https://openalex.org/W2140647923,"Loss-of-function mutations in parkin are the predominant cause of familial Parkinson's disease. We previously reported that parkin-/- mice exhibit nigrostriatal deficits in the absence of nigral degeneration. Parkin has been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Loss of parkin function, therefore, has been hypothesized to cause nigral degeneration via an aberrant accumulation of its substrates. Here we employed a proteomic approach to determine whether loss of parkin function results in alterations in abundance and/or modification of proteins in the ventral midbrain of parkin-/- mice. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry revealed decreased abundance of a number of proteins involved in mitochondrial function or oxidative stress. Consistent with reductions in several subunits of complexes I and IV, functional assays showed reductions in respiratory capacity of striatal mitochondria isolated from parkin-/- mice. Electron microscopic analysis revealed no gross morphological abnormalities in striatal mitochondria of parkin-/- mice. In addition, parkin-/- mice showed a delayed rate of weight gain, suggesting broader metabolic abnormalities. Accompanying these deficits in mitochondrial function, parkin-/- mice also exhibited decreased levels of proteins involved in protection from oxidative stress. Consistent with these findings, parkin-/- mice showed decreased serum antioxidant capacity and increased protein and lipid peroxidation. The combination of proteomic, genetic, and physiological analyses reveal an essential role for parkin in the regulation of mitochondrial function and provide the first direct evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in the absence of nigral degeneration in a genetic mouse model of Parkinson's disease."

The effects of small interfering RNAs on the ligand-induced endocytosis of EGFR were compared with those effects on the constitutive internalization of the transferrin receptor. The knock-downs of clathrin heavy chain and dynamin produced maximal inhibitory effects on the internalization of both receptors. Depletion of α, β2, or μ2 subunits of AP-2 reduced EGF and transferrin internalization rates by 40-60%. Down-regulation of several accessory proteins individually had no effect on endocytosis but caused significant inhibition of EGF and transferrin endocytosis when the homologous proteins were depleted simultaneously. Surprisingly, knockdown of clathrin-assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein, CALM, did not influence transferrin endocytosis but considerably affected EGFR internalization. Thus, CALM is the second protein besides Grb2 that appears to play a specific role in EGFR endocytosis. This study demonstrates that the efficient gene silencing by rationally designed small interfering RNA can be used as an approach to functionally analyze the entire cellular machineries, such as the clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.

This study demonstrates that the efficient gene silencing by rationally designed small interfering RNA can be used as an approach to functionally analyze the entire cellular machineries, such as the clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. Clathrin-coated vesicles mediate endocytosis of many receptors, channels, transporters, and other transmembrane proteins as well as various soluble macromolecules and viruses. The main components of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles are clathrin triskelions, consisting of three heavy and three light chains (1Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 2Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The assembly of triskelions into a cage-like lattice on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane results in the formation of a coated pit. The major proteins that drive coated pit formation are thought to be the adaptor protein complex AP-2 (3Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, it was recently suggested that CALM or its neuronal homolog AP180 is sufficient for clathrin lattice assembly on a lipid monolayer (4Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). AP-2 is a heterotetramer composed of 100-kDa α and β2-adaptins and 50-kDa μ2 and 17-kDa σ2 subunits. CALM and AP180 are monomeric proteins. Clathrin lattice serves as an organizing scaffold for the proteins that carry out cargo sorting, membrane invagination, vesicle scission, and uncoating. These accessory molecules include adaptor/scaffold proteins and enzymes, such as dynamin GTPase, kinases, and phosphatases (5Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The sequence of events during coated vesicle formation is understood at the morphological level. However, the molecular mechanisms of the individual steps of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) 1The abbreviations used are: CME, clathrin-mediated endocytosis; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EGF-Rh, EGF conjugated to rhodamine; Tnf, transferrin; TnfR, Tnf receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. remain to be elucidated. The endocytosis of the EGF receptor (EGFR) has been one of the most popular experimental systems to study the mechanisms of CME (6Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Over the years a number of models have been proposed and numerous proteins have been implicated. However, these models are difficult to reconcile with each other, and the views on the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis remain controversial. One source of the discrepancies is that the important feature of EGFR endocytosis, the saturability of the specific internalization pathway, is often overlooked (7Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many types of cells, occupancy of the large number of EGFRs leads to their internalization through the slow clathrin-independent pathway because the rapid clathrin-dependent pathway becomes saturated (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jiang X. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, to comparatively analyze CME of the EGFR under different experimental conditions, low EGF concentrations and cell lines expressing moderate receptor levels must be used. Recent progress in application of RNA interference (RNAi) methods in mammalian cells led to important advances in elucidation of the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis. We first used RNAi to demonstrate an essential role of Grb2 in the CME of EGFR (10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). More recently, two groups performed analysis of EGFR endocytosis in cells depleted of clathrin and AP-2 by RNAi (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 12Hinrichsen L. Harborth J. Andrees L. Weber K. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45160-45170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both studies reported no effect of AP-2 depletion on EGFR internalization despite the dramatic reduction in the number of coated pits, while they observed contrasting effects of the clathrin knock-down on EGFR endocytosis. These studies raised the question whether EGFR utilize coated pits for internalization and proposed that, even if they do utilize coated pits, these receptors are internalized through coated pits not containing AP-2. To assess the importance of clathrin, AP-2, and other endocytic proteins for EGFR endocytosis, we used novel algorithm to generate functional siRNAs to efficiently suppress the expression of these proteins. This large scale RNAi analysis revealed that clathrin, dynamin, AP-2, Eps15/15R, and Rab5 have general roles in the CME, whereas CALM, similarly to Grb2, is required specifically for EGFR internalization. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies to clathrin heavy chain (TD.1) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); EEA.1, Rab5a, and PP1 were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Los Angeles, CA); Tsg101 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); α-actinin was from Chemicon, Inc.; and GFP was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to dynamin II was from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO); rabbit polyclonal antibodies Ab32 specific to β-adaptins and Ab20 to CALM were described previously (13Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Tebar F. Bohlander S. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to clathrin light chains A and B were kindly provided by Dr. F. Brodsky (University of California at San Francisco), epsin 1 by Dr. L. Traub (University of Pittsburgh), and Eps15 Ab577 and Eps15R Ab860 by Dr. P. P. Di Fiore (European Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy). siRNA Design and Synthesis—siRNAs were selected using an advanced version of the rational design algorithm that ensures siRNA had less than 16 bp of consecutive homology to untargeted molecules. For each gene, four siRNA duplexes with the highest scores (SMARTscores) were selected, and a BLAST search was conducted (Human EST data base) to eliminate potential for off-target effects. Only those sequences with more than three mismatches against unrelated genes were selected (15Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). All duplexes were synthesized in-house as 21-mers with UU overhands using a modified method of 2′-acid labile orthoester chemistry (16Scaringe S.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 3-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the anti-sense strand was chemically phosphorylated to ensure maximized activity (17Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Urlaub H. Luhrmann R. Tuschl T. Cell. 2002; 110: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Grb2 siRNA was described in Ref. 10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar. Sequences are presented in the “Supplemental Materials.” μ2 siRNA was provided by Dr. M. Marsh (University College, London). siRNA to α-adaptin was synthesized as described previously (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Cells and Transfections—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. siRNA duplexes were resuspended in 1× siRNA Universal buffer (Dharmacon, Inc.) to 20 μm prior to transfection. HeLa cells in 12-well plates (50-60% confluent; 1 ml of DMEM/fetal bovine serum per well) were transfected twice with 4 μl of 20 μm siRNA duplex and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 100 μl Opti-MEM medium according to manufacture's recommendations at 24-h intervals. For transfections, in which two or three siRNA duplexes were included, the amount of each duplex was decreased so that the final siRNA concentration remained constant between experiments. Cells were placed into normal culture medium 12 h prior to experiments, which were performed 3 or 4 days after the initial transfection. Transfections of α-adaptin siRNA were performed using Oligofectamin reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed by scraping from the dish by rubber policemen into Triton X-100/glycerol solubilization buffer, and the lysates were electrophoresed as described previously (14Tebar F. Bohlander S. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed with several antibodies followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence system. Several x-ray films were analyzed to determine the linear range of the chemiluminescence signals, and the quantifications were performed using densitometry. In experiments with Eps15R-targeted siRNAs, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Ab860, and Eps15R was detected in immunoprecipitates by Western blot as described above. GFP Fusions—To generate the fusion of YFP with Rab5b or Rab5c (YFP-Rab5b or YFP-Rab5c), a DNA fragment encoding the full-length human Rab5b or Rab5c was obtained by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with a SacI restriction site introduced into the 5′ end and a KpnI site into the 3′ end and cloned into pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). GFP-CALM and YFP-Rab5a constructs were described previously (14Tebar F. Bohlander S. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 18Galperin E. Sorkin A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4799-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Internalization of 125I-EGF and 125I-Transferrin (Tfn)—Mouse receptor-grade EGF (Collaborative Research Inc.) and iron-saturated human Tfn (Sigma) were iodinated as described previously (10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 12-well dishes were incubated with 125I-EGF (1 ng/ml) or 125I-Tfn (1 μg/ml) in binding medium (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C, and the ratio of internalized and surface radioactivity was determined during linear 5-min time course to calculate specific internalization rate constant ke as described previously (10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Mock- or siRNA-transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with 2 ng/ml EGF-rhodamine conjugate (EGF-Rh) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and processed for imaging as described previously (10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A Z-stack of 12 two-dimensional images was acquired for each experimental variant under identical settings through Cy3 filter channel and deconvoluted using SlideBook 4.0 software. Thirteen coated pit and endosomal proteins were chosen to study using siRNA method based on their possible involvement in the CME of EGFR and availability of antibodies. Individual and pools of siRNAs were designed and synthesized using an improved version of the rational design algorithm (19Reynolds A. Leake D. Scaringe S. Marshall W. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 22: 326-330Crossref Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Briefly, the algorithm was developed by performing a statistical analysis of siRNA (and microRNA) and led to the identification of critical sequence and thermodynamic attributes that are common among functional silencing reagents. siRNA duplexes were transfected (individually or in pools) into HeLa cells, and the level of silencing was quantitated by Western blotting at 2, 3, and 4 days after transfection. Fig. 1 shows that the majority of siRNAs and siRNA pools effectively depleted coated pit proteins by 90-95% of levels observed in mock-transfected cells. In most cases, the extent of knock-down was maximal at 3 days after siRNA transfection. Interestingly, CALM was completely eliminated 2 days after transfection. The effectiveness of siRNAs targeted to CALM was confirmed in experiments, in which these siRNAs completely down-regulated GFP-tagged CALM (data not shown). In three instances (β2-adaptin, Eps15, and Eps15R) maximal silencing effects were observed 4 days following transfection. It was difficult to determine the precise extent of Eps15R depletion, because Eps15R is expressed as several splice variants which can be ubiquitylated, thus running as multiple immuno-reactive bands (20Coda L. Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci G. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3003-3012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also illustrates the effective depletion of four endosomal proteins, Rab5a, Rab5b, Rab5c, and EEA.1. For Rab5a, greater than 99% of the protein (and a YFP-tagged version) were eliminated by all four siRNA duplexes. Because antibodies that recognize endogenous Rab5b and Rab5c were not available, YFP-tagged Rab5b and Rab5c were generated and expressed in HeLa cells. The experiments with CALM and Rab5a validated the use of heterologously expressed fusion proteins for testing the efficiency of siRNAs. As was the case with Rab5a, levels of both YFP-Rab5b and YFP-Rab5c were reduced by greater than 99%, as determined using an antibody directed against YFP. Thus in all cases, with the exception of Eps15R, either a single siRNA or an siRNA pool was available that reduced silencing by >90%, and about 50% of all duplexes reduced protein levels by >95%. These results represent a significant improvement over those obtained using conventional design methodologies (22Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). More importantly, the high efficiency of gene knock-down achieved with multiple siRNAs enabled us to utilize biochemical assays to examine the functional consequences of protein down-regulation. One or several siRNAs for each gene were selected to test the functional effects of protein silencing on the internalization rates of two receptors, for Tfn and EGF. Tfn receptor (TfnR) is constitutively endocytosed through clathrin-coated pits. Internalization of EGFR through coated pits is induced by the ligand. Both receptors are endogenously expressed in HeLa cells at moderate levels. The measurements of the uptake rates of 125I-Tfn and 125I-EGF were performed using short time course experiments at 37 °C to avoid contribution of the recycling in the uptake kinetics and using low ligand concentration to avoid saturation of the CME pathway (for EGF). Fig. 2A shows effects of the depletion of each of 13 proteins individually on Tfn and EGF internalization. The largest reduction of internalization rates of both TfnR and EGFR was caused by knock-down of clathrin heavy chain. The residual uptake (20-25%) mainly consists of a clathrin-independent component and a coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis, presumably, due to a small pool of untransfected cells (<5% based on immunofluorescence analysis; data not shown). During preparation of this manuscript, two groups reported contradictory effects of siRNA knock-down of clathrin heavy chain on EGFR internalization (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 12Hinrichsen L. Harborth J. Andrees L. Weber K. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45160-45170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our 125I-EGF internalization data strongly support the essential role of clathrin in EGFR internalization (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The lack of such role reported by Hinrichsen et al. (12Hinrichsen L. Harborth J. Andrees L. Weber K. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45160-45170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) could be explained by an inefficient depletion of clathrin (80%) and/or their internalization assay that favors measurements of the clathrin-independent endocytosis due to the high concentrations of labeled EGF used. To substantiate this view using an independent endocytosis assay, the effect of clathrin heavy chain siRNA on the uptake of EGF-Rh was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. In mock-transfected cells EGF-Rh was efficiently accumulated in endosomes after 5 min of continuous endocytosis (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in cells depleted of clathrin, almost no punctate rhodamine fluorescence was observed, indicative of the effective block of endocytosis (Fig. 2B). The strong inhibitory effect of dynamin II depletion by siRNA on the uptake of 125I-EGF (Fig. 2A) and EGF-Rh (Fig. 2B) supports the data obtained with dominant-negative mutants of dynamin (23Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the view that EGFR is internalized through the pathway of CME. Interestingly, for dynamin II and a number of other genes there appears to be a threshold in the extent of protein down-regulation that must be reached to cause observable functional effects. For instance, incomplete depletion of dynamin II by duplex 1 (∼85% depletion) resulted in a significantly lesser functional consequence (only 30% reduction of internalization rates) than that produced by duplex 2 or a pool of duplexes (∼94% depletion; >70% rate reduction) (data not shown). These data emphasize that high potency of siRNA is essential to reveal the function of targeted molecules and indicates that complete protein elimination is a requirement for the correct accession of the gene function. In contrast to the essential role of clathrin heavy chain, individual (Fig. 2A) or simultaneous down-regulation of clathrin light chains A and B (Fig. 3) did not affect internalization rates. Thus, clathrin light chains do not appear to play an essential role in CME under the conditions of our internalization assays. This observation is consistent with studies using endoribonuclease interfering RNA that revealed no effect of clathrin light chain A depletion on Tfn endocytosis (24Yang D. Buchholz F. Huang Z. Goga A. Chen C.Y. Brodsky F.M. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9942-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, CALM-targeted siRNA had partial but specific inhibitory effect on EGFR endocytosis (Fig. 2A). The endocytic rates were reduced on average by 45% in six independent experiments with two siRNA duplexes. Because CALM depletion did not affect Tfn endocytosis, this protein is apparently not an essential component of the clathrin-associated endocytic apparatus, a finding that is surprising in light of previous observations that overexpression of the CALM clathrin binding domain blocked endocytosis (14Tebar F. Bohlander S. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It is likely that the effect generated by the CALM mutant was the result of interference with other clathrin binding proteins rather than disruption of specific CALM functions. Likewise, the lattice assembly function of CALM/AP180 demonstrated in vitro (4Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) may be accomplished by other proteins in vivo. Our previous siRNA studies (10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) demonstrated Grb2-mediated mechanism of EGFR endocytosis. As shown in Fig. 2C, Grb2 knock-down specifically reduced the rates of EGFR internalization to the extent comparable with that caused by clathrin depletion, suggesting that Grb2 is responsible for most of the EGFR uptake through the CME pathway. Since the simultaneous depletion of Grb2 and CALM by siRNAs did not produce an additive effect (data not shown), it is unlikely that CALM is involved in Grb2-independent endocytosis. It is possible, however, that CALM participates in one of the mechanisms linking EGFR-Grb2 complex to coated pits. The depletion of β2-adaptin reduced the endocytosis rates of EGF and Tfn by 50-60% (Fig. 2A). In addition, partial inhibition of EGFR endocytosis in cells transfected with siRNA targeted to the μ2 subunit of AP-2 was observed (25Fraile-Ramos A. Kohout T.A. Waldhoer M. Marsh M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Thus, our RNAi data are consistent with the general role of AP-2 in CME. This view was, however, challenged by Motley et al. (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) who reported that siRNA knock-down of AP-2 does not affect EGFR internalization and by Conner and Schmid (26Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) who reported normal EGFR internalization rates in cells where AP-2 was sequestered by overexpressed adaptor-associated kinase 1. The most conceivable explanation of the discrepancies between these studies and our results is that different methods to measure internalization rates were used. The latter studies used a technique of cell preincubation with 125I-EGF at 4 °C followed by the chase incubation at 37 °C. Long incubation of cells with EGF at 4 °C allows effective recruitment of ligand-receptor complexes into coated pits (10Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and could be, therefore, sufficient to fully recruit activated EGFR into coated pits remaining in AP-2 depleted cells. In contrast, we measured internalization rates by incubating cells with the labeled ligand directly at 37 °C without a 4 °C preincubation, a condition that is more physiological and that exposes differences in the rates of the initial steps of internalization. To provide additional evidence for the role of AP-2 in EGFR endocytosis, α-adaptin siRNA used by Motley et al. (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) was tested in our internalization assays. Fig. 2D shows that under these conditions the depletion of α-adaptin reduced EGFR endocytosis to the extent comparable with that observed in β2-depleted cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, there was no difference in the internalization rates of EGFR in mock-transfected and siRNA-transfected cells when these rates were measured after 4 °C incubation (Fig. 2D). In summary, our data with siRNAs targeted to AP-2 indicate that there is no significant difference in the AP-2 requirement for CME of EGFR and TfnR. The incomplete inhibition of TfnR endocytosis by AP-2 siRNAs in our experiments may be due to a lower threshold of AP-2 depletion that was necessary for the functional effects as compared with this threshold of clathrin or dynamin depletion sufficient for such effects. Similarly to the experiments with clathrin heavy chain and dynamin II siRNAs, the inhibition of EGFR endocytosis by AP-2 depletion tended to be slightly less pronounced than that of TfnR endocytosis. This can be attributed to the ability of EGFR to be internalized through clathrin-independent pathways. As in the case of clathrin, AP-2, and dynamin, none of siRNAs targeted to several accessory proteins produced EGFR-specific effects. 15-30% reduction of internalization rates of both receptors was observed in cells transfected with Eps15 or Eps15R siRNAs (Fig. 2A). Eps15 and Eps15R have significant sequence homology, identical domain architecture, and similar protein interaction motifs (27Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When both Eps15 and Eps15R were depleted by a combination of two siRNAs, the rates of internalization of 125I-Tfn and 125I-EGF were decreased by 40% (Fig. 3), suggesting that these proteins have important but redundant roles in CME. Overexpression of Eps15 fragments containing binding sites for α appendage domain of AP-2 effectively inhibited endocytosis of TfnR and EGFR (28Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Begue B. Schmid S. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 29Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G. Belleudi F. Mancini P. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Di Fiore P.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5498-5504PubMed Google Scholar). However, a number of other coated pit proteins interact with the same domain of AP-2 (30Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dominant-negative effects of Eps15 mutants did not provide a direct evidence for a specific function of Eps15 in endocytosis, because these effects could be due to interference of the Eps15 mutants with other α appendage interactions. Depletion of all three highly homologous Rab5 isoforms resulted in a 50% reduction of internalization rates of TfnR and EGFR (Fig. 3), whereas siRNAs targeted to Rab5a, Rab5b, and Rab5c did not affect internalization when transfected individually (Fig. 2A). Based on overexpression of mutants of Rab5 mutants, Rab5a isoform was implicated into the specific regulation of EGFR endocytosis (31Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our RNAi experiments showed that Rab5a is redundant, and the elimination of a combination of three Rab5 isoforms is necessary to reveal the role of Rab5s in CME. On the other hand, knock-down of EEA.1 did not affect CME (Fig. 2A). Although Rab5 is highly co-localized and associated with EEA.1 in early endosomes, the function of Rab5 in CME may be mediated by the pools of Rab5 complexed with other effectors. To summarize, this RNAi analysis has provided new insights in the function of the individual components of clathrin-coated pits in EGFR internalization. Further detailed investigation of the consequences of the depletion of endocytic proteins is necessary to elucidate the precise function of these proteins. This study demonstrates that the specific and efficient gene silencing by siRNA can be used as an approach to functionally analyze the entire cellular machineries, such as the clathrin-coated pit.

https://openalex.org/W2105940831,"NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is a homologue of the gp91phox subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. NOX5 is expressed in lymphoid organs and testis and distinguished from the other NADPH oxidases by its unique N terminus, which contains three canonical EF-hands, Ca2+-binding domains. Upon heterologous expression, NOX5 was shown to generate superoxide in response to intracellular Ca2+ elevations. In this study, we have analyzed the mechanism of Ca2+ activation of NOX5. In a cell-free system, Ca2+ elevations triggered superoxide production by NOX5 (Km = 1.06 μm) in an NADPH- and FAD-dependent but cytosol-independent manner. That result indicated a role for the N-terminal EF-hands in NOX5 activation. Therefore, we generated recombinant proteins of NOX5 N terminus and investigated their interactions with Ca2+. Flow dialysis experiments showed that NOX5 N terminus contained four Ca2+-binding sites and allowed us to define the hitherto unidentified fourth, non-canonical EF-hand. The EF-hands of NOX5 formed two pairs: the very N-terminal pair had relatively low affinity for Ca2+, whereas the more C-terminal pair bound Ca2+ with high affinity. Ca2+ binding caused a marked conformation change in the N terminus, which exposed its hydrophobic core, and became able to bind melittin, a model peptide for calmodulin targets. Using a pull-down assay, we demonstrate that the regulatory N terminus and the catalytic C terminus of NOX5 interact in a Ca2+-dependent way. Our results indicate that the Ca2+-induced conformation change of NOX5 N terminus led to enzyme activation through an intra-molecular interaction. That represents a novel mechanism of activation among NAD(P)H oxidases and Ca2+-activated enzymes. NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is a homologue of the gp91phox subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase.

Superoxide and its derivatives are important mediators in a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as bacteria killing (1Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Google Scholar), regulation of blood pressure (2Munzel T. Hink U. Heitzer T. Meinertz T. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Google Scholar), oxygen sensing (5Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Google Scholar), reperfusion brain injury (6Walder C.E. Green S.P. Darbonne W.C.

Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 899-914Google Scholar). NAD(P)H oxidases are professional superoxide-producing enzymes. The best studied among them is the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, which consists of a dimer of transmembrane subunits, gp91phox and p22phox, and four cytosolic subunits, p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and rac2 (1Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, the multi-subunit complex assembles and generates superoxide, a process that is crucial in the elimination of invading bacteria and fungi (8Dinauer M.C. Orkin S.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 117-124Google Scholar). Recently, homologues of the catalytic subunit, gp91phox, have been discovered and identified as either NAD(P)H oxidases (NOX) 1The abbreviations used are: NOX, NADPH oxidase; DUOX, dual domain oxidases; [Ca2+]ic, intracellular free Ca2+ concentration; NOX5-EF, amino acids 1–169 region of NADPH oxidase 5; PEF, penta EF-hand; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); TNS, 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate; ME, melittin; NPAGE, native PAGE; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; N-NOX5-EF, amino acids 1–78 segment of NOX5-EF; C-NOX5-EF, amino acids 79–169 segment of NOX5-EF; Rf, retardation coefficients. or dual domain oxidases (DUOX) (reviewed in Ref. 9Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Google Scholar). They share several features in common with gp91phox: they all possess several transmembrane helices, two of which anchor two heme groups, and they possess a longer intracellular C terminus with NAD(P)H- and FAD-binding sites. When an NAD(P)H oxidase is activated, it transports electrons from intracellular NAD(P)H by means of FAD and its two heme groups to extracellular oxygen, resulting in the formation of superoxide (10Shatwell K.P. Segal A.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1191-1195Google Scholar). Subsequently, a variety of other reactive oxygen species (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, hypochloric acid, peroxynitrate) are generated when superoxide reacts with protons, chloride, and nitric oxide (NO). Five NOX proteins have been found in humans with distinct tissue distribution: NOX1 expressed in colon epithelium (11Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B.

Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Google Scholar). Two DUOX proteins have been identified in mammals: DUOX1 was found mainly in thyroid gland and lung, and DUOX2 was located primarily in thyroid gland and colon. DUOX proteins contain two EF-hand motifs, but Ca2+ regulation of the oxidase/peroxidase activity has not been proven. The biological functions of gp91phox/NOX2 homologues are unknown. Their dependence on other subunits is also to be elucidated, with the exception of NOX1, which was shown to require two other proteins, NOXO1 and NOXA1, to function (18Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Google Scholar, 19Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20006-20012Google Scholar, 20Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Google Scholar). Similarly, second messengers leading to the activation of NOX enzymes are yet to be discovered. NOX5, however, is an exception: it is distinguished from the other NOX proteins by its long, intracellular N terminus, which contains three canonical EF-hands. When heterologously expressed, superoxide production by NOX5 could be induced by ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, indicating that increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]ic) activates NOX5 (17Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Google Scholar). Based on its localization, NOX5 has been suggested to be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of both T- and B-lymphocytes and in the process of sperm-oocyte fusion. Recently, NOX5 expression was found in a prostate cancer cell line, where it was shown to regulate cell growth, thus supporting the idea that it may have such a function in lymphocytes (21Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S. Whorton A.R. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Krenitsky K. Ardie K.G. Lambeth J.D. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C353-C369Google Scholar). NOX5 was described to contain three canonical EF-hands (17Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Google Scholar). This is surprising, because EF-hands usually form antiparallel, symmetrical pairs, and even in the penta-EF-hand (PEF) proteins, the fifth EF-hand is paired to the same one of the second subunit in the homo- or heterodimer (22Jia J. Tarabykina S. Hansen C. Berchtold M. Cygler M. Structure. 2001; 9: 267-275Google Scholar, 23Ilari A. Johnson K.A. Nastopoulos V. Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Colotti G. Tsernoglou D. Chiancone E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 447-458Google Scholar). In several 4-EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins with an activator function (e.g. calmodulin, troponin C, calmodulin-like skin protein, and centrin), the two pairs of EF-hands behave as independent folding units (24Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Google Scholar), but in others, they form a single folding unit (e.g. sarcoplasmic Ca2+-binding protein (25Hermann A. Cox J.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 111: 337-345Google Scholar), several PEF proteins, such as ALG-2 (22Jia J. Tarabykina S. Hansen C. Berchtold M. Cygler M. Structure. 2001; 9: 267-275Google Scholar), grancalcine (26Jia J. Han Q. Borregaard N. Lollike K. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1271-1281Google Scholar) and sorcine (23Ilari A. Johnson K.A. Nastopoulos V. Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Colotti G. Tsernoglou D. Chiancone E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 447-458Google Scholar)). NOX5 possesses an NAD(P)H oxidase domain beside its EF-hands; therefore, it belongs to the multi-domain, or “mosaic” EF-hand-containing proteins. That group is opposed to the “all EF-hand”-containing proteins, which do not possess any catalytic domain, cytoskeleton- or membrane-binding regions attached to their EF-hands (e.g. calmodulin; Ref. 27Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Google Scholar). In most mosaic proteins, the EF-hand-containing domain is an independent folding unit (e.g. in calpain (28Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar), actin-cross-linking protein (29Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Google Scholar), phospholipase C (30Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Google Scholar)). In these proteins, conformational changes upon binding of Ca2+ can be very limited, and the molecular mechanism of enzyme activation is usually poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the conditions and mechanism of NOX5 activation. Results gained with the enzymatic assay in a cell-free system and with methods implying Ca2+-binding, conformational changes, peptide, and protein interactivity of recombinant fragments of NOX5 suggest a novel mechanism of activation among NOX proteins and EF-hand containing enzymes. Plasmid Constructs—All DNA constructs encoding N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of NOX5 were generated from human NOX5β cDNA by PCR using plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase, cloned into pGEX-2T vector, and verified by sequencing. The following primers were used for the PCRs: NOX5-EF forward, 5′-ggatccatgagtgccgaggaggatg-3′, and reverse, 5′-ggatcccgtcagccagtgggcagcg-3′; N-NOX5-EF forward, 5′-ggatccatgagtgccgaggaggatg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gaattctcaggggctgccatggatgagcag-3′; C-NOX5-EF forward, 5′-ggatccatggacaaactcaaattcctc-3′, and reverse, 5′-ggatcccgtcagccagtgggcagcg-3′; NOX5 C terminus forward, 5′-ggatccatggaagtcaacctcctcc-3′, and reverse, 5′-gaattctagaaattctcttggaaaaatc-3′. The E31Q mutant NOX5-EF protein was generated with the following internal, overlapping primers: 5′-gggagatcagcctgcaacaattcaaagcagctctgcatg-3′ and 5′-atgcagagctgctttgaattgttgcaggctgatctcccc-3′. The E31Q mutant of full-length NOX5β was generated with the same internal primers; the external primers were described before (17Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—DNA constructs encoding recombinant NOX5-EF (residues 1–169 plus an 8-residue long cloning stretch GSPGIHRD), recombinant N-NOX5-EF (residues 1–78), recombinant C-NOX5-EF (residues 79–169 plus the GSPGIHRD segment), recombinant E31Q mutant of NOX5-EF, and recombinant C terminus of NOX5 (residues M449 to F565) were transformed into BL-21 bacteria. Protein expression was induced by 3-h incubation with 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C (NOX5-EF and C-NOX5-EF) or 30 °C (E31Q mutant and N-NOX5-EF); glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified as described before (31Molnar G. Dagher M.C. Geiszt M. Settleman J. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial pellet was harvested, lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (for NOX5-EF and C-NOX5-EF: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); for E31Q NOX5-EF and N-NOX5-EF: 0.2× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen), pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, 12,000 × g. The soluble fraction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed successively with lysis buffer, PBS, and thrombin buffer (50 mm, Tris, pH 8.0, NaCl 150 mm, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The recombinant proteins were released from the GST group and the beads with cleavage by thrombin (40 units/ml). Then thrombin was depleted by a 20-min incubation with p-aminobenzamidine-agarose (Sigma) for 20 min at 4 °C, and then by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). As a final step in the purification a Ca2+-dependent chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose (32Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Google Scholar) was added. The C terminus of NOX5 was expressed as a GST-fusion protein and found to form inclusion bodies. The latter were washed repeatedly, dissolved in 8 m urea, and slowly renatured by prolonged dialysis against 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The solution was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as such. Using this procedure, we estimate that 10% of the recombinant NOX5 C terminus could be renatured. The purity of all constructs was verified by PAGE using 15% gels (see Fig. 1S in supplementary material). Separation of Membrane and Cytosolic Fractions—Membrane and cytosolic fractions of NOX5 and control-transfected HEK293 cells were prepared as described for neutrophil granulocytes (33Palicz A. Foubert T.R. Jesaitis A.J. Marodi L. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3090-3097Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in sonication buffer (11% sucrose, 0.2× PBS, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF) and broken by sonication. Sonicates were centrifuged (200 × g, 10 min) and the supernatant was layered onto a 17/40% (w/v) discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged (150,000 × g for 30 min). Cytosolic fractions were collected from the top layer, and membrane fractions were collected from the 17/40% interface (33Palicz A. Foubert T.R. Jesaitis A.J. Marodi L. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3090-3097Google Scholar). Fractions were stored at -70 °C. Protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. NADPH Oxidase Activity Assays—Mixtures containing 0.2× PBS, pH 7.5, 100 μm cytochrome c, 10 μm FAD, 0.3 mm BAPTA, 0.3 mm HEDTA, 0.3 mm NTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 μm phosphatidic acid (1,2 didecanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, Sigma), various Ca2+ concentrations (the free Ca2+ concentration was calculated with WEBMAXC STANDARD software), zero or 400 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 7.5 μg membrane protein were prepared in a final volume of 90 μl/well. Superoxide production was initiated with the addition of 200 μm NADPH and determined by measuring the absorbance of cytochrome c at 550 nm using a Victor 2 (PerkinElmer) microplate reader at 37 °C and correcting for the absorbance of samples containing superoxide dismutase. Activity was linear over the 5-min assay period and was expressed as nmol of O2.¯/min/μg membrane protein using an extinction coefficient of 21,000 m-1 cm-1 for cytochrome c. Km values were determined in Origin version 5.0 software by fitting sigmoid curves to data points. The protocol described above was modified according to Ref. 34Qualliotine-Mann D. Agwu D.E. Ellenburg M.D. McCall C.E. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23843-23849Google Scholar when the effect of human granulocyte cytosol containing p67phox, p47phox, and Rac2 was investigated. When melittin was included in the measurements, the following modifications were made: the amount of membrane proteins used in a single well was reduced to 3 μg/90 μl. ∼10 nm, 10.3 μm, or 34 μm free [Ca2+] were applied, and membrane fractions were pre-incubated with the assay solution in the presence or absence of various concentrations of melittin and in the presence or absence of 1 μm calmodulin for 20 min at 37 °C before the addition of 200 μm NADPH. When the reversibility of the effect of melittin was investigated, membrane samples, incubated with or without melittin in presence of low [Ca2+] (∼10 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C, were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the pellets were resuspended in the assay solution and measured after the addition of 200 μm NADPH. Metal Ion Removal and Protein Concentration—The protein samples were dialyzed extensively against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, containing 1 mm EGTA) and put on a 0.8 × 40 cm Sephadex G-25 (for NOX5-EF) or P10 column (for C-NOX5-EF and N-NOX5-EF) equilibrated in buffer A. The protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients at 278 nm of 18,100, 11,000, and 7100 m-1 cm-1 for NOX5-EF (and E31Q mutant), N-NOX5-EF, and C-NOX5-EF, respectively. The latter coefficients were calculated as described (35Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Google Scholar) on the basis of the numbers of Trp, Tyr, and Cys residues in the sequence. Ca2+ and Mg2+ Binding—Ca2+ binding was measured at 25 °C by the flow dialysis method (36Colowick S.P. Womack F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 774-777Google Scholar) in buffer A. Protein concentrations were 20–30 μm. Treatment of the raw data and evaluation of the intrinsic metal-binding constants were as described (37Cox J.A. Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1-12Google Scholar). For NOX5-EF the data were analyzed with the equation of Adair for four binding sites: v=(K1[Ca2+]+2K1K2[Ca2+]2+3K1K2K3[Ca2+]3+4K1K2K3K4[Ca2+]4)/(1+K1[Ca2+]+K1K2[Ca2+]2+K1K2K3[Ca2+]3+K1K2K3K4[Ca2+]4)(Eq. 1) where K1, K2, etc. are the stoichiometric association constants for the binding of the first and second Ca2+ to the protein. The intrinsic association constants, systematically used in this study to present the data, are linked to stoichiometric ones by the statistical factors 4, 3/2, 2/3, and 1/4 (37Cox J.A. Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1-12Google Scholar). We used the Adair equation of three binding sites for the E31Q mutant and the equation of two binding sites for N-NOX5-EF and C-NOX5-EF, with the statistical relationships as explained in (37Cox J.A. Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1-12Google Scholar). Conformation Change in NOX5-EF Measured by Trp Fluorescence— Emission fluorescence spectra were taken with a PerkinElmer LS-5B spectrofluorimeter on the metal-free form of NOX5-EF, N-NOX5-EF, and C-NOX5-EF (1 μm) in buffer A at 25 °C with excitation at 278 nm and slits of 5 nm. 20 μm EGTA, or 2 mm Mg2+ or Ca2+, or 4 m guanidine-HCl were added to monitor the effect of the respective ions or to obtain the spectrum of the denatured protein. The Ca2+ dependence of the Tyr fluorescence change was titrated on metal-free protein in buffer A in the presence of 5 μm EGTA. The free [Ca2+] was calculated with WEBMAXC STANDARD software using the Ca2+-binding constants for NOX5-EF reported in this study. Thiol Reactivity—The thiol reactivity of NOX5-EF and C-NOX5-EF was assayed on protein samples which had been previously reduced by overnight incubation with 100 mm dithiothreitol at pH 8.5 and passed over a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in de-gassed and nitrogen-saturated buffer A. The kinetics of the thiol reactivity was initiated by mixing 12.5 μm protein solution with 250 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and the absorbance was monitored at 412 nm (38Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Google Scholar). TNS-monitored Hydrophobic Exposure—Changes in the fluorescence properties of TNS were monitored by fluorometry. After incubation of 2 μm apo-form of NOX5-EF, N-NOX5-EF, and C-NOX5-EF in buffer A containing either 20 μm EGTA, 2 mm Ca2+, or 2 mm Mg2+ with 40 μm TNS for 5 min, the solutions were excited at 328 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C with 5-nm slits. The Ca2+ titrations were carried out on 2 μm metal-free protein in buffer A in the absence or presence of 2 mm Mg2+. Because of contaminating Ca2+ in the TNS solution, EDTA up to 5 μm was added. Free [Ca2+] was calculated with WEBMAXC STANDARD version 2.10. Interaction of NOX5-EF with Melittin—The binding of the model peptide melittin (ME) was monitored with native PAGE (NPAGE), as reported previously (39Durussel I. Blouquit Y. Middendorp S. Craescu C.T. Cox J.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 208-212Google Scholar), and by covalent cross-linking experiments (40Durussel I. Luan-Rilliet Y. Petrova T. Takagi T. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2394-2400Google Scholar). In the latter, proteins (10 μm) in 3 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing either 1 mm Ca2+ or EGTA were incubated for 1 h with 100 μm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) and stopped with 1 mm ethanolamine. Then samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 15% acrylamide gels. Ca2+-dependent Binding of NOX5-EF to NOX5 C Terminus—-The Ca2+-dependent interaction between NOX5-EF and NOX5 C terminus was investigated by using pull-down assay and Western blot technique. The following buffer was used for the pull-down assay: 3 mm BAPTA, 3 mm HEDTA, 3 mm NTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 × PBS, ∼10 nm or 35 μm free [Ca2+]. 1 mg glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with or without 40 μg GST-NOX5 C terminus fusion protein for 10 min at 37 °C in 250 μl of assay solution. 12.7 μg NOX5-EF was incubated, separately, with or without 2.7 μm melittin in low (∼10 nm) or high [Ca2+] (35 μm) assay solution (450 μl) for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, the two samples were mixed to reach a 750-μl final volume and 0.9 μm concentration for NOX5-EF, NOX5 C terminus, and melittin, and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. After centrifugation of the beads (at room temperature for 4 min at 2,000 × g), the supernatant was taken away and the beads were washed twice with low or high [Ca2+] solution containing or devoid of 0.9 μm melittin. Finally, sample loading buffer was added to the beads, and they were boiled for 10 min before loading on 15% polyacrylamide gel. After PAGE, transfer, and blocking, the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-NOX5-EF antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing the membranes and after an additional blocking step, anti-rabbit HRP-labeled antibody was used to detect the amount of pulled-down proteins using ECL solution. Generation of Anti-NOX5-EF Antibody—400 μg of recombinant NOX5-EF protein was injected into rabbits subcutaneously using Titer-Max adjuvant. The injection was repeated in every month for 4 times, and sera were taken from the rabbits after each injection. Immunore-active aliquots were pooled and affinity purified on NOX5-EF. Construction of a Cell-free System to Investigate NOX5 Activity—To gain access to the cytoplasmic domains of NOX5, which contain the regulatory elements of the transmembrane protein, we established a cell-free system. Membrane preparations from control- and NOX5-transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with low (∼10 nm) and high (34 μm) free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]) in the presence of FAD, cytosolic fraction of HEK293 cells, 1 mm Mg2+, and low concentration of lipid (5.5 μm phosphatidic acid). Superoxide production was initiated by addition of NADPH, and it was measured with the ferricytochrome c reduction assay. As shown on Fig. 1A, membranes prepared from control transfected cell did not produce any superoxide independently of [Ca2+]. However, the NOX5 containing membranes generated readily detectable amounts of superoxide, but only in presence of high [Ca2+] (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that a minimal concentration of Mg2+ was required for the enzymatic activity, but no significant change was observed in the higher, 200 μm to 1.5 mm [Mg2+] range (not shown). gp91phox, the best characterized homologue of NOX5, requires cytosolic proteins for its activation. To investigate whether NOX5 also requires cytosolic proteins for function, we measured superoxide production of NOX5 in the presence and absence of cytosolic fraction prepared from HEK293 cells. The activity of NOX5 was not reduced in the absence of cytosol; in fact, it increased somewhat (Fig. 2B). Cytosol of human neutrophil granulocytes containing p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 did not influence the enzymatic activity either (not shown). Therefore, we conclude that proteins residing in the cytosolic fraction are not prerequisites for the activation of NOX5, as opposed to gp91phox/NOX2. The Co-factor Dependence of NOX5—The C terminus of NOX5 contains predicted NAD(P)H- and FAD-binding sites. Although NAD(P)H is the source of electrons, FAD is required for their transfer to the heme groups. Accordingly, the omission of either NADPH or FAD abolished superoxide production of NOX5 (Fig. 1C). Based on the amino acid sequence, it is not predictable whether NADH could substitute NADPH as the electron donor, and thus NOX5 might also work as an NADH oxidase. As shown on Fig. 1C, NADH (200 μm) could not replace NADPH and support superoxide production. Next, we tested whether an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium could abolish the activity of NOX5 in the cell-free system. Addition of 1 μm diphenylene iodonium completely blocked superoxide production, thus confirming that it was due to NAD(P)H oxidase activity. Ca2+-dependence of Superoxide Production by NOX5—The cell-free system provides direct access to the EF-hand-containing intracellular N terminus of NOX5. Therefore, it is possible to accurately define the range of [Ca2+], in which the activation of NOX5 takes place. We used a mixture of three Ca2+ buffers (BAPTA, HEDTA, and NTA) to control free [Ca2+] adequately in a wide range; and ferricytochrome c was purified from contaminating Ca2+ by gel filtration. As shown on Fig. 2, NOX5 activation was initiated around 300 nm free [Ca2+] and became complete at ∼7 μm free [Ca2+]. The [Ca2+] corresponding to half-maximal superoxide production (Km) was 1.06 μm. The sigmoidal curve of NOX5 activation by Ca2+ was rather steep, reflecting positive co-operativity. Ca2+ Binding by the N Terminus of NOX5—To determine the Ca2+ binding properties of NOX5, its N terminus (NOX5-EF) was generated as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Its Ca2+-binding properties were determined with flow dialysis experiments, which showed that NOX5-EF binds not three but four Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). Therefore, NOX5 is likely to contain a fourth EF-hand in addition to the three canonical ones. The EF-hands bound Ca2+ with pronounced negative cooperativity (nH = 0.62) and with a [Ca2+]0.5 of 8.9 μm. Using t"

In particular, the Dutch E22Q and Iowa D23N mutations in Aβ cause familial cerebrovascular amyloidosis with abundant diffuse amyloid plaque deposits. Both of these charge-altering mutations enhance the fibrillogenic and pathogenic properties of Aβ in vitro. Here, we describe the generation of several transgenic mouse lines (Tg-SwDI) expressing human neuronal Aβ precursor protein (AβPP) harboring the Swedish K670N/M671L and vasculotropic Dutch/Iowa E693Q/D694N mutations under the control of the mouse Thy1.2 promoter. Tg-SwDI mice expressed transgenic human AβPP only in the brain, but at levels below those of endogenous mouse AβPP. Despite the paucity of human AβPP expression, quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements revealed that Tg-SwDI mice developed early-onset and robust accumulation of Aβ in the brain with high association with isolated cerebral microvessels. Tg-SwDI mice exhibited striking perivascular/vascular Aβ deposits that markedly increased with age. The vascular Aβ accumulations were fibrillar, exhibiting strong thioflavin S staining, and occasionally presented signs of microhemorrhage. In addition, numerous largely diffuse, plaque-like structures were observed starting at 3 months of age. In vivo transport studies demonstrated that Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ was more readily retained in the brain compared with wild-type Aβ. These results with Tg-SwDI mice demonstrate that overexpression of human AβPP is not required for early-onset and robust accumulation of both vascular and parenchymal Aβ in mouse brain.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar, 2Vinters H.V. Farag E.S. Adv. Neurol. 2003; 92: 105-112PubMed Google Scholar). The Aβ peptide is derived from the Aβ precursor protein (AβPP), a type I integral membrane protein, through sequential proteolytic processing mediated by β- and γ-secretase activities (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar, 3Selkoe D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Several mutations that are linked to familial forms of early-onset Alzheimer's disease have been identified in the AβPP gene. These mutations tend to cluster around the β- and γ-secretase cleavage sites within AβPP and lead to increased production of total Aβ or a preferential increase in the levels of the longer, more pathogenic Aβ42 peptide (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar, 3Selkoe D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Citron M. Oltersdorf T.

On the other hand, several mutations in the AβPP gene that reside within residues 21–23 of Aβ and that give rise to familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) have been found. The first recognized of these was the Dutch E22Q mutation, which is associated with diffuse Aβ deposition in the neuropil and severe CAA, leading to recurrent and often fatal hemorrhagic episodes at mid-life (5Levy E. Carman M.D. Fernandez-Madrid I.J. Power M.D. Lieberburg I. van Duinen S.G. Bots G.T.A.M. Luyendijk W. Frangione B.

Psychiatry. 1995; 59: 699-705Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More recently, the Iowa D23N mutation in Aβ was identified in a cohort presenting with late-onset dementia accompanied by severe CAA with numerous small cortical hemorrhages, cortical and subcortical infarcts, and neurofibrillary tangles (8Grabowski T.J.

The reason as to why mutations in this region within Aβ lead preferentially to a strong accumulation of cerebrovascular amyloid remains unclear.It is noteworthy that both the Dutch E22Q and Iowa D23N mutations result in loss of a negative charge in the Aβ peptide. In previous studies, we (9Davis J. Van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Cho H.S. Greenberg S.M. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and others (10Miravalle L. Tokuda T. Chiarle R. Giaccone G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Frangione B. Ghiso J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27110-27116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed, that compared with wild-type Aβ, the Dutch E22Q and Iowa D23N mutant Aβ peptides exhibit enhanced fibrillogenic and pathogenic properties in cultured cerebrovascular cells used as in vitro models for CAA. Moreover, an experimental Aβ peptide containing the Dutch and Iowa mutations together (E22Q/D23N) possesses even more robust fibrillogenic and pathogenic properties in vitro compared with either single mutation alone (11Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Cho H.S. Greenberg S.M. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These combined findings suggest that the loss of negative charges and gain of pathogenicity in Aβ associated with the Dutch and Iowa mutations may directly correlate with the accumulation of Aβ in the brain, particularly around the cerebral vasculature.To further investigate this in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing human Swedish, Dutch, and Iowa triple-mutant AβPP (Tg-SwDI) in brain that produce Dutch/Iowa E22Q/D23N double-mutant Aβ. Although these transgenic mice were found to express human AβPP at levels below those of endogenous mouse AβPP, three independent Tg-SwDI mouse lines developed strikingly similar early-onset and robust accumulation of Aβ in the brain with high association with the cerebral microvasculature. Importantly, these results demonstrate that overexpression of human AβPP is not necessary for the development of Aβ pathology in mouse brain. Furthermore, functional studies revealed, that compared with wild-type Aβ, Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ was poorly cleared from mouse brain into the circulation. These findings suggest that the observed clearance deficit of Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ likely contributes to its strong accumulation in and around cerebral blood vessels and in the parenchyma of the Tg-SwDI mice and possibly in patients with either the Dutch or Iowa familial CAA mutations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVector Construction and Generation of Transgenic Mouse Lines—A pcDNA3 vector containing 2.1 kb of human AβPP (isoform 770) cDNA was used to introduce mutations Swedish K670N/M671L, Dutch E693Q, and Iowa D694N using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The AβPP770-SwDI cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers containing the NheI 5′-linker and SacII 3′-linker. The PCR product was digested and subcloned between exons II and IV of a Thy1.2 expression cassette (a gift from Dr. F. LaFerla, University of California, Irvine, CA) using NheI and SacII restriction sites. The completed construct was entirely sequenced to confirm its integrity. The 9-kb transgene was liberated by NotI/PvuI digestion, purified, and microinjected into pronuclei of C57Bl/6 single cell embryos at the Stony Brook Transgenic Mouse Facility. Three founder transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA. Transgenic offspring from each line were determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA using the following primers specific for human AβPP: 5′-CCTGATTGATACCAAGGAAGGCATCCTG-3′ and 5′-GTCATCATCGGCTTCTTCTTCTTCCACC-3′ (generating a 500-bp product). All subsequent analyses were performed with heterozygous transgenic mice.Immunoblot Quantitation of AβPP—Mouse forebrain, distinct mouse brain regions, or various peripheral tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The tissue homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations of the resulting supernatants were determined using the BCA protein assay Kit (Pierce). The levels of AβPP in the tissue homogenate samples were determined by performing quantitative immunoblotting as described (11Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Cho H.S. Greenberg S.M. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35 μg of total protein from each sample were electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Unoccupied sites on the membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were probed either with monoclonal antibody P2-1, which is specific for human AβPP (12Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Geddes J.W. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), or with monoclonal antibody 22C11 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), which is specific for mouse and human AβPP, and then incubated with a secondary peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The peroxidase activity on the membranes was detected using Super-signal Dura West (Pierce). Bands corresponding to AβPP were measured using a VersaDoc 3000 imaging system (Bio-Rad) with the manufacturer's Quantity One software and compared with standard curves generated from known quantities of purified AβPP.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Quantitation of Aβ Peptides—Soluble pools of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were determined by specific ELISAs of carbonate-extracted mouse forebrain tissue; and subsequently, the insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were determined by ELISA of guanidine lysates of the insoluble pellets resulting from the carbonate-extracted brain tissue (13DeMattos R.B. O'Dell M.A. Parsadanian M. Taylor J.W. Harmony J.A.K. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. Aronow B.J. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99 (J. A.

Mackic J.B. Wang L. McComb J.G. McDonough A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total vascular Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured in guanidine lysates of the brain microvessels isolated from Tg-SwDI mice. In the sandwich ELISAs, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were captured using their respective carboxyl terminus-specific antibodies m2G3 and m21F12, and biotinylated antibody m3D6, specific for human Aβ, was used for detection (13DeMattos R.B. O'Dell M.A. Parsadanian M. Taylor J.W. Harmony J.A.K. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. Aronow B.J. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99 (J. A. K.): 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because antibody m3D6 recognizes an epitope in the first five amino acids of Aβ, this ensured that the sandwich ELISA was measuring amino-terminally intact Aβ peptides.Immunohistochemical Analysis—Mice were killed at specific ages, and the brains were removed and, in most cases, bisected in the mid-sagittal plane. One hemisphere was snap-frozen and used for the protein analyses described above. The other hemisphere was placed in 70% ethanol overnight and subjected to increasing sequential dehydration in ethanol, followed by xylene treatment and embedding in paraffin. Sections were cut from mouse brain hemispheres in the sagittal plane at 5 μm using a microtome, placed in a flotation water bath at 45 °C, and then picked on glass slides. Paraffin was removed from the sections by washing with xylene, and the tissue sections were rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by treating the tissue sections with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min at 22 °C. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized either with a stable diaminobenzidine solution (Invitrogen) or with the fast red substrate system (Spring Bioscience, Fremont, CA), respectively, as substrate. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Thioflavin S staining for fibrillar amyloid was performed as described (16Dickson D.W. Wertkin A. Mattiace L.A. Fier E. Kress Y. Davies P. Yen S.H. Acta Neuropathol. 1990; 79: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Prussian blue iron staining was performed to detect hemosiderin to reveal signs of previous microhemorrhage as described (17Gomori G. Am. J.

Med. 2003; 9: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to collagen type IV (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ). The percent of Aβ-associated blood vessels in the frontotemporal cortex, thalamic, and subiculum regions was determined in four mice at each of the specified ages using stereological principles as described (19Deane R. Yan S. Submamaryan R.K. LaRue B. Jovanovic S. Hogg E. Welch D. Manness L. Lin C. Yu J. Zhu H. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Stern A. Schmidt A.M. Armstrong D.L. Arnold B. Liliensiek B. Nawroth P. Hofman F. Kindy M. Stern D. Zlokovic B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar).Radioiodination of Synthetic Aβ Peptides—Radioiodination was carried out using the lactoperoxidase method (20Thorell J.I. Johansson B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). After radiolabeling, the preparations were subjected to HPLC to separate the monoiodinated non-oxidized forms of Aβ (which is the tracer we used) from di-iodinated Aβ, unlabeled non-oxidized Aβ, and oxidized Aβ species. The content of material in the peaks eluted by HPLC was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to ensure the purity of the radiolabeled species. These analyses confirmed that oxidized species of 125I-labeled wild-type Aβ40 and Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ40 were not present in the preparations. At specific activities between 55 and 85 μCi/μg, the radiolabeled peptides were stabilized using ethanol as a quenching system and kept for up to 96 h. Prior to infusion into animals, we performed HPLC purification of the tracer to ensure use of monomeric Aβ species.Brain Clearance Model—Central nervous system clearance of 125I-labeled wild-type Aβ40 or Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ40 was determined simultaneously with [14C]inulin (a metabolically inert reference marker) in male C57Bl/6 wild-type mice (8–10 weeks old) as described (15Zlokovic B.V. Mackic J.B. Wang L. McComb J.G. McDonough A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A stainless steel guide cannula was implanted stereotaxically into the right caudate putamen of anesthetized mice (60 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital administered intraperitoneally), and 0.5 μl of tracer fluid containing 125I-labeled wild-type Aβ40 or Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ40 (1–120 nm) were injected over 5 min along with [14C]inulin using the Ultra Micropump (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Radioactivity analysis was performed within 30 min.Tissue Sampling and Radioactivity Analysis—Brains were sampled and prepared for radioactivity analysis. Degradation of 125I-labeled Aβ40 peptides was initially studied by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Previous studies with 125I-labeled Aβ40 demonstrated an excellent correlation between the trichloroacetic acid and HPLC methods (15Zlokovic B.V. Mackic J.B. Wang L. McComb J.G. McDonough A. J. Biol.

Brain samples were mixed with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8–10 min at 4 °C, and the radioactivity in the precipitate, water, and chloroform fractions was determined in a γ-counter. The integrity of 125I-labeled wild-type Aβ or Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ injected into the brain was ≥99% as determined by trichloroacetic acid analysis. Degradation of 125I-labeled Aβ peptides in the brain was further studied by HPLC and SDS-PAGE analyses. Following intracerebral injections of 125I-labeled Aβ, brain tissue was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing proteinase inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then lyophilized. The resulting material was dissolved in 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.0) in water before injection onto a Vydac C4 column (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). Separation was achieved with a 30-min linear gradient of 25–83% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described (15Zlokovic B.V. Mackic J.B. Wang L. McComb J.G. McDonough A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the Aβ standards eluted between 29.1 and 31.2 min for the wild-type Aβ40 and Dutch/Iowa mutant Aβ40 peptides. The eluted fractions were collected and counted. The integrity of 125I-labeled Aβ peptides injected into the brain was >98% as determined by HPLC analysis, confirming the results of trichloroacetic acid analysis. For SDS-PAGE analysis, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were resuspended in 1% SDS, vortexed, incubated at 55 °C for 5 min, neutralized, boiled for 3 min, homogenized, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% Tris/Tricine gels, followed by fluorography. Lyophilized HPLC fractions were resuspended in sample buffer, neutralized, boiled, and electrophoresed as we reported previously (15Zlokovic B.V. Mackic J.B. Wang L. McComb J.G. McDonough A. J. Biol.

In all calculations, the dpm values for [14C]inulin and the cpm values for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 125I radioactivity reflecting the intact peptide were used. Inulin was studied as a reference marker that is neither transported across the blood-brain barrier nor retained by the brain and therefore reflects the rate of transport via passive diffusion of the interstitial fluid (interstitial fluid) bulk flow (15Zlokovic B.V.

In the case of Aβ, there are two possible physiological pathways of elimination: direct transport across the blood-brain barrier into the bloodstream and elimination via interstitial fluid bulk flow into the cerebrospinal fluid and cervical lymphatics (15Zlokovic B.V.

To assess the effects of these CAA-associated Aβ mutations in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing the human AβPP770 isoform harboring the Swedish, Dutch, and Iowa mutations in neurons of the central nervous system under the control of the mouse Thy1.2 promoter (Fig. 1). The Swedish K670N/M671L mutation was included in the AβPP transgene to enhance β-secretase processing and production of Aβ (4Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P.

The adjacent Dutch E693Q and Iowa D694N mutations were included in the human AβPP transgene since we previously showed that the presence of both these mutations in Aβ markedly enhances the in vitro cerebrovascular pathogenic properties of Aβ compared with either single mutation (11Van Nostrand W.E.

The transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of the AβPP770-SwDI construct into oocytes in a pure C57Bl/6 background. The presence of the transgene was confirmed by PCR analysis. All mice used in the subsequent characterization studies were heterozygous for the human AβPP transgene.AβPP Expression and Aβ Production in Tg-SwDI/B Mice— The first transgenic mouse line generated (designated Tg-SwDI/B) showed expression of human AβPP in the brain (Fig. 2A). Although human AβPP expression was observed in the cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem, much lower levels were observed in the cerebellum, with no detectable expression in other non-neural tissues (Fig. 2B). However, analysis using a monoclonal antibody that detects both endogenous mouse AβPP and transgenic human AβPP unexpectedly revealed that expression of transgenic human AβPP was modest, and it was estimated by quantitative image analysis to be only at <50% the level of endogenous mouse AβPP (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the low level expression of transgenic human AβPP, young Tg-SwDI/B mice (≈2 months old) exhibited very low levels of total Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the brain, with the predominant species being the shorter Aβ40 peptide (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Analysis of transgenic human AβPP expression and Aβ levels in Tg-SwDI/B mice. Quantitative immunoblotting was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, immunoblot analysis of human AβPP expression in total brain homogenates from Tg-SwDI/B (lane 1) and wild-type (lane 2) mice.

D, the levels of total Aβ40 (lane 1) and total Aβ42 (lane 2) determined in 2-month-old Tg-SwDI/B mouse forebrains by ELISA measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented are the means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements in three mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Over the course of 1 year, the expression of transgenic human AβPP protein remained consistently low and was estimated to be ≈33 ± 4 ng/mg of total brain protein based on comparative quantitative immunoblot measurements against known concentrations of purified human AβPP (Fig. 3A). Despite the continuous paucity of transgenic human AβPP expression, quantitative ELISA analysis revealed a progressive and robust accumulation of insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the Tg-SwDI/B mice (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). The increase in insoluble Aβ peptides first appeared at 3 months and markedly increased by 12 months. The levels of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 increased several-fold through 12 months (Fig. 3, D and E, respectively), but composed a minor fraction compared with the amount of accumulating insoluble Aβ peptides (Fig. 3, B and C). In each case of insoluble and soluble Aβ peptides, the Aβ40 levels were ≈10-fold higher than the Aβ42 levels. The antibodies used to detect Aβ in Tg-SwDI/B mice were human-specific, i.e. did not recognize mouse Aβ, and were directed to the first five amino acids of Aβ, indicating that they possess an intact amino terminus (13DeMattos R.B.

In humans, plasma levels correlate with total body fat, and high concentrations occur in obese women. Among its functions, leptin is able to stimulate normal and tumor cell growth. We demonstrated that leptin induces aromatase activity in MCF-7 cells evidencing its important role in enhancing in situ estradiol production and promoting estrogen-dependent breast cancer progression. Estrogen receptor α (ERα), which plays an essential role in breast cancer development, can be transcriptionally activated in a ligand-independent manner. Taking into account that unliganded ERα is an effector of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal and that leptin is able, via Janus kinase, to activate the Ras-dependent MAPK pathway, in the present study we investigate the ability of leptin to transactivate ERα. We provided evidence that leptin is able to reproduce the classic features of ERα transactivation in a breast cancer cell line: nuclear localization, down-regulation of its mRNA and protein levels, and up-regulation of a classic estrogen-dependent gene such as pS2. Transactivation experiments with a transfected reporter gene for nuclear ER showed an activation of ERα either in MCF-7 or in HeLa cells. Using a dominant negative ERK2 or the MAPK inhibitor PD 98059, we showed that leptin activates the ERα through the MAPK pathway. The N-terminal transcriptional activation function 1 appears essential for the leptin response. Finally, it is worth noting that leptin exposure potentates also the estradiol-induced activation of ERα. Thus, we are able to demonstrate that the amplification of estrogen signal induced by leptin occurs through an enhancing in situ E2 production as well as a direct functional activation of ERα.

Although leptin is mainly synthesized by breast adipose tissue, its expression has also been detected in normal and tumoral human mammary epithelial cells (12O'Brien S.N. Welter B.H. Price T.M.

In addition, it has been shown that leptin receptors (short and long isoforms) are expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells (14Laud K. Gourdou I. Belair L. Keisler D.H. Djiane J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as in human breast cancer cell lines (11Dieudonne M.N. Machinal-Quelin F. Serazin-Leroy V. Leneveu M.C. Pecquery R.

These data suggest an important role of leptin on mammary gland development and tumorigenesis, giving more emphasis to the epidemiological studies that evidence a relationship between obesity and breast carcinogenesis. Obesity is an important health concern, because it is associated with a variety of metabolic disorders and an increased risk of developing cancer (16Bray G.A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3451S-3455SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well established that post-menopausal women with upper body fat predominance experience a higher risk of breast cancer (17Stoll B.A. Breast. Cancer Res.

The association between obesity and breast carcinoma is usually ascribed to estrogen excess, derived from androgen aromatization in peripheral fat deposits (19Chen S. Front.

In addition, a potential relationship between leptin and estrogens stems also from the evidence that estrogens appear to modulate leptin gene expression in adipose tissue (22Shimuzu H. Shimomura Y.

Although estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors are usually more responsive to therapy than estrogen receptor-negative tumors, there is a report demonstrating that estrogen receptor-positive breast tumor status in obese women is actually associated with a poorer prognosis than estrogen receptor-negative status (24Maehle B. Tretli S. Breast. Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 41: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, the T-47D cells, an estrogen receptor-positive cell line, evidenced a dramatic increase in anchorage-independent growth after treatment with leptin (25Hu X. Juneja S.C. Maihle N.J. Cleary M.P. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 2002; 94: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) are members of the superfamily of nuclear steroid hormone receptors, which are able to regulate the transcriptional activity of target genes by interacting with different DNA response elements (26Jensen E.V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 761: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling plays an essential role in promotion and progression of steroid hormone-dependent breast cancer (27Lopez-Otin C. Diamandis E.P. Endocrinol. Rev. 1998; 19: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating the classic transcriptional effect of estrogen, ERα can be transcriptionally activated in the absence of estrogen, a process referred to as ligand-independent activation (28Cenni B.

Physiol. 2002; 282: C853-C863Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the aim of the present study was to investigate whether leptin is able to induce the functional transactivation of ERα using as model systems the estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells and steroid receptor-negative HeLa cells. Our results have demonstrated, for the first time, the ability of leptin to induce ERα nuclear localization together with the typical features of ERα functional transactivation in breast cancer cells.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The wild type human ERα expression vector (HEGO) consists of the full-length ERα cDNA fused with the SV40 early promoter and expressed in the pSG5 vector (38Tora L. Mullick A. Metger D.

Cobb, Department of Pharmacology, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Cell Cultures—Wild-type human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells were a gift from E. Surmacz (Philadelphia, PA). Human uterin cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). MCF-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% CS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% Eagle's non-essential amino acids, and 1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were cultured in Phenol red-free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (CS-fetal calf serum), 0.5% BSA, and 2 mm l-glutamine, for 24 h before each experiment. Immunocytochemical Staining—Paraformaldehyde-fixed MCF-7 and HeLa cells (2% paraformaldehyde A for 30 min) were used for immunocytochemical staining. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide (3% in absolute methanol for 30 min), and nonspecific sites were blocked by normal horse serum (10% for 30 min). ERα immunostaining was then performed using as primary antibody a mouse monoclonal antiserum (1:40, overnight at 4 °C), whereas a biotinylated horse-anti-mouse IgG (1:600, for 1 h at room temperature) was utilized as secondary antibody. Avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC complex/horseradish peroxidase) was applied (30 min), and the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride dihydrate was used as detection system (5 min). TBS-T (0.05 m Tris-HCl plus 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.6 containing 0.05% Triton X-100) served as washing buffer. The primary antibody was replaced by normal mouse serum at the same concentration in control experiments on MCF-7 cultured cells. RNA Isolation—Total cellular RNA was extracted from MCF-7 cells using TRIzol reagent as suggested by the manufacturer. The purity and integrity of the RNA were checked spectroscopically and by gel electrophoresis before carrying out the analytical procedures. RT-PCR Assay—The evaluation of ERα and pS2 mRNA expression was performed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (39Maggiolini M. Donzé O. Picard D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For ERα, pS2, and the internal control gene 36B4, the primers were: 5′-GTGTACAACTACCCCGAGG-3′ (ERα forward) and 5′-CAGATTCATCATGCGGAACCGAATG-3′ (ERα reverse), 5′-TTCTATCCTAATACCATCGACG-3′ (pS2 forward) and 5′-TTTGAGTAGTCAAAGTCAGAGC-3′ (pS2 reverse), and 5′-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3′ (36B4 forward) and 5′-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGT-3′ (36B4 reverse) to yield products of 1172, 210, and 408 bp, with 20, 15, and 15 PCR cycles, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—MCF-7 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes up to 70–80% confluence and then lysed. Protein lysates were obtained with a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, PMSF, and sodium orthovanadate). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the antibody F-10 against ERα or β-actin. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubation of the membrane at room temperature with a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG and revealed using the ECL system. Transfection Assay—MCF-7 cells were transferred into 24-well plates with 500 μl of regular growth medium/well the day before transfection. The medium was replaced with DMEM lacking phenol red as well as serum on the day of transfection, which was performed using the FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer with the mixture containing 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid XETL. A set of experiments was performed cotransfecting XETL and pCMV5myc vector containing the cDNA encoding dominant negative ERK2 K52R (ERK2-, 0.5 μg/well). HeLa cells were cotransfected with XETL, HEGO, and ERK2 (0.5 μg/well). Another set of experiments was carried out by using 0.5 μg/well pSG5/HE15, pSG5/HE19, S104/106/118A-ER, and HE241G plasmids. Six hours after transfection, the medium was changed and the cells were treated in DMEM/F-12 in the presence of 100 and 1000 ng/ml leptin or 100 nm estradiol (E2) for 48 h. A concentration, 10 μm, of the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 was used. In another set of experiments, after transfection, we added MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 (50 μm) overnight in the medium before starting the treatment with leptin. TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (25 ng/well) was used to normalize the efficiency of the transfection. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase kit. The firefly luciferase data for each sample were normalized on the basis of transfection efficiency measured by Renilla luciferase activity. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from MCF-7 as previously described (40Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells plated into 60-mm dishes were scraped into 1.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted for 10 s and resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm leupeptin) by flicking the tube. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 s, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of cold Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction (containing DNA-binding proteins) was stored at -70 °C. The yield was determined by Bradford method (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The probe was generated by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then purified using Sephadex G50 spin columns. The DNA sequences used as probe or as cold competitor is the following (the nucleotide motif of interest is underlined) 5′-TCCCCCTGCAAGGTCACGGTGGCCACCCCGTG-3′. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. The protein binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) with 50000 cpm of labeled probe, 20 μg of MCF-7 nuclear protein, and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC)). The above-mentioned mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide. The entire reaction mixture was electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA for 3 h at 150 V. Gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C. Statistical Analysis—Each datum point represents the mean ± S.E. of three different experiments. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance test using the STATPAC computer program. Leptin Modulates ERα Nuclear Immunoreactivity in MCF-7 Cells—It is well documented that ERα is predominantly localized in the nucleus (42King W.J. Greene G.L. Nature. 1984; 307: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 43Welshons W.V. Lieberman M.E. Gorski J. Nature. 1984; 307: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 44Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and, upon ligand activation, undergoes conformational changes leading to homodimerization and target gene regulation (45Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar). To provide evidence that leptin is able to modulate ERα nuclear localization in MCF-7 cells, we performed two sets of immunostaining experiments using different culture conditions. Fig. 1 shows that, in MCF-7 cells maintained in medium without serum for 24 h, ERα immunoreactivity was well detectable in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1A) and down-regulated in cells treated for 24 h with 100 nm E2 (Fig. 1B) and 1000 ng/ml leptin (Fig. 1C). In the other set of experiments, MCF-7 cells were cultured in serum deprivation conditions for 96 h (Fig. 2). We observed that ERα immunoreactivity was no longer detectable in the control (Fig. 2A), whereas, in the same experimental conditions, the treatment with either E2 (Fig. 2B) or leptin (Fig. 2C) for 24 h induced a strong ERα immunoreactivity in the nuclear compartment. No immunoreactivity was observed either by replacing the anti-ERα antibody by irrelevant mouse IgG (insets in Figs. 1 and 2) or by using the primary antibody pre-absorbed with an excess of receptor protein (data not shown). Leptin Down-regulates ERα Expression—E2 is known to down-regulate the levels of ERα in breast cancer cell line through an increased turnover of the E2-activated ERα protein and a reduced transcription rate of its own gene (46Santagati S. Gianazza E. Agrati P. Vegeto E. Patrone C. Pollio G. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This down-regulation represents an additional hallmark of ERα activation by an agonist. To evaluate if leptin may exhibit a like-estrogen action, we investigated the down-regulatory effects of ERα mRNA and total protein levels in MCF-7 cells. A treatment of 24 h with either 1000 ng/ml leptin or E2 100 nm displayed in both circumstances a similar pattern of response consistent with a down-regulation of both ERα mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B) and protein content (Fig. 3, C and D). ERα mRNA levels were compared by semiquantitative RT-PCR and standardized on the mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene 36B4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Leptin Up-regulates pS2 mRNA—To provide further evidence for the ability of leptin to activate per se ERα, we investigated upon leptin exposure the expression of a classic estrogen-dependent gene, pS2. We observed, by RT-PCR, in MCF-7 cells treated with 1000 ng/ml leptin for 24 h, a strong increase of pS2 mRNA that was inhibited by the addition of the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (Fig. 4, A and B). Leptin Induces Functional Activation of ERα in MCF-7 and HeLa Cells—To corroborate the specificity of leptin to transactivate the endogenous ERα, we transiently transfected MCF-7 cells with the gene reporter XETL, which carries firefly luciferase sequences under the control of an estrogen response element upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter. A significant enhancement of XETL expression was observed in the transfected cells exposed to 1000 ng/ml leptin for 48 h (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained in estrogen receptor-negative HeLa cells cotransfected with HEGO and XETL plasmids tested in the same experimental conditions (Fig. 5). Remarkably the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 was shown to efficiently antagonize the stimulatory effect of leptin on ERα-regulated transactivation in MCF-7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Leptin is able, via JAK2, to activate the Ras-dependent MAPK pathway. Thus, a potential role of ERK1/ERK2 pathway in mediating the stimulatory effects of leptin on ERα has been reasonably investigated, because the MAPK signal is generally involved in enhancing ERα functional activation in a ligand-independent manner. In the presence of MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 or in the cells transiently transfected with"

By measuring the fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching profiles of green fluorescent protein-histone H1 proteins in living cells, we find that the deletion of the N terminus only modestly reduces binding affinity. Deletion of the C terminus, however, almost completely eliminates histone H1.1 binding. Specific mutations of the C-terminal domain identified Thr-152 and Ser-183 as novel regulatory switches that control the binding of histone H1.1 in vivo. It is remarkable that the single amino acid substitution of Thr-152 with glutamic acid was almost as effective as the truncation of the C terminus to amino acid 151 in destabilizing histone H1.1 binding in vivo. We found that modifications to the C terminus can affect histone H1 binding dramatically but have little or no influence on the charge distribution or the overall net charge of this domain. A comparison of individual point mutations and deletion mutants, when reviewed collectively, cannot be reconciled with simple charge-dependent mechanisms of C-terminal domain function of linker histones.

Histone H1 is the fifth histone subtype and is not one of the histones that form the histone octamer of the nucleosome. Rather, histone H1 binds to the surface of the nucleosome and interacts with nucleosomal DNA at the entry and exit points (1Vignali M. Workman J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). In doing so, histone H1 is critical in determining the higher-order folding states of chromatin. Because of this property, histone H1 has traditionally been considered a general repressor of transcription (3Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, histone H1 was found to be modestly depleted in transcriptionally active genes (4Kamakaka R.T. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Bresnick E.H. Bustin M. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L.

More recently, genetic studies have revealed contributions of H1 histones to the establishment of epigenetic silencing (7Jedrusik M.A. Schulze E. Development. 2001; 128: 1069-1080PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gabrilovich D.I. Cheng P. Fan Y. Yu B. Nikitina E. Sirotkin A. Shurin M. Oyama T. Adachi Y. Nadaf S. Carbone D.P. Skoultchi A.I. J. Leukoc.

In addition to a structural role, histone H1 also functions in gene-specific regulation. A large number of studies have demonstrated that H1 histones or specific variants are directly involved in the regulation of specific genes (3Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Folco H.D. Freitag M. Ramon A. Temporini E.D. Alvarez M.E. Garcia I. Scazzocchio C. Selker E.U. Rosa A.L. Eukaryot.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), consistent with the observation of differential gene expression when the sole histone H1 gene was knocked out in Tetrahymena thermophila (15Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).The structure of H1 histones is typically considered to consist of three separate domains (16Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). A short stretch of amino acids on the N terminus and a much larger stretch that comprises the C terminus show significant variability between individual subtypes as well as between species. The amino and carboxyl termini have diverged considerably throughout the evolution of metazoans (17Kasinsky H.E. Lewis J.D. Dacks J.B. Ausio J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). If we restrict the analysis to mammals, the C termini diverge between individual histone H1 variants, but the sequences of the individual C termini are well conserved between species. When histone H1 sequences are examined in a broader range of species, the centrally located region of the protein, the globular domain, is the most highly conserved region among H1 histone family members (18Ponte I. Vila R. Suau P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The structure of the central region of the protein has been solved by x-ray crystallography (19Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and is sufficient for binding to the nucleosome in vitro (20Vermaak D. Steinbach O.C. Dimitrov S. Rupp R.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies with reconstituted systems showed that the C-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. is required to condense chromatin into higher order structures (16Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 23Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the presence of only C-terminal-like domains in some protists.Because of the high density of positively charged amino acids within the CTD, it is commonly believed that condensation is mediated through charge-neutralization of the negatively charged linker DNA. In a recent study, Lu and Hansen (22Lu X. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) found that the ability of histone H1° to stabilize chromatin folding was not evenly distributed; rather, it was localized to two specific subdomains in the CTD. Because the density of positively charged lysine and arginine amino acids is very similar throughout the ∼100 amino acids of the C terminus, binding does not correlate in a simple manner with the abundance of positively charged amino acids within the domain. Lu and Hansen (22Lu X. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) proposed that histone H1 initially binds with low specificity in a charge-dependent manner. Upon binding to the DNA, the C terminus then acquires secondary structure. This feature of protein folding has been described as “intrinsic disorder.” This mechanism of histone H1 binding contrasts with the binding properties that would be expected if histone H1 were to function according to the “charge patch” hypothesis. The charge patch hypothesis proposes that the clustered positively charged lysines in the C-terminal domain bind DNA and facilitate condensation through neutralization of phosphates on the DNA (24Dou Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 225-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Dou Y. Bowen J. Liu Y. Gorovsky M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although this mechanism of binding may apply to the evolutionarily divergent H1 of T. thermophila, recent structural studies of histone H1s from mammals indicate that regions within the C-terminal domain adopt an α-helical structure when associated with DNA (26Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Vila R. Ponte I. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. Suau P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46429-46435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling techniques also predict the adoption of secondary structure in the C terminus of histone H1 (21Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More specifically, the modeling studies reveal that the C terminus may adopt an high mobility group-box-like structure, and that the C terminus SPKK motifs are sites of DNA binding and function in the compaction of the DNA (21Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).We and others have previously used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to quantify the binding of histone H1 proteins in living cells (29Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8626-8636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that histone H1 binds transiently to the chromatin of living cells. In this study, we quantify the specific contributions of the N- and C-terminal domains of histone H1.1 as well as the T/SPXK motifs in the CTD to the in vivo chromatin binding affinity of histone H1. We find that the C-terminal domain of histone H1 plays a major role in defining the affinity of histone H1 binding in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—SK-N-SH cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected for stable incorporation of the plasmids by selection for 2 weeks in the presence of G418, and cells that stably expressed the fluorescent histone H1.1 were sorted and used in FRAP studies.FRAP Analyses—Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope as detailed previously (29Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Each experiment shows the results of at least 20 nuclei collected from three separate experiments. The standard deviations are not shown but are typically less than 5% for each time point.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cloning of histone H1.1 (GenBank accession no. X57130) was described by Lever et al. (29Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Mutations of threonine and serine sites on histone H1.1 was performed by sequential PCR as described in the Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Primers for PCR were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. The sequences of the primers employed to generate mutations were: T152A, CGTCAAGGCTCCGAAAAAGG and CCTTTTTCGGAGCCTTGACGC; T152E, GCGTCAAGGAACCGAAAAAGG and CCTTTTTCGGTTCCTTGACGC; T152K, GCGTCAAGAAACCGAAAAAGG and CCTTTTTCGGTTTCTTGACGC; S183A, GTAGCTAAAGCCCCTGCTAAAGC and GCTTTAGCAGGGGCTTTAGCTAC; S183E, GTAGCTAAAGAACCTGCTAAAGC and GCTTTAGCAGGTTCTTTAGCTAC; and S183K, GTAGCTAAAAAACCTGCTAAAGC and GCTTTAGCAGGTTTTTTAGCTAC. The PCR products were first cloned into pCR2.1 vector using the TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then directionally subcloned into pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). Sequencing of PCR products to verify the mutations were performed by Guelph Molecular Supercenter and the Paleo-DNA Laboratory (Lakehead University).RESULTSVariation in Amino Acid Sequence among Human Histone H1 Subtypes—The conserved features of all of the histone H1 variants include: 1) a central domain, 2) a large carboxyl terminus rich in proline, lysine, and arginine, and 3) serine/threonine kinase phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain, which constitutes more than half of the total mass of the H1 protein, accounts for most of the sequence heterogeneity between histone H1 variants (18Ponte I. Vila R. Suau P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this domain was shown to be essential for high affinity in vivo binding to chromatin (29Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the amino acid alignment of the C-terminal domains of individual histone H1 subtypes of human and mouse. Each subtype has multiple cyclin-dependent kinase-specific motifs, up to five in histones H1.4 and H1.5 (four in the C-terminal tail and one at the N terminus). The specific lysines predicted to bind and compact the “linker” DNA (21Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are highlighted in green.To define the role of phosphorylation in regulating histone H1 binding in vivo, we chose to examine histone H1.1 (also named histone H1a and histone H1S5 (32Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). This H1 subtype has only two C-terminal cyclin-dependent kinase-specific sites, which reduces the complexity of determining the effects of phosphorylation on histone H1 binding to chromatin binding in vivo. Recent studies of rat histone H1d binding to chromatin in vitro (33Bharath M.M. Ramesh S. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7617-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and a number of recent structural and molecular modeling studies now predict that the C-terminal domain of histone H1 is structured when bound to DNA and chromatin (26Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Vila R. Ponte I. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The lysines predicted by molecular modeling (21Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to interact with the DNA within the chromatosome are highlighted as red dots in Fig. 1. In this instance, the Thr-152 site aligns with a conserved TPKK site in which both lysines are predicted to binding extranucleosomal DNA. The conserved SPAK site at Ser-183 in histone H1.1 is four amino acids away from the last two lysines mapped as DNA contacts in the molecular model. If histone H1 adopts a more structured C terminus, the phosphorylation of either or both sites within the C terminus of histone H1.1 may have a much greater impact on histone H1 binding in vivo. The substantial increase in histone H1.1 residency time on chromatin after treatment with the general kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, is consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of chromatin binding in living cells (29Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To address these unresolved questions related to histone H1 structure and function, we designed experiments to further define the specific contributions of individual regions of histone H1 protein to chromatin binding in living cells.C-terminal GFP Fusion Reduces the Affinity of Histone H1 Binding—Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to measure the binding affinity of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged histone H1 bound to chromatin in living cells. We began by measuring the fluorescence recovery rates of histones containing N- or C-terminal tails modified by fusion to GFP and by introducing specific deletions. Fig. 2 shows the relative recovery rates of GFP-tagged histone H1.1 protein stably expressed in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. The two full-length forms of histone H1.1 bound with the highest affinity to the endogenous chromatin. However, when the GFP tag was placed on the C terminus, the recovery rate was faster than when the tag was at the N terminus. The reduction of binding caused by the C-terminal fusion was almost as great as that seen when the N-terminal domain was deleted. Deletion of the N terminus significantly reduced the binding affinity of the histone H1.1; the C-terminal placement of the GFP bound with a lower affinity than that obtained when the GFP was placed at the N terminus. When staurosporine was added to inhibit kinase activity, the recovery time was increased by about 2-fold (see also Fig. 5). When the C terminus was deleted, the GFP-histone H1.1 deletion protein did not bind well and recovered at rates approaching diffusion. Based on these findings, subsequent studies were done with the histone H1.1 cloned into pEGFP-C1, placing the GFP at the N terminus to minimize possible interference.Fig. 2Influence of flanking domains on the relative rates of recovery of histone H1.1. Individual constructs of GFP-tagged histone H1.1 were transfected into SK-N-SH cells, and stable transfectants were used to measure fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of the fluorescent histone. The time in seconds required to achieve 50% fluorescence recovery (T(1/2)) was plotted in the presence and absence of staurosporine. Constructs of histone H1.1 employed in the study had the GFP fused at either the N terminus (gfpH1.1) or the C terminus (H1.1gfp). H1.1DCgfp, histone H1, where histone H1.1 has its CTD replaced by the green fluorescent protein; gfpH1.1DC, histone H1 with the GFP fused to the N terminus of a histone H1.1 construct with the C terminus deleted; DNH1.1gfp, histone H1.1 with a deleted N terminus and the GFP fused to the C terminus; GfpDNH1.1, histone H1.1 with its N terminus replaced by the GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5The effect of double mutations to alanine or glutamic acid on histone H1.1 mobility. FRAP measurements of the mobility of histone H1.1 containing Thr-152 and Ser-183 mutated to either glutamic acid (T152ES183E) or alanine (T152AS183A). The plot shows the relative recovery of fluorescence versus time after photobleaching for each mutant. The full-length histone H1.1 is included as a reference for evaluating relative mobilities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FRAP Analysis of C-terminal Deletions of Histone H1.1—To further define the contribution of the C terminus to histone H1.1 binding in vivo, we initiated a series of FRAP experiments to quantitatively define the contributions of the two C-terminal phosphorylation sites. Within this C-terminal region of histone H1.1, there reside two S/TPXK sites that are phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (34Hill C.S. Rimmer J.M. Green B.N. Finch J.T. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These motifs are of particular interest because the commonly repeated sequence SPKK is known to bind DNA in vitro (35Suzuki M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The possibility that these motifs might be ideally positioned to play a critical role in both DNA binding and histone H1-dependent condensation of the chromatin can be inferred from computational predictions of the structure of both the C-terminal domain in association with DNA and the C-terminal domain positioned within the chromatosome (21Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Bharath M.M. Ramesh S. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7617-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Proteins. 2002; 49: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).We first examined the contributions of the individual regions of the C-terminal tail using partial deletion mutants of human histone H1.1. Deletion of amino acids 183–214 resulted in a protein that has reduced binding affinity and allows the photobleached region to be replaced in approximately half the time (Fig. 3B), showing that this terminal region of the CTD contributes to the binding to chromatin. Further C-terminal deletions up to lysine 151 resulted in a protein that bound to chromatin with much less affinity and recovered in less than 10% of the time required for the full-length protein (Fig. 3B). When these recovery curves were re-plotted using the log of time of recovery, the largest deletion had a recovery profile that presented as a straight line (Fig. 3C). In contrast, both the 183 deletion and the full-length protein resolved into two kinetic populations in these plots. This may reflect the kinetic footprints of two distinct binding events involved in stabilizing the association of the globular domain with the surface of the nucleosome.Fig. 3Reduction in chromatin binding of histone H1.1 with truncated CTD. A, sequence alignment of the C-terminal regions of rat histone H1d and human histone H1.1. The lysines highlighted in yellow are predicted to make specific contacts with the DNA. The motifs highlighted in green represent the conserved phosphorylation sequences, except for the conserved SPAK site, which is highlighted in blue. The position of an additional lysine predicted in the histone H1d chromatosome model to specifically contact the DNA is highlighted in red. B, FRAP recovery curves obtained from cells stably transfected with full-length histone H1.1 or histone H1.1 containing deletions up to and including the phosphorylation sites at Thr-152 (Del152) and Ser183 (Del183). The plot shows the relative recovery of fluorescence in the photobleached region versus time. C, the data from B is re-plotted versus the log of time. The error bars show 1 S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Glutamic Acid Mutation of Thr-152 and Ser-183—Although the deletion analyses showed that the regions from Thr-152 and Ser-183 to the end of the C-terminal domain augment the binding of histone H1.1 in vivo, they did not reveal the roles that the cyclin-dependent kinase-dependent phosphorylation sites may play in chromatin binding. To assess the specific contributions of phosphorylation of each of these sites, we generated GFP-histone H1.1 hybrid proteins in which the Thr-152 was switched to Glu-152 or the Ser-183 was switched to Glu-183. These substitutions introduce negative charges to mimic phosphorylation at these sites.Fig. 4 shows the results of FRAP experiments performed on cells stably expressing these mutated histone H1.1 proteins. The results show that either mutation has a significant effect on binding of the histone H1.1 protein to chromatin. The recovery profiles of the deletion mutants are included in this graph to contrast the magnitude of the change in binding relative to the change seen in the deletion mutants. Mutation of Ser-183 to glutamic acid produced binding properties very similar to those of the mutant that was truncated at this same site. This suggests that this SPAK motif, which was not implicated in DNA binding according to the molecular modeling predictions of Bharath et al. (21Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is located in a region in which a phosphorylation event will disrupt DNA binding of the lysines that are C-terminal to Ser-183. The insertion of a glutamic acid in position 152 has a much greater effect on the affinity of histone H1.1 binding in vivo than does the Ser-183. It is notable that the replacement of Thr-152 with glutamic acid destabilizes histone H1.1 binding more than truncation of the C terminus at Lys-182, which deletes 12 lysines and an arginine.Fig. 4The effects of glutamic acid substitutions at positions 152 and 183 of the H1.1 C terminus. Histone H1.1 constructs that contain either a single glutamic acid substitution of Thr-152 (T152E) or a single glutamic acid substitution of Ser-183 (S183E) were stably expressed in SK-N-SH cells, and the mobility was then measured using FRAP. The recovery profiles of the histone H1.1 constructs containing the corresponding C-terminal deletions are included for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Effects of Other Point Mutations of Thr-152 and Ser-183 on Histone H1.1 Binding—To further evaluate the contribution of these phosphorylated amino acids in the binding of histone H1.1 in vivo, we generated double glutamic acid and double alanine mutants. Fig. 5 shows the recovery profiles of Thr-152 and Ser-183 mutated to either glutamic acid or alanine. For comparison, the single point mutations to glutamic acid are also shown in this plot. It is remarkable that the mutation of both amino acids to glutamic acid generated a histone H1.1 protein with a FRAP recovery profile almost identical to that of the single glutamic acid substitution at amino acid position 152.The mutation of Thr-152 and Ser-183 to alanines would prevent phosphorylation, and this would reduce the mobility of histone H1.1, if phosphorylation merely functions to disrupt binding by charge repulsion. When the recovery profile of histone H1 containing double alanine mutations was determined, we observed a destabilization of histone H1.1 binding in vivo relative to the wild-type histone H1. The resulting mutated histone H1.1 has a binding affinity that is midway between the Ser-183 glutamic acid (S183E) mutant and the parent histone H1.1 protein.Lysine Substitutions of Thr-152 and Ser-183 Increase the Stability of Binding of Histone H1.1—To determine whether the addition of more positive charges to the highly basic C terminus had a direct influence on the binding of histone H1.1 to chromatin in living cells, we substituted Thr-152 or Ser-183 with lysines and measured the binding affinities of these mutant histone H1.1 proteins. Fig. 6 shows that the introduction of a lysine at either position increased the stability of histone H1.1 binding in vivo. This is consistent with the idea that overall net positive charge of these regions is important in regulating histone H1.1 binding. However, when both positions are mutated, the resulting protein bound with lower affinity than either single mutation alone.Fig. 6The effect of lysine substitutions at positions 152 and 183 on histone H1.1 mobility. Histone H1.1 constructs with mutations that converted either Thr-152 (T152K), Ser-183 (S183K), or both amino acids (T152KS183K) to lysines were stably expressed in human SK-N-SH cells, and their mobility was examined by FRAP. The plot shows the relative recovery versus time in seconds after photobleaching.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONUntil the recent development of fluorescence-tagged proteins for use in FRAP, studies relating functions to the structure of histone H1 in chromatin had been limited to in vitro reconstituted systems.

https://openalex.org/W2131571647,"We examined two variants of the genome-sequenced strain, Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168, which show marked differences in their virulence properties including colonization of poultry, invasion of Caco-2 cells, and motility. Transcript profiles obtained from whole genome DNA microarrays and proteome analyses demonstrated that these differences are reflected in late flagellar structural components and in virulence factors including those involved in flagellar glycosylation and cytolethal distending toxin production. We identified putative sigma(28) and sigma(54) promoters for many of the affected genes and found that greater differences in expression were observed for sigma(28)-controlled genes. Inactivation of the gene encoding sigma(28), fliA, resulted in an unexpected increase in transcripts with sigma(54) promoters, as well as decreased transcription of sigma(28)-regulated genes. This was unlike the transcription profile observed for the attenuated C. jejuni variant, suggesting that the reduced virulence of this organism was not entirely due to impaired function of sigma(28). However, inactivation of flhA, an important component of the flagellar export apparatus, resulted in expression patterns similar to that of the attenuated variant. These findings indicate that the flagellar regulatory system plays an important role in campylobacter pathogenesis and that flhA is a key element involved in the coordinate regulation of late flagellar genes and of virulence factors in C. jejuni."

HSCs were originally identified as pluripotent progenitor cells that can differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages. However, it was revealed that the cells also could differentiate into endothelial lineages. ECPs and HSCs are now believed to originate from common progenitor cells, termed hemangioblast cells (12Yamashita J. Itoh H. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Yurugi T. Naito M. Nakao K. Nishikawa S. Nature. 2000; 408: 92-96Google Scholar). Interestingly, these progenitor cells and mature endothelial cells express several common molecular markers, such as von Willebrand factor, c-kit, Tie-2, Flt-1/VEGF-receptor-1, KDR/Flk-1/VEGF receptor-2, Sca-1, CXCR4, CD146, CD31, and CD34 (13Rafii S.

These markers disappear according to the differentiation of the cells into mature blood cells of most hematopoietic lineages, whereas their expression is still highly maintained in mature endothelial cells (14Gill M.

Among them, c-kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is known to play important roles in amplification and recruitment of progenitor cells from bone marrow into the circulation (16Linnekin D. Int. J.

Proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation of endothelial cells are essential processes of angiogenesis and directed by several angiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF (23Ferrara N. J. Mol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Google Scholar) and activation of the PI3K-Akt (27Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Google Scholar) pathway should be important for proliferation and survival of the endothelial cell. Since c-kit is also a member of the PDGF receptor superfamily (28Yarden Y. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Google Scholar), and SCF/c-kit signaling in hematopoietic cell lines are reported to involve Erk1/2, and Akt (29Kapur R. Chandra S. Cooper R. McCarthy J. Williams D.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1287-1293Google Scholar, 30Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 63-70Google Scholar), we studied whether SCF/c-kit signaling has similar roles to VEGF/KDR signaling in endothelial cells or not. In this report we show that SCF/c-kit signaling can promote the survival, migration, and capillary tube formation of HUVEC. This signaling involves Akt and Erk1/2, as VEGF signaling does, but the overall signaling pathways is different. Reagents—HMVECs were purchased from Cambrex BioScience Walkersville, Inc.

Cell Culture—HUVECs were isolated from human umbilical cords by a method described previously (31Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Google Scholar). Briefly, the inside of an umbilical vein was rinsed with sterile saline and incubated with trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, endothelial cells that come off the vessel were obtained and cultured on type I collagen-coated plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in EGM-2. In this study we used three to six passage cells. The mRNA level of Prox-1, which is a marker of lymphangio endothelial cells, was checked by real time RT-PCR. HMVECs were used as a control, about half of which were reported to be lymphangio endothelial cells (32Makinen T. Veikkola T. Mustjoki S. Karpanen T. Catimel B. Nice EC. Wise L. Mercer A. Kowalski H. Kerjaschki D. Stacker SA. Achen M.G. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4762-4773Google Scholar). Endothelial cell purity was measured as CD31-positive cells by a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur) and determined to be more than 99%. sTF Assay—The sTF assay (a collagen three-dimensional culture of HUVECs) was performed according to Deroanne et al. (33Deroanne C.F. Colige A.C. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 215-223Google Scholar) with a small modification. Briefly, HUVECs were maintained by changing culture medium every day and used in subconfluence. Cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA and counted. Seven volumes of type I collagen solution were mixed with 2 volumes of 5× RPMI 1640 and 1 volume of reconstitution buffer on ice. An aliquot (0.4 ml) of the collagen gel mixture was added to each well of 24-well plates and allowed to gel at 37 °C. HUVECs were plated onto the gel at 1.5 × 105 cells per well with SFM containing 10 ng/ml EGF (assay medium) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Medium was removed, and 0.4 ml of type I collagen gel mixture was added upon the cells and allowed to gel for 4 h at 37 °C. An aliquot (0.5 ml) of vehicle/test compounds/neutralizing antibody (three times final concentration) and 1 ml of assay medium plus SCF/VEGF/bFGF/HGF-containing solution (1.5 times final concentration) were added to each well. HUVECs sandwiched in collagen gel were incubated at 37 °Cina5%CO2 atmosphere for 3 days. The medium was removed, and 0.4 ml of MTT solutions (3.3 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethlthiazol-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (Sigma) in PBS) were added to each well and incubated for another 4 h. Photomicrographs of capillaries were taken with a light microscope. Tube length of each capillary was measured using image analysis (Angiogenesis Image Analyzer, version 1.0, Kurabo, Osaka, Japan). Assays were performed in duplicate. Survival Assay—HUVECs (1 × 104/50 μl/well) were cultured in collagen type I-coated 96-well multiplates under EGM-2. After 6 h of culturing, culture medium was exchanged for SFM (assay medium). After overnight culture, assay medium containing several concentrations of growth factor and/or a neutralizing antibody, a compound was added to each well, and cells were cultured at 37 °C for 72 h. After incubation, 0.01 ml/well of the WST-1 reagent was added in each well and incubated for another 4 h. Absorbance of each well was measured in a microplate reader (Spectra Max 250, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at 415 nm (reference wavelength at 660 nm) (34Ishiyama M. Tominaga H. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 1518-1520Google Scholar). Assays were performed in duplicate. Would Healing Assay—HUVECs were maintained by changing culture medium every day and used in subconfluence. Cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA and counted. HUVEC were seeded in collagen-coated 12-well multiplates (2.2 × 105/ml/well) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in EGM-2 medium. When cells adhered (2 h), medium was aspirated, and SCF (100 ng/ml), VEGF (20 ng/ml), FGF-2 (20 ng/ml) in SFM was added (1 ml/well). After 6-h incubation, confluent monolayers of HUVEC were wounded with a pipette chip and incubated in the same medium (35Pepper M.S. Sappino A.P. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassali J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 129-139Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells that had migrated across the edge of the wound were observed. Quantitative RT-PCR Assay—Using TRIzol reagent, total RNA was extracted from HUVECs, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), and H526 cells. Reactions of cDNA (0.0375 ng/well) were prepared for assay. Real time RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit and an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A set of primers and TaqMan probe for each gene were purchased from Applied Biosystems. c-kit and Prox-1 were Assay on Demand™ gene expression products: ID numbers Hs00174029 and Hs00174029. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells in assay medium condition were washed with PBS and detached with trypsin-EDTA. After centrifugation the cell pellet was suspended at 1–3 × 105 cells/ml in 50 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% NaN3 and incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody (anti-CD31 or anti-c-kit antibody) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in 50 μl of anti-conjugated second antibody diluted 1:50 in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The control sample (for background) was incubated in PBS, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences) to quantify staining intensity. The expression of CD31 or c-kit was calculated using the mean fluorescence intensity of each sample as determined by flow cytometry: relative expression = mean fluorescence intensity of sample/mean fluorescence intensity of background. Western Blotting Analysis—Confluent-grown HUVECs in 6-well multiplates were cultured with SFM medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compounds for 60 min and then with SCF or VEGF stimulation (20 ng/ml) for the indicated time. Cells were washed with cold PBS twice, collected in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and allowed to lyse for 10 min on ice. Samples were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Western blotting was performed as described previously (36Kanno S. Oda N. Abe M. Terai Y. Ito M. Shitara K. Tabayashi K. Shibuya M. Sato Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2138-2146Google Scholar). A sample (20 μg) of lysate protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotting. Briefly, samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and run at 30 mA for 2 h. The proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 350 mA for 4.5 h, followed by Western blot analysis. Blots were blocked with Trisbuffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and either 5% skim milk or 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the appropriate secondary antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, blots were developed with Super Signal enhanced chemiluminescence kits. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence with Image Master. The intensity of each band was measured by using an image analyzer (1D Image Analysis Software, Eastman Kodak Co.). SCF Drives the Capillary Tube Formation of HUVECs— Capillary tube formation is one of the most unique features of mature endothelial cells. We initially examined whether SCF can drive capillary tube formation of HUVEC in collagen three-dimensional culture. As shown in Fig. 1A, HUVEC formed capillary tube networks in collagen gel with an assay medium as described under “Experimental Procedures” containing 100 ng/ml SCF, and the network structure was maintained for at least 3 days. The capillary tube formation did not proceed well in the gel with assay medium only (Fig. 1A), and the total length of tube structure depended on the dose of SCF (Fig. 1B), indicating that SCF effectively drives the capillary tube formation of HUVEC. Fig. 1A also shows the capillary tube network driven by VEGF, bFGF, and HGF, the amounts of which were determined as those giving maximal effects. These angiogenic factors are known to induce angiogenesis in this model. Structures of the capillary tube network were basically the same, but detailed morphologies were characteristic of each angiogenic factor. Effects of Anti-SCF, Ant-VEGF, Anti-bFGF, and Anti-HGF Antibodies—Since the amount of SCF (100 ng/ml) that fully drove the capillary tube formation of HUVECs was relatively high, it is possible that the effects of SCF are indirect, such as stimulation of HUVECs to produce some angiogenic factors. To exclude this possibility, we investigated the effects of neutralizing antibody against known angiogenic factors on capillary tube formation of HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 2, capillary tube formation of HUVECs driven by SCF was not inhibited by neutralizing antibody against either VEGF, bFGF, or HGF, whereas those driven by VEGF, bFGF, or HGF were markedly inhibited by each specific antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that production of VEGF, bFGF, and HGF does not contribute to the effects of SCF. SCF Promotes Cell Survival and Migration of HUVECs—It is known that promotion of cell mobility and maintenance of cell survival signaling are essential for capillary tube formation. Thus, we next investigated whether HUVECs proliferate and/or survive in SFM containing SCF. Subconfluent HUVECs were starved in SFM containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h, and the medium was changed to SFM containing various amounts of SCF. As shown in Fig. 3A, the number of viable cells after 3 days in culture depended on the concentration of SCF. Generally, the number of viable cells using 100 ng/ml SCF was the same as the initial number of inoculated cells. When the medium had been exchanged to a fresh one containing 100 ng/ml SCF every 3 days, HUVECs survived at least 1 week (data not shown). These results indicate that SCF promotes cell survival but not the proliferation of HUVECs. On the other hand, HU-VECs proliferated in SFM containing 50 ng/ml VEGF (Fig. 3A), confirming that VEGF promotes both survival and proliferation of HUVEC. It is known that HUVEC themselves produce SCF (5Isner J.M. Asahara T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1231-1236Google Scholar), but the contribution of SCF production to the survival of HUVECs might be small in our culture system, since almost all the cells died in the basal medium without adding SCF after 3 days in culture. Fig. 3B shows the migration of HUVECs in the wound healing assay. The cell-free zone made by scratching using a micropipette tip was filled with migrated HUVECs within 24 h in assay medium containing SCF, VEGF, bFGF, or HGF. A picture of migrating cells was taken 12 h after scratching. The migration speed depended on the concentration of SCF and reached a plateau at 100 ng/ml SCF. VEGF and FGF-2 also promoted the migration of HUVECs, and both effects reached a plateau at 20 ng/ml. These doses were well correlated to the doses driving capillary tube formation of HUVECs. Effects Downstream of SCF/c-kit Signaling—To confirm the direct effect of SCF on HUVECs, we first measured the expression of its receptor, c-kit in HUVEC at both mRNA and protein level by real time RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis. H526 cells (lung cancer), which are well studied as c-kit-expressing cells (37Krystal G.W. DeBerry C.S. Linnekin D. Litz J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4660-4666Google Scholar, 38Abrams T.J. Lee L.B. Murray L.J. Pryer N.K. Cherrington J.M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 471-478Google Scholar), were used as an expression control. The expression levels of c-kit mRNA and protein in the assay medium were 25 and 27% of that of H526 cells, respectively, confirming that HUVECs actually express considerable amounts of c-kit. Next we analyzed tyrosine autophosphorylation of the c-kit by SCF. As shown in Fig. 4, c-kit was also expressed in HUVECs by protein level, and the level was comparable with that of H526 cells, which respond well to SCF (data not shown). After adding SCF to HUVECs, c-kit was immediately tyrosine-phosphorylated (within 5 min), showing that SCF directly stimulates its specific receptor. The phosphorylation gave a peak at 5–10 min and persisted for 30 min. Protein levels of c-kit were not changed during this period. Akt and Erk1/2 were also tyrosine-phosphorylated simultaneously with the phosphorylation of c-kit. STI-571, an inhibitor of c-kit (39Tuveson D.A. Willis N.A. Jacks T. Griffin J.D. Singer S. Fletcher C.D. Fletcher J.A. Demetri G.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5054-5058Google Scholar, 40Attoub S. Rivat C. Rodrigues S. Van Bocxlaer S. Bedin M. Bruyneel E. Louvet C. Kornprobst M. Andre T. Mareel M. Mester J. Gespach C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4879-4883Google Scholar), clearly inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 as well as c-kit, dose-dependently (Fig. 5C). STI-571 also inhibited SCF-driven capillary tube formation and cell survival at the same dose (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that Akt and Erk1/2 should promote survival and tube formation downstream of SCF/c-kit signaling.Fig. 5Effects of STI-571 (c-kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor) on SCF-induced phenotypes of HUVECs. A, effect of STI-571 on SCF or VEGF driven capillary tube formation. HUVECs were three-dimensionally cultured for 3 days in type I collagen gels containing the assay medium with SCF or VEGF and increasing amounts of STI-571. B, effects of STI-571 on SCF- or VEGF-driven cell survival. HUVECs were cultured for 3 days in the assay medium with SCF or VEGF and increasing amounts of STI-571 on 96-well plates coated with collagen type I. C, effects of STI-571 on SCF-driven phosphorylation of c-kit, Erk1/2, and Akt. Confluent monolayers of HUVECs were cultured in the assay medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h on dishes coated with collagen type I. Cells were then treated with increasing amounts of STI-571 for 60 min, followed by SCF stimulation (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting. All of experiments were done at least in duplicate and repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of Events Downstream of SCF c-kit and VEGF/KDR Signaling—It is well known that VEGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several signal transducers including Erk1/2 and Akt (26Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Google Scholar, 27Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies showed that their maximum phosphorylation could be observed at about 10 min after treatment of VEGF and SCF. Therefore, we next compared the tyrosine phosphorylation profile of several signal transducers in HUVECs treated with VEGF and SCF for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 6, VEGF induced phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, p38, and PLCγ as well as its receptor, KDR, in a dose-dependent manner. SCF also induced phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, p38, and c-kit dose-dependently, confirming the results shown in Fig. 4, whereas it did not induce the phosphorylation of PLCγ. Furthermore, maximal tyrosine phosphorylation levels of each molecule in HUVECs with SCF and those with VEGF were different. Akt is more strongly phosphorylated, whereas Erk1/2, p38, and PLCγ were more weakly phosphorylated with SCF than with VEGF. Protein levels of all these molecules were not changed in these analyses. These results indicate that their overall signaling pathways are partly different and that although the same molecules such as Erk1/2, Akt, and P38 are involved downstream of SCF/c-kit and VEGF/KDR, their share of signaling in each downstream pathway are different. Contribution of Akt and Erk1/2 to Capillary Tube Formation in HUVECs Stimulated with SCF or VEGF—Since tyrosine phosphorylation profiles of Akt and Erk1/2 were different in HUVECs treated with SCF and VEGF, we then evaluated the contributions of Akt and Erk1/2 in the cells using two kinds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Wortmannin and LY294002, inhibitors of PI3K, inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt, and PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (41Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Google Scholar, 42Surapisitchat J. Hoefen R.J. Pi X. Yoshizumi M. Yan C. Berk B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6476-6481Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7D, wortmannin (0.1 μm) and LY294002 (4 μm) inhibited both SCF- and VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt, and this dose of wortmannin and LY294002 completely blocked SCF-driven capillary tube formation (Fig. 7, A and B). However, they could not inhibit VEGF-driven capillary tube formation (Fig. 7, A and B). Higher concentrations of the inhibitors were not studied,"

Reduction in levels of the potentially toxic amyloid-β has emerged as one of the most important therapeutic goals in Alzheimer's disease. Key targets for this goal are factors that affect the regulation of the APP gene. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have illustrated the importance of copper in Alzheimer's disease neuropathogenesis and suggested a role for APP and amyloid-β in copper homeostasis. We hypothesized that metals and in particular copper might alter APP gene expression. To test the hypothesis, we utilized human fibroblasts overexpressing the Menkes protein (MNK), a major mammalian copper efflux protein. MNK deletion fibroblasts have high intracellular copper, whereas MNK overexpressing fibroblasts have severely depleted intracellular copper. We demonstrate that copper depletion significantly reduced APP protein levels and down-regulated APP gene expression. Furthermore, APP promoter deletion constructs identified the copper-regulatory region between -490 and +104 of the APP gene promoter in both basal MNK overexpressing cells and in copper-chelated MNK deletion cells. Overall these data support the hypothesis that copper can regulate APP expression and further support a role for APP to function in copper homeostasis. Copper-regulated APP expression may also provide a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.

Biol. 2000; 46: 731-741PubMed Google Scholar). AD is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder in elderly people and is characterized by neuronal loss with the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The major proteinaceous component of senile plaques is a 39-42-amino acid peptide, termed amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) (3Masters C.L. Multhaup G. Simms G. Pottgiesser J. Martins R.N. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), that is proteolytically cleaved from the larger amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) (4Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A.

The APP gene is expressed in all major tissues but predominantly in the brain, where expression is primarily in neurons (13Neve R.L. Finch E.A. Dawes L.R. Neuron. 1988; 1: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although there is both developmental and cell-type specific regulation of APP, expression in the adult is mostly ubiquitous (14Salbaum J.M. Ruddle F.H. J. Exp. Zool. 1994; 269: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The regulation of the APP gene as a pathogenic factor for AD has received considerable attention. Down's syndrome patients, who have an extra copy of the APP gene, invariably exhibit early onset AD-like pathology (15Holtzman D.M. Bayney R.M. Li Y.W. Khosrovi H. Berger C.N. Epstein C.J. Mobley W.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Overexpression of APP in certain areas of the brain in AD patients also suggest that the regulation of APP might be an important factor in the neuropathology of AD (16Johnson S.A. McNeill T. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Science. 1990; 248: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These observations illustrate the importance of elucidating the mechanisms of APP gene regulation in the development of AD. The human APP promoter closely resembles that of a typical housekeeping gene and contains the consensus sequences for the binding of several transcription factors (17Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H.G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Theuns J. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2383-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, retinoic acid, and various transcription factors are among several cellular mediators that cause an increase in APP mRNA levels in neuronal and nonneuronal cells (19Lahiri D.K. Song W. Ge Y.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, thyroid hormone and interferon-γ have been reported to down-regulate APP expression (20Belandia B. Latasa M.J. Villa A. Pascual A. J. Biol.

Recently, an iron-responsive element located in the 5′-untranslated region has been implicated in the regulation of APP expression (22Rogers J.T. Randall J.D. Cahill C.M. Eder P.S. Huang X. Gunshin H. Leiter L. McPhee J. Sarang S.S. Utsuki T. Greig N.H. Lahiri D.K. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Giordano T. Gullans S.R. J. Biol.

To investigate the role of copper in APP gene regulation, we utilized a novel approach involving cultured human fibroblasts overexpressing the Menkes protein (MNK; encoded by ATP7A), a major mammalian copper translocating P-type ATPase involved in copper efflux (23Petris M.J.

Cells lacking the MNK protein show high intracellular copper levels because of the lack of active copper efflux, whereas cells transfected and overexpressing MNK have markedly reduced copper levels (25La Fontaine S.L. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Englezou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J. Howie M. Lockhart P.J. Greenough M. Brooks H. Reddel R.R. Mercer J.F. J. Biol.

We report that depletion of intracellular copper results in significant reduction of APP gene expression. In addition, APP promoter analysis suggests that putative metal regulatory elements may be involved in mediating the response to copper depletion to regulate APP gene expression. Overall, these data suggest that copper is a required co-factor for the basal regulation of the APP gene and support the increasing evidence that APP is involved in copper homeostasis as a copper detoxification/efflux protein. Cell Lines—Human skin fibroblast cells, Me32a, were isolated from a classical Menkes disease patient (26Mercer J.F. Livingston J. Hall B. Paynter J.A. Begy C. Chandrasekharappa S. Lockhart P. Grimes A. Bhave M. Siemieniak D. Glower T.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The patient carried a 4-bp deletion that resulted in a frameshift mutation and premature stop codon of the MNK gene, whose expression was undetectable by Western and Northern analysis (25La Fontaine S.L.

The SV40-immortalized human fibroblast cell line, normal human (GM2069), and human neuroblastoma cell line, human neuron (SY5Y), were used as controls. Culture Conditions—The cell lines MNK deletion and normal human were maintained in basal medium, which consisted of Eagle's basal medium (BME; Thermo Trace) (24Camakaris J. Petris M.J. Bailey L. Shen P. Lockhart P. Glover T.W. Barcroft C. Patton J. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The BME was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Thermo Trace), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.2 mm proline, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate. Vector only, MNK transfected A, and MNK transfected B cell lines were maintained in 10% BME as above with the additional supplement of 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). The cell line human neuron was maintained in basal medium, which consisted of RPMI 1640 (Thermo Trace). The RPMI 1640 was supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 0.8 mm l-glutamine, 0.4 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.02 mm uridine, 16 mm HEPES, and 0.05% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate. The basal copper concentrations of 10% BME and 20% RPMI 1640 were 0.78 (0.05 μg/ml) and 1.02 μm (0.07 μg/ml), respectively, as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer 5000 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The cells were incubated at 37 °C. Bioinformatics—The human APP gene promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession number D87875) and rhesus monkey APP gene promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF067971) were searched for copper response element (28Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Steady-state Measurement of 64Cu Accumulation—The cells were grown to near confluency in basal growth medium. The medium was replaced with BME supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum containing 5-10 μCi/ml 64Cu (as CuCl2; ARI, Lucas Heights, Australia). After incubation at 37 °C for 16, 24, and 36 h, the cells were immediately harvested to obtain the total 64Cu accumulated at the end of the time period (four 35-mm Petri-dishes containing 1 × 106 cells/time point). All of the cells were washed twice in ice-cold serum-free medium to remove any nonspecifically bound 64Cu and harvested by dissolution in 1.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA. The cell lysates were scraped and collected. 64Cu was measured in cell lysates using an LKB-Wallac Ultragamma counter. The protein concentration was estimated in each cell lysate using a Bio-Rad protein assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Total Cellular Measurement of Copper, Zinc, and Iron—The cells were grown for 4 days in basal growth medium as described above. The cells were harvested as previously described (34Camakaris J. Danks D.M. Ackland L. Cartwright E. Borger P. Cotton R.G. Biochem. Genet. 1980; 18: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and copper, zinc, and iron were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 5000 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Indirect Immunofluorescence—The cells were seeded in basal medium onto 13-mm round coverslips 48 h prior to immunofluorescence. The coverslips were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed several times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed several times in PBS, and then blocked overnight in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. All of the antibody incubations were for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Monoclonal APP antiserum was visualized using Alexa 488™-conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were washed overnight in PBS then mounted using 100 mg/ml DABCO (Sigma) in 90% glycerol. Confocal microscopy was carried out using an Olympus BX60 microscope with a 60× PlanApo lens with a 1.40 N/A. This microscope was connected to an “Optiscan F900e” laser-scanning unit with a krypton/argon ion laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm. Protein Extraction and Western Immunoblot Analysis—The cell lines were sonicated in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8 buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and COMPLETE™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 50 μg of protein extracts were fractionated on NuPage™ Bis-Tris (4-12%) gradient acrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and electroblotted overnight to nitrocellulose filters. Detection of MNK and APP protein was performed using an ECL Plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), and MultiMark® (Invitrogen) protein molecular weight standards were loaded. Purified human APP695 isoform ectodomain was loaded as a control (35Henry A. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cappai R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Total RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using a Total RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). 5-μg total RNA samples were denatured in formamide, formaldehyde, MOPS, and ethidium bromide at 65 °C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel. The gel was blotted on Hybond-N+ nitrocellulose filter and immobilized by 50 mm sodium hydroxide. Each filter was prehybridized in hybridization buffer containing 50× Denhardt's reagent, sheared Salmon sperm DNA, 0.5 m EDTA, 1 m Tris, 20% SDS, and 1 m NaPO4 for at least 2 h. The filter was hybridized with a [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probe using the Prime-a-Gene labeling System (Promega). After hybridization, the filters were washed to a stringency of 0.01% SDS, 0.1× SSC at 60 °C. APP cDNA probe corresponded to 3-kb fragment generated from human APP cDNA. Equal loading of samples was verified by rehybridizing the filter with the “housekeeping gene cDNA probe” rat GAPDH. The filter were exposed for 2 h to a PhosphorScreen (Molecular Dynamics) and scanned with a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Densitometer quantification was done with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) software for both APP and GAPDH Northern analysis. Preparation of Plasmid Constructs—The promoter constructs pRSV-βGal, pBLCAT3, pβBIV, pβPB, and pβHB were as previously described (36Song W. Lahiri D.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Song W. Lahiri D.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasmids were prepared for transfection using an EndoFree® plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient Transfection and Lysate Preparation—The cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection in basal medium. All of the cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection mixture was prepared containing 0.5 μg of pRSV-βGal and either 3 μg of pBLCAT3, pβBIV, pβPB, or pβHB/well. Prior to transfection, the medium was changed to basal medium (0.78 μm copper), copper-supplemented medium (50, 100, 250, or 500 μm Cu) or copper-chelator diamsar-treated (38Bingham M.J. Sargeson A.M. McArdle H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1400-G1407PubMed Google Scholar) medium (5, 10, or 50 μm). 48 h post-transfection the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS several times, lysed in reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science), and collected by microcentrifuge centrifugation (16,000 × g) to remove any cellular debris. The protein concentration was measured in each cell extract using a BioRad protein assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). β-Gal Assay—β-Gal activity was used to standardize transfection efficiency for subsequent CAT ELISAs. The cell extracts from transfected cells were analyzed for their β-Gal activity using a β-Gal enzyme assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, 5 μg of protein (an amount within the linear range of the assay) was assayed for 30 min at 37 °C in 2× Assay Buffer before the reaction was stopped with the addition of 1 m sodium carbonate. The absorbance was measured on a Bio-Rad 2550 EIA plate reader at 420 nm. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Promoter Assay—The cell extracts from transfected cells were analyzed for their CAT activity using a colorimetric ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 50 μg of protein (an amount within the linear range of the assay) was placed on anti-CAT coated microtiter plate modules and allowed to bind for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed thoroughly after each step. Next, a digoxigenin-labeled anti-CAT antibody was added to the samples and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A subsequent antibody, anti-digoxigenin conjugated to peroxidase, was placed in the wells for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, peroxidase substrate, ABTS (Roche Applied Science), was added, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader. CAT activity was determined from the ratio of pg CAT/milliunit of β-Gal/μg of protein. Statistical Analysis—One-way ANOVA of more than two means followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison of mean's post-test was performed for Northern analysis, 64Cu accumulation, cellular metal determination, and promoter assays using GraphPad Prism3 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software Inc.). Statistically significant was defined as p < 0.05. Intracellular Copper Levels, but Not Zinc or Iron, Are Severely Decreased in MNK transfected Fibroblasts—Immortalized human fibroblasts isolated from a Menkes disease patient (Table I), herein referred to as MNK deletion cells, and MNK deletion cells stably transfected with and hence overexpressing the MNK efflux protein (Table I), herein referred to as MNK transfected cells, represented powerful tools to investigate the hypothesis that copper levels can modulate APP gene expression. This is due to MNK deletion cells having high intracellular copper, whereas MNK transfected cells have low intracellular copper (25La Fontaine S.L. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Englezou A. Theophilos M.B.

To confirm that MNK deletion and MNK transfected fibroblast cell lines (Fig. 1A) have dramatically altered copper levels, we investigated cells for intracellular levels of copper as well as zinc and iron.Table IDescription of fibroblast cell lines and their MNK expressionNameCell lineDescriptionaFor descriptions, refer to “Experimental Procedures” for further information.MNKMNK deletionMe32aT22/2LImmortalized human fibroblast isolated from classical Menkes disease patientNone detectedVector onlypCMB77Me32aT22/2L stably transfected with empty vectorNone detectedMNK transfected AMNK A12-H9Me32aT22/2L stably transfected with MNK expression vectorOverexpressedMNK transfected BMNK C3-C1Me32aT22/2L stably transfected with MNK expression vectorOverexpressedNormal humanGM2069Immortalized normal human fibroblastWild typea For descriptions, refer to “Experimental Procedures” for further information. Open table in a new tab Intracellular copper levels were measured using two independent approaches. The first was to analyze cells for copper accumulation using the Cu radioisotope, 64Cu, under steady-state conditions. 64Cu analysis showed MNK deletion and vector only control cells maintained copper levels significantly higher than normal human fibroblast cells with an average increase of 125% (Fig. 1B). MNK transfected cells maintained copper levels significantly lower than normal human fibroblast cells with an average decrease of 82% (Fig. 1B). MNK transfected cells also maintained copper levels significantly lower than MNK deletion cells with an average decrease of 92% (Fig. 1B). The second method of analysis examined the total amount of copper present in cell pellets utilizing atomic absorption spectroscopy. This analysis showed MNK deletion and vector only control cells contained significantly elevated copper levels compared with normal human fibroblast cells with an average increase of 65% (Fig. 1C). MNK transfected cells contained significantly reduced copper levels, with an average decrease of 79%, compared with normal human fibroblast cells (Fig. 1C). MNK transfected cells also contained significantly reduced copper levels compared with MNK deletion cells with an average decrease of 87% (Fig. 1C). There was no significant difference in the zinc and iron content of these fibroblast cell lines (Fig. 1, D and E). Overall, the cellular metal analysis demonstrated that by over"

AMPK has recently emerged as an attractive novel target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes because its activation increases fatty acid oxidation and improves glucose homeostasis. Here we show that pharmacological activation of AMPK by insulin-sensitizing drugs markedly inhibits inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), a proinflammatory mediator in endotoxic shock and in chronic inflammatory states including obesity-linked diabetes. AMPK-mediated iNOS inhibition was observed in several cell types (myocytes, adipocytes, macrophages) and primarily resulted from post-transcriptional regulation of the iNOS protein. AMPK activation in vivo also blunted iNOS induction in muscle and adipose tissues of endotoxin-challenged rats. Reduction of AMPK expression by small interfering RNA reversed the inhibitory effects of AMPK activators on iNOS expression and nitric oxide production in myocytes. These results indicate that AMPK is a novel anti-inflammatory signaling pathway and thus represents a promising therapeutic target for immune-inflammatory disorders.

It is a member of a metabolite-sensing protein kinase family that acts as a fuel gauge by monitoring cellular energy levels (1Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). When AMPK “senses” decreased energy storage, it acts to switch off ATP-consuming pathways and switch on alternative pathways for ATP regeneration. AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ. In response to cellular energy depletion, as reflected by an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, AMPK is phosphorylated and activated by a still uncharacterized upstream AMPK kinase (2Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). It also can be activated allosterically by increases in the AMP/ATP and creatine/creatine-P ratios. The metabolic function of AMPK perhaps has been documented best in exercising skeletal muscle, where its activation seems to contribute to increased glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation (3Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Sakamoto K. Goodyear L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). AMPK can be activated chemically with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), which is taken up by cells and phosphorylated by adenosine kinase to form 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside, a nucleotide that mimics the effect of AMP (5Corton J.M.

More recent studies also have identified AMPK as the mediator of the metabolic effects of the adipose-derived peptidic hormones leptin and adiponectin in skeletal muscle and liver (6Minokoshi Y.

Chronic treatment of animal models of type 2 diabetes with the AMPK activator AICAR improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (9Winder W.W. Diabetes Technol.

These beneficial effects are thought to be explained mainly by the well known actions of AMPK on glucose metabolism and lipid oxidation in muscle and liver. Accordingly, the anti-diabetic drugs metformin and rosiglitazone also activate AMPK, and this is believed to contribute to their insulin-sensitizing actions in diabetic subjects (12Musi N.

However, the potential effects of AMPK activation on proinflammatory mediators of insulin resistance have not been investigated yet. Indeed, an inflammatory component also is present in obesity-linked diabetes (16Pickup J.C. Crook M.A. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 17Marette A. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as reflected by increased systemic and tissue concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and interleukin-6 in obese human subjects (18Hotamisligil G.S.

Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6193) Google Scholar, 21Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently have reported that inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), a cytokine-inducible proinflammatory mediator in several pathological conditions, is overexpressed in muscle and fat of genetic and dietary models of obesity and type 2 diabetes (22Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the iNOS gene was found to protect high fat-fed obese mice from developing insulin resistance and to significantly improve glucose tolerance (22Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A role for iNOS in mediating insulin resistance also is supported by the finding that pharmacological inhibition of iNOS reverses impaired insulin action in cultured myocytes exposed to cytokines and the endotoxin LPS (23Bedard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because an inflammatory component that includes iNOS is involved in the pathogenesis of muscle insulin resistance in obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, we asked whether AMPK activation might improve insulin action in muscle cells through inhibition of iNOS, and if so, whether AMPK is a key iNOS inhibitory pathway in other cell types where increased iNOS expression is pathogenic. Materials—AICAR was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Troglitazone and 15-deoxy PGJ2 were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Interferon-γ and TNF-α were from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ) and RD Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. 1400W was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth, PA), and Oligofectamine was from Invitrogen. ADP-Sepharose 4B beads were from Amersham Biosciences, and the Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against iNOS and eNOS and a polyclonal antibody against nNOS were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Mississauga, Canada). Polyclonal antibodies against AMPK (which recognizes both α1- and α2-AMPK), phospho-AMPK, and phospho-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). IRS-1 antibody (C-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—L6 myoblasts and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum) or α-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (20% calf serum) containing 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and differentiated into myotubes and adipocytes as described previously (23Bedard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 24Kapur S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E635-E641PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow-derived macrophages were a kind gift of Dr. M. Olivier (CHUL Research Center, Quebec, Canada). Generation and immortalization of the macrophages from mouse femurs was performed as described previously (25Forget G. Siminovitch K.A. Brochu S. Rivest S. Radzioch D. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Induction of iNOS by cytokines and/or LPS in L6 myotubes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and macrophages and the effects of AMPK-activating agents were carried out as described in the figure legends. The accumulation of nitrite in the incubation medium was used as an index of NO production. Nitrite was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (23Bedard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) and annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the 19-nucleotide (plus 2 amino acids overhanging at 5′) siRNAs were as follows: α1-AMPK, GCAUAUGCUGCAGGUAGAU; α2-AMPK, CGUCAUUGAUGAUGAGGCU; unrelated siRNA, AUUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGAC. L6 myotubes in 12-well plates were transfected 24 h prior to cytokine and LPS treatment with 0.27 μm α1- and α2-AMPK siRNAs by using the Oligofectamine reagent. Mock controls were transfected with unrelated siRNA. Animals—This study was approved by the Animal Care and Handling Committee of Laval University. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) purchased from Charles River (Montréal, Canada) were used in these studies. Rats were pretreated with a single intraperitoneal injection of AICAR (1 g/kg, BW), metformin (100 mg/kg, BW) or saline (vehicle) 30 min prior to LPS (20 mg/kg, BW, intraperitoneally) or saline treatment. Animals were sacrificed 4 h later, and hind limb muscles and white adipose tissues were removed and stored at –80 °C until further processing. Measurement of Plasma and Tissue Nitrite and Nitrate—Nitrite and nitrate levels in plasma, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue were measured by fluorometry (26Rao A.M. Dogan A. Hatcher J.F. Dempsey R.J. Brain Res. 1998; 793: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA and centrifuged for 10 min at 3200 × g to obtain plasma. Tissues were grounded in liquid nitrogen using a mortar. The tissue powder was resuspended in 5 volumes of Tris-EDTA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Tissue lysates were centrifuged at 2800 × g for 20 min, and protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the BCA protein assay. Plasma and tissue lysates then were centrifuged at 5000 × g (4 °C) overnight in an Ultrafree®-Microcentrifuge 10,000 NMWL filter unit. Nitrate was reduced to nitrite using nitrate reductase and the NADPH regenerating system as described previously (26Rao A.M. Dogan A. Hatcher J.F. Dempsey R.J. Brain Res. 1998; 793: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was measured at λex of 360 nm and λem of 450 nm. Determination of Nitric-oxide Synthase Protein Expression and Western Blot Analysis—Muscle and adipose tissue lysates (1 mg of protein) were used to purify nitric-oxide synthase enzymes using 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose resin as described previously (22Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27Kapur S. Bedard S. Marcotte B. Cote C.H. Marette A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. RNA Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated using guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction, and iNOS mRNA was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as described previously (23Bedard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 24Kapur S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E635-E641PubMed Google Scholar). PI 3-Kinase Activity—Cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-IRS-1 coupled to protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. PI 3-kinase activity was determined as described previously (22Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. The effects of the treatments were compared by an analysis of variance followed by Fisher's post hoc test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. AMPK Activators Inhibit iNOS and Reverse Insulin Resistance in Skeletal Muscle Cells—We first tested the effect of the AMPK activator AICAR on iNOS induction in L6 myocytes chronically exposed to cytokines and LPS, which is a model of chronic inflammation associated with insulin resistance (23Bedard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Kapur S. Bedard S. Marcotte B. Cote C.H. Marette A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of muscle cells with stimulated AMPK activity as reflected by increased phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr-172 (a site known to activate the enzyme (28Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar)) as well as by its ability to enhance phosphorylation of ACC, a downstream target of AMPK and a good correlate of its activation (29Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-diabetic drug metformin and the PPARγ agonists troglitazone and 15dPGJ2 also activated AMPK in these cells (Fig. 1A). Chronic exposure of L6 myocytes to cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and LPS markedly induced NO production as detected by the accumulation of the stable bioproduct nitrite in the culture medium (Fig. 1B). This effect was explained by a robust induction of iNOS mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, C and D). Neither eNOS nor nNOS is expressed in control or cytokine/LPS-treated L6 myocytes, and NO production was completely inhibited by co-incubation with the specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W (30Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Furfine E.S. Kiff R.J. Laszlo F. Whittle B.J. Knowles R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4959-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Addition of AICAR caused a dose-dependent reduction of cytokine/LPS-induced NO production, reaching a maximal 80% inhibition at 2.5 mm (Fig. 1B). Treatment with either metformin or PPARγ agonists also decreased (by 50–90%) the effect of cytokine/LPS on NO production. All AMPK activators inhibited NO production through the reduction of cellular iNOS protein levels (Fig. 1C). AMPK activators failed to change the cellular expression of desmin, the main intermediate filament protein in myocytes, here used as an internal control (data not shown). Reduction of iNOS protein expression was not linked to suppression of iNOS transcription because iNOS mRNA levels were not affected by AICAR or the anti-diabetic drugs metformin and troglitazone (Fig. 1D). However, high concentrations of 15dPGJ2 did reduce iNOS mRNA levels (see 25 μm 15dPGJ2 in Fig. 1D). In additional studies, we also tested whether AICAR could inhibit iNOS-mediated NO production either through reduction in substrate (l-arginine) uptake or by direct inhibition of iNOS enzymatic activity. l-Arginine uptake by muscle cells was not found to be affected by AICAR (2.5 mm) (1297 ± 209 versus 1369 ± 90 pmol/min/mg for control and AICAR-treated cells, respectively). Furthermore, AICAR did not affect iNOS subunit dimerization and failed to reduce iNOS catalytic activity in cytokine/LPS-treated myocytes, as assessed by the formation of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]arginine (see Figs. A and B in supplemental material). It has been reported that AICAR increases adenosine release by ischemic heart tissue (31Gruber H.E. Hoffer M.E. McAllister D.R. Laikind P.K. Lane T.A. Schmid-Schoenbein G.W. Engler R.L. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1400-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and this could contribute to iNOS inhibition. However, adenosine per se failed to affect iNOS activity in L6 myocytes, and the inhibitory effect of AICAR on NO production was not decreased by blocking adenosine receptors with 8-(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline (see Figs. C and D in supplemental material), ruling out any role for adenosine release in AMPK-dependent iNOS inhibition. To test whether AMPK-induced iNOS inhibition reverses the insulin resistance-promoting effects of cytokine/LPS, next we measured the effects of AMPK activators on insulin action in L6 myocytes. We chose to assess insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase, an essential mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin, rather than glucose uptake because the latter is increased by AMPK through insulin-independent pathways. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, cytokines and LPS treatment caused insulin resistance as revealed by a 60% reduction in the ability of insulin to stimulate IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity as compared with control cells. However, addition of either AICAR, metformin, or troglitazone to cytokine/LPS-treated cells fully restored insulin action on PI 3-kinase. AMPK activating agents failed to increase PI 3-kinase in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2A). The restoration of insulin action by AMPK-activating agents was similar to that obtained with the specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W (Fig. 2B). AMPK Activators Inhibit iNOS in Adipocytes and Macrophages—Next we tested whether AMPK activation inhibits iNOS in other cell types. We have reported that adipose tissue is a major site of iNOS expression in endotoxemia and that chronic treatment of adipocytes with cytokines and endotoxins reproduces this inflammatory response in vitro (24Kapur S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E635-E641PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, addition of AICAR or anti-diabetic drugs to cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes activated AMPK as reflected by enhanced ACC phosphorylation. Activation of AMPK reduced cytokine/LPS-mediated NO production (Fig. 3B) and cellular iNOS protein content (Fig. 3C) but not iNOS mRNA levels (Fig. 3D). Monocytes and macrophages are major sites of iNOS expression, particularly in infectious or inflammatory diseases. Sustained production of NO endows macrophages with cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against several pathogens and tumor cells, but it also can exert deleterious proinflammatory effects on host cells (32MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK by AICAR and metformin inhibited iNOS induction upon exposure of macrophages to interferon-γ (Fig. 3, E and F). The PPARγ ligand troglitazone also increased AMPK and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of NO production in these cells (Fig. 3, E and F). The inhibitory effects of AMPK activators also were linked to reduction in iNOS protein induction through a post-transcriptional mechanism (Fig. 3, G and H). However, at higher concentrations (> 10 μm) of troglitazone, a reduction in iNOS mRNA levels was also observed. Activation of AMPK by in Vivo Injection of AICAR and Metformin Inhibits iNOS in Muscle and Adipose Tissues of LPS-treated Rats—To test whether AMPK also blunts iNOS induction in vivo, we assessed the ability of AICAR and metformin to inhibit iNOS in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of rats injected with the bacterial endotoxin LPS, a model of septic shock associated with insulin resistance (27Kapur S. Bedard S. Marcotte B. Cote C.H. Marette A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of LPS-challenged rats with AICAR or metformin increased ACC phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and significantly reduced NO production in the plasma as well as in muscle (gastrocnemius and tibialis) and adipose tissues (Fig 4B). AICAR and metformin treatments prevented induction of iNOS protein expression in muscle and fat tissues of septic rats (Fig. 4C). In marked contrast, neither eNOS nor nNOSμ enzymes were affected by LPS or AMPK activators in muscle and fat (nNOSμ was not detectable in fat), highlighting the isoform-specific effect of AMPK on iNOS protein. As observed for cell lines, the inhibitory effects of AMPK activators on iNOS-mediated NO production was explained by post-transcriptional mechanisms because LPS-induced iNOS mRNA expression was not affected by AICAR or metformin treatments (Fig. 4D). However, one notable exception is metformin, which caused a small but reproducible reduction in iNOS mRNA only in adipose tissue. RNA Interference-mediated Depletion of α-AMPK Reverses the Inhibitory Effects of AMPK Activators on iNOS Protein and NO Production—To further establish whether AICAR and anti-diabetic drugs inhibit iNOS through AMPK activation, we next used RNA interference technology to “knock down” endogenous AMPK α-subunits. Immunoblotting experiments confirmed that transfection of siRNA specific for the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits reduced α-AMPK expression to 53 ± 5% of that of cells mock transfected with unrelated siRNA (Fig. 5A). Moreover, combined siRNA treatment resulted in a comparable inhibition of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation by AMPK activators (Fig. 5A). In AMPK-depleted myocytes, the ability of AICAR, metformin, and troglitazone to inhibit cytokine/LPS-induced NO production and iNOS protein expression was reduced significantly as compared with cells treated with unrelated siRNA (Fig. 5B). These results confirm that these agents blunt iNOS expression and NO production at least in part through activation of AMPK. Elucidation of the multiple roles of NO in health and disease states has uncovered many areas where manipulation of NO production would be of therapeutic benefit. Thus, whereas focal iNOS induction and NO production is an important anti-infectious and anti-tumor mechanism of innate immunity (33Bogdan C. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), high amounts of iNOS-derived NO also can lead to self-tissue destruction in autoimmune diseases, allograft rejection, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic heart failure, and other disorders accompanied by excessive activation of the immune system (see Refs. 34Nathan C. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 35Parkinson J.F. Mitrovic B. Merrill J.E. J. Mol.

De Meyer G.R. Bosmans J.M. Bult H. Beelaerts W.J. Vrints C.J. Herman A.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 744-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Behr-Roussel D. Rupin A. Simonet S.

Investig. 1997; 100: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) in which an inflammatory condition also is believed to play a pathogenic role. Such wide implication has produced an intense interest in understanding the modulation of iNOS expression and activity, with the goal of finding novel mechanisms of control of this high output NO pathway. For these reasons, the design of selective iNOS inhibitors and the identification of iNOS inhibitory pathways have received much attention in recent years. In the present study, we show for the first time that pharmacological activation of AMPK by AICAR and two classes of anti-diabetic drugs inhibit iNOS induction in cells and tissues exposed to inflammatory mediators. Gene silencing experiments confirmed that AMPK-activating agents blunt iNOS-mediated NO production at least in part via activation of AMPK. Indeed, depletion of α-AMPK in L6 myocytes by using the combination of α1- and α2-AMPK siRNA species led to a significant loss in the ability of AICAR, metformin, and troglitazone to reduce cytokine/LPS-induced iNOS protein expression and NO production. Metformin and the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone activate AMPK, and this is believed to contribute to their insulin-sensitizing actions in diabetic subjects (12Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Nygren J.

Disord. 2002; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These anti-diabetic effects mainly have been attributed to the lipid- and glucose-related metabolic effects of AMPK activation. However, our data strongly suggest that inhibition of iNOS induction and reduced NO formation represent a novel mechanism by which AMPK improves insulin action in muscle. Indeed, we show here that AMPK activation by several drugs reduces iNOS induction in L6 myocytes chronically exposed to cytokines and LPS, an in vitro model of insulin resistance for glucose transport (23Bedard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also found that iNOS-mediated impairment in insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation can be reversed by AMPK activators. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of AMPK activation on iNOS was confirmed in vivo in a model of septic shock associated with insulin resistance (27Kapur S. Bedard S. Marcotte B. Cote C.H. Marette A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to test whether long term AMPK activation also can prevent or reduce iNOS induction in lower grade but chronic inflammatory disorders associated with insulin resistance such as atherosclerosis and obesity-linked diabetes. AMPK activation also suppressed iNOS protein expression and NO production in cytokine/LPS-treated adipocytes and in adipose tissue of LPS-challenged rats. Whereas the precise role of iNOS-derived NO in adipose cells still is not fully understood, it is thought to be involved in the modulation of lipid metabolism in endotoxemia (24Kapur S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E635-E641PubMed Google Scholar) and may be a paracrine mediator of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in obesity-linked diabetes (22Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK in macrophages, an important site of iNOS expression, also caused inhibition of interferon-γ-induced NO production. The latter finding is of important clinical relevance because macrophage/monocyte iNOS induction has been implicated in the pathogenesis or promotion of several inflammatory/immune disorders such as septic and hemorrhagic shock (42Angele M.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18702-18708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It will be important to dissect out the molecular mechanisms by which AMPK activators cause iNOS inhibition. It is well established that inflammatory cytokines and LPS trigger iNOS transcription through a complex network of intracellular pathways including NF-κB, Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (50Blanchette J. Jaramillo M. Olivier M. Immunology. 2003; 108: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 51Adams V. Nehrhoff B. Spate U. Linke A. Schulze P.C. Baur A. Gielen S. Hambrecht R. Schuler G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARγ ligands rosiglitazone and 15dPGJ2 were previously shown to reduce iNOS expression in several cell types (49Kwon G. Xu G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18702-18708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 52Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) through transcriptional repression (52Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were expecting that PPARγ-dependent activation of AMPK would inhibit iNOS by reducing the transcription of iNOS. Surprisingly, we found that all AMPK activating agents, including the PPARγ agonists troglitazone and 15dPGJ2, decreased iNOS protein but barely affected mRNA expression. Only when higher concentrations of troglitazone and 15dPGJ2 were used did we observe a reduction in iNOS transcript levels. It should be noted that recent studies have shown that inhibition of iNOS transcription by rosiglitazone may result from activation of both PPARγ and PPARδ (53Welch J.S. Ricote M. Akiyama T.E. Gonzalez F.J. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, high concentrations of rosiglitazone inhibit iNOS in PPARγ–/– macrophages at least in part by activating PPARδ. Troglitazone is 100-fold less potent than rosiglitazone for PPARγ, but its affinity for PPARδ has not been established. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that its inhibitory action on iNOS may be mediated in part through PPARδ. Studies of cells lacking both PPARγ and PPARδ will be needed to answer this important issue. The inhibitory effects of AMPK activators on NO production were highly correlated with the reduction in iNOS protein content, suggesting that AMPK modulates iNOS protein turnover. In this regard, recent reports suggest that AMPK switches off protein synthesis either through suppression of the mTOR-p70S6 kinase pathway (54Bolster D.R. Crozier S.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23977-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) or by direct activation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation and inactivation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (55Horman S. Browne G. Krause U. Patel J. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A. Hue L. Proud C. Rider M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1419-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It also is possible that AMPK reduces iNOS protein content by promoting its ubiquitination, a process required for targeting iNOS through the proteasome proteolysis pathway (56Kolodziejski P.J. Musial A. Koo J.S. Eissa N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12315-12320Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitination also has been reported to be involved in the proteolytic degradation of nNOS (57Bender A.T. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17407-17411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) whereas the inhibitory effects of AMPK on NO production appear to be specific for the iNOS isoform. Indeed, neither nNOS nor eNOS proteins were affected by AICAR or metformin treatments in muscle and adipose tissue of LPS-challenged rats, and AMPK activators blunted LPS-induced NO production but did not reduce basal NO formation by constitutive nitric-oxide synthase enzymes. This argues for inhibition of protein synthesis rather than ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation as the principal mechanism by which AMPK regulates iNOS protein turnover. The identification of AMPK as a potent inhibitory pathway for iNOS may provide a molecular basis for the recent observations that exercise training, which increases AMPK expression (9Winder W.W. Diabetes Technol. Ther. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), improved exercise capacity in association with reduced skeletal muscle iNOS expression in patients with chronic heart failure (37Gielen S. Adams V. Mobius-Winkler S. Linke A. Erbs S. Yu J. Kempf W. Schubert A. Schuler G. Hambrecht R. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 42: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Our data further suggest that AMPK represents a promising therapeutic target for immune-inflammatory disorders in which iNOS induction is pathogenic but not critical for health (i.e. non-infectious diseases). These include metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis and obesity-linked diabetes. However, even for those inflammatory conditions, caution must be exerted because iNOS also can play more subtle yet important physiological roles with potential adverse consequences attendant on its inhibition in diseased states. For example, iNOS plays a protective role in the development of transplant arteriosclerosis (58Qian Z. Gelzer-Bell R. Yang S.X. Cao W. Ohnishi T. Wasowska B.A. Hruban R.H. Rodriguez E.R. Baldwin III, W.M. Lowenstein C.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2369-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and also is critical for optimal wound healing (59Yamasaki K. Edington H.D. McClosky C. Tzeng E. Lizonova A. Kovesdi I. Steed D.L. Billiar T.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), which calls into question the use of iNOS inhibitory agents to treat diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. Bearing these cautions in mind, it is crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which AMPK inhibits iNOS because this may help design novel strategies for an effective and tissue-specific inhibition of iNOS in inflammatory settings while limiting adverse physiological consequences.

Dynein moves cargo toward the cell center, and kinesin moves cargo toward the cell periphery. There is growing evidence that bi-directional motility is regulated in the cell, potentially through direct interactions between oppositely oriented motors. We have identified a direct interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin I. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity chromatography, we demonstrate that the intermediate chain of dynein binds to kinesin light chains 1 and 2. The interaction is both direct and specific. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate an interaction between endogenous proteins in rat brain cytosol. Double-label immunocytochemistry reveals a partial co-localization of vesicle-associated motor proteins. Together these observations suggest that soluble motors can interact, potentially allowing kinesin I to actively localize dynein to cellular sites of function.

There is also a vesicle population with both dynein and kinesin I bound that may be capable of bi-directional motility along cellular microtubules. Intracellular transport along microtubules is driven by the motors kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. Kinesin I is a plus end-directed motor, consisting of two heavy chains and two light chains (1Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein is a minus end-directed motor, composed of two globular heads each formed from a single dynein heavy chain and a base formed from intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains (1Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Google Scholar). The accessory complex dynactin binds to dynein and may be required to increase the processivity of dynein-driven movement (2Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Google Scholar, 3King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Google Scholar). In the cell, kinesin powers anterograde transport, moving vesicles and organelles toward the cell periphery. Cytoplasmic dynein drives the retrograde transport of organelles and proteins toward microtubule minus ends. In addition to its role in increasing the processivity of dynein-driven motility, dynactin has been shown to mediate interactions of cytoplasmic dynein with some of its intracellular cargos (4Holleran E.A.

Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 173-183Google Scholar). The mechanisms of cargo coupling to kinesin are yet to be fully understood, but at least some cargos have been shown to bind directly to kinesin light chains (6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 25-28Google Scholar). Although in vitro motility assays clearly indicate that kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein can function independently to produce motility in opposite directions along microtubules, multiple studies have suggested that the activities of these two motors are coordinately coupled in the cell. This coordination may be most clear in axonal transport. Studies in extruded squid axoplasm have indicated that the specific inhibition of either kinesin (7Brady S.T. Pfister K.K Bloom G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1061-1065Google Scholar, 8Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 675-689Google Scholar) or dynein/dynactin (9Waterman-Storer C.M. Kuznetsov S.A. Karki S. Tabb J.S. Weiss D.G. Langford G.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12180-12185Google Scholar) results in a bidirectional block in the transport of vesicles along microtubules. Interdependence of anterograde and retrograde motors has also been noted genetically. Martin et al. (10Martin A.A. Iyaduri S.J. Gassman A. Gindhart J.G. Hays T.S. Saxton W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3717-3728Google Scholar) identified dominant genetic interactions between the kinesin, cytoplasmic dynein, and dynactin genes in Drosophila. Mutations in either motor result in an inhibition of axonal transport and the accumulation of organelles in axonal swellings that stain for markers of both anterograde and retrograde motility. Here we provide biochemical evidence for a direct interaction between conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, mediated by an interaction between dynein intermediate chain (DIC) 1The abbreviations used are: DIC, dynein intermediate chain; KLC, kinesin light chain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; MgAMP-PNP, Mg-5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate; KHC, kinesin heavy chain. and kinesin light chains (KLCs). Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that this interaction is physiologically relevant. Although the interaction is most robust between soluble motors, co-localization studies indicate that some vesicles have both motors bound, allowing for bi-directional motility. The results reported here provide further evidence for a key role of KLCs in mediating interactions between motors and cargo in the cell and suggest that cytoplasmic dynein may represent one of the cellular cargos of kinesin I. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Screen—We used the LexA yeast two-hybrid system to screen an oligo(T)-primed human fetal brain library (Stratagene) for proteins interacting with DIC. The majority of clones isolated were found to encode p150Glued, so we further screened positives by Southern blot to identify novel clones, one of which was identified by data base searching as encoding a TPR protein. Binding and domain mapping studies between kinesin and dynein were performed by subcloning full-length or partial sequences, as noted, of DIC, KLC1, and KLC2 into either the pB42Ad or pJK202 vectors (Stratagene) and scoring for growth on medium lacking adenine in comparison with the appropriate empty vector, as previously described (4Holleran E.A. Ligon L.A. Tokito M.K. Stankewich M.K. Morrow J.S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36598-36605Google Scholar). Affinity Chromatography and Immunoprecipitations—Mouse cDNA clones encoding kinesin light chains 1 and 2 were used to generate GST fusion constructs, which were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified (4Holleran E.A. Ligon L.A. Tokito M.K. Stankewich M.K. Morrow J.S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36598-36605Google Scholar). Purified recombinant DIC or rat brain cytosolic extracts were fractionated over affinity columns generated from either GST fusion proteins or GST alone bound to glutathione-Sepharose, followed by elution of bound proteins with glutathione (4Holleran E.A. Ligon L.A. Tokito M.K. Stankewich M.K. Morrow J.S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36598-36605Google Scholar). The binding of kinesin to DIC was examined by fractionating either purified recombinant KLCs, in vitro translated truncation constructs, or rat brain cytosol over affinity columns generated from either purified recombinant DIC or BSA covalently linked to a Sepharose matrix, followed by elution of bound proteins with 1 m NaCl (2Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with antibodies to: kinesin heavy chain (Chemicon monoclonal antibodies 1613 and 1614), KLCs 1 and 2 (Chemicon monoclonal antibodies 1616 and 1617 and monoclonal antibody 63-90 (generously provided by Dr. Scott Brady of the University of Illinois at Chicago), cytoplasmic dynein (monoclonal antibody MAB1618 to DIC from Chemicon, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies UP1467 and UP1468 to DIC generated in our laboratory, and polyclonal antibodies to heavy chain and the Tctex-1 light chain generously provided by Drs. Richard Vallee of Columbia University and Stephen King of the University of Connecticut), and dynactin (affinity-purified polyclonal antibody UP235 to p150Glued generated in our laboratory). Immunoprecipitations were performed from rat brain cytosol (the supernatant from a 100,000 × g centrifugation of rat brain homogenate) in 50 mm PIPES, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0, in the absence or the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Igepal. Immunoprecipitations were also performed from the 100,000 × g pellet resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, with 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Igepal. Immunoprecipitates were washed eight times in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl with 1% Triton X-100 (4Holleran E.A. Ligon L.A. Tokito M.K. Stankewich M.K. Morrow J.S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36598-36605Google Scholar). Control immunoprecipitations were performed in parallel with protein A beads alone. Further purification of rat brain vesicles was performed by fractionating the membranes from the 100,000 × g pellet by flotation upward though a sucrose step gradient, as described (4Holleran E.A. Ligon L.A. Tokito M.K. Stankewich M.K. Morrow J.S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36598-36605Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were retained in the bottom layer of 2 m sucrose, and the vesicles were isolated from the 1.5/0.6 m sucrose interface. The vesicles were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for immunoprecipitation experiments. The vesicles purified by flotation were incubated with microtubules polymerized from purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton) in the absence or presence of 5 mm MgATP or 10 mm MgAMP-PNP and then centrifuged through a cushion of 40% sucrose at 8,000 × g. Gel samples made from the supernatant and the pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Immunocytochemistry and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin were localized in cultured PtK2, Rat2, and Cos7 cells by immunocytochemistry (11Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Google Scholar), using all the antibodies to kinesin and dynein described above in all possible combinations. The cells were counterstained with antibodies to tubulin (clone DM1A from Sigma or YL1/2 from Serotec) and visualized with Alexa 350-, 488-, and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The vesicles purified by flotation were bound to taxol-stabilized microtubules, fixed with glutaraldehyde, pelleted onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (12Ligon L.A. Shelly S.S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1405-1417Google Scholar), and processed for immunocytochemistry with antibodies to kinesin, dynein, and tubulin. The images were acquired on a Leica DMIRBE microscope with a 63× or 100× Planapo objective using OpenLab software (Improvision) and an Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with DIC and isolated a clone encoding TPR1, a human protein with three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). The TPR motif is a 34-residue degenerate sequence that forms two antiparallel α-helices; tandem arrays of TPRs form an amphipathic channel that mediates protein-protein interactions (13Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Google Scholar). The function of TPR1 is not yet known; therefore, the significance of this interaction is not clear. However, the demonstration of an interaction between DIC and a TPR protein, coupled with previous observations of functional and genetic interactions between dynein and kinesin, led us to test for an interaction between DIC and kinesin light chains. KLC1 and KLC2 each have six TPR motifs that are involved in motorcargo interactions (6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 25-28Google Scholar). KLC1 is a 61-kDa protein primarily expressed in neuronal tissues, and KLC2 is a 67-kDa protein that is more ubiquitously expressed (14Rahman A. Friedman D.S. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15395-15403Google Scholar). We first tested for interactions between DIC and the kinesin light chains using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Both KLC1 and KLC2 were observed to interact with DIC in this assay, but the interaction between DIC and KLC2 was qualitatively more robust (Fig. 1A). To further investigate the interaction, we generated GST-KLC1 and GST-KLC2 fusion proteins and used affinity chromatography to probe for the binding of DIC. Recombinant DIC bound to both the KLC1 and KLC2 affinity columns but not the control column (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that the dynein intermediate chain can bind directly to kinesin light chains 1 and 2. In the reciprocal experiment, KLC2 bound to the DIC column and not to a control BSA column. In contrast, KLC1 did not bind significantly to the DIC column (data not shown). This observation supports the qualitative analysis of the yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting that KLC2 binds more strongly to DIC than does KLC1. We mapped the binding site for KLCs within the dynein intermediate chain polypeptide using the yeast two-hybrid assay to test constructs spanning residues 1-120, 1-283, 120-283, and 283-644 of DIC (Fig. 1D). No significant interaction was observed between KLC1 or KLC2 and the DIC fragment 283-644, indicating that the association between these polypeptides does not involve the C-terminal WD40 repeat region of DIC. The DIC constructs spanning residues 1-283 or 120-283 were consistently most positive in this assay, suggesting that the primary KLC-binding site in dynein spans residues 120-283. Residues 1-120 of DIC did not interact significantly with KLC1 but did demonstrate consistent interactions with KLC2, suggesting that there might be a secondary site of association between dynein and KLC2 that may explain the apparently higher affinity of DIC for this isoform. The inverse experiment was also performed to map the binding site for dynein within the KLC polypeptides. Affinity chromatography experiments revealed that the C-terminal TPR repeat domain of KLC2 bound significantly to a DIC affinity column and not to a BSA control column (Fig. 1E). However, we also noted binding of the N-terminal domain of KLC2 to a DIC column but not to a BSA control column (Fig. 1E). A similar result was observed with KLC1. These observations suggest that the interaction of DIC with kinesin light chains is not limited to the TPR motifs of the light chains but also involves determinants in the N terminus. These in vitro binding studies with purified proteins indicate that DIC can bind directly to kinesin light chains. To test whether these interactions occur with endogenous proteins, we loaded a rat brain cytosolic extract onto a DIC affinity column. Although both KLC1 and KLC2 were present in the cytosolic extract, only KLC2 was retained on the DIC affinity column (Fig. 2A). No significant binding of either KLC1 or KLC2 to a BSA control column was observed. Kinesin heavy chain was also specifically retained by the DIC affinity column (Fig. 2A), indicating that intact kinesin interacts with DIC. We then performed the reciprocal experiment and fractionated rat brain cytosolic extract over GST-KLC1, GST-KLC2, or GST control columns. Dynein intermediate chain, dynein heavy chain, and a dynein light chain (Tctex-1) were all specifically retained by both the KLC1 and KLC2 columns but not by the control GST column (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the intact dynein complex interacts with kinesin light chains. Dynactin was also retained on both the KLC1 and KLC2 columns (Fig. 2C); however, dynactin binds to dynein (2Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Google Scholar), and thus the association with kinesin may be indirect. These experiments indicate that the interaction between kinesin and dynein is both direct, because binding is observed between purified recombinant proteins, and specific, because dynein is specifically retained from brain cytosol by a KLC affinity column, and kinesin is specifically retained on a DIC affinity column. To test the physiological relevance of the association, we looked for the co-immunoprecipitation of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin from rat brain cytosol. We observed that a fraction of cytoplasmic dynein was co-precipitated using two different monoclonal antibodies to KHC (Fig. 3A and data not shown). We also observed the co-immunoprecipitation of dynein and kinesin from cytosol using two independent monoclonal antibodies to KLC (Fig. 3B, left panel, and data not shown). Most of the dynein did not co-precipitate with kinesin, indicating that only a fraction of the total cytosolic pools of the motors are associated under these conditions. We observed only a very limited co-immunoprecipitation of dynactin, not significantly above background (Fig. 3B). There are significant pools of both soluble and vesicle-associated kinesin and dynein in the cell. Therefore, we probed for an interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin in a vesicle-enriched fraction from rat brain. As shown in Fig. 3B, immunoprecipitation of kinesin from membrane-enriched fractions using a monoclonal antibody to KLC led to the robust co-immunoprecipitation of kinesin heavy and light chains as expected (Fig. 3B, right panel). In contrast, neither dynein nor dynactin was consistently observed to co-immunoprecipitate with kinesin from membrane-enriched fractions. Control experiments indicate that the co-immunoprecipitation of dynein and kinesin from the soluble fraction was not disrupted by the low levels of detergent required to solubilize membrane-associated proteins from the vesicular fraction. We further purified membrane fractions by flotation upward through a sucrose step gradient, and immunoprecipitations were performed using monoclonal antibodies to either kinesin heavy chain or light chain. We did not observe significant co-immunoprecipitation of dynein from these fractions (Fig. 3C and data not shown). These immunoprecipitation data indicate that the interaction between dynein and kinesin occurs in the cell. This interaction may be more robust between soluble rather than vesicle-associated motor proteins or alternatively may be disrupted during the solubilization of vesicles prior to immunoprecipitation. To follow up on these biochemical observations, we performed immunocytochemistry in several epithelial and fibroblast cell lines using a battery of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to dynein and kinesin. Both motors are densely distributed in the perinuclear region, and therefore the true extent of co-localization is difficult to assess in this part of the cell. At the cell periphery, where individual organelles and vesicles can more readily be discerned, we saw partial co-localization of the two motor proteins to vesicular puncta (Fig. 4, double arrows). However, many of the vesicles and organelles appeared to be predominantly labeled with either kinesin (arrowhead) or dynein (arrow) antibodies, similar to previous observations with a more limited set of antibodies (16Lin S.X. Pfister K.K. Collins C.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 299-312Google Scholar). Interestingly, we often noted rows of these singly labeled vesicles arrayed along microtubules (Fig. 4, inset A). We also observed partial co-localization of the two motors at points of cell-cell contact in epithelial cells (Fig. 4, inset B). Dynein is localized to adherens junctions in epithelial cells (11Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Google Scholar); here, we see kinesin puncta decorating these dynein patches. This localization of kinesin to sites of cell-cell contact may reflect a role for the motor in the biogenesis of cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts (17Mary S. Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Travo P Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouveiere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 285-301Google Scholar). To further examine the interaction of vesicle-associated dynein and kinesin, we incubated vesicles with microtubules in the absence or presence of either MgATP or MgAMP-PNP. We isolated the microtubule-bound vesicles by sedimentation and analyzed the results by both immunoblot and immunofluorescence. Both dynein and kinesin co-sedimented with microtubules when the vesicular fractions were incubated with microtubules. The degree of co-sedimentation was substantially reduced in the presence of ATP, indicating that the observed linkages were motor-dependent. Conversely, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP increased the amount of motors that co-pelleted with microtubules in this assay (Fig. 5A). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that many dispersed vesicles were clearly stained with antibodies to either dynein or kinesin (Fig. 5B). However, approximately one-third of the vesicles were labeled with antibodies to both motors (Fig. 5B, double arrows). Dynein-bound and kinesin-bound vesicles, as well as vesicles with both motors bound were all observed to associate with microtubules. Association of vesicles with microtubules was more pronounced in the presence of AMP-PNP, and the addition of MgATP induced significant dissociation. These localization studies are consistent with results from immunocytochemistry, indicating that although the most robust association between dynein and kinesin occurs in the soluble pool of motors, there is a population of vesicles with both motors bound. Together, these observations identify a direct interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, mediated by kinesin light chains. Although light chains may not be necessary for all kinesin-cargo interactions, some motor-cargo interactions appear to be mediated by direct binding to KLCs (18Gyoeva F.K. Bybikova E.M Minin A.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2047-2054Google Scholar, 19Khodjakov A. Lizunova E.M. Minin A.A. Koonce M.P. Gyoeva F.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 333-343Google Scholar), and the TPR motifs of KLCs have been shown to interact with vesicular proteins such as amyloid precursor protein and components of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway (Ref. 20Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 25-28Google Scholar). Our results suggest that kinesin I may also interact with a novel cargo, the motor cytoplasmic dynein, via KLCs. Although both KLCs can bind to DIC, the most pronounced interaction was between KLC2 and DIC. Although the differential roles of KLC1 and KLC2 have yet to be fully established, several studies have suggested that KLCs are involved in determining the specificity of kinesin-cargo interactions in the cell. There are two possible models for the role of these direct interactions between plus and minus end-directed motor complexes. The first is that the interaction serves a transport role. The most robust interaction between dynein and kinesin was observed in the soluble pools of these motors, suggesting that one motor serves as a cargo for the other. Kinesin may be required to transport dynein to the periphery of the cell, the end of the axon, or to the plus end of the microtubule. When axonal transport is blocked by ligature, kinesin accumulates proximally, and dynein accumulates both proximally and distally, consistent with the known directionalities of the motors, as well as with the fact that dynein must be transported down the axon prior to initiating active transport back to the cell body (22Hirokawa N. Sato-Yoshitake R. Kobayashi N. Pfister K.K. Bloom G.S. Brady S.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 295-302Google Scholar, 23Hirokawa N. Sato-Yoshitake R. Yoshida T. Kawashima T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1027-1037Google Scholar). Further, dynein was observed to accumulate in large aggregates in axons in kinesin light chain mutants in Drosophila (24Gindhart Jr., J.G. Desai C.J. Beuhausen S. Zinn K. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 443-454Google Scholar). Kinesin-mediated transport of dynein may also explain the kinesin dependence of the robust localization of dynein to microtubule plus ends observed in Aspergillus (25Zhang J. Li S. Fischer R. Xiang X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1479-1488Google Scholar), although the lack of kinesin lights chains in this species suggests that distinct interaction mechanisms may be involved. However, we also noted some co-localization of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin to vesicles, suggesting that there may be cargo-associated motor platforms that coordinate bi-directional organelle motility. The direct interaction between kinesin I and cytoplasmic dynein that we have described may thus be similar to the observation that kinesin II can bind to dynactin through its nonmotor subunit KAP, leading to the hypothesis that dynactin may coordinate the bi-directional motility of melanosomes (21Deacon S.W. Serpinskaya A.S. Vaughan P.S. Lopez Franarraga M. Vernos I. Vaughan K.T. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 291-293Google Scholar). Although kinesins I and II are distinct cellular motors, it is interesting that in both cases specific interactions with the minus end-directed motor dynein have been observed, in one case via a direct interaction with dynein (this study) and in the other case via an interaction with dynactin (21Deacon S.W. Serpinskaya A.S. Vaughan P.S. Lopez Franarraga M. Vernos I. Vaughan K.T. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 291-293Google Scholar). The interaction we have observed between kinesin I and dynein may also have a regulatory role. Kinesin light chains have been reported to affect kinesin motor function, stabilizing an inactive form of the motor in which the tail of kinesin folds back and inhibits the motor domain in the head (26Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Google Scholar). Binding of light chains to cargo may induce a conformational change that releases this inhibition. It will be of interest to determine whether the binding of dynein to the kinesin light chain provides a similar release from inhibition. The binding of kinesin to dynein may also have some regulatory effect on dynein motor function. Such a model would provide for a carefully regulated interaction between oppositely oriented motors that would allow for the efficient transport of cytoplasmic dynein down the axon in its inactive state. Activation of dynein at the axon terminus might induce dissociation from kinesin, freeing dynein to catalyze the motility of cargo back to the cell body. Together the direct coupling of the motors would allow for the efficient localization of dynein to its site of function, which is an important problem in cells with axonal projections that can reach a meter in length. The demonstration of biochemical interactions between oppositely oriented microtubule-based motors provides a mechanistic explanation for their observed interdependency and provides testable hypotheses for further investigations.

Here we report a mechanism of NO-induced transcriptional up-regulation of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes and protective proteins and their role in counteracting NO-induced apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells. Promoter analysis using reporter assays identified the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the promoter region of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) and other detoxifying enzyme genes as responsible for NO-mediated gene induction. The transcription factors NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and small maf proteins were detected in NO-induced nuclear protein-ARE complexes. Nrf2 augmented NO-induced, ARE-dependent gene expression, which was blocked by dominant-negative Nrf2 (DN-Nrf2) lacking the transcriptional activation domain. Consistent with these results, Nrf2 was localized in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells, and NO triggered its rapid nuclear accumulation. Neuroblastoma cells were stably transfected with DN-Nrf2, which repressed both the expression of protective genes and their induction by NO. These DN-Nrf2 cells exhibited reduced NQO1 enzymatic activity and were sensitized to NO-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained when Nrf2 expression was blocked by RNA interference. Conversely, stable cells expressing higher levels of Nrf2 protein had elevated NQO1 activity and were protected from NO. Finally, NO-mediated ARE-dependent gene induction occurred well before apoptosis as judged by caspase activation. These results together suggest that NO signals the transcriptional up-regulation of NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme and protective genes through Nrf2 via the ARE to counteract NO-induced apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells.

Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). NO is a signaling molecule involved in a variety of physiological functions such as vasodilation, fertilization, differentiation, inflammation, and apoptosis (2Hemish J. Nakaya N. Mittal V. Enikolopov G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42321-42329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Bogdan C. J. Exp.

The precise physiological effect of NO essentially depends on the available concentration of NO and the cell type (2Hemish J. Nakaya N. Mittal V. Enikolopov G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42321-42329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Bogdan C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Moncada S.

Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). NO typically activates soluble guanylyl cyclase in cells to catalyze the conversion of GTP to cGMP that in turn activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase and other kinases, which accounts for many of the normal physiological functions elicited by NO (5Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). Strangely, NO influences cell viability either by inducing cell death or by protecting cells against various apoptotic insults. A predominant view is that excessive NO exerts cytotoxic effects in diverse cell types by reacting with superoxide and thereby generating the highly reactive free radical peroxynitrite, which causes nonspecific DNA, protein, and lipid damage (6Brune B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Such damage also triggers downstream signaling pathways and gene expression, which might either elicit cellular repair or apoptosis (7Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). NO is known to regulate gene expression by modulating the activation of transcription factors or by mediating the stability of mRNA (2Hemish J. Nakaya N. Mittal V. Enikolopov G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42321-42329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The role of NO in modulating the function of transcription factors AP1, EGR-1, NF-κB, HIF1, and VDR/RXR is documented (8Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Berendji D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Carlberg C. Kroncke K.D. Mol.

The pro-apoptotic activity of NO is largely mediated via cytochrome c release, loss of mitochondrial potential, and the activation of caspases (13Uehara T. Kikuchi Y. Nomura Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Feng Z.W. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the protective pathway is not clearly understood. It has been proposed that NO can block apoptosis induced by various agents by inhibiting the activation of caspases (16Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Kim S.S. Han J.A. Yoo Y.M. Kim K.M. Lee G.H. Yun H.Y. Green A. Li J.R. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by activating anti-apoptotic/protective proteins such as Bcl-xL (17Okada S. Zhang H. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2590-2596PubMed Google Scholar), cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) (18Ciani E. Guidi S. Della Valle G. Perini G. Bartesaghi R. Contestabile A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49896-49902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or HO-1 (19Choi B.M. Pae H.O. Chung H.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if these various protective mechanisms act in concert or independently and to what extent these protective pathways are cell type-dependent. Neuronal cells can mount a response to oxidative stress and are able to protect themselves to some extent from NO toxicity. For example, constitutive synthesis of c-Jun-regulated NCAM140 counteracts NO-induced apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells (14Feng Z.W. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is well established that pro- and anti-oxidants signal a protective response, including the transcriptional activation of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes and other protective proteins in many cell types through the transcription factor Nrf2 acting on the ARE element (20Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Topics Cell. Reg. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). However, the NO-mediated transcriptional regulation of this class of genes in neuroblastoma and other cells remains unknown. Here we investigate whether NO can elicit the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes and other protective proteins that would counteract NO-induced apoptosis of SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells. We show that NO up-regulates the transcription of mRNAs for phase II detoxifying enzymes and other protective proteins through Nrf2 acting via the ARE. The elevated expression of these genes counteracts NO-induced apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells. Materials—The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-Sy5y was obtained and used as described previously (14Feng Z.W. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell.

The NQO1 monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. David Ross, University of Colorado. The radioactive isotopes for gel shift and Northern analysis were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Plasmid Construction—The full-length cDNA clones encoding mouse Nrf2 (Clone ID 3663276) and mouse small maf (MafK) (Clone ID 4189276) were purchased from Invitrogen. The Nrf2 and the small maf (MafK) cDNAs were sub-cloned into the pcDNA 3.1-His TOPO vector to generate pcDNA-Nrf2 and pcDNA-MafK plasmids. The plasmid encoding the dominant-negative Nrf2 (DN-Nrf2) was a generous gift from Dr. Jaweed Alam, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA. DN-Nrf2 was described previously (22Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The DN-Nrf2 was sub-cloned into the pcDNA vector to generate pcDNA-DN-Nrf2. The 1.1-kb upstream promoter region of the Nqo1 gene (NCBI# M81596) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA prepared from SH-Sy5y cells using the following primers: Forward, 5′-tccgggttcaagcgattctcctgcctcag-3′ and Reverse, 5′-ggctctggtgcagtccggggcgctgattgg-3′. It was cloned in the pGL3 Basic reporter plasmid at the KpnI/XhoI sites and designated as wild type (WT). The various other deletion constructs were made by PCR using the following primers: Nqo1Λ1-Forward, 5′-acctgccttgaggagcaggggtggtgcag-3′ and Reverse, 5′-ggctctggtgcagtccggggcgctgattgg-3′; Nqo1Λ2-Forward, 5′-cacctcagggcacagtgcgcagatggg-3′ and Reverse, 5′-ggctctggtgcagtccggggcgctgattgg-3′; Nqo1Λ3-Forward, 5′-caggcgttgggtcccgcccttgtaggctg-3′ and Reverse, 5′-ggctctggtgcagtccggggcgctgattgg-3′. All the deletion fragments were cloned into the pGL3 Basic vector at the KpnI/XhoI sites. The reporter plasmids bearing the mutations in XRE, ARE, and AP2 were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis (15Li L. Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) based on the wild type (WT) reporter plasmid. The primers used were: XRE (F) 5′-GAT TAC AGC ACG CAG CAC CGC G-3′; XRE (R) 5′-CGC GGT GCT GCG TGC TGT AAT C-3′; ARE (F) 5′-GTC ACA GGC TGA GTC AAG AAT CTG-3′; ARE (R) 5′-CAG ATT CTT GAC TCA GCC TGT GAC-3′, AP2 (F) 5′-CTT CAT CAG CCT GGG GCC CTC C-3′; AP2 (R) 5′-GGA GGG CCC CAG GCT GAT GAA G-3′, respectively. The consensus oligonucleotide sequences/mutant sequences of Nqo1 ARE and the GST Ya ARE were described previously (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the cis-elements were synthesized with NheI and XhoI sites, respectively. The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and cloned at the respective sites in the pGL3 promoter (pGL3P) vector. Four different oligonucleotide sequences were selected for the siRNA knock-down of Nrf2 expression using the siRNA target finder software at www.ambion.com. The selected sequences are si-Nrf2 #1: AACAGGGCCGCCGTCGGGGAG; si-Nrf2 #2: AAGCCGCTTGGAGGCTCATCT; si-Nrf2 #3: AAGTCCCAGTGTGGCATCACC; si-Nrf2 #4: AACAGCATGCCCTCACCTGCT. The hairpin siRNA-encoding oligonucleotides were synthesized along with the loop sequence TTCAAGAGA and the HindIII/BamHI restriction sites and cloned into the siRNA vector pSilencer™ 2.1-U6. Cell Culture and Transfection of Reporter Plasmids—The LipofectAMINE transfection reagent kit was used to perform the transfections of human SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells by procedures as described previously (14Feng Z.W. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control in each transfection. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in Passive Lysis buffer from the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system kit from Promega (note: washing the cells three times with PBS is essential to remove any trace amount of residual NO donor, which would inhibit the luciferase activity). The same kit was used to assay the samples for luciferase activity. The luciferase assay was performed as described (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with a TD-20e luminometer. Gel Shift and Supershift Assay—SH-Sy5y cells were treated with the NO donors DETA-NO, SIN1, or SNP for various times up to 12 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the nuclear extraction kit from Panomics. The in vitro transcription/translation of the plasmids encoding pcDNA-Nrf2 and pcDNA-MafK was performed using the TnT-Coupled Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Systems by procedures suggested in the manufacturer's protocol. Redivue l-[35S]methionine was substituted for methionine in the reactions. After the coupled transcription/translation, the proteins were checked for their correct size by SDS-PAGE. In a similar experiment, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane and probed with Nrf2 and small maf (MafK) antibodies. Both the in vitro translated proteins gave the expected size products as described previously (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The double-stranded Nqo1 ARE as described previously (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Bandshift and supershift assays were performed by previously described procedures (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 10 μg of the nuclear extract was used in the gel shift, and 20 μg of the nuclear extract was used for the supershift experiments. The competition assays were performed using the cold wild type ARE, cold mutant AREM1, and cold mutant AREM2. Mutant AREM1 contains a mutation in the AP1-like element (TGAC) of the core ARE (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and mutant AREM2 contains a mutation in the AP1-like element and the GC box (TGACXXXGC) of the core ARE (23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mutant AREM2 has the following sequence, 5′-CAG TCA CAG TGA CGC TGA AGA ATC T-3′. For supershift assays 1 μg of the various antibodies was added with the nuclear protein-ARE mixture, and the reactions were incubated for a further 30 min at 4 °C. For gel shift and supershift experiments with the in vitro translated proteins, equimolar concentrations of in vitro translated Nrf2 and small maf proteins (MafK) were used. Northern Blot Analysis—SH-Sy5y cells were treated with SNP, SIN1, or DETA-NO for various times. After treatment, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS without calcium and magnesium. The RNA extraction was performed using the RNA extraction kit from Qiagen. Ten micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted by described procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads from Amersham Biosciences was used to label the cDNA probes of human NQO1 and β-actin. Prehybridization and hybridization with the labeled Nqo1 cDNA was done according to a method described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After the hybridization, the membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film for 12 h. The probe was removed from the membrane by placing it in 0.5% SDS at 95 °C. The membrane was then re-probed with radiolabeled β-actin cDNA, washed, and exposed to x-ray film for 12 h. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed by described previously methods (14Feng Z.W. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins and the cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using the kit from Panomics, Inc. For total protein extraction, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing complete protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation, 20 μg of total proteins or 10 μg of nuclear/cytoplasmic proteins were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to an ECL membrane. Immunoblotting was carried out with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% BSA. After washing, the membrane was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antiserum to rabbit or mouse (Chemicon) and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Stable Cell Selection, Toxicity, and Enzymatic Assays—To generate stable cell lines, the plasmids pcDNA-Nrf2 and pcDNA-DN-Nrf2 and the pcDNA vector were transfected individually in SH-Sy5y cells using LipofectAMINE following the manufacturer's protocol. The stable cells were selected in medium with 600 μg of neomycin/ml. After the selection, the stable clones were maintained in medium containing 200 μg of neomycin/ml. To generate Nrf2 siRNA stable cell lines, the plasmids pSilencer-si-Nrf2 (#3) and pSilencer vector control were transfected individually in SH-Sy5y cells using LipofectAMINE following the manufacturer's protocol. The stable cells were selected in medium with 100 μg of hygromycin/ml. After the selection, the stable clones were maintained in medium containing 50 μg of hygromycin/ml. To measure cell death, the Sytox-Hoechst double-staining method or the Crystal Violet staining method or the caspase assay was employed (15Li L. Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Hentze H. Lin X.Y. Choi M.S.K. Porter A.G.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with SNP, DETA-NO, or SIN1 for 8, 16, and 24 h. For Sytox-Hoechst staining the Sytox-Hoechst mixture was added in the medium at a concentration of 500 μg/ml (25Hentze H. Lin X.Y. Choi M.S.K. Porter A.G. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 956-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cells were stained for 10 min, and observed under the fluorescent microscope. The apoptotic cells were identified by the condensed nuclei stained as blue and counted. An average of ten fields was counted, and the experiments were done in triplicates. For Crystal Violet staining, the cells were stained with 30% crystal violet in 10% methanol for 10 min after the drug treatment. The excess stain was removed completely by washing with distilled water many times. The cells were dried completely, and the stain was eluted in 50% methanol, 1% acetic acid solution. The absorbance was measured at 590 nm (26Tosetti F. Vene R. Arena G. Morini M. Minghelli S. Noonan D.M. Albini A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The activity of caspase-3-like proteases was measured using microtiter plates as described (15Li L. Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The experiments were done in triplicates. NQO1 enzyme activity was determined by previously described procedures (27Jaiswal A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The activity was assayed in a reaction mixture with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The decrease in the absorbance of DCPIP was measured at 600 nm, and the NQO1 activity was represented as nanomoles of DCPIP reduced per minute per milligram of protein. The statistical differences were determined using the Prism software by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the cells after the NO donor treatment using the RNA extraction kit from Qiagen. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using the one-step RT-PCR kit from Qiagen using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. 2 μg total RNA was used in each reaction. The primers used for the RT-PCR reactions are as follows. Nqo1-Forward: 5′-atggtcggcagaagagcactgatcg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-ttttctagctttgatctggttgtcagttggg-3′; Catalase-Forward: 5′-atggctgacagccgggatcccg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-cagatttgccttctcccttgccgcc-3′; SOD-Forward: 5′-atggcgacgaaggccgtgtgcgtg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-ttgggcgatcccaattacaccacaag-3′; β-Actin-Forward: 5′-atggatgatgatatcgccgcgctcg-3′ and Reverse: R: 5′-gaagcatttgcggtggacgatggaggg-3′; HO-1-Forward: 5′-gagacggcttcaagctggtgatg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-gttgagcaggaacgcagtcttgg-3′; GCLM-Forward: 5′-gtccacgcacagcgaggagcttcatg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-gatcattgtgagtcaacagctgtatg-3′; GCLC-Forward: 5′-gaggctatgtgtcagacattgattgtcg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-gtgtactcctctgcagcgagctccgtg-3′; GST A4-Forward: 5′-ggatgaagttggtacagacccgaag-3′ and Reverse: 5′-gaggcttcttcttgctgccaggttcaag-3′; GST P1-Forward: 5′-gctgcgcggccctgcgcatgctg-3′ and Reverse: 5′-gcaggttgtagtcagcgaaggag-3′; TRX-F 5′-gctcaggaggtctggcagctgctaag-3′ and Reverse: 5′-gtgcaagcatctcttcctattgccag-3′. The cycling conditions used for the various primer sets are as follows. For NQO1, GCLM, GSTP1, TRX, and β-actin: 50 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 26 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. For SOD and catalase the same reaction conditions as above were used, but the amplification was performed only for 22 cycles. For GCLC, GSTA4, and HO-1: 50 °C for 30 min, 95 °C or 15 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—SH-Sy5y cells were grown and seeded in 6-well plates containing glass coverslips. The cells were either left untreated or were treated with the NO donors (1.5 mm DETA-NO or 2 mm SNP) for 2, 4, and 8 h. Cells were subsequently rinsed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, and 250 mm NaCl in PBS for 30 min. Anti-Nrf2 and Anti-Keap1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1 μg/100 μl in blocking buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) and incubated with the coverslip for 1 h. For viewing Nrf2, fluorescein FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, Inc.) was used. For viewing Keap1, rhodamine-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Laboratories, Inc.) was used. The cells were incubated with the TO-PRO3 nuclear stain (Molecular Probes) just before mounting. Coverslips were mounted and viewed by MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). The microscopic images were processed with the aid of LaserSharp software (Bio-Rad) and Adobe Photoshop. The Nqo1 Gene Is a Transcriptional Target of NO—In a quest to identify protective genes that are transcriptionally regulated by NO, SH-Sy5y cells were treated with the NO donors DETA-NO, SIN1, or SNP for various times. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the scavenger genes SOD and catalase, and the detoxifying enzyme gene Nqo1 showed that these NO donors did not affect the transcription of SOD and catalase (Fig. 1A). However, the transcript of the detoxifying enzyme gene Nqo1 was significantly up-regulated as early as 2 h by all three NO donors (Fig. 1A). Additional experiments done with IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells also showed a significant up-regulation of the Nqo1 gene as early as 2 h after treatment with all three NO donors (data not shown). The early induction of the Nqo1 gene by DETA-NO and SIN1 was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Two transcripts of 1.2 and 2.7 kb were observed for the Nqo1 gene, which was in line with a previous published report (28Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The transcriptional up-regulation of the Nqo1 gene as seen by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting translated into increased NQO1 protein (Fig. 1C) and increased NQO1 activity (Fig. 1D) upon NO treatment. About 5-fold induction of NQO1 activity was observed after 8 h of treatment with DETA-NO (Fig. 1D). These experiments together establish the Nqo1 gene as a transcriptional target of NO.

Here we purify and characterize the multiple DNA ligase enzymes of mycobacteria and probe genetically whether the ATP-dependent ligases are required for growth of M. tuberculosis. We find significant differences in the reactivity of mycobacterial ligases with a nicked DNA substrate, whereby LigA and LigB display vigorous nick sealing activity in the presence of NAD+ and ATP, respectively, whereas LigC and LigD, which have ATP-specific adenylyltransferase activity, display weak nick joining activity and generate high levels of the DNA-adenylate intermediate. All four of the mycobacterial ligases are monomeric enzymes. LigA has a low Km for NAD+ (1 μm) and is sensitive to a recently described pyridochromanone inhibitor of NAD+-dependent ligases. LigA is able to sustain growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in lieu of the essential yeast ligase Cdc9, but LigB, LigC, and LigD are not. LigB is distinguished by its relatively high Km for ATP (0.34 mm) and its dependence on a distinctive N-terminal domain for nick joining. None of the three ATP-dependent ligases are essential for mycobacterial growth. M. tuberculosis ligDΔ cells are defective in nonhomologous DNA end joining.

None of the three ATP-dependent ligases are essential for mycobacterial growth. M. tuberculosis ligDΔ cells are defective in nonhomologous DNA end joining. DNA ligases are grouped into two families, ATP-dependent ligases and NAD+-dependent ligases, according to their nucleotide substrate requirement (1Lehman I.R.

The ligase reaction entails three nucleotidyl transfer steps (1Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In the first step, attack by ligase on the α phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ results in release of PPi or NMN and formation of a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate. In the second step, the AMP is transferred to the 5′ end of the 5′ phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form DNA-adenylate (AppDNA). In the third step, ligase catalyzes attack by a DNA 3′-OH on DNA-adenylate to join the two polynucleotides and liberate AMP. ATP-dependent DNA ligases are found in all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), whereas the NAD+-dependent enzymes are present only in bacteria and entomopoxviruses (1Lehman I.R.

A conditional mutant of Escherichia coli LigA results in growth arrest at the restrictive temperature; thus LigA is essential in E. coli (8Gottesman M.M. Hicks M.L. Gellert M. J. Mol.

The presumption that bacteria encode only NAD+-dependent DNA ligases was overturned by the demonstration in 1997 of an ATP-dependent ligase in the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae (5Cheng C.

Remarkably, M. tuberculosis encodes three distinct ATP-dependent ligase homologues (LigB, LigC, and LigD) plus an NAD+-dependent ligase (LigA) (Fig. 1) (16Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T.

Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6515) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the rationale for this plethora of ligases in a single bacterium, we have produced and characterized recombinant versions of the mycobacterial DNA ligase enzymes and probed genetically the essentiality or dispensability of the ATP-dependent ligases for growth of M. tuberculosis. Recombinant Mycobacterial DNA Ligases—The M. tuberculosis ligA gene (Rv3014c) was amplified by PCR from total genomic DNA using primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a BglII site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BglII and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagen). The M. tuberculosis ligB (Rv3062) and ligC (Rv3731) genes were amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b. The M. tuberculosis ligD gene (Rv0938) was amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce an NcoI restriction site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and the overhanging ends were filled in with DNA polymerase. The blunt-ended PCR product was inserted into pET16b that had been cleaved at the XhoI site and filled in with DNA polymerase. The Mycobacterium smegmatis ligC1 gene was amplified by PCR from total genomic DNA using primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b. The resulting pET-MtuLig and pET-MsmLig plasmids contained the ligase coding sequences fused in-frame with a 63-bp 5′ leader sequence that encodes 10 consecutive histidines (His10 tag). The inserts of the pET-MtuLig and pET-MsmLig plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes during amplification and cloning. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3-RP). Cultures (500 ml) of E. coli BL21(DE3-RP)/pET-Lig were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached ∼0.5. The cultures were placed on ice for 10 min and then adjusted to 2% (v/v) ethanol and 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After further incubation for 17 h at 18 °C with constant shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml; the suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min, then adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100 and sonicated to reduce the viscosity of the lysate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were applied to 1-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The columns were washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The ligase proteins were retained on the column and recovered predominantly in the 100 and 200 mm imidazole fractions. Biochemical characterization of the mycobacterial ligases was performed using the 200 mm imidazole eluate fractions. The eluates of MtuLigA, MtuLigB, and MsmLigC1 were dialyzed overnight against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). The enzyme preparations were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent, with BSA as the standard. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Aliquots (50 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparations of the mycobacterial ligases were mixed with catalase (50 μg), BSA (50 μg), and cytochrome c (50 μg) in 200 μl of buffer C. The mixtures were applied to 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. The polypeptide compositions of the gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for adenylyltransferase and ligation activities as specified in the figure legends. Adenylyltransferase Activity—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm [α-32P]ATP, and enzyme as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with SDS and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The covalent ligase-[32P]AMP complex was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. DNA Ligation Assay—A 36-bp DNA duplex containing a centrally placed 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick was formed by annealing two 18-mer oligode-oxyribonucleotides to a complementary 36-mer strand as described previously (18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 18-mer constituting the 5′ phosphate-terminated strand d(ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA) was 5′ 32P-labeled and gel-purified, then annealed to the complementary 36-mer DNA (the template strand) in the presence of a 3′-OH 18-mer strand d(CATATCCGTGTCGCCCTT). Ligation reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA substrate, ATP or NAD+ as specified, and enzyme as specified were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 60 mm EDTA and 30% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. Ligase Gene Disruptions in M. tuberculosis—Gene disruption was performed by specialized transduction of lig::hygR cassettes using temperature-sensitive mycobacteriophages as described previously (19Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Glickman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ligΔ::hygR gene disruption cassettes were constructed by PCR amplifying genomic DNA segments flanking each ligase gene and inserting them on either side of the hygromycin resistance gene in plasmid pJSC407, a cloning vector containing the hygR marker, a λ cos site, and a unique PacI restriction site for packaging into phAE87. For ligB, the 5′ flanking region was amplified from M. tuberculosis Erdman genomic DNA as a 667-bp fragment that includes the first 23 nucleotides of the predicted ligB open reading frame (ORF). The 3′ flank was amplified as a 730-bp product that includes the last 13 nucleotides of the ligB ORF. For ligC, the 5′ flank was a 745-bp fragment including the first 23 nucleotides of the ligC ORF. The 3′ flank was a 638-bp fragment including the last 20 nucleotides of the ligC ORF. For ligD, the 5′ flank was a 759-bp fragment including the first 11 nucleotides of the ligD ORF and the 3′ flank was a 653-bp fragment including the last 35 nucleotides of the ORF. These ligΔ cassettes were incorporated into phAE87 and high-titer lysates of each phage were used to infect wild-type M. tuberculosis Erdman. After 3 weeks of selection on Middlebrook 7H10 agar medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, hygR transductants were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium with 10% OADC supplement, 0.5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Genomic DNA obtained from candidate ligΔ disruptants was digested with diagnostic restriction endonucleases, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and genotyped at the relevant lig locus by Southern blotting with appropriate 32P-labeled flanking DNA probes, which were prepared by random hexamer priming using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid-based Assay of Nonhomologous End Joining in Vivo— M. tuberculosis lig+ and ligΔ strains were transformed by electroporation with pMSG288 plasmid DNA containing the kanR gene. Parallel transformations were performed with uncut circular plasmid (15 ng of DNA) and linear plasmids generated by digestion with EcoRV (54 ng of DNA) or Asp718I (42 ng of DNA), which cut the plasmid at a single sites well outside the kanR gene. kanR transformants were identified by plating on Middlebrook 7H10 agar medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin. The efficiency of nonhomologous end joining was quantified as the ratio of the number of kanR colonies/ng of DNA arising in cells transformed with linear DNA to the number of kanR colonies/ng of DNA obtained from cells transformed with uncut circular plasmid DNA. Test of Mycobacterial Ligase Function in Vivo by Complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc9Δ—The M. tuberculosis lig genes were excised from the pET plasmids and inserted into the yeast vector pYX1 (CEN TRP1), in which expression of the lig gene is driven by the yeast TPI1 promoter. The ligA gene was excised from pET-MtuLigA with NdeI and EcoRI; the ends were filled in by DNA polymerase, and the blunt-ended ligA fragment was inserted into pYX1 that had been digested with EcoRI and BamHI and filled in by DNA polymerase. ligB and ligC were excised from the pET plasmids with NdeI and BamHI, then inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pYX1. ligD was excised with NcoI and BamHI and inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pYX1. pYX-MtuLig clones were transformed into S. cerevisiae cdc9Δ strain YBSΔL1 (MATa ura3 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 can1 cdc9::LEU2 p360-Cdc9). YBSΔL1 is deleted at the chromosomal CDC9 locus and its growth is sustained by a copy of CDC9 on a CEN URA3 plasmid (p360-Cdc9) (21Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on agar medium lacking tryptophan. Cells from each isolate were then streaked on agar containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), a drug that selects against the URA3 gene on the CDC9 plasmid. cdc9Δ strains transformed with the ligA plasmid gave rise to 5-FOA-resistant colonies after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. cdc9Δ cells transformed with ligB, ligC, or ligD plasmids failed to give rise to 5-FOA-resistant colonies after 10 days of incubation at 25, 30, or 37 °C. The cdc9Δ ligA strain grew on rich medium (YPD agar) at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Characterization of M. tuberculosis LigA—M. tuberculosis encodes four putative DNA ligases (Fig. 1). LigA resembles a typical bacterial NAD+-dependent ligase; it consists of a core ligase domain flanked by a N-terminal domain (Ia), which is implicated in NAD+ recognition (22Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9685-9700Google Scholar), and several C-terminal modules, including a tetracysteine zinc-binding motif, a helixhairpin-helix domain, and BRCT domain (Fig. 1) (23Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To evaluate the biochemical properties of MtuLigA, the protein was produced in E. coli as a His10-LigA fusion and purified from a soluble extract by adsorption to nickel-agarose resin and elution with buffer containing imidazole (Fig. 2A). A synthetic duplex DNA substrate containing a single nick was then used to gauge the DNA sealing activity of LigA, which was evinced by the NAD+ and magnesium-dependent conversion of the 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer strand to a 36-mer product. The extent of ligation was proportional to LigA concentration and 80% of the input substrate was sealed at saturating enzyme (Fig. 2B). The specific activity of LigA calculated from the slope of the titration curve indicated that 18 pmol of nicks were sealed per pmol of LigA during the 15-min reaction. Omission of NAD+ resulted in a 35-fold reduction in specific activity; the residual NAD+-independent ligation is attributable to the presence of preformed LigA-adenylate in the enzyme preparation. The linear dependence of nucleotide-independent strand joining on input enzyme suggested that 50% of the enzyme molecules had AMP bound at the active site. ATP had no stimulatory effect on LigA activity. Thus, MtuLigA is a bona fide NAD+-specific ligase. The quaternary structure of LigA was examined by zonal velocity sedimentation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient. Marker proteins catalase (native size 248 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards in the gradient. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the odd numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. His10-LigA (calculated to be a 77-kDa polypeptide) sedimented as a discrete peak (fractions 15–17) on the heavy side of the BSA peak (Fig. 2C). The ligase activity profile paralleled the abundance of the LigA polypeptide and peaked at fractions 15–16 (Fig. 2D). A plot of the S values of the three standards versus fraction number yielded a straight line (not shown). An S value of 5.1 was determined for LigA by interpolation to the internal standard curve. These results are consistent with a monomeric quaternary structure for LigA. Kinetic Parameters and Inhibition of LigA by Pyridochromanone—The unique substrate specificity of LigA compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases recommends the NAD+ ligases as targets for the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotics. Brötz-Oesterhelt et al. (24Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Häbich D. Labischiinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have conducted a high throughput in vitro screen that identified pyridochromanones as potent inhibitors of E. coli LigA. The most effective of the inhibitors tested was pyridochromanone compound 3, the structure of which is shown in Fig. 3B. Compound 3 was active in vitro against LigA from E. coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but had no effect on human DNA ligase I (24Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Häbich D. Labischiinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The pyridochromanones inhibited the growth of S. aureus and B. subtilis. The identification of a mutation in S. aureus LigA that confers resistance to growth inhibition by pyridochromanone compound 3 provided strong evidence that LigA is the immediate drug target in vivo (24Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Häbich D. Labischiinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here we queried whether pyridochromanone compound 3 was active in vitro against MtuLigA. Compound 3 (a generous gift of Dr. Brötz-Oesterhelt and colleagues at Bayer) was dissolved in 100% Me2SO to achieve a 10 mm stock solution. The compound was further diluted in 100% Me2SO immediately prior to testing its effects on LigA. The drug solutions comprised one-tenth volume of the ligation reaction mixture; thus 10% Me2SO was included in all of the control reaction mixtures. Initial experiments showed that 10% Me2SO elicited a 5-fold increase in the specific activity of LigA in nick joining (data not shown). The dependence of LigA nick joining activity on NAD+ concentration was tested in the presence of 10% Me2SO (Fig. 3A). A Km of 1.3 μm NAD+ and kcat of 4.3 min–1 were calculated from a double-reciprocal plot of the data (not shown). We found that compound 3 inhibited nick joining by LigA in the presence of 5 μm NAD+ with an apparent IC50 of ∼0.6 μm pyridochromanone (Fig. 3C). These results complement those of Brötz-Oesterhelt et al. (24Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Häbich D. Labischiinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and they underscore the point that NAD+-dependent ligases from diverse bacteria are inhibited by a lead compound identified by screening against E. coli LigA. Characterization of M. tuberculosis LigB—M. tuberculosis LigB is a 507-aa polypeptide consisting of a ∼340-aa C-terminal catalytic domain typical of ATP-dependent DNA ligases fused to a ∼170-aa N-terminal domain of unknown function. The catalytic domain is defined by a set of six peptide motifs, highlighted in shaded boxes in Fig. 4, that comprise the ATP binding pocket (25Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Shuman S. Ru X. Virology. 1995; 211: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The closest relatives of mycobacterial LigA, which contain a homologous N-terminal domain, are a putative DNA ligase from the bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor and the ATP-dependent DNA ligases of Pyrococcus abyssii and other species of Archaea (Fig. 4). MtuLigB was produced in E. coli as a His10-LigB fusion and purified from a soluble extract by nickel-affinity chromatography. The 56-kDa His10-LigB protein was recovered in the 100–200 mm imidazole eluate fractions (Fig. 5A). The adenylyltransferase activity of the recombinant LigB protein (reflecting step 1 of the ligase reaction pathway) was demonstrated by incubating the column fractions with [α-32P]ATP and magnesium. This resulted in the formation of an SDS-stable covalent LigB-[32P]adenylate adduct, the abundance of which paralleled the elution profile of the LigB protein (Fig. 5A). LigB catalyzed ATP-dependent nick sealing. The extent of sealing was proportional to LigB concentration (Fig. 5C); 50 pmol of nicks were sealed per pmol of LigB during the 15-min reaction. Omission of ATP resulted in a 60-fold reduction in specific activity; the residual ATP-independent ligation was attributed to the presence of preformed LigB-AMP in the enzyme preparation. We estimated that 76% of the LigB molecules had AMP bound at the active site. NAD+ had no stimulatory effect on LigB activity. Thus, MtuLigB is an ATP-specific ligase. LigB activity was proportional to ATP concentration in the range of 0.06 to 0.5 mm and saturated at ≥1 mm ATP (Fig. 5D). From a double-reciprocal plot of the data in Fig. 5D, we calculated an apparent Km of 0.34 mm ATP. The quaternary structure of LigB was gauged by glycerol gradient sedimentation with internal standards catalase, ovalbumin (45 kDa), and cytochrome c. LigB sedimented as a discrete peak (fractions 17–19) overlapping the ovalbumin peak (Fig. 5B). The adenylyltransferase and ligase activity profiles were coincident and paralleled the abundance of the LigB polypeptide and peaked at fractions 17–18 (Fig. 5B). We surmise that LigB is a monomer. The function of the distinctive N-terminal segment of the 507-aa mycobacterial LigB protein was probed by analysis of incrementally truncated deletion mutants: LigB-(135–507), LigB-(155–507), and LigB-(172–507). The N termini of the LigBΔ mutants are indicated by arrows in Fig. 4. The recombinant His10-LigBΔ proteins displayed the expected incremental increases in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 6A). The purity of the LigBΔ proteins was comparable with that of full-length LigB. All three of the LigBΔ proteins reacted with [α-32P]ATP to form the covalent LigBΔ-[32P]adenylate adduct (Fig. 6B). Indeed, the loss of 134 to 171 amino acids from the N terminus had no detrimental effect on the extents of ligase adenylylation. However, the LigBΔ proteins were severely defective in the overall nick sealing reaction, even under conditions of enzyme excess (Fig. 6C). The specific activities of the LigBΔ mutants were determined by protein titration (data not shown) and normalized to the specific activity of full-length wild-type LigB; we thereby calculated that LigB-(135–507), LigB-(155–507), and LigB-(172–507) were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% as active as wild-type LigB, respectively. These results indicate that the N terminus of LigB is essential for nick joining at a step subsequent to ligase adenylylation. Characterization of M. tuberculosis LigD—M. tuberculosis LigD is a 759-aa polypeptide consisting of a C-terminal catalytic domain typical of ATP-dependent DNA ligases (Fig. 7) fused to a large N-terminal domain composed of two putative catalytic modules: a proximal “polymerase” module that has similarity to the catalytic subunit of eukaryal DNA primases and a distal “nuclease” module that resembles the exonuclease III/apurinic endonuclease family of DNA repair enzymes (Fig. 1) (40Weller G.R. Doherty A.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A His10-LigD fusion was purified from a soluble E. coli extract by nickel-affinity chromatography. The 86-kDa LigD protein was recovered in the 100–200 mm imidazole eluate fractions (Fig. 8A). Incubating the LigD-containing imidazole eluate fractions with [α-32P]ATP and magnesium resulted in the formation of a covalent LigD-[32P]adenylate adduct (Fig. 8A).Fig."

In this study, we report for the first time that transient cerebral ischemia induces aberrant mitotic proteins and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein with neurofibrillary tangle-like conformational epitopes in adult female rat cortex.

Furthermore, inhibition of mitosis-related cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) by roscovitine significantly reduced the hyperphosphorylation of tau.

The prevalence of dementia in ischemic stroke patients is nine times higher than controls at 3 months (1Tatemichi T.K. Desmond D.W. Mayeux R. Paik M. Stern Y. Sano M. Remien R.H. Williams J.B.

Many of these dementias developed progressively, and cerebral damage is believed to be the direct cause of cognitive decline in only half of these cases (3Tatemichi T.K. Paik M. Bagiella E.

Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that aberrant mitotic activation, as well as DNA replication, in terminally differentiated neurons appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD (12Vincent I. Zheng J.H. Dickson D.W. Kress Y. Davies P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Yang Y. Geldmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many cyclin-dependent kinases, including Cdc2 and cyclin B1, as well as many other mitotic markers, are elevated in nearly all tauopathy-related neurodegenerative diseases (14Husseman J.W. Nochlin D. Vincent I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These protein kinases regulate cell cycle progression into mitosis in developing and proliferating cells. If cell cycle re-entrance is forced by ectopically driving an oncogene with a neuronal-specific promotor, the targeted neurons will die rather than divide (15al-Ubaidi M.R. Font R.L. Quiambao A.B.

In AD and other tauopathy diseases, induction of Cdc2 and cyclin B1, as well as aberrant DNA replication, is observed in neurons containing NFTs (13Yang Y. Geldmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, completion of successful nuclear divisions in differentiated neurons has never been reported. These inappropriately induced mitotic protein kinases can phosphorylate tau, modify other cytoskeletal proteins, and further induce apoptosis in terminally differentiated cells (19Yen S.H. Liu W.K. Hall F.L. Yan S.D. Stern D. Dickson D.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal an intricate interaction between apoptosis, mitosis, and formation of NFTs in terminally differentiated neurons. Activation of programmed cell death is observed in AD brains. Apoptosis, as indicated by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) (20Katsuse O. Iseki E. Suzuki K. Kosaka K. Neuropathology. 2001; 21: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) positive neurons and activation of neuronal caspase-3 (21Stadelmann C. Deckwerth T.L. Srinivasan A. Bancher C. Bruck W. Jellinger K. Lassmann H. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1459-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), is widespread in AD brains. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is induced under stress, as well as in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and binds to spindle microtubules (22Uren A.G. Beilharz T.

Up-regulation of cyclin D1 and other cell cycle progression markers is observed during apoptosis in post-mitotic neuronal cultures (21Stadelmann C. Deckwerth T.L. Srinivasan A. Bancher C. Bruck W.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1150-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All above mentioned evidence indicates that mitotic events may contribute to the formation of AD pathology (14Husseman J.W. Nochlin D. Vincent I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Vincent I. Rosado M. Davies P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed an induction of tau hyperphosphorylation, and mitosis-related proteins, and assessed the temporal pattern and colocalization of markers of apoptosis, mitotic protein activation, and tau hyperphosphorylation in a rodent model for transient cerebral ischemia. In this non-transgenic animal model, apoptotic signals precede both mitotic protein activation and formation of NFT-like conformational changes. Furthermore, brain delivery of a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, roscovitine, or systemic administration of the potent neuroprotective reagent, 17β-estradiol, significantly reduced the epitope of tau hyperphosphorylation. These results suggest that therapies directed at apoptosis or aberrant cell cycle may be a valuable target in preventing the sequel of neuropathological events, observed in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Animals—Four-6-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles Rivers (Wilmington, MA), and maintained in our animal facility in a temperature-controlled room (22-25 °C) with 12-h dark-light cycles. All rats have free access to laboratory chow and tap water. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of North Texas Health Science Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal Surgeries—All experimental animals received ovariectomies at least 14 days before any further surgical procedure. For middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and reperfusion, an intraluminal filament model with slight modification was used (27Simpkins J.W. Rajakumar G. Zhang Y.Q. Simpkins C.E. Greenwald D.

Stroke. 1986; 17: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). Briefly, the animal was anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), then the internal carotid artery (ICA) was exposed, and a 3-0 monofilament nylon suture was introduced into the ICA lumen through a puncture and gently advanced to the distal ICA until proper resistance was felt. After 1 h, the suture was withdrawn from the ICA and the distal ICA was immediately cauterized. At the desired time after the onset of reperfusion (2, 4, or 24 h) animals were sacrificed and sampled for immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, or 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain, as described below. TTC Staining—Brains were removed, immediately after sacrificing the animal, and dissected coronally into 2-mm sections using a metallic brain matrix (ASI Instruments, Inc., Warren, MI), and stained by incubation in 2% TTC in a 0.9% saline solution at 37 °C for 30 min. Photographs were taken with a Kodak digital camera. Each treatment group included at least 3-4 animals. Roscovitine Administration—Rats were anesthetized with halothane and placed in a stereotaxic device. A surgical stainless steel microsyringe was temporarily inserted with the following coordinates: anteroposterior -5; lateral 1.8 from bregma; and -7.9 ventral from the dura, so that the tip of the syringe needle would be inserted into the third ventricle (29Paxinos G. Watson C. Pennisi M. Topple A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1985; 13: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The insertion position was confirmed with post-mortem dissection. Animals were administered 50 μl of 1 mm roscovitine (Sigma) in 30% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (equivalent to ∼20 μm initial final concentration of roscovitine in the brain) into the right lateral ventricle over a period of 5 min using a microinjection syringe. The needles were held in position for at least another 30 min to avoid leaking. Sham treated animals received an equal volume of 30% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. The animals were then allowed to rest at least 2 h before further MCA surgery. Estrogen Treatments—17β-Estradiol (Steraloids, Inc., Newport, RI) was dissolved in absolute ethanol and then diluted in corn oil (Penta Manufacturing, Airfield, NJ) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Ethanol was evaporated by incubation at 60 °C overnight. A single subcutaneous injection of 100 μg/kg or vehicle was given to the rats 2 h before MCA occlusion surgery. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting analysis with various antibodies, brain tissue was dissected into frontoparietal cortex (peri-infarct area) and subcortical basal ganglia fractions (complete infarct area), then homogenized in RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40 or Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were collected for analysis. Samples were probed with specific antibodies at proper dilutions with procedures according to the manufacturer's instruction. The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). In all immunoblots, each lane represented an independent experimental animal with described treatments. Protein Kinase Assay—Cdc2-like kinase activity was examined with SignalTECT cdc2 Protein Kinase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 10 μg of brain extract was incubated with cdc2-specific substrates in 20 μl of the protein kinase assay buffer together with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). After 15 min of reaction at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of stop buffer, heated at 95 °C. The result was obtained by counting in a liquid scintillation counter. Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescent Staining—For histological studies, we used paraffin-embedded brain sections (5-7 μm thick) that received transcardiac perfusion with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by immersion fixation, then switched to 70% alcohol, for at least another 24 h before paraffin embedding. All single antigen detection was performed using an avidin-biotin immune peroxidase method with dimethylaminobenzene substrate (dark brown) and Histostain plus kits (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc., South San Francisco, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Multiantigen immunodetection or colocalizations were achieved with either immunofluorescence with a variety of highly species-specific or isotype-specific non-overlapping Alexa fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Detection of fluorophore was achieved by fluorescent microscope or confocal microscopy. Some immunofluorescent stainings were counterstained with DAPI, a nuclear marker. TUNEL Assay and Colocalizations with Specific Antigens—DNA fragmentation was detected by a TUNEL method using a Dead END fluorescent kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colocalization with TUNEL staining was achieved by confocal microscopy as described above, with Alexa fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies that do not overlap with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled TUNEL stain. Antibodies used in the immunohistological studies include GFAP (1:50) (Sigma), NeuN (1:50) (Chemikon, Temecula, CA), cyclin B1 (1: 50), Cdc2 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and MPM-2 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). The following antibodies were used to stain hyperphosphorylation and NFT-like conformational tau epitopes: MC1 (unique PHF conformation) and TG3 (phospho-tau 231/235 and AD conformation); phosphorylated tau epitopes: CP13 (phospho-tau 202/205), CP3 (phospho-tau 214), PHF-1 (phospho-tau 396/404), and CP9 (phospho-tau 231), all at a 1:10 dilution. All of the above mentioned phospho-specific antibodies for tau were the kind gifts and characterized by Dr. Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Sarcosyl Tau Extraction—Sarcosyl extraction was performed as described previously with a slight modification (30Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain tissues from ischemic and contralateral rat cortex were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was brought to 1% N-lauroylsarcosinate (Sarcosyl) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with moderate shaking. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the Sarcosyl-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Extracts were either temporally stored at 4 °C, or at -80 °C for long-term storage until use. This material was used for both immunoblotting and electron microscopy analysis. Electron Microscopy—Resuspended Sarcosyl-insoluble materials obtained from ischemic cortical or contralateral extracts were placed directly on carbon-coated, 300-mesh grids, stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, and analyzed by electron microscopy (31Gotz J. Chen F. Barmettler R. Nitsch R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 529-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As negative controls, filament preparations from contralateral extracts were examined at the same time. Microphotographs were recorded at an operating voltage of 80-100 kV and at nominal magnifications of 160,000-400,000 on a Zeiss electron microscope. Semiquantitative Cell Counting—To estimate the density of cortical cells labeled with specific antibodies, methods were adapted from previous reports (32Jiang W. Gu W. Brannstrom T. Rosqvist R. Wester P. Stroke. 2001; 32: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, ischemic brain sections from animals that received roscovitine (n = 6) or sham treatment (n = 3) were randomly selected from paraffin-embedded sections. Each brain section was labeled for a specific antigen or double-labeled, together with DAPI-based counterstain. Cell counting was performed in the ischemic boundary cortex under a CAST-Grid system (Nikon, Inc.). The region was delineated in the ischemic brain cortex near the edge of the surface, where the highest density of TUNEL-positive cells was observed. The striatum was not included in this study, as few positive cells were observed in this region. Within these boundaries, optical dissectors were systematically randomly sampled and the number of positive cells, together with DAPI-labeled nuclear counterstain in each optical section was counted. The positive labeled cell numbers in the investigated region are normalized with the total number of cells, indicated by the DAPI stain. The data are expressed as the percentage of DAPI nuclear counterstained cells. Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Rapidly Induces Apoptosis and Subsequent Mitotic Events—MCA occlusion is a widely used ischemic stroke model (28Bederson J.B. Pitts L.H. Tsuji M. Nishimura M.C. Davis R.L. Bartkowski H. Stroke. 1986; 17: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). This in vivo model for neuronal death has the distinct advantage that apoptosis is rapidly induced and synchronized in a large number of neurons (33Li Y. Chopp M. Powers C. Jiang N. Brain Res. 1997; 765: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the effects of transient cerebral ischemia on apoptosis and the expression of mitotic markers. As early as 2 h after the initiation of reperfusion following a 1-h ischemia, positive TUNEL staining appeared in the core ischemic region within the basal ganglion, but no mitotic markers were observed in the neurons in the ischemic region (Fig. 1A). At 4 h of reperfusion, the brain areas and number of cells displaying TUNEL-positive staining had increased. At the same time, expression of mitotic markers, cyclin B1 and MPM-2, appeared in the ischemic core (Fig. 1, B and D), and these markers extended into parts of the cortex around the infarct area (data not shown). Cyclin B1 is the activator of Cdc2 protein kinase, and accumulates during mitosis (34Fang F. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and the MPM-2 monoclonal antibody recognizes a set of M-phase specific phosphoproteins, most of which are the substrates of Cdc2/cyclin B1 (35Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). No phospho-epitopes of tau were detected at 4 h of reperfusion after MCA occlusion in either the ischemic region or the contralateral brain side (data not shown). Aberrant Mitotic Proteins Associate with Delayed Cell Death—The ischemia-reperfusion injury showed that both density and intensity of TUNEL-positive staining progressed with time and was evident throughout the infarcted brain region at 24 h of reperfusion (Fig. 1). The TUNEL signals were not present in the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 2A), but were abundant in both the core region (Fig. 1C) and the cortical areas (Fig. 2, B and C). In parallel, we also observed a marked induction of both the mitotic epitopes (MPM-2) and the mitotic proteins cyclin B1 in the ischemic area. In the hemisphere contralateral to the occlusion, these mitotic epitopes were absent (Fig. 2A). However, on the ischemic side, these mitotic epitopes were widespread and intensely stained (Fig. 2). Most of the mitotic epitopes had cytosolic distributions with a few instances of nuclear localization. This observation is consistent with previous research in AD patients (14Husseman J.W. Nochlin D. Vincent I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the periventricular areas, where the lateral ventricle separates the ischemic from the fully perfused brain areas, TUNEL-positive cells formed a sharp line of demarcation across, and almost perfectly colocalize with the mitotic marker MPM-2 (Fig. 2D). Cyclin B1 (data not shown) or MPM-2 (Fig. 2D) colocalized with TUNEL in about 30-90% of cells, depending on the brain location and the severity of ischemic damage. Semiquantitative co-localization assay indicates that most MPM-2 immunoreactivity associates with TUNEL. Most of the cyclin B1 and MPM-2 positive cells in the frontoparietal cortex had a neuronal morphology (Fig. 2C). To further evaluate the co-localization of TUNEL and mitotic markers and to identify cell types containing these markers, we performed semiquantitative counting (Fig. 2, E and F). More than 30% of cells in the cortex showed co-localization of MPM-2 and TUNEL. About 29% of the MPM-2-positive cells in the cortex stained positive for a neuronal marker, NeuN. Most unlabeled cells in cortex had neuronal morphology, whereas most unlabeled cells in subcortex were astrocytes and glia. Also it appeared that there was a reduction of GFAP immunoreactivity in the ischemic reason. Transient Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Induces Tau Hyperphosphorylation and NFT-like Conformational Epitopes—We further assessed ischemic brain sections of animals that had undergone transient ischemia with a variety of antibodies that detect tauopathies in neurons affected with human AD. These monoclonal antibodies were directed against distinct phosphorylation sites and/or conformational states of tau protein present in AD brains (36Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Cohen P. Vanmechelen E. Vandermeeren M. Cras P. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The transient cerebral ischemia induced not only hyperphosphorylation, indicated by PHF-1 (Fig. 3C) and CP13 (Fig. 3D), but also the unique tauopathy conformational change, indicated by MC1 (Fig. 3A) and TG3 (Fig. 3B). The NFTs were expressed throughout the ischemic area, with the most intense immunoreactivity observed in the frontoparietal cortex (Fig. 3, A-D), in a pattern similar to cyclin B1/MPM-2 staining. Although there was evidence of cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation, these NFT-positive cells still had an apparent neuronal morphology, and most of the immunoreactivity was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A-D). Immunoblot analysis of cortical extracts revealed a marked induction of NFT-specific epitopes in cortical areas affected by MCA occlusion-induced ischemia compared with the control areas of the contralateral cortex (Fig. 3E). Further analysis of Sarcosyl-extracted tau extracts by electronic microscopic analysis showed evidence of aberrant paired-helical filaments similar to that found in AD patient brain extracts. However, defined tangles and senile plaques, as identified with modified Gallyas silver and thioflavin-S staining were not detected. Previous studies have demonstrated that tau can be phosphorylated by a number of protein kinases (37Pelech S.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16 (257-261): 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We examined some candidate protein kinases involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. We observed an increase in Cdc2 protein kinase levels (Fig. 4A), as well as an increase in its kinase activity (Fig. 4B). The corresponding activator of Cdc2, cyclin B1 also showed a marked induction (Fig. 4C). Cdk5, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and pERK levels in cortical extracts from animals at 24 h after MCA occlusion were not significantly changed. Co-localization of Markers of Apoptosis, Mitosis, and NFTs—To further understand the spatial relationship of the apoptotic, mitotic, and NFTs, we examined the colocalization of these markers in the frontoparietal cortex in the penumbra areas. These markers highly colocalized with each other in cortical pyramidal neurons in the peri-infarct areas. Double staining of NFTs and TUNEL revealed that TUNEL-positive signals colocalized with 30-70% NFT-positive cells (Fig. 5). Roscovitine, a Potent Mitotic Cdk Inhibitor, Reduces Tau Hyperphosphorylation in the Ischemic Cortex—To further confirm the relationship of this tau hyperphosphorylation and aberrant cell cycle, we administered roscovitine, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (Ki = 0.2-0.7 μm), into the lateral ventricle. The effect of this treatment was evaluated by examining the mitotic epitopes with MPM-2 labeling (Fig. 6A). The treatment reduced the MPM-2 epitope from an average of 38.4 ± 4.4% in sham-treated animals to an average of 9.9 ± 2.3% in roscovitine-treated animals in frontoparietal cortex (Fig. 6B). We also noticed a reduction in average staining intensity, which was difficult to evaluate quantitatively. To evaluate the effects of roscovitine on tau hyperphosphorylation, we performed semiquantitative cell counting in the frontoparietal cortex. Roscovitine treatment reduced PHF-1-positive cell number in the ischemic cortical regions from an average of 23.24 ± 3.0% in sham-treated to 5.9 ± 1.4% in roscovitine-treated animals (Fig. 7, A and B). 17β-Estradiol Reduces Ischemic Damage, Aberrant Mitosis, and NFT Epitopes—To determine the correlation between ischemic damage and NFT formation, we assessed the responses to MCA occlusion in the presence of a known anti-apoptotic agent, 17β-estradiol. Estrogen treatments have been demonstrated to be effective in protecting greater than 50% of ischemic brain tissues from MCA occlusion-induced apoptosis (27Simpkins J.W. Rajakumar G. Zhang Y.Q. Simpkins C.E. Greenwald D. Yu C.J. Bodor N. Day A.L. J. Neurosurg. 1997; 87: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 38Wise P.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 229-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Behl C. Prog. Brain Res. 2002; 138: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TTC staining was used to reveal the extent of the infarcted area after ischemia-reperfusion (Fig. 8A). 17β-Estradiol treatments in this stroke model reduced the ischemic volume by about 50% (Fig. 8A) and caused a similar reduction in TUNEL staining (Fig. 8A) in the ischemic areas. We found that this treatment significantly reduced the expression of the mitotic protein, cyclin B1 (Fig. 8B) and of NFT epitopes in cortical brain extracts from the ischemic cerebral cortex (Fig. 8C). In the current study, we observed the early appearance of apoptosis and the subsequent induction of aberrant mitotic proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation by a transient focal cerebral ischemia, and further characterized the tau hyperphosphorylation with monoclonal antibodies that detect a variety of phosphorylation sites and NFT-like conformational epitopes. We also examined the Sarcosyl-insoluble tau extracts with high magnification e"
https://openalex.org/W2082408176,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation and bone development and remodeling. Collagenase-3 (matrix metalloproteinase-13) is expressed by osteoblasts and seems to be involved in osteoclastic bone resorption. Here, we show that TGF-β1 stimulates collagenase-3 expression in the rat osteoblastic cell line UMR 106-01 and requires de novo protein synthesis. Dominant-negative Smad2/3 constructs indicated that Smad signaling is essential for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity. Inhibitors of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways, but not the JNK pathway, reduced TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression, indicating that the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways are also required for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in UMR 106-01 cells. These inhibitors did not prevent nuclear localization of Smad proteins, but they inhibited Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. We have shown for the first time that Runx2 (a bone transcription factor and a potential substrate for the MAPK pathway) is phosphorylated in response to TGF-β1 treatment in osteoblastic cells. Cotransfection of Smad2 and Runx2 constructs had a cooperative effect on TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity in these cells. We further identified ligand-independent physical interaction between Smad2 and Runx2. Taken together, our results provide an important role for cross-talk between the Smad and MAPK pathways and their components in expression of collagenase-3 following TGF-β1 treatment in UMR 106-01 cells.

Summers C. Bord S. Bishop N.J. Kelsall A.W. Coleman N. Compston J.E. Bone (N. Y.). 1998; 23: 95-102Google Scholar) and interact with the known TGF-β type I-III receptors (betaglycan) (3Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 21-41Google Scholar). TGF-β plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation and bone development and remodeling. Inhibition of endogenous TGF-β signaling in bone in mice results in altered bone remodeling (4Filvaroff E. Erlebacher A. Ye J. Gitelman S.E. Lotz J. Heillman M. Derynck R. Development. 1999; 26: 4267-4279Google Scholar). Although osteoblasts are presumably responsible for production of most of the TGF-β entrapped in bone matrix, the majority of active TGF-β appears to be generated by bone-resorbing osteoclasts either through release of TGF-β stored in bone matrix or by biosynthesis of new TGF-β (5Centrella M. Canalis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7335-7339Google Scholar, 6Oreffo R.O. Mundy G.R. Seyedin S.M. Bonewald L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Collagenase-3 gene expression is regulated by bone-resorbing agents such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, and growth factors that promote bone turnover (10Scott D.K. Brakenhoff K.D. Clohisy J.C. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2153-2159Google Scholar, 11Kusano K. Miyaura C. Inada M. Tamura T. Ito A. Nagase H. Kamoi K. Suda T.

In vivo, collagenase-3 has been shown to be expressed in ossifying centers during bone development (15Schorpp M. Mattei M.G. Herr I. Gack S. Schaper J. Angel P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 211-217Google Scholar) and is detectable by immunohistochemistry in rat calvariae 14 days after birth (16Partridge N.C. Davis B.A. Sipe B. Gershan L.A. Fiacco G.J. Lorenz T.C. Jeffrey J.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 63: 416-422Google Scholar). The regulation of this gene is likely to have important consequences for both normal and pathological remodeling of bone where the balance between bone resorption and bone formation is disrupted. Using mutant mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in Col1a1 that are resistant to collagenase cleavage of type I collagen, Zhao et al. (17Zhao W. Byrne M.H. Boyce B.F. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 517-524Google Scholar) showed that PTH-induced bone resorption and calcemic responses are markedly diminished. The number of osteoclasts is also reduced, and the animals have thicker than normal bones (18Zhao W. Byrne M.H. Wang Y. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 941-949Google Scholar).In the last few years, significant progress has been made in delineating the signaling mechanisms utilized by TGF-β. TGF-β signals through sequential activation of two cell-surface serine/threonine kinase receptors (types I and II), which phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 within their conserved C-terminal SSXS motif (19Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Google Scholar, 20Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R.

These activated Smad proteins, together with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes. Smad4 is an essential component in many of the Smad-dependent responses (23de Caestecker M.P. Hemmati P. Larisch-Bloch S. Ajmera R. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13690-13696Google Scholar), serving both to stabilize the Smad-transcription factor complex (24Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Google Scholar) and to form functional interactions with critical transcriptional adapter proteins (25de Caestecker M.P. Yahata T. Wang D. Parks W.T. Huang S. Hill C.S. Shioda T. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2115-2122Google Scholar). The inhibitory Smad proteins (Smad6 and Smad7) directly inhibit the TGF-β type I receptor serine/threonine kinase and the transcriptional machinery (19Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Google Scholar, 20Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar). MAPKs also represent another major type of signaling intermediate for TGF-β.Because TGF-β1 is a local regulator of bone cell function and collagenases appear to be involved in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, we postulated that TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in osteoblastic cells could play a pivotal role in bone remodeling. Hence, it was of interest to dissect and identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in UMR 106-01 cells. The Runx family of transcription factors is encoded by three distinct genes, runx1 (polyoma enhancer-binding protein-2B/core-binding factor-α2/AML1), runx2 (polyoma enhancer-binding protein-2A/core-binding factor-α1/AML3), and runx3 (polyoma enhancer-binding protein-2C/core-binding factor-α3/AML2). Runx2 plays an essential role in osteogenesis (26Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Google Scholar, 27Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K.

We show here the functional interaction of Smad2 and Runx2 as signaling components for the Smad and MAPK pathways and that they are necessary for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity in osteoblastic UMR 106-01 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—TGF-β1 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).

The filters were scanned and quantitated using a PhosphorImager system.Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit. Reverse transcription was carried out using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Roche Applied Science). PCRs were performed using a real-time PCR DNA Engine Opticon (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, which allow real-time quantitative detection of the PCR product by measuring the increase in SYBR green fluorescence caused by binding of SYBR green to double-stranded DNA. The SYBR green kit for PCRs was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primers for human collagenase-3 and β-actin were designed using PrimerExpress software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Transient Transfections—The plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were transfected with 1 μg/plate DNA and 5 μl/plate LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium. After 16 h, 1 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. After 24 h, the cells were treated with either control or TGF-β1-containing medium for 24 h. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured by reacting 50 μl of cell lysate in duplicate in a 100-μl reaction volume consisting of final concentrations of 250 μm n-butyryl-CoA and 23 mm [14C]chloramphenicol (0.125 μCi/assay). Butylated chloramphenicol was removed by pre-extraction with 200 μl of mixed xylenes. The xylene phase was back-extracted with 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Butylated chloramphenicol retained in the final organic layer was determined by scintillation counting. A standard curve using purified CAT was performed every experiment to determine the linear range of the enzyme assay. Renilla luciferase activity was monitored as an internal control of transfection efficiency using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (31Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Google Scholar, 32Selvamurugan N. Pulumati M.R. Tyson D.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5037-5042Google Scholar, 33D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Karsenty G. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 816-822Google Scholar). The whole cell extracts were precleared with normal rabbit serum and protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. After preclearing, the samples were immunoprecipitated with antibody and protein A-agarose beads and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and SDS loading buffer was added, followed by boiling in a water bath. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in Tris-buffered saline (0.1% Tween 20, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was exposed to primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSTo study the effect of TGF-β1 on expression of collagenase-3 in the rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line UMR 106-01, cells were treated with TGF-β1 either at different concentrations for 24 h (Fig. 1A) or for different time periods with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Fig. 1B). Total cellular RNAs were purified and analyzed by Northern blotting using a rat collagenase-3 cDNA. The filters were scanned and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. As shown in Fig. 1A, collagenase-3 expression was maximally stimulated (3.8-fold) by 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 at 24 h in UMR 106-01 cells (Fig. 1B). An equal amount of RNA loading and transfer was verified by detecting 18 S ribosomal RNA on the same filter. To determine whether the TGF-β1-mediated increase in collagenase-3 mRNA is a primary response, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with control medium or medium containing TGF-β1 for 24 h in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml cycloheximide added 1 h before treatment. Total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis using labeled rat collagenase-3 or 18 S ribosomal cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1C, cycloheximide inhibited TGF-β1 induction of collagenase-3 mRNA, indicating that the TGF-β1 stimulation of collagenase-3 expression is secondary and that de novo protein synthesis is required for this purpose. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was then performed using an antibody against rat collagenase-3, which confirmed stimulation of secretion of collagenase-3 from UMR 106-01 cells into the medium (data not shown).Smad proteins have been identified as intracellular mediators for members of the TGF-β superfamily. To determine the involvement of the Smad pathway in TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression, we first examined phosphorylation patterns of Smad2 activated by TGF-β1. UMR 106-01 cells were treated with TGF-β1 for different times as indicated. Whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, Smad2 was rapidly phosphorylated within 15 min of TGF-β1 treatment, which persisted for 4 h in these cells. Similarly, Smad3 was also phosphorylated in response to TGF-β1 treatment for 1 h (Fig. 2B). To examine the functional significance of the Smad pathway activated by TGF-β1 in regulating collagenase-3 expression in these osteoblastic cells, we utilized dominant-negative Smad2 and Smad3 expression plasmids. The rat -500 collagenase-3 promoter construct was transiently transfected with either pCMV-Smad2Mutant or pCMV-Smad3Mutant into UMR 106-01 cells and then treated with control or TGF-β1-containing medium for 24 h and assayed for CAT activity. The transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with Renilla luciferase plasmid. Both Smad2/3 mutants reduced, but did not completely abolish, the basal and TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activities in UMR 106-01 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that the TGF-β1 response for collagenase-3 promoter activity requires an additional signaling pathway.Fig. 2TGF-β1 activates the Smad signaling pathway. A, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with control or TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml)-containing medium for the indicated times. Whole cell extracts were isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-Smad2 antibody to show equal amounts of protein loaded in the membrane. B, nuclear extracts from control UMR 106-01 cells and from UMR 106-01 cells treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 1 h were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Smad3 antibody. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-Cdk2 antibody to show equal amounts of protein loaded in the membrane. C, the -500 collagenase-3 promoter construct was transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells along with the pCMV, pCMVSmad2Mutant (Smad2M), or pCMV-Smad3Mutant (Smad3M) expression construct. The cells were then treated with control or 10 ng/ml TGF-β1-containing medium for 24 h. The lysates were prepared and assayed for CAT activity. The transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with Renilla luciferase reporter gene construct. The data were analyzed by ANOVA using Prism 3.0. *, significant difference compared with the control. RLU, relative luciferase units; pmol but, pmol butylated chloramphenicol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify whether the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression, we used MAPK pathway inhibitors. UMR 106-01 cells were pretreated with Me2SO, PD98059 (MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), or SP600125 (JNK2 inhibitor) at different concentrations for 20 min and then treated with or without TGF-β1 for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the sense or antisense oligomers for rat collagenase-3 and β-actin (Fig. 3, A-C). The ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors decreased TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression from 10.0 ± 1.8-fold to 3.0 ± 0.6-fold at 25 μm and to 1.7 ± 0.4-fold at 10 μm, respectively. These results suggest that, in addition to the Smad pathway (Fig. 2), the MAPK pathway is also required for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in UMR 106-01 cells. There was no effect with the JNK2 inhibitor (Fig. 3C). To show the action and specificity of the MAPK inhibitors, we pretreated the UMR 106-01 cells with those inhibitors for 20 min and then treated them with control or PTH (10-8m)-containing medium for 24 h. Total RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR, and the results show that ERK1/2 (Fig. 3D) and p38 (data not shown) inhibitors had no effect on PTH-induced collagenase-3 expression in UMR 106-01 cells, whereas the JNK2 inhibitor blocked PTH-induced collagenase-3 expression in UMR 106-01 cells (Fig. 3E).Fig. 3TGF-β1 requires both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways for collagenase-3 mRNA induction. A-C, UMR 106-01 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with control or TGF-β1(10 ng/ml)-containing medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 (added 20 min before TGF-β1 treatment) at different concentrations as indicated. D and E, serum-starved UMR 106-01 cells were treated with control or PTH (10-8m)-containing medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of either inhibitor PD98059 or SP600125 (added 20 min before PTH treatment). Total RNA was isolated and subjected to real-time quantitative RT-PCR using specific primers for rat collagenase-3 and β-actin. The relative levels of mRNAs were normalized to β-actin, and the TGF-β1 and PTH-fold changes were calculated over controls. The data are represented as means ± S.D. (n = 3). The data were analyzed by ANOVA using Prism 3.0. *, significant difference compared with Me2SO (DMSO) treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined whether the Smad and MAPK pathways act independently or involve some level of intracellular cross-talk. Smad2 translocates to the nuclear compartment after TGF-β1 stimulation. Activation of MAPK pathways has been shown to both activate and induce nuclear translocation of Smad2 (34de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Google Scholar, 35Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether specific inhibitors of MAPK pathways inhibit TGF-β1-dependent nuclear translocation of the Smad proteins in UMR 106-01 cells. Cells were pretreated with the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors for 30 min, followed by TGF-β1 treatment for 1 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Smad2 and anti-phospho-Smad3 antibodies. When UMR 106-01 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1, there was increased nuclear accumulation of phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3, which were detected by their respective antibodies (Fig. 4A). Pretreatment with p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 inhibitors did not inhibit nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3 proteins. These observations demonstrate that nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins is independent of MAPK signaling pathways.Fig. 4A, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 inhibitors do not inhibit TGF-β1-stimulated Smad2/3 phosphorylation. UMR 106-01 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with control (C) or TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml)-containing (T) medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 (added 20 min before TGF-β1 treatment) at different concentrations as indicated. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Smad2, anti-phospho-Smad3, or anti-Cdk2 antibody. B, p38 and ERK1/2 inhibitors block TGF-β1-stimulated Smad-mediated collagenase-3 promoter activity. The -500 collagenase-3 promoter construct was transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells along with either pCMV alone or FLAG-tagged Smad2/4. The cells were then treated with control or TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml)-containing medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 (added 20 min before TGF-β1 treatment). The lysates were prepared and assayed for CAT activity. The transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with Renilla luciferase reporter gene construct. Data represent means ± S.E. of three experiments. The data were analyzed by ANOVA using Prism 3.0. *, significant difference compared with the control. The expression of FLAG-Smad2/4 proteins was also verified by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. RLU, relative luciferase units. DMSO, Me2SO; pmol but, pmol butylated chloramphenicol; RLU, relative luciferase units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether these MAPK pathways affect the transcriptional activity of the Smad complex, the -500 collagenase-3 promoter construct was transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells along with FLAG-tagged Smad2/4 expression constructs. The cells were then pretreated with Me2SO or with p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 inhibitors, followed by TGF-β1 treatment. The lysates were prepared, and CAT activity was measured. The transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4B, Smad2/4 increased both the basal and TGF-β1 responses for collagenase-3 promoter activity in UMR 106-01 cells. Pretreatment with SB203580 and PD98059 inhibited both TGF-β1-stimulated and Smad-mediated collagenase-3 promoter activity in these cells. The level of expression of FLAG-Smad2 and FLAG-Smad4 proteins in the transfected cells was analyzed by Western blot analysis. These results indicate that both the Smad and MAPK pathways merge their signals within the nucleus or at the transcriptional level for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in UMR 106-01 cells.Runx2 is a bone-related transcription factor and is essential for the differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal precursors and for bone formation (26Ducy P.

The rat -500 collagenase-3 promoter construct was transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells with increasing amounts of an AML-1/ETO expression plasmid. AML/ETO is a repressor protein that does not contain the transactivation domain proline, serine, and threonine-rich and C-terminal domain of Runx; it has only the DNA-binding domain (31Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with control or TGF-β1-containing"

A widely accepted view of transporters is that they consist of a pore with alternating access to the intracellular and extracellular solutions, which serves to couple ion movement to the movement of substrate. However, recent observations that EAATs, and also a number of other neurotransmitter transporters, can also function as ligand-gated chloride channels have blurred the distinctions between transporters and ion channels. Here we show that mutations in the second transmembrane domain (TM2) of EAAT1 alter anion permeation properties without affecting glutamate transport and that a number of TM2 residues are accessible to the external aqueous solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extracellular edge of TM2 is in close proximity to a membrane-associated domain that influences glutamate transport. This study will provide the foundation for beginning to understand how transporters can function as both transporters and ion channels.

EAATs are secondary active transporters in which glutamate is co-transported with 3 Na+ and 1 H+ followed by the counter-transport of 1 K+ (1Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), which enables EAATs to maintain a 106-fold glutamate concentration gradient across the cell membrane. In addition to this coupled transport conductance, glutamate also activates a thermodynamically uncoupled chloride conductance through the transporter (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

In order to investigate this idea further, it is necessary to identify the molecular determinants of chloride permeation and to examine interactions between these residues and other residues involved in glutamate binding and translocation. The ion permeation pathways of various ion channels are lined with amino acid residues with polar side chains such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine (25Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 26Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the chloride selectivity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is the result of an energetically favorable interaction between chloride ions and a polarizable, as opposed to charged, pore (27Smith S.S. Steinle E.D. Meyerhoff M.E. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 799-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The second transmembrane domain is in the amino-terminal half of the EAATs and is separate, at least in primary structure, from the glutamate translocation region. It has positive charges at either end and contains a number of polar residues that are highly conserved between the transporter subtypes (Fig. 1). Based on the position and nature of the residues within TM2, we hypothesized that this domain forms part of the chloride permeation pathway of EAAT1. We have tested this idea by creating a number of conservative mutations in TM2, and we show that several residues within this domain selectively alter chloride channel function without affecting glutamate transport which suggests that this domain forms part of the chloride channel. Many of these residues are accessible to the aqueous environment that is consistent with this domain lining a water-filled pore, and finally we demonstrate that the extracellular edge of TM2 is in close proximity to a membrane-associated domain that influences glutamate transport. Site-directed Mutagenesis—EAAT1 was subcloned into the plasmid oocyte transcription vector (pOTV) (15Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), and all mutations were sequenced on both strands by Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (ABI PRISM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The wild type and mutant transporter cDNAs were linearized with SpeI and cRNA transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc.). Electrophysiology—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Stage V oocytes were harvested from Xenopus laevis as described previously (28Poulsen M.V. Vandenberg R.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 159-167Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and all surgical procedures were approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics committee. 50 nl of cRNA was injected into oocytes and incubated in standard frog Ringer's solution (ND96: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55). Current recordings were made using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced with a MacLab 2e chart recorder (ADI Instruments, Sydney, Australia) using the chart software and a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments) controlled by an IBM-compatible computer using the pClamp software (version 7.0, Axon Instruments). The current-voltage relationships for substrate-elicited conductances were determined by subtraction of steady state current measurements in the absence of substrate, obtained during 75-ms voltage pulses from –30 mV to potentials between –100 and +80 in 10-mV steps, from corresponding current measurements in the presence of substrate. Uptake of l-[3H]glutamate or d-[3H]aspartate (Amersham Biosciences) was measured under voltage clamp in oocytes expressing wild type and mutant transporters. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at –100 mV, and 100 μm l-[3H]glutamate or d-[3H]aspartate was applied for 1 min, followed by a 3-min washout. Oocytes were removed from the bath and lysed in 50 mm NaOH, and scintillation counting was performed. Recording solutions for the chloride titration were normal frog Ringer's solution with gluconate substitution to the desired extracellular chloride concentration [Cl–]out, and 100 mm Tris-Cl was added to frog Ringer's solution to obtain 200 mm [Cl–]out. The anion permeability ratios were determined using recording solutions with 10 mm sodium salts of the various test anions chloride (Cl–), bromide (Br–), iodide (I–), or nitrate (NO–3) plus 86 mm sodium gluconate to obtain 96 mm Na+), and 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm magnesium gluconate, 1.8 mm calcium gluconate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55. Recordings were made with the bath grounded via a 3 m KCl/agar bridge connected to a 3 m KCl reservoir to minimize offset potentials. After testing the effects of the various anions, the measurements in Cl– were repeated to ensure that anion loading of the cell was not significant. The reversal potential measurements in the different anions were used to calculate PX/PCl (X denotes Br–, I–, or NO–3) using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (29Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 441-470Google Scholar). The equilibrium potentials for chloride were calculated assuming [Cl–]in = 41 mm (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The transporter-specific leak conductance was isolated by using dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) (Tocris, Bristol, UK). Substrate dose responses were fitted by least squares as a function of current (I) to I/Imax = [S]/(K0.5 + [S]), where Imax is the maximal current, K0.5 the concentration of substrate that generates half-maximal current, and [S] the substrate concentration. Current as a function of cadmium concentration [Cd2+] was also fitted by least squares analysis to I/Imax = (1 – [Cd2+])/(IC50 + [Cd2+]) + C/Imax, where IC50 is the [Cd2+] at half-maximal reduction in transport current, and C is the residual transport current at maximal Cd2+ inhibition of transport. All values presented are means of at least three cells ± S.E. Cysteine Modifications—2-Sulfonatoethyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Stock solutions (0.1 m) were prepared in MilliQ water, stored at –20 °C, and diluted using frog Ringer's buffer immediately before use. The current-voltage relationships were determined, as described above, before and after a 5-min application of either 10 mm MTSES, 1 mm MTSET, or 30 μm HgCl2. Current-voltage measurements were normalized to the current generated by 100 μm l-glutamate at –100 mV before application of the sulfhydryl reagent. Experiments were also carried out in which the MTS reagent or HgCl2 was applied in the presence of l-glutamate. Time course of MTS modification of cysteine mutants was performed at –60 mV. A 100 μm l-glutamate control dose (Icontrol) was applied to oocytes expressing R90C, Q93C, or V96C, and after washout, the same l-glutamate dose was applied with the lowest concentration of MTS reagent that gave stable inhibition within 2 min. The time-dependent decrease in current was fitted with a single exponential giving the time constant of modification. The pseudo first-order rate constant was calculated as the inverse of the modification time constant, and dividing by the concentration of the MTS reagents provided the second-order rate constants. Cross-linking Experiments—After a control dose of 100 μm l-glutamate, oocytes were unclamped, and the grounding electrode was removed followed by a 2-min treatment with 1 mm DTT; the oocyte was washed for 5 min, and the grounding electrode was replaced, followed by the application of 100 μm l-glutamate. The current-voltage measurements presented in Fig. 6 were normalized to the current generated by 100 μm l-glutamate at –100 mV after reduction by DTT. Cross-linking was then induced by treating oocytes with the oxidizing agent copper phenanthroline (CuPh), 100 μm copper sulfate, and 400 μm 1,10-phenanthroline. After a control dose of 100 μm l-glutamate, oocytes were incubated with CuPh for 5 min followed by washout and reapplication of 100 μm l-glutamate. Analysis of Kinetic Data—Analysis of kinetic data was carried out using the Kaleidagraph Software version 3.1. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni's post hoc test was performed using Prism GraphPad (30Motulsky H. Analyzing Data with GraphPad Prism, Version 3.00. GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego1999Google Scholar) to assess difference in the means. p values less than 0.05 were taken to be significant and are indicated in figures and tables follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and *** p < 0.001. Mutations in Transmembrane Domain 2 Affect Anion Permeation—A series of mutations of polar and charged residues in TM2 of EAAT1 were generated, and the recombinant transporters were expressed in X. laevis oocytes. The rates of l-[3H]glutamate transport measured under voltage clamp at –100 mV by the mutants and wild type EAAT1 were similar (Table I), except for D112A and K114L in which the rates of transport were reduced by ∼30%. Relatively minor changes in the K0.5 values for l-glutamate- and d-aspartate-elicited currents of the mutant transporters were also observed (Table I). These results demonstrate that residues in this region are unlikely to be directly involved in coupled glutamate transport.Table IKinetic and electrophysiological properties of wild type and mutant EAAT1 transportersK0.5 (l-glutamate)K0.5 (d-aspartate)[3H]Glutamate uptakeErevCl-NO-3μmfmol/oocyte/minmVEAAT120.0 ± 3.023.0 ± 2.0371 ± 3111.2 ± 1.2-63.4 ± 1.2R90L19.5 ± 0.911.4 ± 1.8388 ± 7910.3 ± 2.5-68.5 ± 0.7Q93A38.7 ± 2.230.3 ± 0.9385 ± 4338.0 ± 1.5ap < 0.001 when compared with wild type (EAAT1).

Application of either l-glutamate or d-aspartate to oocytes expressing EAAT1 generates a current that is the sum of an inward coupled transport conductance and the uncoupled chloride conductance (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The net current activated by l-glutamate reverses direction at +61.4 ± 2.5 mV (n = 10), whereas the current activated by the alternate substrate d-aspartate reverses direction at +11.2 ± 1.2 mV (n = 10, Table I and Fig. 2A). The more negative reversal potential of the d-aspartate-activated currents is due to a larger chloride component than the current activated by l-glutamate. The substrate-activated anion conductance of wild type EAAT1 has a lyotrophic permeability sequence of Cl– < Br– < I– < NO–3 (Table II and Fig. 3C), where NO–3 is more permeant than Cl– through the transporter (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). When the extracellular chloride is substituted with NO–3, the substrate-activated outward current is larger, and the reversal potential shifts to more negative membrane potentials because the proportion of current due to the anion conductance compared with the transport conductance is significantly greater (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). At +60 mV most of the observed current is due to the influx of external anions with little contribution from coupled transport. The d-aspartate-activated currents measured at +60 mV in the presence of extracellular NO–3 of S103A, S103V, T106A, D112A and K114L were significantly reduced, whereas P98G and S102A showed larger currents compared with wild type (Fig. 2). Significant changes in the reversal potential of the l-glutamate(data not shown) and d-aspartate-activated currents measured in the presence of either 96 mm Cl– or NO–3 are also observed (Table I). Thus, although small changes in K0.5 values for d-aspartate and l-glutamate were observed, the large changes in the current-voltage relationships of the mutants are likely to be due to changes in gating and/or permeation properties of the chloride channel of the transporters.Table IIRelative anion permeability ratios for d-aspartate- and l-glutamate-elicited conductances of wild type and mutant EAAT1 transportersd-Aspartatel-GlutamatenPBr-/PCl-Pl-/PCl-NO3−PBr-/PCl-Pl-/PCl-NO3−EAAT12.1 ± 0.18.4 ± 0.310.7 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.18.1 ± 0.29.7 ± 0.210R90L2.1 ± 0.17.3 ± 0.69.1 ± 0.81.7 ± 0.15.9 ± 0.57.8 ± 0.86Q93A1.5 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 when compared with wild type (EAAT1).

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3The d-aspartate-activated anion conductances of wild type and mutant EAAT1 transporters. A, average current-voltage relationships elicited by 100 μm d -aspartate in extracellular buffers containing various chloride concentrations of 10 mm (open squares), 30 mm (closed squares), 60 mm (open circles), 100 mm (closed circles), and 200 mm (open diamonds)(n = 5). The reversal potential for chloride in 10, 30, 60, 100, and 200 mm is 36, 8, –10, –22, and –40 mV, respectively. The dashed line represents the predicted coupled d-aspartate transport component (e-fold per 41 ± 2 mV). B, 100 μm d -[3H]aspartate was applied for 1 min to EAAT1-expressing oocytes voltage-clamped at –100 mV, and the charge translocation (Charge) to d-aspartate uptake (Flux) ratio is presented in the bar graph. The dashed line represents a charge/flux ratio of 2, which is due to coupled d-aspartate transport, and the remainder of the charge/flux is due to the uncoupled chloride component, which varies between the mutants (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 when compared with wild type EAAT1, n ≥ 3.)

Note the different scale for P98G, n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the role of TM2 in anion permeation through the transporter, the permeability of various anions relative to chloride was determined for each of the mutant transporters. To estimate the relative anion permeabilities of the wild type and mutant transporters, it is necessary to subtract the conductance due to coupled transport from the total substrate-activated conductance. This was carried out using a two-step procedure. First, the voltage dependence of the coupled transport component of EAAT1 was estimated by varying the extracellular chloride concentration from 10 to 200 mm and measuring the residual current at the theoretical chloride reversal potentials for each concentration of chloride (Fig. 3A). The reversal potential for chloride at 10, 30, 60, 100, and 200 mm is 36, 8, –10, –22, and –40 mV, respectively, assuming [Cl–]in = 41 mm (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). At these potentials, the current due to the uncoupled chloride component, in the above buffers, is zero, and the remaining current is due to coupled substrate transport. The current measurements at the various chloride reversal potentials were plotted and fit to an exponential function for d-aspartate(e-fold per 41 ± 2 mV; n = 5) (Fig. 3A) and l-glutamate (e-fold per 54 ± 5 mV; n = 5) (data not shown)-activated currents. The second step was to estimate the proportion of the current due to coupled transport and the anion conductance for the wild type and each of the mutant transporters. Substrate transport is coupled to the co-transport of 3 Na+, 1 H+ and the counter-transport of 1 K+ ion (1Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), resulting in a net inward movement of two positive charges for every transport cycle. The proportion of the current at –100 mV that is due to coupled transport was estimated by performing d-[3H]aspartate and l-[3H]glutamate uptake, whereas clamping the oocytes at –100 mV and calculating the quantity of charge translocated per transport cycle of the current at –100 mV that is due to coupled substrate transport for wild type EAAT1 and each of the mutants can be predicted. With this value and the calculated voltage dependence of the coupled substrate component of EAAT1 estimated in step 1 and assuming a similar voltage dependence of coupled transport for all transporters, we estimated the proportion of the current at each membrane potential due to coupled substrate transport for the mutant transporters. This conductance was then subtracted from the total substrate elicited conductance to leave the uncoupled anion conductance. Examples of the current-voltage relationships of the d-aspartate-activated anion conductances of wild type EAAT1, P98G, S103A, and T106A are presented in Fig. 3C. These recordings were made by using 10 mm of the permeant anions in the extracellular solution to avoid anion loading of the oocyte. The Q93A, P98G, S102A, S103A, S103V, and T106A mutations showed significant changes in relative anion permeability compared with wild type for d-aspartate- and l-glutamate-activated conductances (Table II), and in the case of S103V the permeability sequence of the l-glutamate-activated conductance is changed to Cl– < NO–3 < Br– < I–. The change in relative anion permeability of several mutant transporters and in particular the change in permeability sequence for S103V suggest that there are changes in the interactions between the permeating anions and residues in TM2 and imply that these residues face the lumen of the chloride channel. It should be noted that there are small differences in the permeability ratios depending on which substrate is used to activate the uncoupled anion conductance. This may be due to subtle differences in the conformation of the anion pore when it is activated by d-aspartat"
https://openalex.org/W2107921073,"Transcription regulators of the MerR family respond to myriad stress signals to activate σ70/σA-targeted genes, which contain suboptimal 19-bp spacers between their -35 and -10 promoter elements. The crystal structure of a BmrR-TPP+-DNA complex provided initial insight into the transcription activation mechanism of the MerR family, which involves base pair distortion, DNA undertwisting and shortening of the spacer, and realignment of the -35 and -10 boxes. Here, we describe the crystal structure of MerR family member MtaN bound to the mta promoter. Although the global DNA binding modes of MtaN and BmrR differ somewhat, homologous protein-DNA interactions are maintained. Moreover, despite their different sequences, the mta promoter conformation is essentially identical to that of the BmrR-TPP+-bound bmr promoter, indicating that this DNA distortion mechanism is common to the entire MerR family. Interestingly, DNA binding experiments reveal that the identity of the two central bases of the mta and bmr promoters, which are conserved as either a thymidine or an adenine in nearly all MerR promoters, is not important for DNA affinity. Comparison of the free and DNA-bound MtaN structures reveals that a conformational hinge, centered at residues N-terminal to the ubiquitous coiled coil, is key for mta promoter binding. Analysis of the structures of BmrR, CueR, and ZntR indicates that this hinge may be common to all MerR family members."
https://openalex.org/W2124146523,"Obesity is a major health problem in industrialized societies, and fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis) is common in obese individuals. Oxidative stress originating from increased intracellular levels of fatty acids has been implicated as a cause of hepatocellular injury in steatosis, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. p53, widely known as a tumor suppressor, has been shown often to be activated in stressed cells, inducing cell cycle arrest or death. Here we demonstrate that p53 is involved in the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular injury associated with steatosis. We found that p53 in the nucleus is induced in the liver from two mouse models of fatty liver disease, ob/ob and a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses an active form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 in the liver (TgSREBP-1), the one with obesity and the other without obesity. This activation of the p53 pathway leads to the elevation of p21 mRNA expression, which can be considered an indicator of p53 activity, because ob/ob mice lacking p53 generated by targeting gene disruption exhibited the complete restoration of the p21 elevation to wild type levels. Consistent with these results, the amelioration of hepatic steatosis caused by Srebp-1 gene disruption in ob/ob mice lowered the p21 expression in a triglyceride content-dependent manner. Moreover, p53 deficiency in ob/ob mice resulted in a marked improvement of plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, demonstrating that p53 is involved in the mechanisms of hepatocellular injury. In conclusion, we revealed that p53 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease.

Shimano H. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of liver disease associated with obesity has remained poorly understood. Although fatty liver is typically benign, it is believed that in a subset of individuals gradual progression from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis and eventually to cirrhosis can occur. Since liver cell damage is reversible by caloric restriction at least at the early stages of the disease, it is postulated that nutritional overload plays a pivotal role in the mechanisms of hepatocellular injury. Notably, fatty liver disease also develops without obesity in some mouse models, when SREBP-1 expression and thereby lipogenesis are elevated in the liver (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, the retention of triglycerides within hepatocytes is a prerequisite for the development of fatty liver disease, exerting toxic effects on hepatocytes. As a mechanism by which overnutrition causes liver cell damage, oxidative stress originating from increased intracellular levels of fatty acids is considered to be involved (3Angulo P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar, 4Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Caldwell S.H. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1202-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar), although these concepts remain largely hypothetical. The p53 gene was the first tumor-suppressor gene to be identified and has been found to be inactivated in most human cancers (17Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar). The p53 protein prevents division of stressed cells or causes them to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). For example, γ-irradiation activates p53 to turn on the transcription of p21Waf1/CIP1, which binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, thus blocking the G1-S and G2-to-mitosis transitions. The stresses that activate p53 are diverse, ranging from DNA damage to oxidative stress, hypoxia, and heat shock (18Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 has been thought to be a guardian against cellular stresses and has been extensively studied and well established as a tumor suppressor. However, much less is known about other roles of p53 beyond tumor suppression. Notably recent reports (19Jaeschke H. Gores G.J. Cederbaum A.I. Hinson J.A. Pessayre D. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol.

We have reported previously (22Yahagi N. Shimano H. Matsuzaka T. Najima Y. Sekiya M. Nakagawa Y. Ide T. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25395-25400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that p53 is activated in adipocytes of ob/ob mice, being involved in the mechanisms of dysregulated gene expression in adipose tissue of obese animals. These mice have largely excessive fat deposition in adipocytes and hepatocytes. If overloaded fat stresses adipocytes thereby activating the p53 pathway, the same mechanism could be provoked in the steatotic hepatocytes of obese animals, presumably leading to hepatocellular injury. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that steatotic hepatocytes are under various stresses that induce p53, which gives rise to liver cell damage and plays an important role in the development of fatty liver disease. In our present study, we demonstrate that nuclear p53 is induced in the liver from two mouse models of fatty liver disease, one with obesity and the other without obesity, elevating p21 mRNA expression as an indicator of its activity and that, as we expect, p53 is involved in the mechanisms of hepatocellular injury accompanied by steatosis. Animals—Lep+/ob-C57BL/6J and p53+/–-C57BL/6J (23Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 923-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice deficient in SREBP-1 were established as described previously (24Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and were backcrossed 6 times onto the C57BL/6J background. These mice were intercrossed to produce ob/ob mice lacking p53 (ob/ob × p53–/–) or SREBP-1 (ob/ob × Srebp-1–/–) as described previously (13Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Ide T.

SREBP-1a transgenic mice overexpressing amino acids 1–460 of human SREBP-1a under control of the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter (TgSREBP-1) were made as described previously (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Genotypes at the transgenic loci were determined by PCR, and heterozygous mice were used. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and a standard chow diet (Oriental MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were performed with 12-week-old male mice. All animals were sacrificed in an early phase of the light cycle. Nuclear Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts from mice livers were prepared as described previously (25Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclear protein (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. p53 was detected using a 1:500 dilution of anti-p53FL (sc-6243, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The phosphorylation at Ser-15 of p53 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-p53 Ser-15 (9284S, New England Biolabs). Bound antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA from mouse liver was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of RNA samples equally pooled from each group (n = 3–6) were run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. The cDNA probes were cloned as described previously (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime DNA Labeling System kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probe in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C with the exception of p53, for which ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion) was used at 42 °C. The membranes were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Blood Chemistries and Liver Lipid Analyses—Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities were measured on an automated analyzer at a clinical chemistry laboratory (Special Reference Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). The contents of triglycerides in liver were measured as described previously (27Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assay kit was used for the determination of triglycerides (LH, Wako Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). p53 Activation in Two Models of Fatty Livers, ob/ob and TgSREBP-1 Mice—In our first series of experiments, we examined the p53 expression both at mRNA and protein levels in the nucleus from livers of ob/ob mice. These mice present a marked increase in hepatic triglyceride contents, i.e. fatty livers (hepatic steatosis), and are a good model for fatty liver disease associated with obesity. We extracted nuclear proteins from control and ob/ob mice livers, and we analyzed them by Western blotting with anti-p53 and anti-phosphorylated p53 at Ser-15 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, we demonstrated that ob/ob mouse liver had higher levels of p53 protein in the nucleus than wild type. Consistently, an active form of p53, phosphorylated at Ser-15, was also up-regulated in ob/ob livers (Fig. 1). In contrast, p53 mRNA level was not elevated in ob/ob livers. We also performed these analyses of p53 expression in SREBP-1 transgenic (TgSREBP-1) mice. This is another model of fatty liver but does not display systemic obesity. Similarly to ob/ob mice, TgSREBP-1 mice showed elevated expression of p53 protein with no increase in mRNA expression levels (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 was also increased in parallel. p53 Activation in Fatty Liver Causes Elevation of p53-regulated Genes—To explore the effects of p53 activation in the nucleus from fatty livers, we further examined the expression profile of p53 downstream genes such as p21, Mdm-2, and Bax α in these animals. As shown in Fig. 3, these p53-regulated genes were elevated in the livers of TgSREBP-1 mice. In contrast, only p21 was elevated in ob/ob livers, whereas Mdm-2 and Bax α were not altered in mRNA expression levels (Fig. 4a). The mRNA expression of Fas, another p53 downstream gene, was not increased in either mouse model. These data suggest that p53 activation causes the up-regulation of p21 as its target gene in livers of ob/ob and TgSREBP-1 mice, and that the mRNA expression level of p21 is a good indicator of p53 activity in fatty livers.Fig. 4p21 mRNA expression as an indicator of p53 activity parallels liver triglyceride contents. a, Northern blot analysis of p53-regulated genes in livers from WT and ob/ob mice (six male mice each) lacking SREBP-1 or p53, whose genotypes are indicated in the panel. Total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to Northern blotting, followed by hybridization with the indicated cDNA probes. A cDNA probe for 36B4 (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) was used to confirm equal loading. The quantification results obtained with BAS2000 system were normalized to the signal generated from 36B4 (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) mRNA, and the fold changes against control are displayed below each blot. b, relationship between liver triglyceride (TG) contents (on horizontal axis) and p21 mRNA expression level (on vertical axis; the same data as shown above) is plotted. Genotypes are indicated in the panel. The regression line among the points for wild type, ob/ob, ob/ob×Srebp-1+/–, and ob/ob × Srebp-1–/– is inserted. Bars, S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) p21 mRNA Expression as an Excellent Indicator of p53 Activity—To validate that the elevation of p21 in fatty liver is really caused by p53, we assessed the effects of p53 deficiency in ob/ob mice. For this purpose, we intercrossed ob/ob and p53-null mice, and we obtained six male mice deficient in both leptin and p53 (ob/ob × p53–/–) in the C57BL/6J background. These doubly homozygous mice were equally obese compared with ob/ob mice as we reported previously (22Yahagi N. Shimano H. Matsuzaka T. Najima Y. Sekiya M. Nakagawa Y. Ide T. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25395-25400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The Northern blot analysis on livers from these mice revealed that the disruption of p53 completely abolished the up-regulation of p21 mRNA expression observed in ob/ob mice to the same levels as in wild type (Fig. 4, a and b). Meanwhile, the mRNA expression levels of Mdm-2, Bax α, and Fas were not influenced by p53 disruption. These results established that p53 activation caused the elevated expression of p21 in ob/ob livers and that p21 mRNA level is a good indicator of p53 activity. Disruption of SREBP-1 Ameliorates Fatty Livers and Thereby Lowers p21 Expression—To clarify further the relationship between fatty livers and the p53-p21 pathway, we analyzed ob/ob mice deficient in SREBP-1. These mice were obtained by intercrossing of ob/ob and SREBP-1-null mice in the C57BL/6J background (13Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Ide T. Yoshikawa T. Amemiya-Kudo M. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19353-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and as we reported previously, the double homozygotes exhibit a marked improvement of fatty livers. As expected, p21 mRNA expression in livers of double homozygotes (ob/ob × Srebp-1–/–; n = 6) was decreased to near wild type levels, and heterozygotes (ob/ob × Srebp-1+/–) were at an intermediate level (Fig. 4, a and b), so the improvement of hepatic steatosis by Srebp-1 gene disruption in ob/ob mice completely paralleled the decrease in p21 expression. These results demonstrate that amelioration of fatty livers lowers the elevated expression of p21. p53 Disruption Alleviates Liver Injury of ob/ob Mice—ALT is a liver-specific enzyme that is released into the blood when hepatocytes are damaged. Therefore, plasma ALT levels are widely used as an excellent marker to evaluate liver injury, and it is well known that they are elevated in humans and animals with fatty livers including ob/ob mice. To estimate the degree of liver cell damage in ob/ob mice lacking SREBP-1, we measured plasma ALT levels in these mice. As expected, ob/ob mice without either allele of Srebp-1 gene (ob/ob × Srebp-1–/–) showed decreased levels of ALT, and heterozygotes (ob/ob × Srebp-1+/–) were at an intermediate position (Fig. 5a). These values are completely in parallel with the hepatic triglyceride contents, indicating that plasma ALT levels are a good marker for hepatic steatosis accompanied by liver injury. Next we evaluated plasma ALT in ob/ob mice deficient in p53. Notably, the double homozygotes (ob/ob × p53–/–), whose hepatic triglyceride contents were equal to those of ob/ob mice as shown in Fig. 4b, exhibited marked reduction in plasma ALT levels compared with ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that p53-mediated cytotoxicity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver injury concomitant with hepatic steatosis. Our present studies clearly demonstrate that p53 is activated to induce p21 expression in two different models of hepatic steatosis, and that the p53 pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. Although others have reported that p53 activation itself coincides with fatty liver in humans (28Akyol G. Dursun A. Poyraz A. Uluoglu O. Ataoglu O. Edaly N. Memis L. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this is the first report to describe the role of p53 in the mechanisms of hepatocellular injury accompanied by hepatic steatosis. The mechanisms of hepatocellular injury associated with steatosis have largely been unknown. It is postulated that excess fat accumulation in the liver predisposes cells to hepatocellular injury, and that this is presumably caused by the cellular toxicity of excess free fatty acids, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation (3Angulo P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar, 4Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Caldwell S.H. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1202-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). All of these can potentially activate the p53 pathway as causes of p53 activation are diverse, ranging from DNA damage to oxidative stress and hypoxia (18Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In particular, oxidative stress is currently stated to be a central mechanism of cytotoxicity in steatotic liver, and multiple potential sources of oxidative stress have been identified including cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), peroxisomal β-oxidation, mitochondrial electron leak, and ceramide production (4Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Caldwell S.H. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1202-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar, 29Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). These oxidative stresses might possibly be involved in the mechanisms of p53 activation observed in our current study. Moreover, reactive oxygen species-induced cytokine release (transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, or interleukin-8) that may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury (19Jaeschke H. Gores G.J. Cederbaum A.I. Hinson J.A. Pessayre D. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 65: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 30Crespo J. Cayon A. Fernandez-Gil P. Hernandez-Guerra M. Mayorga M. Dominguez-Diez A. Fernandez-Escalante J.C. Pons-Romero F. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) has also been shown to induce p53 activation (21Sola S. Ma X. Castro R.E. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48831-48838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Jeoung D.-I. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have reported recently (22Yahagi N. Shimano H. Matsuzaka T. Najima Y. Sekiya M. Nakagawa Y. Ide T. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25395-25400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that p53 is activated in adipocytes of ob/ob mice. It is very intriguing if one can assume that some kind of stresses brought about by excess fat accumulation compel this activation and that the same mechanisms could be turned on in case of steatotic hepatocytes. This analogy is also remarkable from the standpoint of the lipotoxicity theory proposed by Unger (29Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), where it is assumed that in the pathogenesis of obesity triglycerides overaccumulate in various tissues and exert toxic effects. The molecular mechanism by which p53 causes hepatocellular injury also remains obscure. Bax protein is reported to be implicated in the cytotoxic effects of p53 through transcriptional up-regulation (33Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and is demonstrated to be increased in ob/ob mouse liver (34Rashid A. Wu T.C. Huang C.C. Chen C.H. Lin H.Z. Yang S.Q. Lee F.Y. Diehl A.M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, we detected no elevation of Bax mRNA expression in ob/ob liver nor reduction in ob/ob mice lacking p53 (ob/ob × p53–/–), although it was induced in TgSREBP-1 mouse liver. Fas mRNA expression was not increased, which is also reported to be a p53-regulated cell surface protein known to trigger apoptosis (35Owen-Schaub L.B. Zhang W. Cusack J.C. Angelo L.S. Santee S.M. Fujiwara T. Roth J.A. Deisseroth A.B. Zhang W.W. Kruzel E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3032-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). These results are not surprising because it is known that the p53 target genes are widely divergent and tissue-dependent (36Fei P. Bernhard E.J. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7316-7327PubMed Google Scholar). As far as we examined, the only gene found to be up-regulated by p53 was p21, but it is not generally considered as a cytotoxic molecule. The actual mediator of the cytotoxic action of p53 needs to be identified in further investigations. Our findings may have good clinical implication for a therapy against fatty liver disease in that inhibition of p53 might possibly prevent steatotic hepatocytes from being damaged. Remarkably, it was recently demonstrated that inhibition of p53 protects liver tissue against endotoxin-induced hepatocellular injury (20Schafer T. Scheuer C. Roemer K. Menger M.D. Vollmar B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), increased sensitivity to which is reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease (37Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z.

https://openalex.org/W2014021788,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays a role as an intracellular mediator of the xenobiotic signaling pathway. AhR contains signals for both nuclear localization and nuclear export (NES). The objective of this study was to demonstrate how AhR intracellular distribution was regulated physiologically in cells. We found that cell density, but not the cell cycle, influenced the subcellular distribution of AhR in a keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT: AhR was predominantly nuclear at sparse cell densities, both nuclear and cytoplasmic at subconfluence, and predominantly cytoplasmic at confluence. Stable transfectants of HaCaT carrying a reporter gene fused with xenobiotic responsive element showed an association between xenobiotic responsive element-mediated transcription and AhR relocalization. Leptomycin B promoted nuclear accumulation of AhR irrespective of cell density, suggesting that this alteration may be because of a change of the regulation of the nuclear export of AhR. We found that Ser-68 in the NES of AhR was phosphorylated after nuclear accumulation of activated AhR and the nuclear export of a chimeric GST-AhR-GFP fusion protein was suppressed by substitution of a serine residue (Ser-68) to aspartic acid, which mimics the negative charge of phosphorylation. This novel cell density-dependent AhR relocalization was affected by exposure to SB203580, okadaic acid, and low Ca2+ concentrations. These findings strongly suggest that cell density regulates the intracellular localization and function of AhR, because of modulation of nuclear export activity. The p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the NES and its dephosphorylation, regulated by cell-cell contact signals, may have pivotal roles in the novel AhR relocalization. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays a role as an intracellular mediator of the xenobiotic signaling pathway. AhR contains signals for both nuclear localization and nuclear export (NES). The objective of this study was to demonstrate how AhR intracellular distribution was regulated physiologically in cells. We found that cell density, but not the cell cycle, influenced the subcellular distribution of AhR in a keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT: AhR was predominantly nuclear at sparse cell densities, both nuclear and cytoplasmic at subconfluence, and predominantly cytoplasmic at confluence. Stable transfectants of HaCaT carrying a reporter gene fused with xenobiotic responsive element showed an association between xenobiotic responsive element-mediated transcription and AhR relocalization. Leptomycin B promoted nuclear accumulation of AhR irrespective of cell density, suggesting that this alteration may be because of a change of the regulation of the nuclear export of AhR. We found that Ser-68 in the NES of AhR was phosphorylated after nuclear accumulation of activated AhR and the nuclear export of a chimeric GST-AhR-GFP fusion protein was suppressed by substitution of a serine residue (Ser-68) to aspartic acid, which mimics the negative charge of phosphorylation. This novel cell density-dependent AhR relocalization was affected by exposure to SB203580, okadaic acid, and low Ca2+ concentrations. These findings strongly suggest that cell density regulates the intracellular localization and function of AhR, because of modulation of nuclear export activity. The p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the NES and its dephosphorylation, regulated by cell-cell contact signals, may have pivotal roles in the novel AhR relocalization.

AhR is an intracellular mediator of the xenobiotic signaling pathway and remains in the cytoplasm as a complex with Hsp90 (1Denis M. Cuthill S. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 801-807Google Scholar, 2Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13802-13805Google Scholar), p23 (3Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F.

When environmental contaminants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) bind to AhR, the receptor complex subsequently translocates into the nucleus, where AhR dissociates from Hsp90 to bind to the heterodimer partner AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) (8McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Google Scholar, 9Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol.

In the nucleus, AhR/ARNT binds to xenobiotic responsive elements (XRE) (11Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Nishi C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1465-1477Google Scholar), which are enhancer DNA elements located in the 5′-flanking region of target genes. In addition to the genes for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1A1 or glutathione S-transferase Ya, several genes such as p27Kip1 (12Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1742-1753Google Scholar), AhR repressor (13Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Google Scholar), Bax (14Matikainen T. Perez G.I. Jurisicova A. Pru J. Schlezinger J.J. Ryu H-Y. Laine J. Sakai T. Korsmeyer S. Casper R.F. Sherr D.H. Tilly J.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 355-359Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase κ (15Ogi T. Mimura J. Hikida M. Fujimoto H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 943-953Google Scholar) have also been identified as target genes for the AhR/ARNT system. Analyses of AhR-deficient mice have shown that AhR is involved directly in chemical carcinogenesis caused by benzo-(a)pyrene (16Shimizu Y. Nakatsuru Y. Ichinose M. Takahashi Y. Kume H. Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 779-782Google Scholar), in teratogenesis such as cleft palate (17Mimura J. Yamashita K. Nakamura K. Morita M. Takagi N.T. Nakao K. Ema M. Sogawa K. Yasuda M. Katsuki M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 645-654Google Scholar), hepatotoxicity, and immunosuppression because of thymic involution caused by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (18Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 173-179Google Scholar). Moreover, AhR may participate in the resolution of fetal vascular structures during development (19Lahvis G. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Google Scholar), and in the normal ovarian germ-cell dynamics of mice (20Robles R. Morita Y. Mann K.K. Perez G.I. Yang S. Matikainen T. Sherr D.H. Tilly J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 450-453Google Scholar). It is also likely that AhR is involved indirectly in adverse biological responses because of endocrine disrupters in the environment by a molecular interaction of activated AhR and nuclear steroid hormone receptors such as the estrogen receptor (21Klinge C.M. Kaur K. Swanson H.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 163-174Google Scholar, 22Ohtake F. Takeyama K. Matsumoto T. Kitagawa H. Yamamoto Y. Nohara K. Tohyama C. Krust A. Mimura J. Chambon P. Yanagisawa J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kato S. Nature. 2003; 423: 545-550Google Scholar). However, despite an extensive study to elucidate the various roles of AhR, little is known of the physiological function of AhR because of a paucity of information of its endogenous ligands (23Adachi J. Mori Y. Matsui S. Takigami H. Fujino J. Kitagawa H. Miller III, C.A. Kato T. Saeki K. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31475-31478Google Scholar, 24Song J. Clagett-Dame M. Peterson R.E. Hahn M.E. Westler W.M. Sicinski R.R. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14694-14699Google Scholar). We previously identified and characterized a nuclear localization signal (NLS) of AhR as amino acid residues 13-39 (25Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Google Scholar), the bipartite core that overlapped with domains of DNA or Hsp90 binding (26Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Google Scholar, 27Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Google Scholar). Moreover, we also showed that AhR has a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) (28Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Google Scholar, 29Wen W. Meinkkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Google Scholar) that is dependent on chromosome region maintenance 1 composed of amino acid residues 55-75 in helix 2 (25Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Google Scholar), the hydrophobic core involved in heterodimer formation with ARNT. Using these two signals, AhR shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of a cell (30Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Watanabe J. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 503-509Google Scholar), and the intracellular localization of AhR may be regulated by the masking and unmasking of NLS and NES with some interacting proteins. In general, the intracellular distribution of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins such as transcription factors is also determined by the balance of nuclear import and export activity (31Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 32Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Google Scholar, 33Pennisi E. Science. 1998; 279: 1129-1131Google Scholar, 34Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Google Scholar), which is specifically regulated by various physiological or environmental signals. Molecular modulations of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (35Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Google Scholar), especially close to the NLS (36Rihs H.P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Google Scholar, 37Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Google Scholar) or NES (38Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Google Scholar, 39Lee H. Bai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5835-5845Google Scholar), by the network of signal transduction cascades, are frequently known to regulate the intracellular distribution of such proteins, resulting in spatial and temporal-specific gene regulation mediated by transcription factors. To elucidate how the nuclear import and export of AhR is regulated physiologically in cells, we used a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, which endogenously expresses both AhR and ARNT (40Wanner R. Brommer S. Czarnetzki B.M. Rosenbach T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 706-711Google Scholar). Keratinocytes are a major component of the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of skin and protects the inner organs from various stimuli of xenochemicals including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (41Sutter T.R. Guzman K. Dold K.M. Greenlee W.F. Science. 1991; 254: 415-418Google Scholar). The most prominent effect of exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in humans is the development of chloracne, a persistent acneiform condition characterized by comedones and cysts of the skin caused by a disturbance of the normal differentiation process of keratinocytes (42Moses M. Prioleau P.G. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1985; 12: 497-506Google Scholar). Because growth or differentiation of cultured keratinocytes is regulated in part by cell density, we examined the subcellular localization of AhR in HaCaT cells under various cell density conditions, and found that the cell density, but not the cell cycle, influenced not only the intracellular localization of AhR but also AhR transcriptional activation in HaCaT cells. It is likely that cell density may regulate the AhR relocalization partly by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the Ser-68 in the NES. Cell Culture—Cell lines used for this study were the human keratinocyte HaCaT kindly provided by Dr. N. Fusenig (43Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Google Scholar) and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. HaCaT cells were also cultured in DMEM in the presence of EGTA (4 mm), SB203580 (50 μm) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co., San Diego, CA), U0126 (10 μm) (Promega), and okadaic acid (200 nm) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). To reduce the Ca2+ concentration, HaCaT cells were also placed in S-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum that was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Plasmids—The XRE-driven pX4TK-Luc, containing four copies of the XRE fused with the TK promoter and luciferase, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Mimura (13Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Google Scholar). The XRE-TK fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of pEGFP-1 (Clontech Co., Palo Alto, CA) to produce pX4TK-GFP. The construction of the GST-AhR-GFP fusion gene was carried out as described previously using GST-GFP2 vector (9Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Google Scholar). Replacement of amino acid residues was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to generate AhR mutants, and each mutant was confirmed by sequencing. Immunofluorescence of AhR in HaCaT Cells—HaCaT cells were cultured with sparse distribution, subconfluence or confluence on coverslips. Leptomycin B (LMB) (5 ng/ml) (Sigma) or MC (1 μm) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka) were added to the medium for 2 h before fixation. For immunofluorescence, an anti-AhR antibody (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and an anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate were used for the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was carried out as described previously (44Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Google Scholar) using an anti-BrdUrd antibody (BIOSYS SA, Compiegne, France) and a goat antibody to rat IgG conjugated with rhodamine (Cappel, Durham, NC). Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Fractions—HaCaT cells on culture dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the cells were scraped off followed by centrifugation to collect the cells. The cell pellets were lysed in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were homogenized and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were pooled as the cytosolic fraction and the resulting pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer as the nuclear fraction. The same protein concentrations of cytosolic and nuclear fractions were used for immunoblotting analysis. Western Blotting—Samples for analysis by SDS-PAGE were lysed in SDS-lysis buffer, and the proteins were separated on appropriate concentrations of polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The probe antibodies used were as follows: anti-AhR antibodies, anti-ARNT antibodies (NOVUS, Littleton, CO), anti-CYP1A1 antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-involucrine antibodies (Sigma), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies (Promega), and anti-AhR-(61-74)-pS68 antibodies, which was produced from chemically synthesized AhR-(61-74) containing phosphoserine 68 (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Gunma, Japan). The membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and visualized by an AP Conjugate Substrate Kit (Bio-Rad). Cloning of Stable Transfectants—HaCaT cells were co-transfected with pSVneo and pX4TK-Luc or pX4TK-GFP by the Lipofectin method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). pGL3 basic (Promega) or pEGFP-1 plasmids were used for control experiments. After transfection, the cells were replated and incubated with a selection medium containing 0.8 mg/ml geneticin. Luciferase Assay—Stable HaCaT transformants containing pX4TKLuc were seeded in a 12-well plate and cultured to the appropriate cell density. The luciferase activity was determined using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was adjusted to the protein content of each sample used. The protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). In Vitro Wound Healing Model—Stable HaCaT transformants containing pX4TK-GFP were cultured to confluence, partly scraped off, and then the scraped wound was allowed to heal in vitro (45Michalik L. Desvergne B. Tan N.S. Basu-Modak S. Escher P. Rieusset J. Peters J.M. Kaya G. Gonzalez F.J. Zakany J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Duboule D. Wahli W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 799-814Google Scholar). GFP expression was examined by fluorescent microscopy. Microinjection Analysis—GST-AhR-(55-75)-GFP vector was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21, and the expressed fusion proteins were purified as described previously (9Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Google Scholar). The purified preparation of GST-AhR-(55-75)-GFP was injected into Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell nuclei along with Texas Red-labeled bovine serum albumin, which was co-injected to ensure a clean nuclear injection without leakage (25Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Google Scholar). After microinjection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before fixation with 4% formaldehyde. The injected protein was localized by fluorescence microscopy. Immunohistochemistry of Mouse Livers—Male C57BL/6 mice received an intraperitoneal injection of MC (25 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in corn oil each day for three successive days. Sections of frozen liver from MC-treated or corn oil-treated control mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and were blocked with goat serum. Colorimetric detection was performed by the protocol of the streptavidin method, using anti-AhR-(61-74)-pS68 antibody and anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) as primary and secondary antibodies. Cell Density-dependent AhR Relocalization in HaCaT Cells—To elucidate how nuclear import and export of AhR is regulated physiologically in cells, we examined the subcellular localization of AhR in HaCaT cells under the conditions of sparse distribution, subconfluence or confluence (Fig. 1A, upper panels). HaCaT cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells on a 3-cm culture dish with coverslip on day 0, and were cultured for the numbers of days indicated and then fixed. On day 2, when the cells were sparsely distributed, AhR was localized predominantly in the nucleus. On day 4, when the cells were maintained in subconfluence, the fluorescent signal of AhR was distributed equally both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, when the cells were further grown to confluence on day 6, the immunostained AhR was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. Using immunoblotting analysis, it was also shown that the relative concentration of AhR in the nucleus was gradually decreased in proportion to the cell density (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined the effect of LMB, a specific inhibitor of nuclear export, on the intracellular localization of AhR under conditions of varying cell density (Fig. 1A, middle panels). Treatment with LMB for 2 h resulted in a promoted nuclear accumulation of AhR even with high cell density, suggesting that both nuclear import activity and some potential endogenous ligands for the AhR exist even when the HaCaT cells are confluent. These observations led us to consider that AhR in HaCaT cells alter its intracellular distribution according to cell density, and this alteration may be because of a change of the regulation of the nuclear export of AhR. Because cell-to-cell communication of the HaCaT cells seems to be crucial in the novel AhR relocalization by cell density, we studied the effect of Ca2+ depression on the AhR distribution. When cells were grown to confluence on day 6 in DMEM followed by another 2-h incubation in the absence or presence of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, or incubated with Ca2+-deficient S-MEM, a clear nuclear localization of AhR was observed in the cells, in which Ca2+-dependent cell-to-cell contact was disrupted by a low concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. 1C). The disrupted cell-cell interaction was confirmed by observation of subcellular localization of E-cadherin (data not shown). To study whether the AhR nuclear localization in sparse cell density was partly because of a distribution specific to the cell cycle, S-phase cells were identified among asynchronous HaCaT cell populations on day 2 by briefly labeling with BrdUrd. As shown in Fig. 1D, a predominant nuclear localization of AhR was not associated specifically with either BrdUrd positive (S-phase) or negative cells, indicating that AhR relocalization was dependent on the cell density but not on a particular event specific in the cell cycle. AhR-mediated Transcription Is Regulated by Cell Density—To investigate whether or not altered intracellular localization of AhR because of cell density reflects AhR-mediated transcription, we established stable transfectants of HaCaT cells by introducing pX4TK-Luc, which contains four copies of the XRE fused with luciferase (Fig. 2A). Whereas the transfectant that contained the control plasmid TK-Luc did not show any activity, a transfectant containing pX4TK-Luc, Clone XRE.3, displayed luciferase activity even in the absence of exogenous ligand. The luciferase activity of XRE.3, however, was only doubled by MC treatment when compared with the activity of untreated cells. This may be explained because of the small effect of MC on the nuclear translocation of AhR in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Fig. 2B shows the XRE-driven luciferase activity in relation to the number of cultured XRE.3 cells. When XRE.3 was inoculated at 5 × 104 cells on a 3-cm culture dish on day 0, the cells were grown to reach subconfluence on day 4, and a maximal luciferase activity was observed as shown in Fig. 2B. When the cells were further grown to reach confluence on day 6, when AhR was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A), the luciferase activity was reduced to basal levels. Another clone, XRE.11, yielded similar results (data not shown). The decreased XRE-mediated transcription under high cell density was confirmed by an experiment in which different numbers of cells were inoculated on day 0 (Fig. 2C). When a large number of XRE.3 cells (1.5-3.0 × 106) were seeded in a dish and incubated for 26 h, the luciferase activity was decreased to 50% compared with when only a small number of cells (0.4 × 106) were inoculated. We also studied the effect of reseeding the confluent cells on the reactivation of luciferase (Fig. 2D). When XRE.3 cells in confluence on a 3-cm culture dish (day 6) were harvested with trypsin treatment followed by reseeding of 1.8 × 106 cells on a 6-cm culture dish on day 0, the luciferase activity increased. Fig. 2E shows a representative profile of expression of the AhR/ARNT system in combination with a target gene product CYP1A1 under varying cell density. As shown in this figure, the expression levels of AhR or ARNT did not change under different conditions of cell density. Although CYP1A1 was expressed under sparse or subconfluent conditions, the down-regulation of CYP1A1 was observed in the confluent state, similar to the decrease of luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). On the contrary, the expression of involucrine, a specific differentiation marker of keratinocytes (45Michalik L. Desvergne B. Tan N.S. Basu-Modak S. Escher P. Rieusset J. Peters J.M. Kaya G. Gonzalez F.J. Zakany J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Duboule D. Wahli W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 799-814Google Scholar), increased gradually with increased cell density. Thus, it is likely that the altered XRE-mediated luciferase activity because of cell density resulted from a novel redistribution of AhR, but not from a different expression level of AhR. XRE-mediated Transcription in a Wound-healing Model—To visualize the transcriptional activity of the AhR/ARNT system in cells, stable transfectants of HaCaT with a pX4TK-GFP expression plasmid containing XRE fused with GFP were introduced (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows a representative profile of the XRE-mediated GFP expression of a transfectant, Clone 14, under various conditions of cell density. The GFP was expressed clearly either on days 1 or 3, when the cells were maintained at low density. In contrast, the green fluorescence gradually diminished after day 5 when the cells grew to confluence or superconfluence (days 7 or 9). To further investigate the relation between cell density-dependent AhR redistribution and transcriptional activity, we carried out an experiment using an in vitro wound-healing model, which requires coordinated activities of keratinocytes such as proliferation, migration, cell-to-cell adhesion, and differentiation (46Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Google Scholar). Whether or not the cell scraping resulted in a reactivation of GFP at the injury site, the adhering superconfluent monolayer of cells displaying no fluorescence (Fig. 3B, day 9) was scraped off in part and then the cells were further cultured for 3 days. Cells initiated migration from the edge to fuse both injured edges within 24 h after injury, but GFP reactivation was not initiated (data not shown). After 3 days of culture, however, the expression of GFP was evident among the cells immediately bordering the wound margin (Fig. 3C). These observations clearly suggest that XRE-mediated transcription was selectively activated at the wound edges, where the cells seem to be loosely associated. These results support the idea that XRE-mediated transcription is influenced by cell density and suggest that the AhR/ARNT system functions in this process. Phosphorylation of Ser-68 within NES Inhibits Nuclear Export of AhR—Because cell density-dependent AhR relocalization may be because of a change of the regulation of the nuclear export of AhR, we examined which amino acid residues(s) of AhR-NES are important for the modulation of nuclear export activity. In addition to the functional NES located in the bHLH domain of AhR (25Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Google Scholar), a novel NES-like motif of AhR-(218-230) in the PAS domain was reported (47Berg P. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43231-43238Google Scholar), but direct nuclear export activity of the sequence has not been shown. Fig. 4A shows a comparison of the functional NES core of AhR-(64-73) with the corresponding region of proteins having nuclear export activity. Among them, we developed great interest in Ser-68 or Ser-73, because some transcription factors possess a Ser or Thr in their NES, which is often phosphorylated in the activated or inactivated forms. An alanine substitution mimics the dephosphorylated form of the NES, whereas an aspartic acid substitution mimics the negative charge of the phosphorylated side chain (48Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8143-8156Google Scholar). When injected into the nucleus of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, the wild type AhR-(55-75) fused with GST-GFP was found to be present in the cytoplasm and was excluded almost completely from the nucleus within 30 min. In contrast, coinjected Texas Red-labeled bovine serum albumin was localized in the nucleus. When injected into the nucleus, mutated AhR-(55-75) (S73D) retained nuclear export activity, whereas AhR-(55-75) (S68D) was unable to pass through the nuclear pore and remained in the nucleus (Fig. 4B), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-68 inhibits nuclear export activity. We produced specific antibodies against AhR-(61-74) containing phosphoserine 68 (anti-AhR-(61-74)-pS68 antibody) to test whether or not Ser-68 of the AhR was phosphorylated in the nucleus. Using in vitro binding of the antibody to phosphorylated or unphosphorylated AhR-(61-74) peptides, we confirmed that the anti-AhR-(61-74)-pS68 antibody specifically reacted with the phosphorylated peptide of AhR-(61-74) but not with the unphosphorylated AhR-(61-74) (Fig. 4C, a). When HaCaT cells were grown to confluence in DMEM, followed by another 10 h incubation with Ca2+-deficient S-MEM, a clear nuclear localization of AhR was observed as shown in Fig. 1C. After immu"

We analyzed the 5′-up-stream region of human VMD2, a gene that is preferentially expressed in the RPE and, when mutated, causes Best macular dystrophy. Transgenic mouse studies with VMD2 promoter/lacZ constructs demonstrated that a-253 to +38 bp fragment is sufficient to direct RPE-specific expression in the eye. Transient transfection assays using the D407 human RPE cell line with VMD2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs identified two positive regulatory regions, -585 to -541 bp for high level expression and -56 to -42 bp for low level expression. Mutation of a canonical E-box located in the -56 to -42 bp region greatly diminished luciferase expression in D407 cells and abolished the bands shifted with bovine RPE nuclear extract in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Independently a candidate approach was used to select microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) for testing because it is expressed in the RPE and associated with RPE abnormalities when mutated. MITF-M significantly increased luciferase expression in D407 cells in an E-box-dependent manner. These studies define the VMD2 promoter region sufficient to drive RPE-specific expression in the eye, identify positive regulatory regions in vitro, and suggest that MITF as well as other E-box binding factors may act as positive regulators of VMD2 expression.

It has many specialized functions that support and nourish photoreceptors, including important roles in retinoid metabolism (visual cycle), phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments, maintenance of the blood-retina barrier, movement of ions and water, and synthesis and transport of substances that constitute the interphotoreceptor matrix (1Bok D. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 189-195Google Scholar). The importance of the RPE in maintaining retinal photoreceptors is highlighted by the Royal College of Surgeons rat that exhibits a markedly reduced capacity for phagocytosis of outer segments by the RPE that results in the degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells (2Mullen R.J. LaVail M.M. Science. 1976; 192: 799-801Google Scholar, 3D'Cruz P.M. Yasumura D. Weir J. Matthes M.T. Abderrahim H. LaVail M.M. Vollrath D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 645-651Google Scholar). In addition, in humans, RPE dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people in western countries (4Klein R.

Ophthalmology. 2001; 108: 697-704Google Scholar).Mutations in several genes that are specifically or preferentially expressed in the RPE, such as RPE65, RLBP1, RGR, TIMP3, and VMD2, are associated with inherited human retinal dystrophies (6Redmond T.M.

Mutations in VMD2 result in Best disease (vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD)), an autosomal dominant, juvenile onset macular dystrophy characterized by a striking accumulation of lipofuscin-like material within and beneath the RPE (16Weingeist T.A. Kobrin J.L. Watzke R.C. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1982; 100: 1108-1114Google Scholar, 17Frangieh G.T. Green W.R. Fine S.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1982; 100: 1115-1121Google Scholar, 18Stone E.M. Nichols B.E. Streb L.M. Kimura A.E. Sheffield V.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 246-250Google Scholar). VMD2 encodes a multispan transmembrane protein, bestrophin, that is expressed preferentially in the RPE and functions as an oligomeric chloride channel that is thought to be responsible for the characteristic abnormality observed in the electrooculogram in patients with Best disease (19Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Google Scholar, 20Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Google Scholar).Despite the key role of the RPE in vision and the importance of the genes that are specifically or preferentially expressed in the RPE, relatively few studies have focused on the regulation of RPE gene expression. Perhaps the best studied model of RPE gene regulation to date has been the RPE65 gene (21Boulanger A. Liu S. Henningsgaard A.A. Yu S. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31274-31282Google Scholar, 22Boulanger A. Redmond T.M. Curr. Eye Res. 2002; 24: 368-375Google Scholar), which is specifically expressed in the RPE and cone photoreceptors (23Znoiko S.L. Crouch R.K. Moiseyev G. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1604-1609Google Scholar). A combination of transgenic and cell culture experiments have identified a murine promoter region sufficient for RPE-specific expression and suggested that octamer and E-box binding transcription factors may play important regulatory roles (21Boulanger A. Liu S. Henningsgaard A.A. Yu S. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31274-31282Google Scholar). The human RPE65 5′-upstream region has also been studied using sequence analyses, cell transfection assays, and DNase I footprinting (24Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644Google Scholar). Analysis of the 5′-up-stream region of the human cellular 11-cis-retinaldehyde-binding protein gene (RLBP1), which is preferentially expressed in RPE and Muller cells, suggested that a photoreceptor consensus element-1 (PCE-1, CAATTAG) located in the proximal promoter region might act as a positive regulator of RPE gene expression (25Kennedy B.N. Goldflam S. Chang M.A. Campochiaro P. Davis A.A. Zack D.J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5591-5598Google Scholar). This is interesting because PCE-1 was generally considered a photoreceptor element, and a sequence similar to PCE-1 is also present within the proximal promoter region of both human and murine Rpe65; however, its biological relevance has not yet been experimentally tested. Promoter regions have also been analyzed for genes that are expressed in the RPE but are not RPE-specific. For example, transgenic studies demonstrated that 270 bp of the murine tyrosinase gene (Tyr) upstream region is sufficient to direct cell type-specific expression and developmental regulation in melanocytes and the RPE (26Beermann F. Schmid E. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2809-2813Google Scholar). At the biochemical level, the human TYR promoter can be bound in vitro by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) with binding mediated by an M-box, which contains a core CATGTG E-box motif (27Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728Google Scholar, 28Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Takahashi K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 503-509Google Scholar). Consistent with this binding, MITF is sufficient to direct pigment cell-specific transcription of TYR (28Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Takahashi K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 503-509Google Scholar, 29Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Shibata K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8058-8070Google Scholar). MITF is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors and expressed in several cell lineages including melanocytes, RPE, osteoclasts, and mast cells (27Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728Google Scholar, 30Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Google Scholar, 31Hughes M.J.

Mice with mutations in Mitf (Mitfmi/Mitfmi) show loss of pigmentation, microphthalmia, and early onset of deafness. The RPE in these mice forms a multilayered structure resembling the neural retina, suggesting a critical role of MITF in RPE development (35Packer S.O. J. Exp. Zool. 1967; 165: 21-46Google Scholar, 36Hero I. Farjah M. Scholtz C.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 2622-2635Google Scholar, 37Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Chen C.C. Opdecamp K.

Development. 2000; 127: 3581-3591Google Scholar).To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating RPE-specific gene regulation, we analyzed VMD2 as a model system. Using a combination of transgenic and transient transfection approaches, we found that a fragment as small as -253 to +38 bp is sufficient to direct RPE-specific expression in the eye, and two regions, -585 to -541 bp and -56 to -42 bp, are important for high level and low level expression in vitro, respectively. We also present evidence that MITF as well as other E-box binding factors may act as positive regulators of VMD2 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Sequencing, and Comparison of the 5′-Upstream Region of Human and Murine Vmd2—A P1 human genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) was screened with a 32P-labeled bovine Vmd2 cDNA clone according to the company's instructions. P1 plasmid DNAs were purified from purchased Escherichia coli clones and analyzed by Southern hybridization to confirm that the clones contained the 5′-flanking region of VMD2. A 129/SvJ mouse genomic library in Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which was a kind gift from Dr. Se-Jin Lee (The Johns Hopkins University), was screened with the same bovine Vmd2 cDNA probe according to standard methods (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.60-2.121Google Scholar). Both P1 and phage DNAs were directly sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH) with 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide added in the reactions. Later the 5′-flanking sequences of both human and murine Vmd2 were also obtained from the GenBank™ at National Center for Biotechnology Information (accession number NT_033903 for human and NT_039687 for mouse).Computer programs, GeneWorks 2.5 (Oxford Molecular Group, Beaverton, OR) and Vector NTI version 7 (Invitrogen) were used for sequence alignment. To look for the presence of known transcription factor binding sites, MatInspector professional version 6.0 was used with the database of Matrix Family Library version 3.0 (Genomatix, Munich, Germany) (40Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Google Scholar).Primer Extension—Human donor eyes were obtained from eye banks through the National Disease Research Interchange. Eyes were dissected equatorially, the retina was removed, RPE cells were collected by gentle scraping, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar).Primer extension was performed according to standard procedures (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, NJ1994: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar) using 10 μg of human RPE total RNA as template with two primers complementary to VMD2 mRNA sequence. The locations of Primer A (5′-TAAGTGATGGTCATGGCCAGGCAGTGG-3′) and Primer B (5′-AGGTGGGGTTCCAGGTGGGTCCGATGATCC-3′) are shown in Fig. 1B. The end-labeled primers were annealed to RNA at 65 °C for 90 min and extended using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 65 °C for 1 h.Plasmid Construction—Four VMD2 promoter/lacZ reporter constructs were made for transgenic mouse studies. First, a 7.2-kb BamHI/SphI fragment containing 3.5 kb 5′-upstream of VMD2 was purified from human P1 DNA and subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene). Then two genomic fragments were generated by digestion with BspHI/XcmI for Construct 1 (-2948 to +38 bp) and EcoRI/XcmI for Construct 2 (-585 to +38 bp). Two shorter fragments were generated by PCR using the following primers and confirmed by sequencing: forward primer for Construct 3 (-424 to +38 bp), 5′-CATTCTTTCCATAGCCCACA-3′; forward primer for Construct 4 (-253 to +38 bp), 5′-CTCTGGATTTTAGGGCCATG-3′; reverse primer for both fragments, 5′-GGTCTGGCGACTAGGCTGGT-3′. These four fragments were blunt ligated into SmaI site upstream of lacZ gene in placF vector (a kind gift of Dr. Jacques Peschon, Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA).Fourteen VMD2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs were made for transient transfection assays, including the four fragments described above. Additional 10 fragments were generated by PCR using the primers below and confirmed by sequencing. All fragments were blunt ligated into SmaI site of pGL2-Basic vector, which contains luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers were as follows: forward primer for fragment -540 to +38 bp, 5′-TCCTTTTCAGATAAGGGCAC-3′; -500 to +38 bp, 5′-AAACCTACCCGGCGTCACCA-3′; -460 to +38 bp, 5′-GACCAGAAACCAGGACTGTT-3′; -204 to +38 bp, 5′-CCTGGTCTCAGCCCAACACC-3′; -154 to +38 bp, 5′-AGGCTGTGCTAGCCGTTGCT-3′; -104 to +38 bp, 5′-AAGGACTCCTTTGTGGAGGT-3′; -86 to +38 bp, 5′-GTCCTGGCTTAGGGAGTCAA-3′; -71 to +38 bp, 5′-GTCAAGTGACGGCGGCTCAG-3′; -56 to +38 bp, 5′-CTCAGCACTCACGTGGGCAG-3′; and -41 to +38 bp, 5′-GGGCAGTGCCAGCCTCTAAG-3′. Reverse primer for all fragments was the same as that used for transgenic constructs.Mutated VMD2 promoter/luciferase constructs were made using synthetic oligonucleotides containing a mutation (CANNTG to ACNNTA) in E-box 1 (-47 to -42 bp, designated m1), E-box 2 (-69 to -64 bp, m2), or both (m1m2) in the context of both the -104 to +38 and -71 to +38 bp fragments (Fig. 4A). Forward oligonucleotides that corresponded to -104 to -25 bp (5′-AAGGACTCCTTTGTGGAGGTCCTGGCTTAGGGAGTCAAGTGACGGCGGCTCAGCACTCACGTGGGCAGTGCCAGCCTCTA-3′) or -71 to -22 bp (5′-GTCAAGTGACGGCGGCTCAGCACTCACGTGGGCAGTGCCAGCCTCTAAGA-3′) and contained mutation m1, m2, or m1m2 were annealed to a common reverse oligonucleotide that corresponded to +38 to -41 bp (5′-GGTCTGGCGACTAGGCTGGTGGGACTCCCTGGGACTCTGTGGCCAGTGCCCCTGCCCACTCTTAGAGGCTGGCACTGCC-3′). The annealed oligonucleotides were extended to both ends by Klenow fragment, blunt ligated into SmaI site of pGL2-Basic vector, and verified by sequencing.Fig. 4Effect of mutation in E-box elements on VMD2 promoter activity. A, sequence of the VMD2 proximal promoter containing two E-box elements. The transcription start site (TS, numbered +1) is indicated by an angled arrow. Two E-box sites, E-box 1 and E-box 2, are highlighted in boldface. Mutations in E-box 1 and E-box 2 are indicated under the boldfaced consensus sequence and designated as m1 and m2, respectively. A probe for EMSA that contains E-box 1 (Probe -55/-34) is underlined. B, effect of mutation in E-box elements on VMD2 promoter activity. Luciferase constructs containing mutations in E-box elements in the context of both the -104 to +38 and -71 to +38 bp fragments as well as the constructs containing wild-type fragments and pGL2-Basic vector were transiently transfected into D407 cells. Relative luciferase activities were calculated and presented as described in Fig. 3B. The constructs containing mutations of both E-box 1 and E-box 2 are designated as m1m2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To construct an expression vector, a human MITF-M cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using human RPE total RNA as template with a forward primer containing an EcoRI site (5′-ACTGAATTCATTGTTATGCTGGAAATGCTAGA-3′) and a reverse primer containing a HindIII site (5′-AGAAAGCTTGAACAAGTGTGCTCCGTCTCTTC-3′). The cDNA fragment was then inserted into EcoRI/HindIII sites downstream of CMV promoter in pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-His B vector (Invitrogen).Generation of Transgenic Mice—The transgenic constructs were microinjected into mouse one-cell embryos (B6/SJL F2 hybrid) at the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as described previously (43Zack D.J. Bennett J. Wang Y. Davenport C. Klaunberg B. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 187-199Google Scholar). Mouse pups were screened to determine positive transgenic founders by both Southern blot analysis and PCR of tail DNAs. Ten micrograms of mouse tail DNAs were digested with BamHI and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 3.1-kb lacZ fragment according to standard procedures for Southern blotting (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.60-2.121Google Scholar). Primers for PCR were forward 5′-ACATCAGCCGCTACAGTCAA-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGAGATGCTCTTGAAGTCT-3′. Transgenic founders were mated with wild-type BALB/cJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to generate progeny with albino background.Histology, X-Gal Staining, Flat Mount, and RT-PCR Analysis for Transgenic Mice—Mice were euthanized, eyes were enucleated, and the whole eyes were fixed at 4 °C for 1 h in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for eye sections or in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for RPE/choroid flat mounts. For histochemical staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), eyes were then cryoprotected in 25% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C for 12-18 h, mounted in OCT medium (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and cut at 10 μm on a cryostat. Sections were stained in 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS at 37 °C for 12-48 h (43Zack D.J. Bennett J. Wang Y. Davenport C. Klaunberg B. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 187-199Google Scholar). Sections of non-transgenic mice were also stained by hematoxylin and eosin. For RPE/choroid flat mounts, fixed whole eyes were washed in PBS and stained in the X-gal solution at 37 °C for 24-48 h. The stained eyes were cut at the equatorial zone, the anterior portion was removed, the retina was removed, and the RPE/choroid eye cup was cut from the periphery by a pair of microsurgical scissors.To check the expression of lacZ reporter in other tissues, RT-PCR was performed using 1 μg of total RNA extracted by TRIzol from liver, brain, kidney, spleen, testis, and eye of each founder. First strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and PCR was performed using 35 cycles with the same primer set as used for the tail DNA screening. As a control for RNA and RT reaction, a cDNA fragment of ribosomal protein S16 was also amplified using forward primer 5′-CACTGCAAACGGGGAAATGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGAGATGGACTGTCGGATGG-3′.Cell Cultures and Transient Transfections—Nine human cell cultures were screened for the expression of VMD2 by RT-PCR using 1 μg of total RNA, and a 269-bp VMD2 fragment was amplified using forward primer 5′-CATAGACACCAAAGACAAAAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTGCTTCATCCCTGTTTTCC-3′. As a control, S16 was used as described above. Based on these results, three human RPE cell lines, D407 (44Davis A.A. Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner J. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Google Scholar) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and a human neuroepithelioma cell line, SK-N-MC (47Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1976; 57: 683-695Google Scholar), were selected. Each cell line was cultured in the medium suggested in the references. Cells were transfected at 40-48 h after plating into 60-mm dishes at 70-80% confluency using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA for each dish included 9 μg of a luciferase construct and 1 μg of pCMV-lacZ as an internal control for transfection efficiency. For co-transfection studies, 0, 0.5, or 2.5 μg of a human MITF-M expression vector were added to each DNA mixture, and the total amount of expression vector was adjusted to 2.5 μg by adding pcDNA3.1 vector when necessary. Transfections were performed six independent times in duplicate each time. Cell lysates were prepared at 48-60 h after transfection using 300 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (48Kumar R. Chen S. Scheurer D. Wang Q.L. Duh E. Sung C.H. Rehemtulla A. Swaroop A. Adler R. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29612-29618Google Scholar) except that Softmax Pro 2.6.1 program with SpectraMax Plus 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for β-galactosidase assay.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—RPE cells from 203 bovine eyes yielded 4.4 mg of nuclear extract by the method of Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). EMSA was performed according to standard methods as described previously (50Nie Z. Chen S. Kumar R. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2667-2675Google Scholar). For scanning EMSA, a total of 26 oligonucleotide probes, each of which was 30 bp long and overlapped the adjacent probes by 10 bp at each end, were designed in the VMD2 5′-upstream region from +50 to -280 bp (Probes 1-16) and from -400 to -610 bp (Probes 17-26). Oligonucleotide pairs complementary to each other were annealed and labeled by fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment. Labeled probe (20,000-40,000 cpm) was incubated with 3-5 μg of nuclear extracts in binding solution (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) containing either 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) on ice for 30 min and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. For supershift assays with Probe 24, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μl of each antibody at room temperature for 1 h before addition of the probe. Anti-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) antibodies used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were anti-CEBPβ (sc-746, which reacts with CEBPβ, -α, -δ, and -ϵ), anti-CEBPα (sc-9314), anti-CEBPβ (sc-150), and anti-CEBPδ (sc-151). Anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) was used as control.Two oligonucleotide probes were made corresponding to -55 to -34 bp (Fig. 4A, underlined), one with wild-type sequence and the other with mutation of E-box 1 (CACGTG to ACCGTA). For cold oligomer competition experiments, 1-, 10-, and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled annealed oligonucleotides, wild-type or E-box 1 mutation, were added to binding reactions containing 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and the mixtures were kept on ice for 10 min before adding 32P-labeled wild-type probe.RESULTSCloning and Sequence Comparison of the 5′-Upstream Region of Human and Murine Vmd2—Genomic clones corresponding to human and murine Vmd2 were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transcription start site for VMD2 was determined as 111 bp upstream from the initiation ATG by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human RPE RNA (data not shown). This result was confirmed by primer extension using two independent primers (Fig. 1A).The 5′-upstream regions of human and murine Vmd2 were sequenced 2.3 and 5.7 kb from the transcription start site, respectively. Within 2.3 kb of the 5′-flanking region of human VMD2, two repetitive sequences are present: Alu at -2391 to -2113 bp and L1 at -1471 to -1280 bp. In murine Vmd2, the B1 repeat is located at -396 to -267 bp (assuming the transcription start site based on homology to the human gene). Sequence alignment of these 5′-flanking regions of the two species demonstrated many blocks of conserved sequences particularly in three regions: -1579 to -1523, -664 to -530, and -244 bp to the 5′-untranslated region (data not shown).The VMD2 5′-upstream region contains several consensus transcription factor binding sites, including three E-box, E-box 1 (-47 to -42 bp), E-box 2 (-69 to -64 bp), and E-box 3 (-847 to -842 bp); NF1/CTF1 (-782 to -769 bp); two octamer (-420 to -413 and -591 to -584 bp); CEBP (-565 to -556 bp); and PCE-1-like (-174 to -168 bp) binding sites (Fig. 1B). Four Crx/Otx-like homeodomain protein binding sites are also present at -81 to -76, -127 to -122, -1088 to -1083, and -1553 to -1548 bp. Although many blocks of conserved sequences are seen in the 5′-upstream region between the two species, some of the above mentioned consensus sequences are not found in murine Vmd2. For instance, among three E-box sites found in VMD2, only E-box 2 is conserved in the murine gene, and neither the NF1/CTF1, CEBP, nor one octamer (-420 to -413 bp) binding site is well conserved. In contrast, a PCE-1-like sequence is identified in both species, and it differs by only one nucleotide from the consensus sequence CAATTAG. Interestingly all three E-box sites, of which a consensus is CANNTG, are flanked by 5′ ANT residues, creating ANTCANNTG, similar to the M-box in which a core CATGTG motif is flanked by specific 5′ re"
https://openalex.org/W2142484115,"Adipogenesis is dependent on the sequential activation of transcription factors including the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and steroid regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). We show that the mood stabilizing drug valproic acid (VPA; 0.5–2 mm) inhibits mouse 3T3 L1 and human preadipocyte differentiation, likely through its histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory properties. The HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) also inhibited adipogenesis, whereas the VPA analog valpromide, which does not possess HDAC inhibitory effects, did not prevent adipogenesis. Acute or chronic VPA treatment inhibited differentiation yet did not affect mitotic clonal expansion. VPA (1 mm) inhibited PPARγ induced differentiation but does not activate a PPARγ reporter gene, suggesting that it is not a PPARγ ligand. VPA or TSA treatment reduced mRNA and protein levels of PPARγ and SREBP1a. TSA reduced C/EBPα mRNA and protein levels, whereas VPA only produced a decrease in C/EBPα protein expression. Overall our results highlight a role for HDAC activity in adipogenesis that can be blocked by treatment with VPA.

Overall VPA is well tolerated, with common side effects including tremor, sedation, alopecia, and weight gain (1Macritchie K. Geddes J.R. Scott J. Haslam D. de Lima M. Goodwin G. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2003; CD004052Google Scholar). The mechanism of action for these efficacious and deleterious effects remains to be elucidated and is most likely multifactorial. The specific effects of VPA on neurotransmitter systems, most notably γ-aminobutyric acid signaling, as well as other cell signaling pathways, explain some of the mechanisms by which VPA exerts its effects in humans, rodents, and cell culture systems (2Coyle J.T. Duman R.S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 157-160Google Scholar). For example, VPA has histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory effects that are the likely cause of VPA teratogenicity (3Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36734-36741Google Scholar, 4Gottlicher M. Minucci S. Zhu P. Kramer O.H. Schimpf A. Giavara S. Sleeman J.P. Lo Coco F. Nervi C. Pelicci P.G. Heinzel T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6969-6978Google Scholar). In addition, inositol depletion contributes to VPA inhibition of sensory neuronal growth cone formation in vitro (5Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Google Scholar). Up to 70% of adult patients receiving VPA treatment gain weight (5–14 kg) (6Jallon P. Picard F. Drug Saf. 2001; 24: 969-978Google Scholar). This is cause for concern because of the increasing number of off label uses for VPA, such as migraine headache and neuropathic pain, and the increased health risk and decreased compliance rate associated with weight gain (6Jallon P. Picard F. Drug Saf. 2001; 24: 969-978Google Scholar, 7Vanina Y. Podolskaya A. Sedky K. Shahab H. Siddiqui A. Munshi F. Lippmann S. Psychiatr. Serv. 2002; 53: 842-847Google Scholar, 8Aronne L.J. Segal K.R. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2003; 64: 22-29Google Scholar). Clinically evaluating patient age, sex, familial predisposition to weight gain, changes in dietary habits, and VPA dosage have failed to reveal predictive factors for VPA-induced weight gain. In attempting to generate animal models of VPA-induced weight gain, we and others have demonstrated that VPA does not cause weight gain in mice (9Chapman J.B. Cutler M.G. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1984; 83: 390-396Google Scholar) or rats (10Wolden-Hanson T. Gidal B.E. Atkinson R.L. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 1075-1081Google Scholar, 11Lagace D.C. Nachtigal M.W. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 27: 587-594Google Scholar); however, VPA can induce a significant increase in body weight in female rhesus monkeys (12Ferin M. Morrell M. Xiao E. Kochan L. Qian F. Wright T. Sauer M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2908-2915Google Scholar), suggesting that this side effect may be a characteristic of primate physiology. There is currently no clear mechanism to explain how VPA causes weight gain. VPA can inhibit both class I and II HDACs, with a high potency for class I HDACs (4Gottlicher M. Minucci S. Zhu P. Kramer O.H. Schimpf A. Giavara S. Sleeman J.P. Lo Coco F. Nervi C. Pelicci P.G. Heinzel T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6969-6978Google Scholar). The role of HDAC activity in adipocyte differentiation is not well defined; however, recent work has highlighted a requirement for reduced HDAC activity for transcriptional activation of adipogenic genes in vitro (13Fajas L. Egler V. Reiter R. Hansen J. Kristiansen K. Debril M.B. Miard S. Auwerx J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 903-910Google Scholar). We demonstrate that VPA treatment inhibits mouse 3T3-L1 and human adipocyte differentiation. Adipocytes differentiate from preadipocytes via a well defined series of transcriptional events involving several key transcription factors, including members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and steroid regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) (14Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref Google Scholar). Inhibition of differentiation by VPA is characterized by diminished PPARγ and SREBP1a mRNA and protein. The mRNA levels for C/EBPα were not affected by VPA treatment; however, there was a significant reduction in C/EBPα protein levels. Experiments using either the structurally unrelated HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or valpromide (VPM), an amide analog of VPA that does not inhibit HDACs, support the hypothesis that HDAC activity is required for initiation of adipogenesis. Cell Culture and Differentiation—Mouse 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and subcultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). The medium was changed every 2 days, and the preadipocytes were maintained at <50% confluence. For 3T3-L1 differentiation experiments, 2 days after preadipocytes reached confluence they were treated with medium to induce differentiation (MDI: DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; CanSera), 250 nmol/liter dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 nmol/liter 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and 100 nmol/liter (0.58 μg/ml) human insulin (Roche Applied Science)). After 2 days in MDI, the preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 5 μg/ml insulin. Subsequent medium changes occurred every second day. VPA and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PB) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, whereas VPM and TSA were dissolved in Me2SO and applied as indicated in figure legends. Me2SO levels were kept under 0.1%. For PPARγ agonist-induced differentiation, preadipocytes (2 days post-confluent) were treated with DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 nmol/liter insulin, and a PPARγ agonist (troglitazone (TGZ; 5 nm or 10 nm) or rosiglitazone (ROS; BRL49653, 250 nm or 1 μm)). After 2 days the medium was changed to DMEM, 10% FBS, 5 μg/ml insulin, and the PPARγ agonist. Subsequent medium changes occurred every 2 days with medium containing the PPARγ agonist. Human adipocyte experiments were conducted by Zen-Bio Inc. (Contract DAL040403). Primary human preadipocytes were obtained from patients undergoing liposuction surgery. Two lots of cells were used including those from an individual (L091901, male, 48 years old, body mass index of 25.07) and a mixed lot (SL0023, six female individuals, average age of 48, average body mass index of 26.07). Details for preadipocyte differentiation can be found at www.zen-bio.com. For each experiment, a control consisting of a triplicate set of cells treated with 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α was included. The addition of ROS, Zen-Bio PPARγ agonist, or tumor necrosis factor α was included with each medium change. Oil Red O Staining—The cells were stained with Oil Red O and quantified as previously described by Kasturi and Joshi (15Kasturi R. Joshi V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12224-12230Google Scholar). Stain bound to lipid droplets was extracted with isopropanol, and the absorbance of the dye-triglyceride complex was measured at 520 nm. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—The cells were pulsed labeled with [3H] thymidine (2 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 1 h prior to harvesting (1, 10, 20, or 30 h after the induction of differentiation), similar to the method of Tang and Lane (16Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were placed on ice and rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. To precipitate the DNA, the cells were incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with absolute alcohol at room temperature and allowed to air dry at room temperature for 2 h. DNA was extracted using 0.1 m NaOH for at least 1 h at room temperature, and radioactivity was counted in acidified scintillation fluid. Analysis of Lipid Synthesis—The cells were pulse labeled with [14C] acetic acid (250 nCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. [14C] acetic acid will be metabolized and incorporated into acetyl CoA, which is subsequently incorporated into newly synthesized triacylglycerol. The cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of methanol:water (5:4, v/v) and sonicated. The organic and aqueous phases were extracted using chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) with 0.58% NaCl. The organic phase was washed three times with ideal upper phase buffer (0.57% methanol:NaCl:choloroform, 45: 47:3, v/v/v), evaporated, and then resuspended in chloroform. Radiolabeled lipids were resolved by TLC in petroleum ether:diethyl ether: acetic acid (60:40:1, v/v/v). Standards were identified using iodine staining, and the TLC plates were exposed to film. Radiolabeled lipids identified by co-migration with authentic standards were scraped into vials and quantified by scintillation counting. Northern Analysis—RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated on a 1.5% agarose, 0.67% formaldehyde gel and transferred to BrightStar Plus membrane (Ambion Inc.). The mouse PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP1a cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (2 μCi/ml) using the Strip-EZ DNA probe synthesis and removal kit (Ambion). The blots were incubated with probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml) in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) overnight and washed, and the signals were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. Western Analysis—The cells were washed two times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the extracts were isolated using high salt lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, clarified by centrifugation (10 min at 15 000 × g), and quantified by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad). For SREBP1a analysis, the cells were treated for 4 h before harvesting and again during lysis with 25 μg/ml of the proteasome inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucine-leucine-norleucinal (Sigma). Twenty to forty micrograms of protein/lane were used for Western analysis. The proteins were detected with antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. including anti-PPARγ (E-8), anti-SREBP1a (2A4), anti-C/EBPα (14AA), or rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (Sigma). After washing in Tris-buffered saline, the blots were incubated with sheep anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International). Protein expression was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and signal-quantified using NIH Image software. Western blots were stripped in stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min at 50 °C, washed, blocked, and reprobed. Transient Transfection and PPAR-LBD Assay—Reporter gene assays were completed in HepG2 cells maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were plated in 24-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well the day prior to transfection. The cells were transfected in triplicate with the mammalian transfection mixture of 200 ng of reporter plasmid FR-luc, 100 ng of internal reference plasmid pCMV β-galactosidase, and 12.5 ng of either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain expression plasmid (BD-Gal4) or the expression plasmid for GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused with the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (PPAR-Gal4) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The subsequent day, the cells were treated overnight with compounds. Twenty hours after the addition of drugs, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined using the Enhanced Luciferase assay kit (BD Pharmingen). The results were normalized using β-galactosidase activity and represent the mean data from three independent experiments. VPA Inhibits Adipocyte Differentiation—To determine whether VPA could induce adipocyte differentiation, mouse 3T3-L1 cells were cultured for 2 days in DMEM containing 10% FBS, insulin, and VPA (1 or 5 mm). After 13 days in culture, there were very few cells staining red with Oil Red O, which binds to triacylglycerol (TAG) in fat droplets, a hallmark of adipocyte formation (Fig. 1A, left panel; for a higher magnification, see Fig. 1B). As a positive control, the cells induced to differentiate in medium consisting of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and insulin (MDI) but no VPA, contained numerous lipid droplets (Fig. 1A). These data show that chronic VPA treatment was unable to induce differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. We next examined the effect of VPA treatment on MDI-induced preadipocyte differentiation. Daily treatment with VPA significantly inhibited MDI-induced adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner; shown by the decrease in lipid content measured 13 days after the initiation of differentiation (Fig. 1, A and C). Under higher magnification, almost 100% of MDI-treated cells displayed lipid droplet formation, whereas in the presence of MDI and VPA, there was a reduction in the number of cells that had lipid droplet formation (Fig. 1B, right panels). To quantify the decrease in TAG levels following daily treatment with VPA, the cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]acetic acid at day 13 post-differentiation in the presence or absence of VPA. Chronic VPA treatment resulted in an average significant decrease in TAG synthesis by 51% (untreated 21,723 ± 4,782 dpm/mg protein versus 1 mm VPA 10,698 ± 2,855 dpm/mg protein, p < 0.001). In addition to working with 3T3-L1 cells, Zen-Bio Inc. was contracted to conduct a double-blind study to examine the effects of VPA on differentiation of primary human subcutaneous preadipocyte cultures in vitro. Similar to the studies in 3T3-L1 cells, the effect of VPA on adipocyte differentiation was measured both in the absence and presence of differentiation inducing media (Zen-DIM). These studies were conducted on two cell lots, one from a single individual (L091901) and the other from a pooled sample containing adipocytes from six individuals (SL0023). In both lots VPA by itself did not induce differentiation of human preadipocytes, rather it inhibited differentiation in the presence of Zen-DIM (Fig. 2A). Lot L091901 exhibited some differentiation in the absence of Zen-DIM, which was also inhibited by VPA treatment (Fig. 2A). Quantification of TAG levels revealed that VPA inhibited differentiation in a dose-dependent manner more effectively than tumor necrosis factor α, a known inhibitor of preadipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2B). Collectively these data show that in both mouse and human cells chronic VPA treatment inhibits adipocyte differentiation. We then examined whether the inhibitory effects of VPA on 3T3-L1 differentiation occurred following a single treatment with VPA. When 1 mm VPA was added once concurrent with MDI at the onset of differentiation, VPA reduced adipocyte formation (Fig. 3A). This finding suggested that VPA treatment might affect critical steps that occur at the onset of differentiation. After reaching confluence preadipocytes become quiescent; however, in response to differentiation media they undergo mitotic clonal expansion. Because inhibition of mitotic clonal expansion can inhibit differentiation we measured whether VPA affected re-entry into the cell cycle. Measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA, differentiating preadipocytes exhibited a well characterized entry into and exit from S phase of the cell cycle at ∼12–16 h following addition of the MDI (Fig. 3B). In the presence of VPA, this curve remains unchanged, indicating that VPA does not affect mitotic clonal expansion. Daily VPA treatment beginning after the removal of the MDI (days 3–13) caused the inhibition of differentiation to the same extent as VPA treated concurrently with the MDI (day 0–2) (Fig. 3C). Daily VPA treatment beginning 7 days after the initiation of differentiation (day 7–13) also reduced Oil Red O levels; however, this reduction was not significant compared with untreated cells. These results suggest that VPA is affecting critical events that occur both at the onset of differentiation, as well as events required during the initial maturation of the adipocytes. VPA Inhibits PPARγ-induced Differentiation—PPARγ agonists induce differentiation of adipocytes, whereas PPARγ antagonists inhibit differentiation (17Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Google Scholar). The PPARγ ligands TGZ and the more potent ROS were used to induce the differentiation of 3T3-L1 and human preadipocytes. When co-treated with VPA and either TGZ or ROS, differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was inhibited by 60 and 43%, respectively (Fig. 4A), suggesting that VPA can inhibit differentiation mediated by PPARγ. In support of these findings, VPA was also able to inhibit ROS-induced differentiation of human preadipocytes, assessed by TAG levels (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, VPA inhibited differentiation of human preadipocytes when differentiation was induced with 10 μm Zen-Bio proprietary non-thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonist. 2D. C. Lagace and M. W. Nachtigal, unpublished observations. These data show that VPA inhibits PPARγ-induced differentiation in mouse and human preadipocytes. VPA Is Not a PPARγ Ligand—Because of the ability of VPA to block PPARγ-induced differentiation, we conducted reporter assays to assess whether VPA interacted with the LBD of PPARγ. Because TGZ and ROS had equivalent activities, these experiments were conducted using TGZ. VPA induced a weak activation of the PPARγ-LBD chimeric construct (PPAR-Gal4), compared with a greater than 40-fold increase by TGZ (Fig. 4C). The VPA-induced fold increase in PPAR-Gal4 was similar to the increase in activation of the control plasmid (BD-Gal4) lacking the PPARγ-LBD. These results suggest that VPA may nonspecifically increase the activation of PPAR-Gal4. VPA increases the activity of many reporter genes in transient transfection experiments and is suggested to be due to VPA acting as a HDAC inhibitor (4Gottlicher M. Minucci S. Zhu P. Kramer O.H. Schimpf A. Giavara S. Sleeman J.P. Lo Coco F. Nervi C. Pelicci P.G. Heinzel T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6969-6978Google Scholar). We found that the HDAC inhibitor TSA induces a similar fold increase as VPA in BD-Gal4 and PPAR-Gal4 reporter activity (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that nonspecific activation of reporter genes may be due to an indirect effect of HDAC inhibitors. PPARγ partial agonists or antagonists can inhibit 3T3-L1 differentiation. Because VPA inhibits 3T3-L1 differentiation, we examined the effect of VPA on the dose-response curve for TGZ-induced PPARγ activity to determine whether VPA may be acting as a PPARγ partial agonist or antagonist. TGZ dose-dependently induced PPARγ activity with a mean fold induction of luciferase activity ranging from 23 ± 2.5 to 35 ± 5.2 (Fig. 4D). If VPA was acting as a partial agonist or antagonist, it should inhibit TGZ activity. VPA induced a mean 2.5 ± 0.23-fold increase (Fig. 4F) in TGZ-induced PPARγ activity (range, 53 ± 6.3 to 72 ± 16.0 (Fig. 4D)); however, this fold increase by VPA was similar to the increase in BD-Gal4 reporter activity (Fig. 4, E and F). Unlike VPA, TGZ did not induce the control BD-Gal4 reporter. TSA had similar effects as VPA in inducing an ∼2-fold increase in TGZ-activated PPARγ and BD-Gal4 reporter activity.2 These data imply that VPA (0.5–2 mm) does not act as a PPARγ partial agonist or antagonist, most likely producing its effects through its HDAC inhibitory activity. VPA Treatment Inhibits PPARγ and SREBP1a mRNA Levels—The onset of differentiation in adipocytes involves activation of gene expression including C/EBPα/β/δ, PPARγ, and SREBP1a. Northern analysis was conducted to determine whether the reduction in differentiation by VPA was accompanied by changes in gene expression. Prior to the onset of differentiation, preadipocytes have undetectable levels of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and SREBP1a mRNA (Fig. 5A). Twenty-four hours following the initiation of differentiation, a weak signal for the three transcripts was detectable. At days 1, 2, and 5 following the initiation of differentiation, VPA-treated cells had reduced levels of PPARγ and SREBP1a mRNA, and no change in C/EBPα mRNA levels compared with control cells (Fig. 5, A and B). We found that VPA reduced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels at days 2 and 5 by 33 ± 6 and 29 ± 8%, respectively, and therefore could not use it to normalize for equal loading. Because there was no change in C/EBPα levels at days 2 and 5 following treatment, it is unlikely that the reduction in PPARγ and SREBP1a gene expression is due to unequal loading; confirmed by 18 S rRNA loading (Fig. 5A). VPA Treatment Reduces PPARγ, SREBP1a, and C/EBPα Protein Levels—To determine whether VPA-induced a concomitant reduction in mRNA and protein levels for PPARγ, total cell protein lysates were obtained from cells treated with VPA 1, 3, and 5 days after addition of the MDI medium. PPARγ has two isoforms (PPARγ1 and PPARγ2) that are undetectable in preadipocytes (day 0), are expressed at low levels 1 day following initiation of differentiation (day 1), and are clearly detectable at all time points tested after day 3 (Fig. 6A). VPA treatment caused a reduction in PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, with a maximum reduction greater than 50% on day 7 (Fig. 6C). After detection of PPARγ, the blots were stripped and incubated with an antibody against C/EBPα, which detects both the 42- and 30-kDa alternative translation products. Although C/EBPα proteins were undetected in preadipocytes, a signal was detected at day 1 of differentiation and increased throughout differentiation, days 3–5 (Fig. 6A). Compared with untreated cells, daily VPA treatment reduced the amount of p42 and p30 C/EBPα protein (Fig. 6C), which was surprising because no changes in C/EBPα mRNA levels were detected in the presence of VPA. The precursor (P; 125 kDa) and the cleaved (C; 68 kDa) forms of SREBP1a were detected in differentiating adipocytes (Fig. 6B). In comparison with the expression of the SREBP1a(P), which appears 1 day after inducing differentiation, SREBP1a(C) was detected at later time points, with higher amounts of expression at day 4 and 7. Daily VPA treatment did not have an effect on the amount of SREBP1a(P) but consistently decreased the SREBP1a(C) at day 4 and later time points (Fig. 6, B and C). HDAC Inhibition and Adipogenesis—We sought to determine whether other HDAC inhibitors had similar effects on adipogenesis and confirm whether VPA treatment in our model was associated with HDAC inhibition. Similar to VPA, daily TSA (3 nm) or 4-PB (1.5 mm) treatment inhibited 3T3-L1 differentiation (Fig. 7, A and B). The dose of VPA, TSA, and 4-PB was chosen based on the known HDAC IC50 for these compounds (3Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Klein P.S. J. Biol.

For hydroxamic acid compounds such as TSA the in vitro HDAC IC50 is within the nm-μm range, whereas short chain fatty acids such as VPA and 4-PB have HDAC IC50 in the mm range (21de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Google Scholar, 22Thiagalingam S. Cheng K.H. Lee H.J. Mineva N. Thiagalingam A. Ponte J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 84-100Google Scholar). Because the effect of TSA and 4-PB were similar, future experiments were conducted using TSA, a more potent and commonly used HDAC inhibitor. Similar to VPA, TSA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 7C). In comparison with VPA, VPM (1 mm), an amide analog of VPA that does not inhibit HDAC activity, did not significantly affect 3T3-L1 differentiation (Fig. 7, A and B). To examine the HDAC inhibitory activity of VPA, we treated 3T3-L1 cells with VPA (1 mm), TSA (3 nm), or VPM (1 mm) daily and assessed histone acetylation at days 3 and 7 following initiation of differentiation. Compared with untreated cells, VPA and TSA induced histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 7D). Some histone H3 acetylation was observed in VPM-treated cells, but the levels were consistently less than that produced by VPA or TSA (Fig. 7D). We determined whether the reduction in adipocyte differentiation by TSA affected C/EBPα, PPARγ, and SREBP1a protein and mRNA expression. TSA reduced PPARγ1, PPARγ2, p42 and p30 C/EBPα, and the cleaved form of SREBP1a(C) but not SREBP1a(P) (Fig. 8, A and B). In contrast to the effects of VPA or TSA, VPM treatment, which does not inhibit differentiation, did not affect protein expression (Fig. 8A). Similar to VPA-treated cells, TSA treatment caused reduced levels of PPARγ (average reduction, 23 ± 7%) and SREBP1a (average reduction, 18 ± 11%) mRNA levels (Fig. 8C). Unlike VPA treatment, which had no effect on C/EBPα mRNA levels, TSA treatment reduces C/EBPα mRNA levels (average reduction, 37 ± 5%), and VPM had no effect on mRNA levels compared with untreated cells (Fig. 8C). Our results show that VPA treatment prevents mouse and human adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Pharmacologic manipulation of HDAC activity with TSA and 4-PB inhibited preadipocyte differentiation, whereas VPM did not, leading to the notion that the HDAC inhibitory properties of VPA may be responsible for blocking adipogenesis. TSA treatment reduced mRNA levels for PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP1a, whereas VPA treatment reduced PPARγ and SREBP1a mRNA but not C/EBPα mRNA levels. Inhibition of differentiation by VPA and TSA was accompanied by a reduction in TAG and decreased protein levels for PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP1a. Based on these results, we hypothesize that HDAC activity is required for adipocyte differentiation. The role of HDACs during adipocyte differentiation remains largely unknown compared with their role in the differentiation of other cell types such as skeletal muscle (21de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2025179963,"The current model of immune activation in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that fungi and Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria activate the Toll/Dif pathway and that Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria activate the Imd/Relish pathway. To test this model, we examined the response of Relish and Dif (Dorsal-related immunity factor) mutants to challenge by various fungi and G(+) and G(-) bacteria. In Relish mutants, the Cecropin A gene was induced by the G(+) bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, but not by other G(+) or G(-) bacteria. This Relish-independent Cecropin A induction was blocked in Dif/Relish double mutant flies. Induction of the Cecropin A1 gene by M. luteus required Relish, whereas induction of the Cecropin A2 gene required Dif. Intact peptidoglycan (PG) was necessary for this differential induction of Cecropin A. PG extracted from M. luteus induced Cecropin A in Relish mutants, whereas PGs from the G(+) bacteria Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis did not, suggesting that the Drosophila immune system can distinguish PGs from various G(+) bacteria. Various fungi stimulated antimicrobial peptides through at least two different pathways requiring Relish and/or Dif. Induction of Attacin A by Geotrichum candidum required Relish, whereas activation by Beauvaria bassiana required Dif, suggesting that the Drosophila immune system can distinguish between at least these two fungi. We conclude that the Drosophila immune system is more complex than the current model. We propose a new model to account for this immune system complexity, incorporating distinct pattern recognition receptors of the Drosophila immune system, which can distinguish between various fungi and G(+) bacteria, thereby leading to selective induction of antimicrobial peptides via differential activation of Relish and Dif."
https://openalex.org/W2039874250,"Protein assembly is a critical process involved in a wide range of cellular events and occurs through extracellular and/or transmembrane domains (TMs). Previous studies demonstrated that a GXXXG motif is crucial for homodimer formation. Here we selected the TMs of ErbB1 and ErbB2 as a model since these receptors function both as homodimers and as heterodimers. Both TMs contain two GXXXG-like motifs located at the C and N termini. The C-terminal motifs were implicated previously in homodimer formation, but the role of the N-terminal motifs was not clear. We used the ToxR system and expressed the TMs of both ErbB1 and ErbB2 containing only the N-terminal GXXXG motifs. The data revealed that the ErbB2 but not the ErbB1 construct formed homodimers. Importantly, a synthetic ErbB1 TM peptide was able to form a heterodimer with ErbB2, by displacing the ErbB2 TM homodimer. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by using three controls: (i) Two single mutations within the GXXXG-like motif of the ErbB1 peptide reduced or preserved its activity, in agreement with similar mutations in glycophorin A. (ii) A TM peptide of the bacterial Tar receptor did not assemble with the ErbB2 construct.

Understanding the interactions involved in peptide-peptide recognition within the membrane milieu is therefore an important task. Despite advances, the limited number of studies conducted report mainly on homodimerization and not on heterodimerization of TM segments in vitro and in vivo (1Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F.

A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) system. To our knowledge, only a few studies reported on hetero-association of TM domains in vivo. These studies include: (i) introducing exogenous TM peptide mutants of glycophorin A (GPA) to the ToxR system, which expresses the TM domain of glycophorin A, and observing a dominant negative effect (9Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31229-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); and (ii) the study of hetero-association of the TM domain α and β integrin subunits, using the GALLEX system (10Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct identification of two assembly motifs within a single TM domain has not been reported. For this purpose, we investigated the recognition patterns of the ErbB receptor family TM domains. This single span TM receptor family (type I), which is involved in a variety of cell processes, is also implicated in several types of cancer (11Hurwitz E. Klapper L.N. Wilchek M. Yarden Y. Sela M.

Cancer. 1991; 48: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Homodimerization of these receptors has been known to be a prerequisite for signal transduction for over a decade (13Yarden Y.

Cell transformation and cancer can be induced by overexpression of the ErbB receptors (15Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A.

Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Lately, it was established that the heterodimerization of different ErbB receptors in a ligand-dependant manner is responsible for the proper transmittance of signals into the cell (18Brandt B.H. Roetger A. Dittmar T. Nikolai G. Seeling M. Merschjann A. Nofer J.R. Dehmer-Moller G. Junker R. Assmann G. Zaenker K.S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6093-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The TMs of these receptors by themselves were shown to adopt a monomeric form in vitro in some cases (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In another case, the extracellular domain was demonstrated to be involved in homo- but not heterodimerization of the ErbB receptors (24Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, the TM domains of ErbB1–4 were shown to homodimerize in vivo (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM domains contain two GXXXG-like motifs (Fig. 1). Mutations corresponding to the GPA G83I mutant (the second Gly position was mutated to Ile) suggested that the site II motif is responsible for homodimerization of both ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM segments. On the other hand, the results of mutation within site I are less clear (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). More precisely, the site I motif seems to play a role in homodimerization of ErbB2 but not in that of ErbB1. This is in agreement with studies were a Glu or Gln mutation was introduced into the Val position within the site I motif (25Carpenter C.D. Ingraham H.A. Cochet C. Walton G.M. Lazar C.S.

Here we used a ToxR system combined with synthetic TM peptides to shed light on the possible role of the TM domains in the assembly process of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors. Our findings demonstrate a role for the site I motif in the homodimer formation by ErbB2 but not ErbB1 and in the heterodimer assembly of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Three ErbB1 peptides, as well as the aspartate receptor peptide, were synthesized by a standard Fmoc solid-phase method on a Rink methyl benzhydril amide resin (27Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23602-23607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid and were purified by RP-HPLC on a C4 reverse phase Bio-Rad semipreparative column (250 × 10 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). The purified peptides were shown to be homogeneous (>99%) by analytical HPLC. The compositions of the peptides were confirmed by Platform LCZ electrospray mass spectrometry. A guest host system of 4 lysines was used to ensure the solubility of the TM segment (29Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Labeling of Peptides—The Fmoc protecting group was removed from the N terminus of the resin-bound peptides by incubation with piperidine for 12 min, whereas all the other reactive amine groups of the attached peptides were kept protected. The resin-bound peptides were washed twice with dimethylformamide and then treated with rhodamine (2 equivalents) in anhydrous dimethylformamide containing 2% N,N-diisopropylethylamine, leading to the formation of a resin-bound N-rhodamine peptide. After 24 h, the resin was washed thoroughly with dimethylformamide and then with methylene chloride. The labeled peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified as described above. Maltose Complementation Assay—Membrane insertion and correct orientation of the various ToxR chimera constructs (GPA, A16, ErbB1, ErbB2, and ΔTM) were examined as described previously (30Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, PD28 cells were transformed with the different plasmids and cultured overnight. The cells were washed twice with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. They were then used to inoculate M9 minimal medium, with 0.4% maltose, at a 200-fold dilution. Cell density at 650 nm was measured at different time intervals. In Vivo Detection of Homo- and Heterodimerization of Proteins in the Membrane—The ToxR transcription activator can be used successfully to assess weak protein-protein interactions within the Escherichia coli membrane. Previously, a TM-encoding DNA cassette was inserted on a plasmid, between the maltose-binding protein and the ToxR transcription activator (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Dimerization of the TM domains results in association and activation of the ToxR transcription factor, which then becomes active and is able to bind the ctx promoter. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli FHK12 cells, which contain β-galactosidase under the control of a ctx promoter. After transforming FHK12 cells, 1 ml of cultures (8 repeats) were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol and 0.1 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 37 °C. β-galactosidase activity was quantified in crude cell lysates after the addition of o-nitrophenylgalactoside and monitoring the reaction at 405 nm for 20 min in 30-s intervals at 28 °C. Specific β-galactosidase activity was measured in Miller units (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Hetero-association was detected using ToxR-GPA grown in the presence of an exogenous peptide (Fig. 2). Inhibition was calculated as follows. I=1−Apeptide−AbaselineAmax−Abaseline(Eq. 1) where I is the inhibitory ability of the peptide, Apeptide is the activity of ToxR-GPA in the presence of peptide, Amax is the maximal activity of ToxR-GPA without peptide, and Abaseline is the baseline activity of the monomer A16 plasmid (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). IC50 was calculated by fitting normalized data to the Langmuir equation (Equation 3) in the Origin 6.0 commercial program (31Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Hong L.H. Carr P.A. Kim P.S. Cell. 1999; 99: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). AA+B⟺A+AB(Eq. 2) I=ϕ+ϕ∗IC50[B]+IC50(Eq. 3) where A represents the ToxR-GPA transcription factor, B represents the exogenous peptide, and I represents inhibition of β-galactosidase activity. This modified model has a new scaling constant ϕ that takes into account the fact that exogenous peptides can homo-oligomerize into several oligomeric states. Differences between the exogenous peptides will most likely result in a different equilibrium between the different homo-oligomerization states. If one of these oligomers can interact with the dimer ToxR receptor, it may inactivate the receptor. Thus, the effective concentration of the active receptor available for interaction with the monomeric form of the peptide can vary. This will lead to different saturation levels for the inhibition by different peptides. ToxR-GPA Protein Expression Levels by Western Blot—FHK12 cells were grown in the presence or absence of ErbB1, and then 10-μl samples were added to 2× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and then blotted. The primary antibody used was anti-maltose-binding protein. The detection was done with the Phototope-HRP Western blot detection system from Cell Signaling Technology. Peptide Partitioning into FHK12 Membrane—Partitioning of rhodamine-labeled ErbB1 to the inner membrane of E. coli was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. FHK12 bacteria from the control of the association assay were diluted 1:10,000 and incubated with rhodamine-labeled ErbB1, final concentration of 500 nm, for 2 h. Samples were fixed by the addition of agarose gel at a final concentration of 0.25% in phosphate-buffered saline. The agarose, as opposed to cross-linking, does not cause an increase of autofluorescence during the time scale of the experiment. Confocal images were obtained using an Olympus IX70 FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Care was taken that any photobleaching did not compromise the interpretation, and laser irradiation and other illumination were prevented between acquisitions. The confocal images were obtained at 12-bit resolution. We investigated the ErbB TM domains as a model for a TM with two recognition motifs. Our objective was to find out whether the two motifs have a distinct role in the homodimerization or heterodimerization. For this purpose, we have prepared 16-amino-acid long ToxR constructs of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM domains (Table I). These two constructs contain the site I motif but not the site II motif. The latter was previously demonstrated to control homodimerization of ErbB1 and ErbB2 TMs (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, we could use the ErbB1 and ErbB2 constructs to isolate and investigate the site I motif for both its homodimerization and its heterodimerization propensities in our modified ToxR system (9Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31229-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In addition, we chemically synthesized three ErbB1 peptides and an additional unrelated peptide corresponding to the TM of the E. coli aspartate receptor (Tar-FG) to serve as a negative control. The designations and sequences of the peptides are shown in Table II. The peptides were investigated for their propensity to recognize the ErbB2 TM domain.Table IToxR constructs investigatedConstruct designationTM sequenceErbB1aThe site I N terminal GXXXG like motifs are marked with bold and underlined letters645SIATGMVGALLLLLVV660ErbB2651LTSIVSAVVGILLVVV666Tar-1bTar-1 is a homodimer forming TM domain from the bacterial aspartate receptor (35)13MVLGVFALLQLISGSL28A16 (control)1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA16GPA (control)74LIIFGVMAGVIGT86a The site I N terminal GXXXG like motifs are marked with bold and underlined lettersb Tar-1 is a homodimer forming TM domain from the bacterial aspartate receptor (35Sal-Man N.

These bacteria are unable to grow on minimal M9 medium containing maltose without the presence of a properly inserted ToxR-TM-MalE chimera protein on the inner membrane. We followed the PD28 growth curve for 60 h, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The PD28 bacteria survived and proliferated when transformed with the ToxR constructs containing the following TM domains: ErbB1 and ErbB2, GPA, and A16. However, there was no significant growth when transformed with a construct lacking a TM domain. Thus, we concluded that all the constructs used in this study are expressed and inserted in the correct orientation into the inner membrane. Homodimerization of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM Domains— Our hypothesis that the site I motif plays a role in the heterodimerization of ErbB1 and ErbB2 is based on the propensity of each of them to form homodimers. The ToxR plasmid construct is a simple and robust method for detecting homodimerization of TM domains in vivo (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The detection is done through the signal of a β-galactosidase reporter gene. We tested the propensity of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 constructs to form homodimers. The ErbB1 construct displayed a signal corresponding to a monomeric TM domain, whereas the ErbB2 construct demonstrated homodimerization propensity (Fig. 4). We used the GPA TM as a positive control for homodimerization and a construct with 16 alanines (A16) as a monomer control (33Manolios N. Collier S. Taylor J. Pollard J. Harrison L.C. Bender V. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Rutledge T. Cosson P. Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These results fit the current model, in which only the site II motif is involved in homodimerization of the ErbB1, whereas both the site I and the site II motifs are involved in the homodimerization of ErbB2 TM domain (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM Domains—Heterodimerization can be detected through the addition of an exogenous peptide to the ToxR system (9Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31229-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interaction of this peptide with a ToxR receptor within the membrane will form a heterodimer, thus inactivating the ToxR transcription factor. In our case, the exogenous addition of an ErbB1 synthetic peptide to the ErbB2 construct resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the β-galactosidase reporter gene signal (Fig. 5). We normalized this inhibition to the homodimer signal of the ErbB2 construct in the absence of peptide and the monomeric signal of the A16 construct. These signals correspond to 0% heterodimerization and 100% heterodimerization, respectively (Fig. 5). The extrapolated IC50 was found to be 0.63 μm with R2 of 0.96 for the heterodimerization between the ErbB1 peptide and the ErbB2 construct by fitting to the model described under “Experimental Procedures.” The scaling constant was set to 0.65 by the non-linear least square fitting. To verify the specificity of the heterodimerization, three controls were used: (i) We introduced two mutations that correspond to significantly inactive and active mutations within the corollary GXXXG motif of GPA. The G83I mutation in the GPA TM domain significantly reduced the homodimerization propensity, whereas the mutation M81V did not interfere much with the homodimerization of GPA (1Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here an ErbB1 G652I mutant peptide had a significantly reduced affinity to the ErbB2 TM domain. The extrapolated IC50 of the interaction was 4.1 μm with R2 of 0.91. The scaling constant was set to 0.7 by the non-linear least square fitting. In contrast, an M650V mutant peptide preserved the ErbB1 affinity to ErbB2. (ii) We used a peptide corresponding to the TM domain of the bacterial aspartate receptor that is practically a monomer in the membrane (similarly to ErbB1) and inserts properly into the membrane (35Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This peptide demonstrated virtually no propensity to assemble with the ErbB2 construct, as illustrated in Fig. 5. (iii) To verify that the ErbB1 peptide could not interact nonspecifically with different homodimer-forming ToxR chimeras, we used a construct containing the TM-1 domain from the bacterial aspartate receptor, which forms homodimers in the membrane (35Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The data reveal no interaction between the ErbB1 peptide and the TM-1 construct (Fig. 5). Membrane Localization of the ErbB1 Peptide Analogues— The binding of ErbB1 peptides to the membrane of the FHK12 bacteria is a prerequisite for the interaction between the peptide and the ErbB2 ToxR construct. To verify that the ErbB1 peptides bind to FHK12 membranes, the bacteria were observed under a confocal microscope in the absence and presence of a rhodamine-labeled ErbB1 peptide at a 0.5 μm concentration. The results confirmed that the ErbB1 peptides are mainly localized to the bacterial membrane. The binding of ErbB1 as a representative example is given in Fig. 6. It is clear that the peptides bind the membrane of the bacteria, although it is impossible to distinguish between the inner and outer membranes. Nevertheless, we observed localized concentrations within the bacteria. We believe that these are invaginations of the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. Regardless, it clearly demonstrates that the peptides can enter through the outer membrane. Effects of the Exogenous Peptides on Protein Expression—We have used Western blot analysis to detect the effect of the ErbB1 peptide, its mutants, and the Tar-FG peptide on the expression level of the ToxR system. As expected, similar expression patterns of the ErbB2 and Tar-1 constructs were observed both in the presence and in the absence of the corresponding exogenous peptides (Fig. 7). Thus, the reduction in β-galactosidase signal, observed in the presence of the ErbB1 peptide, is due to the interaction with the ErbB2 TM and not due to variation of protein expression levels. It is worth noting that slight variations in lane intensities are mainly due to differences in loading of the gel. Less than 10% differences were measured when comparing the ratios of ErbB2 or Tar-1 chimera expression with respect to endogenous MalE expression (data not shown). The main finding in this study is that a single TM domain contains two GXXXG-like motifs (site I and site II), each with a separate function in TM domain assembly. The site I motif is implicated in heterodimer formation, and the site II motif is implicated with homodimer formation. Previously, it was demonstrated, through mutational analysis, that the site II motif plays an important role in the homodimerization of both ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors. However, the data with regard to the site I motif of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 do not suggest a uniform role for the motif (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Mutations within the site I motif of ErbB2 suggest that it is involved in homodimerization, whereas mutations within the site I motif of ErbB1 had negligible effect on assembly. Our data demonstrate that the ErbB1 site I motif is not sufficient for formation of homodimers. This complements the data obtained previously by point mutations in this region that demonstrated only a small effect on homodimerization of the ErbB1 TM domain (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 25Carpenter C.D. Ingraham H.A. Cochet C. Walton G.M. Lazar C.S. Sowadski J.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ErbB2 site I motif has sufficient propensity to form homodimers. The latter result fits well with existing data (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For example, the most infamous point mutation in the ErbB2 receptor (neu) involves a Val to Glu change within the site I motif of the TM domain (17Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The neu mutation is believed to increase the propensity of the TM domain to form homodimers (22Brennan P.J. Kumagai T. Berezov A. Murali R. Greene M.I. Kumogai T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6093-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, in some cases, cell transformation by the ErbB2 receptor is dependent on EGF, through the formation of heterodimers with ErbB1 (21Yarden Y. Oncology. 2001; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 22Brennan P.J. Kumagai T. Berezov A. Murali R. Greene M.I. Kumogai T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6093-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, point mutations within the ErbB2 TM domain pinpointed the interaction surface of the ErbB2 homodimer to its two GXXXG-like motifs (23Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the site I motif, present in the ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM domains, plays a role in heterodimerization. To validate this model, we utilized a synthetic peptide corresponding to the ErbB1 truncated TM domain (containing only the site I motif) and two of its analogues. This wild-type peptide demonstrated a significant propensity to generate heterodimers with the ErbB2 TM construct. By displacing the ErbB2 TM domain, it created a dose-dependent dominant negative effect that we could quantify. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by three controls: (i) Two ErbB1 peptide analogues, the first of which, a Gly652 to Ile, showed a significant reduction in heterodimer formation, and the second of which, a Met650 to Val analogue, was active similarly to wild-type peptide. These results correlate with the role of these residues in the GXXXG motif shown in the GPA TM (1Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) A non-related monomeric TM peptide could not interact with the ErbB2 ToxR construct, and (iii) the ErbB1 peptide could not interact with a non-related ToxR construct. To our knowledge, these results demonstrate the first example of a single TM domain (ErbB1) containing two distinct recognition motifs, with each specific for a different interaction; the site I motif is necessary for heterodimerization, whereas the site II motif is needed for homodimerization. The involvement of the ErbB receptor family in the signal transduction of cells is immense. They play a key role in proliferation as well as differentiation. They are implicated in several types of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In each case, different complexes of the ErbB receptors are considered to be the dominant species in conferring the tumorigenic effects. Understanding the biophysical mode of action of these receptors will bring us a step closer to developing effective therapeutics. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism of ErbB assembly in the membrane can shed light on the nature of protein-protein recognition within membranes and their assembly mechanism in general. The additional benefit of using the peptide displacement strategy is that such an approach can provide leads for drugs designed to inhibit specific ErbB homodimer or heterodimer complexes.

Blood vessel growth and development are complex processes involving endothelial cell proliferation, invasion, and directional migration. All of these features are important characteristics of neovascularization; however, precise molecular mechanisms governing these events still remain undefined. Several lines of evidence suggest that endothelial cell adhesion molecules may be involved in angiogenesis. Diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetic retinopathy display increased adhesion molecule expression with concomitant neovascularization (1Kwon H.M. Sangiorgi G.

Despite the active role adhesion molecules play during angiogenesis, little mechanistic information exists describing how these molecules facilitate neovascularization.Tissue remodeling such as that seen during angiogenesis involves the transition of cells from a quiescent to a mitogenic and pro-migratory phenotype. Numerous environmental signals such as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and mechanical forces are integrated in the cell to generate specific cellular responses. Migration occurs through coupling of actin-based protrusion and contraction with the dynamic formation and disassembly of cell-extracellular matrix adhesions and is highly adhesion-dependent. Both the formation of new matrix contacts and the generation of tractional forces are mediated through integrins (8Dunn G. Eur. J. Cancer. 1980; 16: 6-8Google Scholar, 9Ridley A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Google Scholar, 10Webb D. Parsons J. Horwitz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E97-E100Google Scholar). Altering the adhesive state of the cell induces a biphasic effect on cell migration, with low levels of adhesion insufficient to support tractional forces and high levels of adhesion preventing cell displacement (11Palecek S. Loftus J. Ginsberg M. Lauffenberger D. Horwitz A. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Google Scholar, 12DiMilla P. Barbee K. Lauffenburger D. Biophys.

Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Google Scholar, 14Kevil C.G. Pathophysiology. 2003; 9: 63-74Google Scholar). Several lines of experimental evidence implicate ICAM-1 in endothelial cell migration. For example, in atherosclerosis patients, increased endothelial cell ICAM-1 expression was observed within the neovasculature of coronary plaques, but not in endothelial cells directly overlying the plaque (15Boyle J.J. Wilson B. Bicknell R. Harrower S. Weissberg P.L. Fan T.P. J. Pathol. 2000; 192: 234-242Google Scholar). ICAM-1 clustering has been shown to stimulate actin stress fiber formation in endothelial cells through a RhoA- and p38 MAPK-dependent pathway (16Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Google Scholar). In addition, ICAM-1 itself can associate with the actin cytoskeleton through direct binding with α-actinin or the linker molecule ezrin (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Google Scholar, 17Carpen O. Pallai P. Staunton D. Springer T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1223-1234Google Scholar). The ICAM-1/ezrin/actin association has been postulated to enhance adhesion of cellular lamellipodia, which may influence cell motility.NO production appears to be a key target in angiogenic signaling since known pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, substance P, and tissue ischemia have all been reported to stimulate neovascularization in an NO-dependent manner (18Montrucchio G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20770-20774Google Scholar) showed that vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated endothelial cell migration involves increased ICAM-1 expression through an Akt/NO-dependent pathway and that a blocking ICAM-1 antibody prevents chemotactic endothelial cell migration toward vascular endothelial growth factor. Finally, ICAM-1 can modulate several signaling pathways that affect endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and neovascularization, including Src kinase, ERK1/2 kinase, p38 MAPK, and RhoA/ROCK (16Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Google Scholar, 26Pluskota E. Chen Y. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30029-30036Google Scholar, 27Tilghman R. Hoover R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1293-1307Google Scholar).We show here that loss of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells significantly attenuates cell motility through a unique NO-dependent pathway. These data demonstrate that constitutive expression of ICAM-1 is important for basal Akt and eNOS phosphorylation. Loss of basal eNOS activity in ICAM-1-deficient cells induces the formation of actin stress fibers and significantly reduces the ability of these cells to migrate. Thus, our findings suggest a novel role of ICAM-1 during endothelial cell migration that may be important for neovascularization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture materials were purchased from Sigma.

The aortas were incised and incubated in 5 ml of HBSS/collagenase solution containing 1 unit/ml dispase at 37 °C and agitated every 10 min for a total of 30 min to release the endothelial monolayer. The digests were then passed over a 40-μm nylon filter to isolate single cells. The single cell suspension was centrifuged at 375 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of HBSS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and labeled with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin I (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. The labeled cell suspension was pelleted, washed twice, and resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and positively stained cells were collected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated B. simplicifolia lectin I and used as a positive control. Positively sorted cells were plated onto 0.5% gelatin-coated 6-well plates in medium containing MCDB-131 (pH 7.2), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 units/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen.Western Blot Analysis and NO Detection—Western blotting was performed as reported previously (30Kevil C.G. Oshima T. Alexander B. Coe L.L. Alexander J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C21-C30Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of total protein was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline/Tween overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-phospho-Akt Thr308 or Ser473, total anti-Akt, anti-phospho-eNOS Ser1177, or total anti-eNOS antibody at 1:1000 dilution. Membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody at 1:3000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed and developed using ECL Western blot detection reagents.Total NO production in cell-conditioned medium was determined by measuring the NO metabolites nitrite (NO−2), nitrate (NO−3), S-nitrosothiols, nitrosyl-heme adducts, and N-nitrosamines in conditioned medium using an NO chemiluminescence analyzer as described previously (31Marley R. Patel R. Holt S. Darley-Usmar V. Moore K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 31: 688-696Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were injected into a reaction chamber containing vanadium chloride in 2 m HCl solution that was boiled (90 °C under weak vacuum) and bubbled with helium gas. This mixture reduces nitrate, nitrite, S-nitrosothiols, nitrosyl-heme adducts, and N-nitrosamines to NO, which can then measured by reaction with ozone in a chemiluminometer.Measurement of Cell Migration—Dunn cell migration chambers were purchased from Weber Scientific International Ltd. (Teddington, United Kingdom). Cell migration experiments were performed as reported previously (32Zicha D. Dunn G.A. Brown A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 769-775Google Scholar, 33Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457Google Scholar, 34Orr A.W. Elzie C.A. Kucik D.F. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2917-2927Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips were coated with 0.1% gelatin for 1 h, and endothelial cells were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to attach in serum and growth factor-free MCDB-131 medium for 3 h. Glass coverslips were then loaded onto the Dunn chamber containing serum and growth factor-free MCDB-131 medium, cell side down, and sealed to the chamber with an equal mixture of vacuum grease and Vaseline blotted to remove excess oil. Cells were imaged on an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a CCD camera (Model 300T-RC, Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) and a computer-controlled stage (Prior Scientific, Rockland, MA) to enable viewing of multiple fields over the time course of the experiment. The temperature on the stage was kept constant at 37 °C, and images were captured at 2-min intervals for a total of 6 h. Time-lapse images were analyzed by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). Slight movements in position resulting from the use of a movable stage were removed by simultaneous tracking of a stationary point and normalization of the resulting (x,y) coordinates generated by Metamorph. Tracks were analyzed using programs written by one of us (D. F. K.) for this purpose. Total track distance was determined as the sum of the incremental distances between successive (x,y) coordinates. Cell speed was determined as the total distance migrated divided by the time of the assay. Total cell displacement was calculated as the distance between the final (x,y) coordinate and the initial (x,y) coordinate. x displacement and y displacement were also calculated for each cell using this method and could be used as the final cell position given an initial cell position at the origin (0,0). Fifty cells from each Dunn chamber experiment were analyzed, with each experiment repeated three separate times. Data were statistically compared using Student's t test between experimental groups.Actin Staining of Endothelial Cell Monolayers—Actin staining of endothelial cell monolayers was performed as described previously (35Kevil C.G. Oshima T. Alexander J.S. Endothelium. 2001; 8: 107-116Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Monolayers were permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Cells were washed and incubated with 6 μm Alexa 546-phalloidin for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and mounted using Vectashield containing the nuclear counterstain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were imaged using Simple PCI software (Compix, Inc., Cranberry Township, PA) connected to an Eclipse TE2000 inverted epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY).RESULTSICAM-1 Deficiency Decreases Endothelial Cell Displacement—Previous studies have shown that ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells is involved in inflammation-mediated angiogenesis and that soluble ICAM-1 itself can also be pro-angiogenic (3Yasuda M. Shimizu S. Tokuyama S. Watanabe T. Kiuchi Y. Yamamoto T. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2113-2121Google Scholar, 4Yasuda M. Shimizu S. Ohhinata K. Naito S. Tokuyama S. Mori Y. Kiuchi Y. Yamamoto T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C917-C925Google Scholar, 7Gho Y.S. Kleinman H.K. Sosne G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5128-5132Google Scholar). To investigate the role of ICAM-1 in endothelial cell migration, we compared cell migration in wild-type and ICAM-1-deficient MAECs. Fig. 1 shows representative cell migration tracks for wild-type and ICAM-1-deficient MAECs. We found that loss of ICAM-1 substantially attenuated basal endothelial cell migration. Individual cell tracks were further analyzed to determine the total migration distance and speed of migration. Interestingly, we observed that loss of ICAM-1 decreased both the total migration distance and speed compared with wild-type cells, as determined by tracking successive positions of the cell centroid (Fig. 1). Since the cell tracking software used does not distinguish between changes in cell shape and cell translocation, the actual effect of ICAM-1 deficiency on endothelial cell migration distance and speed may be more significant. Measurement of total displacement and directionality (total displacement/total distance) revealed that loss of ICAM-1 significantly inhibited the directional displacement of endothelial cells (Fig. 1). Consistent with this, time-lapse images showed that ICAM-1-deficient cells did not display considerable translocation from their point of origin.What was most striking was that ICAM-1 migration paths were more annular with little linear tracks that would enable lateral cell displacement. Furthermore, ICAM-1 cell migration was most irregular in that the nature of movement was random and non-directional (as indicated by the directionality ratio), resulting in decreased lateral displacement. Together, these findings suggest that ICAM-1 mutant cells are quite capable of moving, but that the development of cell polarity and directional migration are compromised.ICAM-1 Deficiency and Alterations in the Endothelial Cytoskeleton—ICAM-1 has been reported to associate with the actin cytoskeleton and may influence lamellipodium formation (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Google Scholar, 36Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol.

Subconfluent endothelial cells were labeled with Alexa 546-phalloidin to examine intracellular actin organization. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that wild-type endothelial cells displayed several actin-rich lamellipodium regions and distinct migration morphology with prominent pseudopod and uropod formation. In contrast, cytoskeletal organization was substantially different in ICAM-1-deficient cells. There were numerous stress fibers with smaller, less organized lamellipodia and a distinct loss of cell polarity as determined by poorly defined pseudopod and uropod formation (Fig. 2, C and D). Overall, ICAM-1-deficient cells appeared to exhibit a contractile phenotype compared with wild-type endothelium. These data suggest that ICAM-1 is important in determining endothelial cell actin cytoskeletal organization and may be important for generation of proper cell polarity.Fig. 2Comparison of the actin cytoskeletal organization in wild-type and ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cells. Wild-type and ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cells were stained with Alexa 546-phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. A and B show actin staining of wild-type endothelial cells. C and D illustrate actin staining of ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cells.

Witzenbichler B. Spyridopoulos I. Asahara T. Ding B. Sullivan A. Losordo D.W. Isner J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1156-1161Google Scholar, 40Lee P.C. Salyapongse A.N. Bragdon G.A.

Recent reports have also shown that eNOS enzymatic activity is greatly influenced by phosphorylation via Akt/protein kinase B, suggesting that production of bioavailable NO is closely regulated (41Dimmeler S.

We examined the phospho-Akt and total Akt and eNOS protein levels in wild-type and ICAM-1 mutant endothelial cells. Fig. 3A illustrates decreased phospho-Akt Thr308 in ICAM-1 mutant cells, whereas phospho-Akt Ser473 and total Akt remained unchanged. eNOS Ser1177 (Ser1177 in human and Ser1179 in bovine) has recently been reported to be critical for both basal and agonist-induced eNOS activities (44Scotland R.S.

Importantly, Western blot analysis of total eNOS protein was not different between endothelial cell types. These observations suggest that ICAM-1-mediated defects in endothelial cell migration may be due to a decrease in NO bioavailability.Fig. 3ICAM-1 expression, eNOS phosphorylation, and the importance of NO for migration. A illustrates phospho-Akt308, phospho-Akt473, and total Akt protein levels in wild-type and ICAM-1 mutant endothelial cells. B shows phospho-eNOS Ser1177 and total eNOS protein levels in wild-type and ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cells.

Fig. 3C shows that NO production in ICAM-1-deficient MAECs was significantly attenuated compared with wild-type cells. Together, these data provide strong evidence linking constitutive ICAM-1 expression with basal NO production via modulation of eNOS phosphorylation.NO Donors Enhance ICAM-1-deficient MAEC Motility—Endothelial cell migration experiments were performed in the presence of the NO donor DETA NONOate to examine whether restoring NO bioavailability could correct the cell migration defects of ICAM-1 mutant endothelial cells (Fig. 4). 0.1 μm DETA NONOate donor treatment of wild-type endothelial cells did not significantly alter the total displacement distance compared with untreated cells. In contrast, DETA NONOate treatment of ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cells significantly increased the total displacement distance compared with untreated cells. Using the reported half-life of DETA NONOate (20 h at pH 7.4 and 37 °C) at a reaction stoichiometry of 2 molecules of NO released per molecule of DETA, the calculated amount of NO release over the 6-h incubation period was ∼40 nm. Importantly, experiments using decomposed DETA NONO-ate plus vehicle did not alter the migration profiles (Fig. 4). Having observed significant differences with relatively low levels of NO, we next examined whether inhibition of NOS activity in wild-type cells would similarly decrease cell migration compared with ICAM-1-deficient cells. 200 μml-NNA treatment of wild-type cells did significantly attenuate the total cell displacement distance, although to a lesser extent than in ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cells (Fig. 4). Closer examination of the cell migration properties of DETA NONOate-treated ICAM-1-deficient cells revealed that NO administration did not significantly alter the overall migration distance or speed, but did correct and significantly enhanced total cell displacement and the directionality ratio (Fig. 5). Interestingly, DETA NONOate treatment of mutant endothelial cells showed a significant increase in displacement compared with DETA NONOate-treated wild-type cells, indicating a hypersensitivity to NO.Fig. 4Effect of NO supplementation on ICAM-1-deficient endothelial cell displacement. Migration assays were performed using DETA NONOate (0.1 μm) over a 6-h period. The upper panels show migration plots of wild-type cells treated with either vehicle (left panel) or DETA NONOate (right panel). The middle panels illustrate migration plots of ICAM-1-deficient cells treated with vehicle (left panel) or DETA NONOate (right panel). NO supplementation enhanced only ICAM-1 mutant cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W2166599679,"Kinases can phosphorylate and regulate androgen receptor activity during prostate cancer progression. In particular, we showed that glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylates the androgen receptor, thereby inhibiting androgen receptor-driven transcription. Conversely, the glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor lithium chloride suppressed the glycogen synthase kinase-3β-mediated phosphorylation of the androgen receptor, thereby enabling androgen receptor-driven transcription to occur. The androgen receptor hinge and ligand-binding domains were important for both the phosphorylation and the inhibition of transcriptional activity of the receptor by glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Furthermore, androgen receptor phosphorylation was augmented by LY294002, an indirect inhibitor of protein kinase B/Akt that inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β. We also showed that the mutation of various phosphorylation sites on glycogen synthase kinase-3β affected the ability of these mutants to co-distribute with the androgen receptor in the cell nucleus, also that both glycogen synthase kinase-3β and androgen receptor proteins can be found in cell nuclei of prostate cancer tissue samples. Because glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity is suppressed after the enzyme is phosphorylated by protein kinase B/Akt and Akt activity frequently increases during the progression of prostate cancer, nullification of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β-mediated suppression of androgen receptor activity by Akt likely contributes to prostate cancer progression.

De Marzo A.M. Isaacs W.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 366-381Google Scholar). In the prostate, AR helps maintain the balance between the growth and death of prostate cells (4Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Google Scholar). Structurally, the AR has a transactivation domain (amino acids 1-556), a DNA-binding domain (amino acids 559-627), a hinge region (amino acids 622-670), and a ligand-binding domain (amino acids 712-919) (3Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421Google Scholar). During the progression of prostate cancer, however, ARs can become mutated or their regulation compromised, which often leads to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer (4Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Google Scholar, 6Logothetis C.J. Hoosein N.M. Hsieh J.T. Semin. Oncol. 1994; 21: 620-629Google Scholar). Androgen-independent prostate cancer is a lethal recurring tumor that often develops in patients who have undergone androgen ablation therapy. Multiple factors can cause androgen-independent prostate cancer (4Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Google Scholar), but the most common factor, and the one that helps drive both normal and dysfunctional receptor activity, is the phosphorylation of AR.Data suggest that kinases regulate AR function, but which kinases are involved remains unresolved. Rigorous phosphoamino acid analyses of the AR have shown that serine phosphorylation events are more prevalent than either threonine or tyrosine suggesting that serine kinases may exert most of the influence on the AR (1Brinkmann A.O.

Many consensus sites are present in the AR for serine kinases including mitogen-activated protein kinases, calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 (8Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Google Scholar). In one instance, Ser308 in the AR was identified as a phosphorylation site but the kinase that phosphorylates it remains to be identified (9Zhu Z. Becklin R.R. Desiderio D.M. Dalton J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 836-844Google Scholar). Others have shown that serines 81 and 94 become phosphorylated soon after translation and when these sites are mutated this limits ligand-induced phosphorylation but not transactivation (7Jenster G. de Ruiter P.E. van der Korput H.A.

For example, one study showed that the phosphorylation of AR on Ser210 and Ser790 by Akt stimulated AR-driven transcriptional activity (16Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845Google Scholar), whereas another study showed that Akt suppressed activity (17Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Google Scholar). However, both of these studies using in vitro kinase assays in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, putatively showed that Ser213 and Ser791 were the amino acids on AR that were phosphorylated by Akt. Limited in vivo analysis further indicated that Akt mediated the phosphorylation of AR in COS-1 cells, but no attempt was made to determine whether Akt and AR were co-localized within cells (17Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Google Scholar). In contrast with these findings, other studies by Gioeli et al. (18Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Google Scholar) who used intact cells to perform [32P]orthophosphate labeling in vivo followed by peptide mapping and mass spectroscopy, failed to confirm the phosphorylation of AR by Akt on Ser213 and Ser791. These conflicting in vitro findings with regard to the Akt phosphorylation of Ser213 and Ser791 on AR and the failure to confirm in vivo that these sites are phosphorylated led us to postulate that GSK-3β regulates AR as an indirect consequence of Akt activity. GSK-3β is a likely candidate for regulating AR as an indirect mediator of Akt activity for multiple reasons. One reason is that GSK-3β is known to phosphorylate and mediate the activity of numerous nuclear transcription factors (19Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Google Scholar); another is that GSK-3β is inactivated after being phosphorylated on Ser9 by Akt (19Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Google Scholar, 20Frame S. Cohen P.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Google Scholar).We have recently shown that GSK-3β can phosphorylate cyclic AMP response element-binding protein and activate its transcriptional activity in the nuclei of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells (21Salas T.R.

In the present study, we used prostate carcinoma cells and COS-1 cells to: 1) examine the phosphorylation of AR by GSK-3β and its effects on AR-mediated transcription; 2) determine the AR protein domain that interacts with and is phosphorylated by GSK-3β; and 3) examine the intracellular co-distribution of AR with mutated forms of GSK-3β.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture Conditions—The human prostate adenocarcinoma cells PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, as well as COS-1 cells, were obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). PC-3 cells were selected that stably expressed empty pcDNA 3.1 vector (C3 cells), hAR/pcDNA 3.1 plasmid (A103 cells), or VP16-AR (V28 cells). All tumor cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium (mixed 1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed to detect various proteins in human prostate cancer cells. Whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described (22Subbarayan V. Sabichi A.L. Llansa N. Lippman S.M. Menter D.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2720-2726Google Scholar). Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by chemiluminescence procedures, as previously described (22Subbarayan V. Sabichi A.L. Llansa N. Lippman S.M. Menter D.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2720-2726Google Scholar).GSK-3β Phosphorylation of AR in Cells—Various GSK-3β constructs were transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed with phosphate free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and then incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 1 nm 17α-methyl-17β-hydroxyestra-4,9,11-trien-3-one (R1881, otherwise known as metribolone, a synthetic nonmetabolizable androgen) for 6 h at 37 °C (23Dube J.Y.

Prostate. 1984; 5: 581-588Google Scholar). Radiolabeled medium was removed and cells were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scrape-harvested as previously described (22Subbarayan V. Sabichi A.L. Llansa N. Lippman S.M. Menter D.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2720-2726Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies were performed on 200 μg of total protein using rabbit anti-AR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), after which the proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography performed to detect 32P-labeled AR. Electrotransferred proteins were probed with rabbit anti-AR polyclonal or mouse anti-AR monoclonal primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using the Super-Signal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce).Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—After starvation prostate cells were incubated with 1 nm R1881 for 20 min. Following treatment, cells were harvested and 200 μg of total protein lysate was assayed by immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis with either an N- or C-terminal specific AR binding antibody or GSK-3β specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, protein lysates were precleared by incubating with protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 30 min at 25 °C. Specific antibodies (10 μg/ml) were added to lysates and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by washing 3 times with HEPES-buffered saline. Proteins that were bound to protein A/G were removed using SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Samples were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the reciprocal antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were visualized with West Femto chemiluminescence kit (Pierce).Kinase Assays—pRSET-GST-ARLBD protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using the B-PER/GST Spin Purification Kit (Pierce) in the presence of 1 nm R1881. Purified GST-ARLBD was incubated with various concentrations of GSK-3β (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by NuPage gradient gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen) followed by autoradiography.Immunofluorescence Analysis—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (22Subbarayan V. Sabichi A.L. Llansa N. Lippman S.M. Menter D.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2720-2726Google Scholar). A primary rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing GSK-3β (Santa Cruz) or mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing AR (BD Biosciences) was diluted (1:200; v/v) in buffer as previously described (22Subbarayan V. Sabichi A.L. Llansa N. Lippman S.M. Menter D.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2720-2726Google Scholar). The samples were then incubated with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody Alexa-488 (green), an anti-mouse secondary antibody Alexa-350 (blue), and actin probe Alexa-594 phalloidin (red) (Molecular Probes), after which they were examined as previously described (22Subbarayan V. Sabichi A.L. Llansa N. Lippman S.M. Menter D.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2720-2726Google Scholar).Luciferase Assays—Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate using FuGENE 6. In one set of experiments, various AR constructs (ARwt, AR5, AR65, AR104, AR106, and AR126), previously described (27Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Google Scholar, 28Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Google Scholar) were transfected in combination with wild-type GSK-3β (GSK-3βwt) (Fig. 5A). In another set of experiments, various GSK-3β constructs previously described (29Murai H. Okazaki M. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Google Scholar) (GSK-3βwt, GSK-3βΔ9, GSK-3βK85M, and GSK-3βY216F) were transfected in combination with ARwt into COS-1 cells. Probasin-luciferase (PB-LUC) and pARE-LUC were the reporter constructs used to analyze AR-driven transcriptional activity. Cells were harvested and analyzed using the LUCLITE system (Packard Instrument Co.) and then quantitated in a 96-well black plate using a TOPCOUNT NT multiwell plate scintillation detector (Packard Instrument Co.). All results from the luciferase assays were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, which was generated from pRLTK (Promega Corp.).Immunostaining of Paraffin Sections—Immunohistochemistry was carried out in paraffin-embedded sections (3-4 μm) following deparaffinization and rehydration in xylene, graded alcohol, and distilled H2O (DH2O), respectively. Antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in steam. The endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking the sections with avidin block followed by biotin block for 15 min each (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) and then rinsing three times between treatments with phosphate-buffered saline, protein nonspecific blocking solution (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) was applied and incubated for 20 min and slides were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbit anti-human GSK-3β (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or AR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:50 with background reducing diluent (Dako Corp.) were applied to the sections and incubated overnight at 25 °C. Then, the sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Dako Corp.) and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline between steps. Peroxidase activity was detected by applying 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride containing 0.02% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, rinsed with DH2O, intensified with a saturated lithium carbonate as a bluing agent, and rinsed again with DH2O. The sections were then dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and mounted in Permount (Fisher) and covered with coverslips.Image Analysis—Digital capture methods were optimized to provide the best signal-to-noise contrast for image analysis. We used a Quantix CCD camera that is driven by IP Labs (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA) image analysis software on a Power PC G4 computer with 128 megabytes of RAM. This image-acquisition equipment is attached to an IX70 inverted research light microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY).RESULTSLow GSK-3β Activity in Proliferating Prostate Cancer Cells—We used Western blots to analyze GSK-3β protein expression and phosphorylation in proliferating prostate cells. The total levels of GSK-3β protein expression were similar in all the prostate cancer cells with little variation in phosphorylation at Tyr216 (a constitutive phosphorylation event that activates this enzyme). In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser9 suppressed GSK-3β activity and was very high in the androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4) but lower in the androgen-independent PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). Previously we verified that GSK-3β enzymatic activity inversely correlates with (P)-Ser9-GSK-3β levels in these prostate cancer cells. 2T. R. Salas, S. M. Lippman, and D. G. Menter, unpublished data. Fig. 1Changes in the phosphorylation state of GSK-3β alter its ability to phosphorylate the AR. A, Western blot analysis was performed to compare the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β in AR-deficient (AR-) (PC-3, DU145, and C3) and AR-expressing cells (AR+) (LNCaP, A103, and V28) prostatic carcinoma cells. The total levels of GSK-3β were similar in all cell types (bottom row), and there was little difference in the (P)Tyr216-GSK-3β levels (middle row). The (P)Ser9-GSK-3β level was higher in the AR+ cells, LNCaP, compared with AR- cells, PC-3, DU145, C3, or AR+ cells derived from an AR- lineage, i.e. A103 and V28 cells (top row). The relative density represents the mean pixel density of the (P)Ser9-GSK-3β normalized to that of the total GSK-3β. B, this diagram shows the structure of HA-tagged GSK-3β and mutants used in this study. 1, GSK-3βwt contains an enzymatic site and two critical regulatory phosphorylation sites Ser9 and Tyr216. 2, GSK-3βΔ9 is a deletion mutant that has the first 9 amino acids removed and is constitutively active because it is missing Ser9, the inhibitory phosphorylation site for Akt. 3, GSK-3βY216F is an enzymatically inactive point mutant that has an essential tyrosine phosphorylation site mutated to a phenylalanine. 4, GSK-3βK85M is an enzymatically suppressed point mutant that has an essential lysine mutated to a methionine. C, GSK-3β variants are expressed in AR+ cells. Only endogenous GSK-3β is expressed in the PCMV4 vector control samples (lanes 1, 5, and 9). In general, the HA tag on these GSK-3β variants caused them to migrate above the endogenous GSK-3β. GSK-3βwt (lanes 2, 6, and 10) has migrated above the endogenous GSK-3β. Constitutively active GSK-3βΔ9 (lanes 3, 7, and 11) has migrated above and below the endogenous GSK-3β. The inactive point mutant GSK-3βY216F (lanes 4, 8, and 12) has migrated above the endogenous GSK-3β. Heavy phosphorylation of Ser9 occurs primarily on the endogenous GSK-3β in the presence of all variant proteins. Relative density represents the mean pixel density of the (P)Ser9-GSK-3β normalized to that of the total GSK-3β. D, enzymatically active GSK-3β variants phosphorylate AR. Overexpression of constitutively active GSK-3βΔ9 (lanes 3, 8, and 13) in AR+ cell lines increased the phosphorylation of AR to its greatest extent, followed by the phosphorylation produced by GSK-3βwt (lanes 2, 7, and 12). Vector controls (PCMV4, lanes 1, 6, and 11) and inactive GSK-3βY216F (lanes 4, 9, and 14) point mutant-expressing cells showed less phosphorylation of AR, whereas treatment with GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl (2.0 mm, lanes 5, 10, and 15) actively suppressed the phosphorylation of AR. Relative density represents the mean pixel density of the 32P-labeled AR normalized to that of the total AR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the effect of an androgen-independent cell background on AR activity, we selected PC-3 cells that stably express AR from a PC-3 cell background. When we selected PC-3 prostate cells that stably expressed a control vector (C3 cells), AR plasmid (A103 cells) or VP16-AR (V28 cells), Ser9 did not increase to the same levels in these cells as observed in the androgen-expressing LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 4-7).Phosphorylation of GSK-3β Variants in AR-expressing Cells—We next overexpressed HA-tagged GSK-3β variants (29Murai H. Okazaki M. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) containing various point mutations or deletions in the AR-expressing LNCaP, A103, and V28 cells to determine how these molecular changes affected GSK-3β expression (Fig. 1C). Deletion of the first 9 amino acids of GSK-3β resulted in the formation of the GSK-3βΔ9 protein, which is constitutively active and cannot be inactivated by Akt. Ser9 phosphorylation was present on endogenous GSK-3β but not to the same degree on the transfected HA-tagged variants (Fig. 1C). The position of the HA-tagged variants was verified using an anti-HA antibody. 3T. R. Salas, S. M. Lippman, and D. G. Menter, unpublished observations. Prevention of GSK-3β-induced Phosphorylation of AR by LiCl—The phosphorylation of AR increased above that in control cells in the presence of GSK-3βwt (Fig. 1D, lanes 2, 7, and 12) and to a greater extent in the presence of constitutively active GSK-3βΔ9 (Fig. 1D, lanes 3, 8, and 13). In contrast, the phosphorylation of AR was limited in the presence of PCMV4 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1, 6, and 11) and inactive GSK-3βY216F (Fig. 1D, lanes 4, 9, and 14). Phosphorylation was further decreased in cells treated with 2.0 mm lithium chloride (LiCl), a GSK-3β inhibitor (Fig. 1D, lanes 5, 10, and 15). These data suggest that GSK-3β is involved in phosphorylating AR.Distribution of GSK-3β Variants and AR in Cell Nuclei—We examined the intracellular distribution of the different GSK-3β (green) proteins, the AR (blue) and actin (red) in immunofluorescence studies to determine whether these molecules could interact within cells (Fig. 2). Untransfected PC-3 and C3 cells contained low levels of endogenous GSK-3β that were located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the PC-3 cells. Overexpressed GSK-3βwt was also present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected cells. However, the GSK-3βY216F protein was predominantly found in the cytoplasm, and the GSK-3βΔ9 protein was predominantly found in the nucleus of transfected cells. In addition, AR was not present in the PC3-C3 control cells that expressed the empty vector but was present in the nuclei of all R1881-treated AR-expressing cells. In the absence of R1881 by contrast, much less AR was found in the nuclei of AR-expressing cells (data not shown). These data show that the intracellular distribution of both AR and GSK-3β did not influence each other. AR was predominantly in the nuclei of R1881-treated prostate cells and was not affected by the distribution of GSK-3β. In contrast, the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β appears to rely in part on its phosphorylation status, in particular, the absence of the Tyr216 phosphorylation site prevented the distribution of GSK-3βY216F into cell nuclei. These data suggest that although the intracellular distribution of AR and GSK-3β do not depend on each other, these two molecules are capable of co-localizing in cancer cell nuclei, which would enable GSK-3β to phosphorylate AR.Fig. 2Activated GSK-3β and AR distribution in prostate cells. We examined the localization of AR (blue) and GSK-3β (green) in R1881-treated prostate cancer cells after counterstaining samples for actin (red). In C3 cells stably expressing an empty transfection vector, no AR was observed (asterisk). The intracellular distribution of GSK-3β (green) in C3 cells varied with the variant that was transfected into cells. The GSK-3βwt was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of C3 cells, whereas the GSK-3βΔ9 variant was predominantly in the nucleus (narrow arrows) and the GSK-3βY216F variant was found in the cytoplasm (wide arrows). In A103, V28, and LNCaP cells that express AR, the AR (blue) was almost exclusively in the nucleus of R1881-treated cells. The distribution of GSK-3β (green) protein in cells that express AR (A103, V28, and LNCaP) was the same as cells that do not express AR (C3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Low GSK-3β Activity in COS-1 Cells—We used COS-1 cells to characterize the interactions between GSK-3β and AR deletion variants because they are easy to transfect and do not express endogenous AR. First, however, we determined that the expression pattern and phosphorylation status of GSK-3β were similar to those in the LNCaP cells, in that Ser9 was phosphorylated (Fig. 3A) and the kinase activity was low (data not shown). Similar to prostate cancer cells, when we expressed GSK-3β variants in COS-1 cells, the endogenous GSK-3β was phosphorylated on Ser9, but was decreased in the GSK-3β variants (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3The AR is phosphorylated by active forms of GSK-3β in COS-1 cell nuclei. A, the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β was examined in COS-1 cells. The total levels of GSK-3β (bottom row), (P)Tyr216-GSK-3β (top row), and (P)Ser9-GSK-3β (middle row) were similar to those in LNCaP, A103, and V28 cells. B, COS-1 cells co-transfected with AR and GSK-3β variants showed similar results to those in prostate cancer cells. Only endogenous GSK-3β was expressed in vector control samples (lane 1). GSK-3βwt (lane 2) migrated above the endogenous GSK-3β, constitutively active GSK-3βΔ9 (lane 3) migrated above and below the endogenous GSK-3β, and the inactive point mutant GSK-3βY216F (lane 4) migrated above the endogenous GSK-3β. The endogenous GSK-3β was phosphorylated on Ser9, but the variant GSK-3β proteins were not. Relative density represents the mean pixel density of the (P)Ser9-GSK-3β normalized to that of the total GSK-3β. C, AR (blue) was observed in the nuclei (narrow arrows) of R1881-treated COS-1 cells that were co-transfected with AR and GSK-3β variants. The pattern of GSK-3β (green) expression in COS-1 cells was the same as that in the cancer cells. AR was present in the cell nuclei with GSK-3βwt and GSK-3βΔ9, but only the AR was observed in the nuclei (narrow arrows) of cells transfected with GSK-3βY216F, which appeared in the cytoplasm (wide arrows). D, the co-transfection of enzymatically active GSK-3β variants with AR into R1881-treated COS-1 cells increased the phosphorylation of AR. In contrast, vector controls (PCMV4,"
https://openalex.org/W1973003527,"Little is known about the sources of acetyl-CoA used for the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, a key regulator of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the heart. In perfused rat hearts, we previously showed that malonyl-CoA is labeled from both carbohydrates and fatty acids. This study was aimed at assessing the mechanisms of incorporation of fatty acid carbons into malonyl-CoA. Rat hearts were perfused with glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and a fatty acid (palmitate, oleate or docosanoate). In each experiment, substrates were 13C-labeled to yield singly or/and doubly labeled acetyl-CoA. The mass isotopomer distribution of malonyl-CoA was compared with that of the acetyl moiety of citrate, which reflects mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. In the presence of labeled glucose or lactate/pyruvate, the 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA was up to 2-fold lower than that of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. However, in the presence of a fatty acid labeled in its first acetyl moiety, the 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA was up to 10-fold higher than that of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. The labeling of malonyl-CoA and of the acetyl moiety of citrate is compatible with peroxisomal β-oxidation forming C12 and C14 acyl-CoAs and contributing >50% of the fatty acid-derived acetyl groups that end up in malonyl-CoA. This fraction increases with the fatty acid chain length. By supplying acetyl-CoA for malonyl-CoA synthesis, peroxisomal β-oxidation may participate in the control of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the heart. In addition, this pathway may supply some acyl groups used in protein acylation, which is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory mechanism for many biochemical processes.

Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate of fatty acid synthesis in lipogenic organs. It is also a key regulator of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation in most mammalian tissues because it modulates the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (1McGarry J.D. Mills S.E.

Malonyl-CoA is formed by cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1The abbreviations used are: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, MPE, molar percent enrichment. 1The abbreviations used are: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, MPE, molar percent enrichment. and is disposed off either by lipogenesis or via malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which reforms acetyl-CoA. Alterations in malonyl-CoA metabolism and regulation have been associated with insulin resistance and obesity (5Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J.

Mice lacking ACCβ, the predominant ACC isoform in cardiac and skeletal muscle, show not only decreased malonyl-CoA levels and increased fatty acid oxidation but also major alterations in systemic energy balance with decreased body fat despite increased food intake (6Abu-Elheiga L.

However, little is known about the origin of acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis. Acetyl-CoA is produced predominantly in the mitochondria. The concentration of acetyl-CoA available to cytosolic ACCβ appears to be in the low μm range (13Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. much below the Km of ACCβ for acetyl-CoA. It has been proposed that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is transferred to the cytosol either via acetylcarnitine and the carnitine acetyl transferase system (14Lopaschuk G.D. Gamble J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or via citrate and ATP-citrate lyase (15Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Kurowski T.G. Apazidis A. Witters L.A. Shafrir E. Ruderman N.B.

The present study was undertaken to characterize the contributions of glucose, lactate/pyruvate, and fatty acids of different chain length to the acetyl moiety of malonyl-CoA in rat hearts perfused under conditions that mimic the in vivo milieu, in terms of substrate supply to the heart.

Our strategy was to use combinations of labeled substrates that generate M2 and M1 mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, for example, [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) and [1-13C]oleate, respectively. Our data clearly demonstrate the participation of peroxisomal β-oxidation (24Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The enzyme, isolated from the Bio-Gel column (28Linn T.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1691-1698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate, and aliquots of the suspension (2 units/0.1 ml) were kept frozen at –80 °C. Before use, the enzyme was dissolved in 1 ml of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. Organ Perfusion Experiments—Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum for 10–12 days with standard laboratory chow. Hearts from overnight-fasted rats (180–220 g) were perfused in the Langendorf mode (12 ml/min) with non-recirculating bicarbonate buffer containing dialyzed bovine serum albumin (3%, fatty acid-free, Intergen), 50 μm carnitine, 8 nm insulin, and physiological concentrations of carbohydrates (glucose, lactate, and pyruvate) and a fatty acid (oleate, palmitate, or docosanoate) to mimic the in vivo conditions (29Vincent G. Bouchard B. Khairallah M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H257-H266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) Combinations of unlabeled and labeled substrates (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, oleate, palmitate, and/or docosanoate) were chosen to induce a wide range of 13C enrichment of malonyl-CoA and of the acetyl moiety of citrate (Table I). All experiments started by a 15-min equilibration with all substrates being unlabeled. Then, depending on the protocol, 1–3 unlabeled substrates were replaced by the labeled substrate(s) shown in Table I. Mass isotopomer analysis allows us to use pairs of labeled substrates in the same experiments, which generate M1 and M2 mass isotopomers of both malonyl-CoA and the acetyl moiety of citrate. Interconvertible lactate and pyruvate were used both unlabeled and identically labeled. The hearts were quick-frozen after 5–40 min of perfusion with the labeled substrates.Table IConditions of perfusion of isolated rat heartsGroups[Glucose][Lactate][Pyruvate][Fatty acid]Labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate)mmmmmmmm151[U-13C3]0.2 [U-13C3]0.3 [1-13C]oleateM1: 1.68 ± 0.1**M2: 0.62 ± 0.09**25 [U-13C6]10.20.3 oleateM2: 0.42 ± 0.04**340.50.10.1 [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoateM2: 8.2 ± 0.70***440.50.10.2 [U-13C]palmitate + 0.2 palmitateM2: 0.65 ± 0.10**54 [U-13C6]0.5 [3-13C]0.1 [3-13C]0.4 palmitateM1: 0.59 ± 0.14*M2: 0.76 ± 0.16 NS640.50.10.2 [16-13C]palmitate + 0.2 [1,2-13C2]palmitateM1: 0.28 ± 0.01*M2: 1.11 ± 0.14** Open table in a new tab Analytical Procedures—The concentration and 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA were assayed as described previously (21Reszko A.E.

We developed a technique for measuring the mass isotopomer distribution of the acetyl moiety of citrate. 200–500 mg of powdered frozen heart was extracted with 3.5 volumes of 6% perchloric acid. The acid extract was titrated with 10 m KOH to pH 12, and the alkaline solution was kept 2 h at room temperature and then kept overnight at 4 °C to allow hydrolysis of extant acetyl-CoA. After centrifuging the KClO4, the solution was supplemented with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, and then with 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.6 mm CoA, and 10 units/ml malate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started with 0.2 units of ATP-citrate lyase. The progression of the reaction was followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. When the reaction was complete (30–40 min at room temperature), the solution was run through an Oasis SPE cartridge (Waters) preconditioned with 1 ml of methanol followed by 1 ml of water. After loading the sample, the cartridge was washed with 1 ml of 5% methanol in water, and acetyl-CoA was released with 1 ml of methanol. After evaporation in a Savant vacuum centrifuge, the residue was dissolved in 0.15 ml of 0.1 mm HCl and analyzed by ion trap liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The masses monitored were 808.1–810.1. The mass isotopomer distribution of calibration standards of [U-13C6]citric acid and [1,5-13C2]citric acid, precursors of M2 and M1 acetyl-CoA standards, was assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of trimethyl citrate formed by incubating the citric acid standards with methanol/HCl. Data Presentation and Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as molar percent enrichment (MPE) as defined previously (18Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Vincent G. Bouchard B. Khairallah M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H257-H266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, mass isotopomers of metabolites containing 1 to n 13C atoms are identified as Mi with i = 1, 2,... n, and the absolute MPE of individual 13C-labeled mass isotopomers (Mi) of a given metabolite was calculated as follows, MPE(Mi)=% AMi/[AM+∑AMi](Eq. 1) where AM and AMi represent the peak areas from ion chromatograms corrected for natural abundance, corresponding to unlabeled (M) and 13C-labeled (Mi) mass isotopomers, respectively. We present data from about 50 heart perfusion experiments. For each of the experimental conditions chosen (Table I), we ran 6–8 perfusions in the presence of selected 13C-labeled substrate(s) with the time parameter being allowed to vary. Data shown in figures are the M2 and M1 13C enrichments of tissue malonyl-CoA or acetyl moiety of citrate measured in a given heart perfusion. They represent means of duplicate gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry injections, respectively, which differed by <2%. The statistical significance of differences between the 13C enrichment of malonyl-CoA and of the acetyl moiety of citrate obtained for the perfusions conducted for various times under a given experimental condition was tested using a paired t test (Graph Pad Prism Software version 4). The 13C enrichment ratios (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) obtained with a 13C-labeled substrate in a given experimental condition are reported as means ± S.E. of n perfusion experiments. Experiments with Oleate—In the first two series of experiments, hearts were perfused with buffer containing 5 mm glucose, 1.0 mm lactate, 0.2 mm pyruvate, and 0.3 mm oleate (Table I, Groups 1–2). As 13C substrates, we used [U-13C](lactate + pyruvate) plus [1-13C]oleate (Group 1) or [U-133C6]glucose (Group 2). In these cases, the M2 and M1 enrichments of malonyl-CoA reflect the contribution of carbohydrate and oleate oxidation, respectively, to the acetyl moiety of malonyl-CoA. Similar considerations apply to the labeling of the acetyl moiety of citrate, which reflects mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. For this and subsequent sections, the time courses of labeling of malonyl-CoA and the acetyl moiety of citrate are presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4. The M1 and M2 labeling ratios (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) are presented in the last column of Table I.Fig. 2Mass isotopomer distributions of malonyl-CoA and of the acetyl moiety of citrate in hearts perfused with [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate (Group 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Mass isotopomer distributions of (A) malonyl-CoA and (B) the acetyl moiety of citrate in hearts perfused with 50% enriched [U-13C16]palmitate or with [U-13C6]glucose + [3-13C](lactate + pyruvate) (Groups 4 and 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Mass isotopomer distributions of (A) malonyl-CoA and (B) the acetyl moiety of citrate in hearts perfused with [16-13C]palmitate + [1,2-13C2]palmitate (Group 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The M2 enrichment of malonyl-CoA from [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) (2.5–5%, Fig. 1A) and from [U-13C6]glucose (10%) reflected a low contribution of extra-cellular carbohydrates to malonyl-CoA. In contrast, the M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA from [1-13C]oleate increased progressively without plateauing and reached about 19% after 45 min (Fig. 1A). This was unexpected because, in the presence of [1-13C]oleate, the maximal M1 enrichment of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is 100/9 = 11%, assuming zero contribution from glucose and lactate/pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the 19% M1-labeled acetyl moiety of malonyl-CoA could not be derived solely from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Indeed, the M1 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate plateaued at 9% (Fig. 1B). Thus [1-13C]oleate contributed 9 × 9 = 81% to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. However, the M1 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate (9%) was about one-half that of malonyl-CoA (19%). In contrast, the M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate derived from [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) or [U-13C6]glucose plateaued at a value that was ∼ 2-fold greater than that of malonyl-CoA (5 and 18%, respectively). The combined data of Groups 1 and 2 show that the contributions of exogenous oleate, lactate plus pyruvate, and glucose to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, 81, 4, and 18%, respectively, add up to close to 100%. These results, which concur with previous ones (16Poirier M. Vincent G. Reszko A.E. Bouchard B. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1379-H1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Vincent G. Comte B. Poirier M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E846-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that there is little if any contribution of endogenous substrates to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Taken together, the data of Fig. 1, A and B, demonstrate that some of the malonyl-CoA label derived from [1-13C]oleate does not arise from the mitochondrial metabolism of this substrate. To explain this finding, we hypothesized that the high M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA was derived, at least in part, from the partial peroxisomal β-oxidation of [1-13C]oleate, forming highly enriched [1-13C]acetyl-CoA in the vicinity of ACC. Experiments with Docosanoate—To provide support for a contribution of peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids to malonyl-CoA formation, we used [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate (Table I, Group 3). Docosanoate is a very long-chain C22 fatty acid that is partly oxidized in peroxisomes (25Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Because of its low solubility, even in the presence of 3% bovine serum albumin, we perfused rat hearts with only 0.1 mm [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate. Fig. 2 shows the high M2 labeling of malonyl-CoA, which peaked at about 43%. In contrast, the M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate plateaued at only about 4%. Since only 2 of the 11 acetyl units of [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate were labeled, complete mitochondrial oxidation of the substrate would have resulted in a maximal M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate of 18%. In the presence of [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate, the 10-fold difference in the M2 enrichments of malonyl-CoA and acetyl moiety of citrate strongly suggests that most of the acetyl moiety of malonyl-CoA is derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation. Experiments with Palmitate—In the experiments reported in the above sections, the fatty acids oleate and docosanoate were 13C-labeled on the first acetyl. These tracers do not allow probing specifically the fate of the omega acetyl, which, presumably, forms acetyl-CoA only in mitochondria. The availability of differentially 13C-labeled palmitate, [U-13C16]-, [16-13C]-, or [1,2-13C2]palmitate allowed us to probe the fates of the various acetyl groups of palmitate. For these sets of perfusions, hearts were perfused with buffer containing 4 mm glucose, 0.5 mm lactate, 0.1 mm pyruvate, and 0.4 mm palmitate (Table I, Groups 4–6). Let us first consider the two groups of perfusions conducted with 0.2 mm [U-13C16]palmitate + 0.2 mm unlabeled palmitate (Group 4) and with [U-13C6]glucose + [3-13C](lactate + pyruvate) + 0.4 mm unlabeled palmitate (Group 5). As shown in Fig. 3A, the M2 enrichment of malonyl-CoA labeled from 50% enriched [U-13C16]palmitate increased almost linearly to 27% at 35 min without plateauing. In the same experiments, the M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate peaked at 37% at 30 min (Fig. 3B). Therefore, since [U-13C16]palmitate was 50% enriched, the contribution of 0.4 mm palmitate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA peaked at 74%. In parallel experiments with [U-13C6]glucose + [3-13C](lactate + pyruvate) + unlabeled palmitate (Group 5), the M2 and M1 enrichments of malonyl-CoA plateaued early at 18 and 3% (Fig. 3A), whereas those of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA plateaued at 22 and 6%, respectively (Fig. 3B). As in the experiments with oleate, the contributions of palmitate, lactate/pyruvate, and glucose to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA add up to close to 100%, indicating little contribution from endogenous sources. Lastly, one group of perfusions was conducted under the same conditions with a mixture of [16-13C]palmitate and [1,2-13C2]palmitate (Group 6). These two 13C substrates allow probing in the same experiment the fates of the last and the first acetyl groups of palmitate, as M1 and M2 isotopomers, respectively. Hearts were perfused with 0.2 mm [16-13C]palmitate + 0.2 mm [1,2-13C2]palmitate, each tracer being thus 50% enriched (Table I, Group 6). As shown in Fig. 4, the M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA was ∼ 10-fold lower than its M2 enrichment. In contrast, the M1 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate was 2-fold lower than its M2 enrichment. These data provide clear evidence for a differential metabolism of the α and ω acetyl groups of palmitate. According to current concepts, the acetyl-CoA used by heart cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase to form malonyl-CoA (i) is of mitochondrial origin and (ii) is transferred from the mitochondria via acetylcarnitine (14Lopaschuk G.D. Gamble J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or via citrate and ATP-citrate lyase (15Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Kurowski T.G. Apazidis A. Witters L.A. Shafrir E. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E641-E648PubMed Google Scholar, 16Poirier M. Vincent G. Reszko A.E. Bouchard B. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1379-H1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The major finding of this study is the demonstration that a substantial proportion of malonyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA molecules derived from extramitochondrial long-chain chain fatty acid β-oxidation. This was evidenced by comparing the 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA with that of the acetyl moiety of citrate, which reflects mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. In the presence of fatty acids labeled in the first acetyl moiety, the labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate) was greater than 1.0. In contrast, in the presence of labeled glucose or lactate/pyruvate, the labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate) was smaller than 1.0. In hearts perfused with [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) and [1-13C]oleate, the M2 enrichment of malonyl-CoA (from [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate)) plateaued at about one-half that of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1B). This implies that the labeling of M2 acetyl-CoA transferred from mitochondria was diluted by unlabeled acetyl-CoA formed in the extramitochondrial space. The only known source of unlabeled extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA (in the absence of exogenous acetate) is the partial peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids. Although [1-13C]oleate was M1-labeled in its first acetyl, its oxidation did not generate any M2 acetyl-CoA. Therefore, all acetyl-CoA molecules derived from the partial peroxisomal oxidation of [1-13C]oleate are “M2 unlabeled” and dilute the M2 labeling of acetyl-CoA derived from [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate). In contrast, the M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA labeled from [1-13C]oleate was twice that of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. The latter finding can only be explained by the formation of M1 acetyl-CoA molecules through extramitochondrial oxidation of [1-13C]oleate, most likely in peroxisomes. In fact, it appears that, under the conditions of these experiments, about one-half of the extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA used to form malonyl-CoA was derived from the mitochondria, and one-half was derived from extramitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids. Since the M2 enrichment of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA derived from [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) was diluted 2-fold after its transfer to the extramitochondrial space, we can assume that a similar 2-fold dilution occurred to the M1 enrichment of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA derived from [1-13C]oleate (9% to 4.5%). Then, we can calculate the M1 enrichment of extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA derived from the peroxisomal β-oxidation of [1-13C]oleate. Out of 100 molecules of malonyl-CoA, 50 were derived from acetyl-CoA enriched at 4.5%, and 50 were derived from acetyl-CoA enriched at X%. Solving a simple algebraic equation yields a 33.5% enrichment of acetyl-CoA derived from the peroxisomal β-oxidation of [1-13C]oleate. Since one in three acetyls derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation was labeled, it appears that [1-13C]oleate underwent three cycles of peroxisomal oxidation, on average. This assumes that the exogenous [1-13C]oleate was the sole fuel of peroxisomal β-oxidation in these hearts. Our data are compatible with current concepts on partial peroxisomal β-oxidation of (very) long-chain acyl-CoAs (26Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Presumably, [1-13C]oleate was degraded in peroxisomes to an unlabeled C12 CoA ester, which either was transferred to the mitochondria for further oxidation or alternatively could be involved in the acylation of heart proteins (30Hasselbaink D.M. Roemen T.H. van der Vusse G.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 239: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the participation of an extramitochondrial β-oxidation pathway to the formation of acetyl-CoA for malonyl-CoA synthesis comes from perfusion experiments with [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate. Under this condition, if the 40% enriched extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA were to be entirely derived from [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate, the latter would have undergone five cycles of peroxisomal β-oxidation to form 40% enriched acetyl-CoA and unlabeled dodecanoyl-CoA. The presence of some labeling of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA can result from the transfer from the extramitochondrial to the mitochondrial space of (i) [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoyl-CoA or of [1,2-13C2]eicosanoyl-CoA (derived from the former by one cycle of peroxisomal β-oxidation) via the carnitine palmitoyltransferase system or (ii) [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA derived from partial peroxisomal β-oxidation of [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate, via the carnitine acetyltransferase system. The first mechanism is compatible with the presence of a very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and a very long-chain trifunctional enzyme in mitochondria (31Izai K. Uchida Y. Orii T. Yamamoto S. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1027-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Uchida Y. Izai K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1034-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a third set of perfusion experiments (Group 6), an equimolar mixture of palmitate tracers labeled in the first ([1,2-13C2]palmitate) or last ([16-13C]palmitate) acetyl units provided more insight into the mechanisms involved in the extramitochondrial formation of acetyl-CoA. The M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA was lower than its M2 enrichment. This was expected since (i) [16-13C]palmitate would label malonyl-CoA only via labeling of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, whereas (ii) [1,2-13C2]palmitate would label malonyl-CoA via mitochondrial acetyl-CoA and peroxisomal β-oxidation. Comparing the mass isotopomer distributions of the acetyl moiety of citrate and of malonyl-CoA in these hearts reveals that the M2 enrichment of malonyl-CoA, derived from [1,2-13C2]palmitate, is somewhat higher than the M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate. Therefore, some of the M2 labeling of malonyl-CoA was probably derived from partial peroxisomal β-oxidation of [1,2-13C2]palmitate. Also, the M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA, derived from [16-13C]palmitate, is lower than the M1 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate. This probably results from the production of unlabeled acetyl-CoA by partial peroxisomal β-oxidation of [16-13C]palmitate. The degree of dilution of (M1 enrichment of acetyl moiety of citrate)/(M1 malonyl-CoA) is imprecise because of the low M1 enrichment of malonyl-CoA. If one estimates the dilution factor at about 2–3, using the rationale described for the experiments with [1-13C]oleate, one would conclude that the labeled substrate went through one or two cycles of peroxisomal β-oxidation. This is compatible with the estimate of Veerkamp and Van Moerkerk's (33Veerkamp J.H. van Moerkerk H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), derived from incubations of rat heart homogenates with [1-14C]palmitate in the presence of antimycin and rotenone. The interpretation of the difference in the M1 and M2 labelings of malonyl-CoA is somewhat complicated by the fact that the M2 labeling of the acetyl moiety of citrate from [1,2-13C2]palmitate was about twice that of its M1 labeling from [16-13C]palmitate (Fig. 3). One could have expected that the two tracers would equally label the acetyl moiety of citrate. This difference can be explained by the following considerations. The transfer of label from [16-13C]palmitate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is only partial because of the combined effects of (i) the incomplete isotopic equilibrium of the mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase reaction (34Huth W. Dierich C. von O.V. Seubert W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Fink G. Desrochers S. Des Rosiers C. Garneau M. David F. Daloze T. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18036-18042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) the reversibility of the mitochondrial 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase reaction that converts acetoacetyl-CoA to acetoacetate (19Vincent G. Comte B. Poirier M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E846-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fink G. Desrochers S. Des Rosiers C. Garneau M. David F. Daloze T. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18036-18042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the reversible acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase reaction, the exchange of the C3 + 4 acetyl of acetoacetyl-CoA with the free acetyl-CoA pool is much slower than the exchange of the C1 + 2 acetyl (34Huth W. Dierich C. von O.V. Seubert W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This was also observed in liver for the mitochondrial (34Huth W. Dierich C. von O.V. Seubert W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Brady P.S. Scofield R.F. Ohgaku S. Schumann W.C. Bartsch G.E.

Biophys. 1987; 259: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (38Endemann G. Goetz P.G. Edmond J. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3434-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, acetoacetyl-CoA derived from the last four carbons of [16-13C]palmitate is more labeled in its C3 + 4 acetyl compared with its C1 + 2 acetyl. Through the reversible 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase reaction, the asymmetrically labeled acetoacetyl-CoA is partly converted to asymmetrically labeled acetoacetate, which is released in the perfusate (35Fink G. Desrochers S. Des Rosiers C. Garneau M. David F. Daloze T. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18036-18042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool is more labeled when palmitate is labeled in its first versus last acetyl moiety. There are no precise estimates of the contribution of peroxisomal oxidation to the total rate of long-chain fatty acid oxidation in the heart (25Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, using data from this study, one can estimate the range of the rate of peroxisomal oxidation needed to sustain the production of malonyl-CoA. The turnover of rat heart malonyl-CoA is about 5 nmol·min–1·g of wet weight–1 (21Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since peroxisomal oxidation contributes at least one-half of the acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis, the latter could be supported by a rate of peroxisomal oxidation of about 2.5 (nmol acetyl)·min–1·g of wet weight–1. This rate is 100 times lower than the rate of acetyl-CoA produced from mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in hearts perfused with a mixture of substrates including 0.4 mm oleate (19Vincent G. Comte B. Poirier M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E846-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a very low rate of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation is sufficient to sustain the turnover of heart malonyl-CoA. However, acetyl-CoA formed by peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation can also be used in acetylation reactions. Also, the C12 and C14 acyl-CoAs derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation can be used in protein acylation, which is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory mechanism for many biochemical processes (30Hasselbaink D.M. Roemen T.H. van der Vusse G.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 239: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 40DeMar Jr., J.C. Rundle D.R. Wensel T.G. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 49-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since the heart is not a lipogenic organ, the C12 and C14 acyl-CoAs could be derived from the partial peroxisomal oxidation of common long-chain fatty acids. In conclusion, data from this study conducted in hearts perfused with a substrate mixture mimicking the in situ milieu show that a substantial fraction of the fatty acid carbon incorporated into malonyl-CoA is derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation and that this fraction increases with the fatty acid chain length. Also, using the labeling pattern of malonyl-CoA as a probe of peroxisomal β-oxidation, it appears that palmitate, oleate, and docosanoate are degraded in peroxisomes to C12-C14 intermediates. The latter could be further oxidized in mitochondria and/or could participate in protein acylation (30Hasselbaink D.M. Roemen T.H. van der Vusse G.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 239: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since the concentration of cytosolic acetyl-CoA is much lower than the Km of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for acetyl-CoA, the supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA must be a component of the regulation of malonyl-CoA metabolism. Therefore, peroxisomal β-oxidation, which supplies acetyl-CoA to the cytosolic site of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, may contribute to the regulation of malonyl-CoA metabolism and of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Future investigations will (i) assess the impact of fatty acid concentrations on the contribution of peroxisomal β-oxidation to the acetyl moiety of malonyl-CoA and (ii) address the pathophysiological significance of our findings, especially under conditions where signaling through peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α is increased, such as diabetes (39Finck B.N. Han X. Courtois M. Aimond F. Nerbonne J.M. Kovacs A. Gross R.W. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).

Hepatocyte swelling by insulin contributes to p38MAPK activation leading to inhibition of autophagic proteolysis. Recently integrins were shown to sense hypoosmotic hepatocyte swelling.

Modulation of cell function by cell volume changes implies structures that sense cell hydration changes (osmosensing), thereby initiating signal transduction toward effector sites (osmosignaling). Integrins are a family of extracellular matrix adhesion molecules involved in “mechanotransduction” and growth factor signaling (7Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 8Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliani R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hynes R.O.

In addition, GRGDSP also abolishes proteolysis inhibition by glutamine-induced cell swelling, whereas swelling-independent proteolysis inhibition, e.g. by phenylalanine, remains unaffected (12vom Dahl S.

Insulin induces hepatocyte swelling because of a net retention of K+, which results from a concerted activation of Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransport, Na+/H+ exchange, and the Na+/K+-ATPase (1Häussinger D. Lang F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 371-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Schliess F. Häussinger D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 225: 187-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte swelling by insulin depends on PtdIns-3-kinase and mediates p38MAPK activation, which triggers inhibition of autophagic proteolysis (15Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Schliess F. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Biol.

Equipotent hypoosmotic swelling mimics the insulin effect on p38MAPK and proteolysis inhibition, whereas prevention of insulin-induced cell swelling abolishes p38MAPK activation and proteolysis inhibition by insulin (16Schliess F. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Adipocyte swelling by insulin was considered to feed forward MAP-kinase activation and glutamine uptake triggered by the hormone (17Ritchie J.W. Baird F.E. Christie G.R. Stewart A. Low S.Y. Hundal H.S. Taylor P.M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). How insulin-induced cell swelling is sensed and feeds into overall insulin signaling is unknown. The present study investigates the role of integrins and Src in insulin signaling. We used the intact organ model of perfused rat liver because it authentically represents three-dimensional hepatocyte anchoring to the extracellular matrix with preserved cell polarity and cytoskeletal integrity. The present data support the view that the insulin-induced cell volume increase is sensed by integrins, which essentially contributes to Src-dependent p38MAPK activation and inhibition of autophagic proteolysis. Swelling-dependent proteolysis inhibition by insulin is insensitive to rapamycin, suggesting that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is not involved. The data define a novel role for integrins in growth factor signaling and dissect swelling-dependent proteolysis inhibition via p38MAPK from mTOR-dependent proteolysis inhibition, which may gain importance in the presence of certain amino acids. Liver Perfusions—The experiments were approved by the responsible local authorities. Livers from male Wistar rats (120-150 g body weight), fed a standard chow, were perfused as described previously (18Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in a non-recirculating manner. The perfusion medium was the bicarbonate-buffered Krebs-Henseleit saline plus l-lactate (2.1 mm) and pyruvate (0.3 mm) gassed with O2/CO2 (95/5 v/v). The temperature was 37 °C. In normoosmotic perfusions, the osmolarity was 305 mosm. Hypoosmotic exposure (185 mosm) was performed by lowering the NaCl concentration in the perfusion medium. The addition of inhibitors and insulin to influent perfusate was made either by use of precision micropumps or by dissolution into the Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Viability of the perfused livers was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase leakage from livers, which did not exceed 20 milliunits min1 g liver-1. Lactate dehydrogenase activity in effluent was between 2-21 milliunits/min/g over a 190-min perfusion period. For comparison, in a perfusion model of hepatic ischemia/reoxygenation injury, lactate dehydrogenase activity in efflux medium increases up to about 1500 milliunits/min/g (19Wettstein M. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1560-1566PubMed Google Scholar). The portal pressure was routinely monitored with a pressure transducer (Hugo Sachs Electronics, Hugstetten, Germany) (20vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The effluent K+ concentration was continuously monitored with a K+-sensitive electrode (Radiometer, Munich, Germany); insulin-induced K+ fluxes were determined by planimetry of areas under curves (21Häussinger D. Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise, the compounds used in this study did not affect portal perfusion pressure. Measurement of Proteolysis in the Perfused Rat Liver—The rate of proteolysis was assessed by measuring the release of 3H from isolated perfused rat livers after prelabeling of liver proteins in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of 150 μCi of l-[4,5-3H]leucine 16-20 h before the perfusion experiment (21Häussinger D. Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After a pre-perfusion period of 80 min, the release of trichloroacetic acid soluble 3H label reached a steady state (about 500 cpm min-1 g liver-1) and was associated with effluent leucine by more than 95% as shown by chromatographic analysis (15Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The release of label remained almost constant for another 80-100 min and was seen to be derived from intracellular protein breakdown, because leucine is neither synthesized nor catabolized in liver. In these experiments the influent perfusate was supplemented with unlabeled leucine (100 μm) to prevent reutilization of [3H]leucine for protein synthesis, although the addition of unlabeled leucine had no effect on [3H]label release from the liver, indicating that [3H]leucine reutilization for protein synthesis was negligible. To correct for different labeling of hepatic proteins after intraperitoneal injection in the individual perfusion experiment, the rate of proteolysis was set to 100% under normoosmotic control conditions, and the extent of inhibition of proteolysis was determined 30 min after institution of the respective conditions, a time point when a new steady state had been reached. Determination of Intracellular Water Space in Perfused Liver—The intracellular water space in the intact perfused rat liver was calculated from the difference of washout profiles of simultaneously infused [14C]urea and [3H]inulin (∼500 Bq/ml perfusate) as described previously (22vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, both isotopes were infused for 5 min, a time period sufficient to allow equilibration of both tracers within the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Then, tracer infusion was stopped, and the influent perfusate was collected for another 5 min, a time period allowing complete washout of both isotopes. The effluent was monitored for the total sum of released 3H and 14C label by dual spectrum scintillation spectrometry. Taking the 3H/14C ratio under steady state conditions, a putative 14C-accessible, but not 3H-accessible, space was calculated. This space, expressed as intracellular water space (μl/g liver), was seen to reflect the cellular hydration state. The cellular hydration state was measured under control conditions and again 30 min after institution of the respective conditions. A spontaneous decrease of the intracellular water space of 2.6% within 30 min in fed animals was taken into account as described previously (22vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In livers from fed animals, the cell water under control conditions was 572 ± 11 μl/g (n = 28). Tissue Processing for Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot determinations, liver lobes from perfused liver were excised in a way that kept portal pressure constant at the respective time points (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after infusion of insulin) and homogenized with an Ultraturrax (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) at 0 °C in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Western Blot Analysis—The lysed samples from the perfused liver were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. Therefore an identical volume of 2× gel loading buffer containing 200 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.8) was added to the lysates. After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (50 μg of protein/lane, 7.5% gels). Following electrophoresis, gels were equilibrated with transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris/HCl, 0.03% SDS, 20% methanol). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) or a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Blots were blocked overnight in 1% bovine serum albumin solubilized in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 3-4 h with antibodies raised against [Tyr(P)418]Src, Src, [Tyr(P)397]FAK, FAK, [Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182]p38, p38, [Tyr(P)1158]IRβ, IRβ, and [Ser(P)473]PKB, PKB, [Thr(P)421/Ser(P)424]p70S6-kinase, p70S6-kinase, and 4E-BP1 at a dilution of 1:5.000. Following washing and incubation for 2 h with horse-radish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10.000), the blots were washed again and developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed with the EASY RH system (Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany). Immunofluorescence Staining of the α5β1 Integrin Dimer and the Active Conformation of the β1 Integrin Subunit—Cryosections of perfused livers were analyzed for total α5β1 integrin expression, induction of the active conformation of the β1 integrin subunit, and integrity of the actin cytoskeleton by using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning system with an argon-krypton laser on a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope (Bensheim, Germany) as described (23Kubitz R. Huth C. Schmitt M. Horbach A. Kullak-Ublick G. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Livers were perfused with normoosmotic (305 mosm), hypoosmotic (185 mosm), or normoosmotic Krebs-Henseleit saline supplemented with 35 nm insulin as described above. If indicated, furosemide (100 μm, experiments shown in Fig. 2) or latrunculin B (2 μm, experiments shown in Fig. 4) was added to the perfusion medium 30 min prior to and during insulin infusion. For immunohistochemistry of liver slices as primary antibodies, the polyclonal goat anti-α5β1 integrin dimer antibody (1:100) and the monoclonal mouse anti-β1 integrin subunit active conformation antibody (1:100) were used (Fig. 2). To visualize filamentous actin, FITC-coupled phalloidin (1 μg/ml) was applied (Figs. 2 and 4).Fig. 4Latrunculin B disrupts microfilaments in perfused rat liver. Latrunculin B (2 μm) was infused 30 min prior to addition of insulin (35 nm). In control experiments insulin was added in the absence of latrunculin B. Liver samples were taken immediately before (zero time point) and during infusion with insulin (15 and 30 min after addition of insulin). Morphological analysis of actin G distribution was performed in slices from perfused rat liver obtained by freeze sectioning. Microfilaments were visualized by means of immunofluorescence by labeling with FITC-coupled phalloidin.

Role of Integrins as Osmosensors in Insulin Signaling toward p38MAPK—Insulin (35 nm) induces a rapid Src phosphorylation on Tyr418, which is maximal after 2-5 min (Fig. 1, Table I) and as shown previously (15Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) insulin causes a rapid and transient activation of the p38-type MAP-kinase in perfused rat liver (Fig. 1A, Table I). Also the level of [Tyr(P)397]FAK is increased in response to insulin (Fig. 1A, Table I). Control perfusions in the absence of insulin were without effect on p38MAPK and did not affect either Src phosphorylation on Tyr418 or FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397 (Fig. 1A, Table I).Table IEffects of the integrin antagonistic peptide GRGDSP, its inactive analogue GRGESP, the Src inhibitor PP-2, and the NKCC1 inhibitor furosemide on Src Tyr418, FAK Tyr397, and dual p38MAPK phosphorylation induced by insulin in perfused rat liverConditionTyr(P)418SrcTyr(P)397FAKThr(P)180/Tyr(P)182p38Control1.3 ± 0.1 (7)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.1.3 ± 0.1 (4)1.3 ± 0.2 (7)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.Insulin2.1 ± 0.3 (6)bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).1.5 ± 0.2 (6)bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).2.8 ± 0.4 (6)bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).Insulin + GRGDSP1.3 ± 0.1 (8)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.1.2 ± 0.2 (6)1.5 ± 0.7 (8)Insulin + GRGESP3.7 ± 0.2 (6)bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).1.7 ± 0.4 (6)bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).2.8 ± 0.5 (6)bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).Insulin + PP-21.5 ± 0.2 (9)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.bPhosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).1.1 ± 0.2 (7)1.4 ± 0.3 (9)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.Insulin + furosemide1.1 ± 0.1 (6)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.ND1.2 ± 0.2 (3)aResponse was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.cValue was taken from Ref. 16.a Response was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from the response evoked by insulin in absence of inhibitory compounds.b Phosphorylation was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different from that found at the zero time point (insulin absent).c Value was taken from Ref. 16Schliess F. vom Dahl S.

Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Recently the formation of new connections between integrins and their specific ligands was shown to be required for integrin-mediated mechanotransduction (25Jalali S. del Pozzo M.A. Chen K. Miao H.

As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I infusion of the integrin-antagonistic hexapeptide GRGDSP (10 μm), but not the inactive control peptide GRGESP (10 μm), prevents the increase of [Tyr(P)418]Src and p38MAPK activation (Fig. 1, Table I) by insulin. Also the insulin-induced FAK-Tyr397 phosphorylation is sensitive to GRGDSP, although some inhibition is also observed in the presence of GRGESP (Table I).

Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), was used to examine the potential role of Src in the activation of p38MAPK by insulin in perfused rat liver. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I, PP-2 (250 nm) largely prevents Src Tyr418 phosphorylation, activation of p38MAPK, and FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation by insulin. PP-2 impaired neither IRβ Tyr1158 and PKB Ser473 phosphorylation nor K+ retention and cell swelling induced by insulin, indicating that Src is not involved in mediating cell swelling by insulin. Loop diuretics inhibit the sodium potassium chloride co-transport and thereby prevent insulin-induced hepatocyte swelling (27Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Eur. J.

Häussinger D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I, infusion of furosemide effectively prevents the increase of [Tyr(P)418]Src in response to insulin (Fig. 1, Table I). The findings support the view that cell swelling by insulin in perfused rat liver acts as a trigger of Src activation. However, furosemide has no effect on insulin-induced PKB Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Hypoosmotic Swelling and Insulin induce β1 Integrin Active Conformation—In normal liver the most important integrins are α1β1, α5β1, and α9β1 (29Carloni V. Mazzocca A. Pantaleo P. Cordella C.

To analyze the potential involvement of β1 integrin in osmosensing, sections from perfused livers were analyzed for β1 immunoreactivity using antibodies recognizing the active β1 integrin and the α5β1 dimer, respectively. To visualize hepatocyte border lines, the cortically localized filamentous actin was labeled with FITC-coupled phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 2, under normoosmotic control conditions there was an intense membrane staining for the α5β1 dimer but not for the active β1 form, indicating that integrins are largely in an inactive form under control conditions.

The apyrase activity found in the saliva of hematophagous insects is correlated with the prevention of ADP-induced platelet aggregation of the host during blood sucking. Purification of apyrase activity from the saliva of the triatomine bug Triatoma infestans was achieved by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose and gel filtration chromatography. The isolated fraction includes five N-glycosylated polypeptides of 88, 82, 79, 68 and 67 kDa apparent molecular masses. The isolated apyrase mixture completely inhibited aggregation of human blood platelets. Labeling with the ATP substrate analogue 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine showed that the five species have ATP-binding characteristic of functional apyrases. Furthermore, tandem mass spectroscopy peptide sequencing showed that the five species share sequence similarities with the apyrase from Aedes aegypti and with 5′-nucleotidases from other species. The complete cDNA of the 79-kDa enzyme was cloned, and its sequence confirmed that it encodes for an apyrase belonging to the 5′-nucleotidase family. The gene multiplication leading to the unusual salivary apyrase diversity in T. infestans could represent an important mechanism amplifying the enzyme expression during the insect evolution to hematophagy, in addition to an escape from the host immune response, thus enhancing acquisition of a meal by this triatomine vector of Chagas' disease.

Hematophagy in triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is associated with the presence of biochemical compounds in the salivary glands that are essential for obtaining blood meals. Indeed, most blood-feeding arthropods have salivary components with vasodilatory, anti-clotting, and anti-platelet aggregation activities that are capable of inhibiting hemostatic reactions of the host (1Arocha-Pinango C.L.

Similarly, collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by, respectively, pallidipin and triabin, both of which are present in the saliva of Triatoma pallidipennis (11Noeske-Jungblut C.

However, the importance of ADP as a common mediator of platelet aggregation pathways is evidenced by the presence on the vascular endothelium surface of the CD39 apyrase, which limits platelet aggregation by hydrolyzing ADP, thus preventing thrombus formation (13Marcus A.J.

Thus, studying insect apyrases may lead to alternative strategies against the diseases they transmit, as well as new pharmaceutical tools for platelet aggregation-associated disorders.

Here, we report the purification and characterization of five salivary apyrases from Triatoma infestans, a vector of the agent of Chagas' disease, the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The sequence of the gene encoding the 79-kDa apyrase confirmed that it belongs to the 5′-nucleotidase family apyrase. Triatomines and Collection of Saliva—T. infestans were reared in an insectary maintained at 28 ± 2 °C, 70% ± 5 relative humidity, with photoperiods of 12 h. Pipette tips were placed over the triatomines mouthparts and approximately 0.2–1 μl of saliva was collected from each adult triatomine. Except for phenotyping, all experiments were performed with pooled saliva obtained from insects at 20 days following a blood meal. The saliva was filtered through an 0.22-μm pore membrane and stored at –80 °C until use. Apyrase Purification—Saliva (800 μg of protein) was applied to an oligo(dT)12–18 cellulose column (0.7 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted with isocratic steps of 10 ml of the same buffer containing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl, respectively, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected on ice and tested for apyrase activity. The active fractions, which were eluted in 0.5 m NaCl, were pooled and concentrated to 50 μl by ultrafiltration through a Centricon 30 (Amicon) at 4 °C. The resulting protein solution (50 μg) was loaded on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The absorbency at 280 nm was recorded, and 0.4-ml fractions were tested for enzyme activity. The active fractions, pooled and concentrated as described above, this time to 0.5 ml, were stored at –80 °C until use. Deglycosylation—Proteins were deglycosylated with O-glycosidase (0.1 unit) and neuraminidase (0.5 unit) as described by the glycosidase procedures (Bio-Rad). For PNGase F 1The abbreviations used are: PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; FSBA, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; MS/MS, tandem mass spectroscopy; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. (0.1 unit) treatment, 2 μg of purified saliva were boiled in 1% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and diluted 10-fold in 100 mm phosphate containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 prior to incubation with the enzyme for 12 h at 37 °C. The mix was then subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE analysis. FSBA Labeling—Purified apyrases were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 mm FSBA (Sigma) solubilized in Me2SO. To assess labeling specificity, ATP (5 mm) was introduced in the reaction mix before the addition of FSBA. Mock control consisted of purified apyrases incubated with Me2SO only (10% final concentration). Then, proteins were submitted to 6% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and immunoblot was performed with serum raised against FSBA in rabbit (a kind gift of Dr. A. R. Beaudoin). Immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Platelet Aggregation Assay—From a fasting human donor who had not been exposed to any platelet aggregation-interfering drugs within the preceding 10 days, 5 milliliters of human blood was collected in sodium citrate 0.38%, and 2 ml of the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by differential centrifugation (25Born G.V. Nature. 1965; 206: 1121-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The PRP (400 μl) was preincubated under stirring for 10 min at 37 °C, and the aggregation was induced by the addition of ADP (5 μm final concentration) and measured in an aggregometer (model 2020, NetLab, São Paulo, Brazil) after incubation for 10 min. Different dilutions of crude or purified apyrase were added to the PRP at 4 min prior to the addition of the inducer. Enzymatic Characterization of T. infestans Apyrase Activity—T. infestans salivary apyrase activity was determined essentially as described previously (26Schadeck R.J. Sarkis J.J. Dias R.D. Araujo H.M. Souza D.O. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1989; 22: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, 30-μl samples were incubated in microplates with 50 μl of activity buffer (100 mm Tris, 10 mm KCl, 450 mm sucrose, 20 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and 20 μl of 5 mm ATP, ADP, or AMP at 37 °C for 20 min. The released inorganic phosphate (Pi) was quantified by the Fiske and Subbarow method (27Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Reaction was shown to be linear over a 30-min period. Each assay was run in triplicate. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to release 1 μmol of Pi/min at 37 °C. The activity of the purified apyrase mixture was determined at 25, 30, 37, 42, 56, and 65 °C for 20 min, as described above. Likewise, the effect of pH on the apyrase activity was determined at 37 °C using 50 mm buffering solutions of bis-Tris, pH 6–7, Tris-HCl, pH 7–8, and borate, pH 9–10. The effect of divalent cations on enzyme activity was determined by substituting the MgCl2 present in the reaction mix with CaCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, or CoSO4 at a final concentration of 1 mm. The effects of inhibitors on the apyrase activity were determined by preincubating purified apyrase at 37 °C for 10 min with ouabain (1 mm), levamisole (1 mm), mycrocistin-LR (0.01 mm), okadaic acid (0.01 mm), sodium azide (20 mm), NaF (1 and 10 mm), vanadate (0.1 an 1 mm), 2-mercaptoethanol (5 mm), iodoacetamide (5 mm), or di(adenosine-5′)pentaphosphate (0.01 mm). Mass Spectrometry—Following electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining, the 88-, 82-, and 79-kDa bands and the 68/67-kDa doublet were excised from the gel, washed, and analyzed in the manner described previously (28Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). In brief, the gel pieces were washed in 25 mm ammonium hydrogenocarbonate (NH4HCO3), pH 8, then in 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm NH4HCO3, and finally with pure water, for 30 min each before complete dehydration in a vacuum centrifuge. The gel pieces were reswollen with a minimum amount of sequence grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) solution containing 0.5 μg of protease (typically 10 μl of an 0.05 μg portion of trypsin/μl solution in 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing 10% acetonitrile). When necessary, NH4HCO3 buffer was added until the gel piece achieved complete rehydration. Digestion occurred at 37 °C for 3–5 h. The tryptic digest was extracted twice with a 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm NH4HCO3 solution. The digest solution and the extracts were pooled, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and desalted with ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Bedford, Ma) prior to a nanospray MS/MS analysis. A Q-Tof instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK) was used with a Z-Spray ion source working in the nanospray mode. About 3–5 μl of the desalted sample was introduced into a needle (medium sample needle, Protana Inc., Odense, Denmark) to run MS and MS/MS experiments. The capillary voltage was set to 1000 V and the sample cone to 50 V. Glufibrinopeptide was used to calibrate the instrument in the MS/MS mode. MS/MS spectra were transformed using MaxEnt3 (MassLynx, Micromass Ltd.), and amino acid sequences were analyzed using PepSeq (BioLynx, Micromass Ltd). Amino acid sequences were used in homology searches with BLAST or FASTA (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). PCR Amplification of apy79 cDNA—cDNA inserts of a salivary gland cDNA library constructed in λ ZAP bacteriophage (Stratagene) were PCR-amplified using the M13 reverse and T7 vector primers flanking the inserts as follows. After chelation of the MgCl2 present in SM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgSO4, 0.01% gelatin) by EDTA used for storage of the library phages, 10 μl of the library boiled for 10 min was used as template in a 35-cycle standard PCR reaction. Amplification products ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 kb were then gel-purified using a QIAquick column (Qiagen). To amplify the apy79 cDNA fragment, primers were derived from the 5′-nucleotidase conserved motif GNHEFD and the VYEEDDL/I peptide sequence of the 79-kDa apyrase. The degenerated primer set CONS1-s (GGNAAYCAYGARTTYGAY) and MS79-as (ADRTCRTCYTCYTCRTA) was used. PCR amplification products were obtained from the amplified library with an annealing temperature of 45 °C (8 °C above calculated Tm) to ensure maximum specificity. The single band product of 1.2 kb was cloned into pGEM T-easy plasmid (Promega). Library Screening—The 1.2-kb cDNA fragment was labeled using the Random Primer labeling kit (Invitrogen) and used to screen the salivary gland cDNA library by standard procedures (λ ZAP manual), with washes done at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were submitted to in vivo excision (λ ZAP manual) to rescue the plasmids from which the inserts were sequenced. 5′-RACE—To get the 5′ missing region of the apy79 cDNA, we used the Stratagene GeneRacer kit that allows selection of complete mRNA by selective ligation of a RNA linker to their capped 5′ end. We used as starting material 2 μg of total RNA TRIzol extracted from the salivary glands of equal numbers of adult insects at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 15 days after feeding. The 79GSP1-as primer (AGGTTGTGATCCTGTA) was used for reverse transcription, and the resulting cDNA was submitted to PCR with the 79GSP2-as primer (GCCAGAATGTCCCACGGCGAATA) and 5′ end linker primer. Specificity of the 1-kb product obtained was confirmed by nested PCR using two other gene-specific primers and Southern blot with the 1.2-kb apy79 cDNA probe. This product was cloned into pCR 4-TOPO and sequenced. Baculovirus Expression—Recombinant baculovirus was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac system and protocol (Invitrogen). The Apy79 coding region was cloned by standard molecular biology techniques into the pFastBac plasmid with native signal peptide or mellitin signal peptide (kind gift from S. Bibert). In addition, two His-tagged constructions were derived by adding six histidine residues at the C terminus. Sf9 insect cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus, and supernatant aliquots were taken at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after infection. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE using the standard Laemmli procedure. After completion of the run, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a semidry system. Membranes were blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry skimmed milk and then probed with anti-apyrase serum raised in rabbit by immunization with purified 79-kDa recombinant apyrase. Secondary antibody was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and immunoblot was developed using diaminobenzidine. Genomic Southern—Genomic DNA was extracted from 50 adult T. infestans insects, and the pooled DNA was probed by Southern blot with 32P-labeled apy79 cDNA (29Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual Vol. 6. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7-12Google Scholar). Fifty μg of genomic DNA was digested with XhoI, BamHI, or HindIII. This last enzyme promotes two cuts within the apy79 cDNA, generating a 468-bp internal fragment. The DNA fragments were separated in an 0.7% agarose gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was probed with 25 ng of radiolabeled apy79 spanning positions 75–2449 of the deposited cDNA sequence (EcoRI digestion). The blotted nitrocellulose membrane was washed subsequently at 60 °C in 2× SSC (twice), 0.2× SSC, and 0.1× SSC, each containing 0.1% SDS. T. cruzi DNA was used as a negative control. Purification and Characterization of Proteins with Apyrase Activity—Insect saliva from about 150 T. infestans reared in the laboratory was used to purify apyrase activity first described by Ribeiro et al. (3Ribeiro J.M. Schneider M. Isaias T. Jurberg J. Galvao C. Guimaraes J.A. J. Med. Entomol. 1998; 35: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An oligo(dT)12–18 cellulose column was used for a first-step purification of the apyrase because this method has been successfully employed for purification of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferases (30Okamura S. Crane F. Messner H.A. Mak T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3765-3767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical experiment showing chromatography of 800 μg of saliva in an oligo(dT)-cellulose column is shown in Fig. 1A. About 10% of the total saliva proteins bound to the matrix and was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. This fraction, which retained 84% of the salivary apyrase activity, was concentrated and loaded on a Superose 6 column. The apyrase activity was eluted as a large peak with an elution volume corresponding to a 400-kDa globular protein, as shown in Fig. 1B. This two-step chromatographic procedure led to an ∼75-fold increase in apyrase specific activity with a yield of 35%. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1C) showed that the 400-kDa apyrase fraction contained five proteins with molecular masses of 88, 82, and 79 kDa and a 68–67 kDa doublet, implying that they are associated in a protein complex. 2E. Faudry, J. M. Santana, C. Ebel, T. Vernet, and A. R. L. Teixeira, manuscript in preparation. The presence of the 68–67 kDa doublet is more clearly seen in SDS-PAGE with a lower polyacrylamide concentration (Fig. 2, lane 1). The purified sample was treated with neuraminidase, O-glycosidase, or PNGase F. Only PNGase F changed the migration pattern to 64-, 59-, 57-, and 54-kDa bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) showing that the various species are N-glycosylated and do not represent different glycosylation levels of one or more proteins. The five apyrase species were specifically labeled by FSBA (Fig. 3), an ATP analogue that covalently binds its enzyme target and can be detected by anti-FSBA-specific antibodies (31Sevigny J. Cote Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Antibody specificity was shown by the lack of reactivity against apyrases that were not incubated with FSBA (Fig. 3, lane 1). The intensity of the signal was markedly reduced when the apyrases were preincubated with ATP (Fig. 3, lane 3). Therefore, the five proteins are likely to be functional species with respect to ATP binding. The T. infestans apyrases inhibited ADP-induced human platelet aggregation (Fig. 4). This inhibition assay was run by incubating increasing concentrations of crude saliva with PRP followed by 5-min incubations with 5 μm ADP. The experiment illustrated in Fig. 4 depicts 27% inhibition of platelet aggregation with 1 μg of crude saliva and complete inhibition with 5 μg and as low as 30 ng of purified apyrases. The apyrase activity of saliva spontaneously ejected by one insect completely abolished aggregation of platelets equivalent to 1 ml of human blood. Characterization of the Apyrases—Enzymatic characterization was performed to assess the apyrase nature of the purified proteins. The purified mixture displayed the same optimal temperature (37 °C) and optimal pH (pH 8.0) for the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP (maximum specific activities of 1500 and 1200 units/mg, respectively). Moreover, the two activities showed similar dependence upon divalent cations (1 mm final concentration) with a maximal hydrolytic activity against ATP and ADP obtained in the presence of 2 mm of Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+, whereas Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ did not influence enzyme activity. The enzymatic activity was ranked for nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (ATP > CTP > GTP > UTP > ITP) and nucleoside 5′-diphosphates (ADP > IDP > CDP > GDP > UDP), which corresponds to a typical apyrase pattern. Consistent with these observations, the purified fraction did not hydrolyze nucleoside 5′-monophosphates, glycerol phosphate, glycose 6-phosphate, and UDP-galactose. A series of ATPases, ATPDases, alkaline phosphatase, protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, and adenylate cyclase inhibitors were tested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both ATPase and ADPase activities were inhibited to similar levels by 1 mm vanadate and 1 mm NaF, indicating that the two enzymatic activities are unlikely to be held by different active sites. This was confirmed by a mixed substrate experiment (32Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1979: 72-75Google Scholar). The apyrase activity against a mixture of ATP and ADP was close to the mean of activities determined for hydrolysis of each of the two substrates used separately (data not shown). Taken together, all of these observations are consistent with a single site for nucleoside 5′-diphosphates and -triphosphates in each protein and exclude the possibility that the purified molecular species could correspond to a mixture of ATPases and ADPases. Analysis of the Saliva Apyrases by Mass Spectrometry—The masses of peptides obtained by in-gel digestion of the 88- and 79-kDa proteins were compared with the in silico digestion of Swiss Protein and TrEMBL data base entries (33Henzel W.J.

Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). The peptide mass maps from the 88- and 79-kDa proteins presented striking similarities with the Ae. aegypti apyrase map, and partial sequences were also conserved. To confirm these results, MS/MS peptide sequences were obtained from the 88-, 82-, 79-, and 68–67-kDa proteins (Fig. 5). Because of their close migration, the 68- and 67-kDa species were excised together. Each of the four samples excised from the gel showed sequence similarities with 5′-nucleotidase family proteins (17Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The VPVV(Q/K)A sequence, belonging to the highly conserved region of this protein family, was found in each polypeptide chain. In summary, the results presented in Fig. 5 reveal several similarities between the T. infestans saliva apyrases and members of the 5′-nucleotidase family belonging to species of four different orders. Although the five apyrase species display peptides with high similarities, differences among some residues suggest a diversity of genetic origin.

Type 1 InsP3R (InsP3R1) is a predominant neuronal isoform. Neuronal InsP3R1 is one of the major substrates of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. In our previous study (Tang, T. S., Tu, H., Wang, Z., and Bezprozvanny, I. (2003) J. Neurosci. 23, 403-415) we discovered a direct association between InsP3R1 and protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α). In functional experiments we demonstrated that phosphorylation by PKA activates InsP3R1 and that dephosphorylation by PP1α inhibits InsP3R1. To extend these findings, here we investigated the possibility of InsP3R1-PKA association. In a series of biochemical experiments we demonstrate the following findings. 1) InsP3R1 and PKA associate in the brain. 2) InsP3R1-PKA association is mediated by the AKAP9 (Yotiao) multi-functional PKA anchoring protein. 3) InsP3R1-AKAP9 association is mediated via the leucine/isoleucine zipper (LIZ) motif in the InsP3R1 coupling domain and the fourth LIZ motif in AKAP9. 4) The InsP3R association with AKAP9 is specific for type 1 InsP3R. 5) Both the SII(+) and the SII(-) coupling domain splice variants of InsP3R1 bind to AKAP9. 6) Binding to AKAP9 promotes association of neuronal InsP3R1 with the NR1 NMDA receptor; and 7) neuronal InsP3R1 associate with PP1 directly via carboxy-terminus and indirectly via AKAP9. The obtained results advance our understanding of cross-talk between cAMP and InsP3/Ca2+ signaling pathways in the brain.

The Ser-1755 residue is functionally important for potentiating the effects of PKA on the SII(+) InsP3R1 splice variant, whereas both Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 are important for potentiating the effects of PKA on the SII(-) InsP3R1 splice variant (11Wagner II, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Google Scholar). An emerging theme in signal transduction is the association of signaling molecules in macromolecular signaling complexes. The association of upstream and downstream signaling components increases the speed, efficiency, and specificity of signal transduction. Association between signaling molecules is often mediated by adaptor proteins. Recent data indicate that adaptor proteins mediate the association of PKA, PP1, and PP2A with the cardiac Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyanR2) (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar). In the previous paper we demonstrated the direct association of neuronal InsP3R1 with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) (16Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Google Scholar). Do InsP3R1 and PKA also associate in the brain? Is InsP3R1-PKA association direct or mediated by an adaptor protein? To address these questions, here we performed biochemical analysis of InsP3R1-PKA association. We discovered a novel InsP3R1-AKAP9-PKA complex in the brain and demonstrated that InsP3R1-AKAP9 association mediated by leucine/isoleucine zipper (LIZ) motifs in InsP3R1 and AKAP9 (Yotiao). The obtained results provide novel information about cross-talk between cAMP and InsP3/Ca2+ signaling pathways in the brain.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar) as a template; HA-AKAP9-LIZ = 1-820, HA-AKAP9-LIZ_1-3 = 1-302, HA-AKAP9-LIZ_1-4 = 1-400, and HA-AKAP9-LIZ_1-7 = 1-585. HA-AKAP6-LIZ = 264-451 in pCMV5-HA was generated by PCR using human AKAP6 plasmid (KIAA0311) as a template. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding rat InsP3R1-SII(+) (RT1), InsP3R1-SII(-) (RT1-SII(-)), InsP3R2 (RT2), and InsP3R3 (RT3) have been described previously (21Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Google Scholar, 23Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Google Scholar). 2H. Tu, Z. Wang, E. Nosyreva, H. De Smedt, and I. Bezprozvanny, submitted for publication. The RT1-L1268A mutant construct in pFastBac1 vector was generated by a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. The RT1-L1268A baculovirus was generated and amplified using Bac-to-Bac system according to manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. Immunoprecipitations and in Vitro Phosphorylation—Adult rat brains were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Brain homogenates were solubilized for 1.5 h at 4 °C in extraction buffer A containing 1% CHAPS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (100 ml) were infected with RT1 baculovirus and collected by centrifugation 72 h postinfection. Collected cells were solubilized in extraction buffer A. The rat brain and RT1 lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g (TL-100) and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads covered with T443 rabbit pAb against InsP3R1 (or the corresponding preimmune serum). Precipitated fractions were washed three times with ice-cold phosphorylation buffer (120 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in the phosphorylation buffer. The phosphorylation reaction (in 200-μl volume) was initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP, 5 μm ATP, and variable concentrations of cAMP (0-1000 nm) as indicated in the text. In control reactions, 10 units of PKA bovine heart catalytic subunit were added. The phosphorylation reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, and then the beads were pelleted, washed three times with the phosphorylation buffer, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Synaptosomes (P2) were prepared from rat brains as described previously (24Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Google Scholar), solubilized in extraction buffer A, clarified by centrifugation, (100,000 × g in TL-100), and immunoprecipitated with an anti-InsP3R1 polyclonal antibody attached to protein A-Sepharose beads. The precipitate was analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies against NR1 or PP1. GST, GST-RT1-LIZ, GST-RT3-LIZ, and GST-IC4 proteins were expressed in BL21 bacterial strain, purified on glutathione beads, eluted by reduced glutathione, and added into immunoprecipitation reactions at 200 μg/ml as indicated. Precipitation of [3H]InsP3 Binding Sites—Rat brain lysates, prepared as described above, were immunoprecipitated with anti-InsP3R1, anti-AKAP9, or anti-AKAP6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies attached to protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with the extraction buffer, incubated for 30 min with 5 nm [3H]InsP3 (Amersham Biosciences) on ice, pelleted by centrifugation, and rinsed quickly with extraction buffer A. The amount of [3H]InsP3 in the final samples was quantified by β-counting. The nonspecific signal was estimated by performing immunoprecipitation with empty protein A beads. GST and GST-RT1-LIZ proteins were included in the immunoprecipitation reactions at 200 μg/ml as indicated. In Vitro Binding Assays—Lysates from Sf9 cells infected with RT1-SII(-), RT1-L1268A, RT2, and RT3 baculoviruses were prepared as described above for RT1. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g in TL-100) and used in binding experiments. HA-AKAP6-LIZ and HA-AKAP9-LIZ fragments were expressed in COS7 cells by DEAE-dextran transfection (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 16.41-16.46Google Scholar). 72 h after transfection, cells were collected with ice-cold PBS and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g (TL-100 rotor, Beckman), mixed with Sf9 cells lysates containing recombinant InsP3R, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and precipitated by isoform-specific anti-InsP3R polyclonal antibodies. Precipitated fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Antibodies—The mouse monoclonal antibodies used were anti-HA (HA.11 from Covance), purified anti-NR1 (MMS0501P from Covance), anti-PP1, anti-AKAP1, and anti-AKAP2 from BD Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal anti-InsP3R1 (T443), anti-InsP3R2 (IB7122), and anti-InsP3R3 (IB7124) antibodies were described previously (26Kaznacheyeva E. Lupu V.D. Bezprozvanny I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 847-856Google Scholar). 2H. Tu, Z. Wang, E. Nosyreva, H. De Smedt, and I. Bezprozvanny, submitted for publication. Rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP6 antibody (UB07087) is from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP9 (anti-Yotiao) antibody (ZMD.252) is from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. InsP3R1-PKA Association Involves an Adaptor Protein and LIZ Motif in the InsP3R1 Sequence—To determine whether InsP3R1 and PKA form a complex in the brain, we performed a series of InsP3R1 immunoprecipitation experiments with rat brain lysates. Precipitated fractions were incubated with variable concentrations of cAMP (0-1000 nm) in the presence of [32P]MgATP and analyzed by phosphorimaging. We found that a substantial amount of 32P radioactivity was incorporated into InsP3R1 under these conditions in the presence of 100 and 1000 nm cAMP (Fig. 1A). No 32P radioactivity was incorporated into InsP3R1 in the absence of cAMP, and the signal at 10 nm cAMP was much weaker than at 100 or 1000 nm cAMP (Fig. 1A). From these results we concluded that functional cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is precipitated from rat brain lysates as a complex with the InsP3R1. This conclusion is consistent with the previous biochemical studies (27DeSouza N. Reiken S. Ondrias K. Yang Y.M. Matkovich S. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39397-39400Google Scholar). Do InsP3R1 and PKA associate directly? To address this question, we repeated immunoprecipitation/cAMP-phosphorylation experiments with the lysates from Sf9 cells infected with the RT1 baculovirus. In contrast to experiments with brain lysates, we did not detect cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of InsP3R1 precipitated from Sf9 cell lysates even in the presence of 1000 nm cAMP (Fig. 1B). Thus, we concluded that InsP3R1-PKA association is not direct and is most likely mediated by a neuronal PKA-anchoring (AKAP) adaptor protein. The ryanodine receptor, RyanR, is another intracellular Ca2+ release channel distantly related to InsP3R. It has been shown that RyanR1 and RyanR2 are associated with the AKAP6 (mAKAP) adaptor protein via non-canonical LIZ motifs in the RyanR1 and RyanR2 sequences (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar). The canonical leucine zipper (LZ) motif in the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane region of InsP3R1 plays an important role in the oligomerization of InsP3R (28Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar, 29Galvan D.L. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48248-48260Google Scholar). By sequence analysis we identified an additional non-canonical LIZ motif in the coupling region of the InsP3R1 (Asn-1251-Ile-1287, Fig. 2A). The identified InsP3R-LIZ motif is similar to the AKAP6-binding LIZ motif in RyanR1 and RyanR2 (Fig. 2A). Notably, both InsP3R and RyanR contain the “skip” residue (eight residues instead of seven between “d” amino acids) (30Brown J.H. Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1996; 26: 134-145Google Scholar) in the same position of this particular LIZ motif (Fig. 2A, indicated by a small triangle). Thus, by analogy with RyanR, we reasoned that LIZ motif in the InsP3R1 sequence may also mediate the association of InsP3R1 with an AKAP protein. To test the importance of the identified LIZ motif for InsP3R1 association with PKA, we repeated immunoprecipitation/cAMP phosphorylation experiments in the presence of the GST-RT1-LIZ protein. We found that GST-RT1-LIZ protein disrupted cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated brain InsP3R1 (Fig. 2B). The effects of GST-RT1-LIZ were specific, as GST protein had no effect on cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated neuronal InsP3R1, and the GST-RT3-LIZ protein had a much lesser effect than GSTRT1-LIZ (Fig. 2B). From these results we concluded that InsP3R1-PKA association in the brain is likely to be mediated by an AKAP adaptor protein that binds to the InsP3R1-LIZ motif (Fig. 2A). InsP3R1 Is Specifically Associated with AKAP9 in Vivo—AKAPs play an important role in the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling in cells (31Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Google Scholar). AKAP6 (mAKAP, AKAP100, KIAA0311) protein is expressed in muscle and the brain and is localized to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (32McCartney S. Little B.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9327-9333Google Scholar). The AKAP6 protein is 2319 amino acids long (molecular mass 257 kDa) and contains two LIZ motifs (Table I), a PDE4D3 phosphodiesterase binding site, and an RII-binding site (Fig. 3A) (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar, 32McCartney S. Little B.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

The AKAP6-LIZ2 motif binds to the LIZ3 motif in the RyanR1 and RyanR2 sequences (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar). To determine whether the LIZ-dependent association of InsP3R1 with PKA is also mediated by AKAP6, we attempted to precipitate the AKAP6-InsP3R1 complex from rat brain lysates. In these experiments rat brain lysates were precipitated with anti-AKAP6 polyclonal antibodies, and the amount of precipitated InsP3R1 was quantified by [3H]InsP3 binding. To confirm the specificity of immunoprecipitations, the experiments were performed in the presence of GST or GST-RT1-LIZ proteins. In control experiments we demonstrated that the addition of GST or GST-RT1-LIZ proteins had a similar effect on the precipitation of [3H]InsP3 binding sites from rat brain lysates by anti-InsP3R1 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3C). We found that AKAP6 polyclonal antibodies failed to precipitate [3H]InsP3-binding sites from rat brain lysates above the background (Fig. 3C). Thus, it is unlikely that the InsP3R1-AKAP6 complex is formed in rat brain.Table ILIZ and LZ motifs (underlined) in AKAPsAKAP1LIZ/LZAmino acidsSequenceLZ310-338LDRNEEGLDRNEEGLDRNEESLDRNEEGLAKAP2LIZ/LZAmino acidsSequenceLIZ80-108LEDNIQRLEQEIQTLESEESQISAKEQIIAKAP6LIZ/LZAmino acidsSequenceLIZ1850-871IASHKAGLKDMLRMIASQWKELLIZ21217-1238LEWDEMDISNKLISLNEESNDLAKAP9LIZ/LZAmino acidsSequenceLIZ1169-190LEMMESELAGKQHEIEELNRELLIZ2205-226LQEFEAAIKQRDGIITQLTANLLIZ3275-296LLQAKQQILTHQQQLEEQDHLLLIZ4364-392LTTADKLLGELQEQIVQKNQEIKNMKLELLIZ5493-514ITVNEDQIKLMNVAINELNIKLLIZ6524-545LKEELGLILEEKCALQRQLEDLLIZ7549-577LSFSREQIQRARQTIAEQESKLNEAHKSLLZ1700-721LITKQNQLILEISKLKDLQQSLLZ2778-799LQEKFAQLEAENSILKDEKKTLAKAP13LIZ/LZAmino acidsSequenceLZ2654-2675LRAAQKQLEREQEQLRREAERLScarLIZ/LZAmino acidsSequenceLZ69-90LQERVDRLSVSVTQLDPKEEEL Open table in a new tab After the failure of anti-AKAP6 antibodies to precipitate [3H]InsP3-binding sites from brain lysates, we searched other known AKAP proteins for the presence of LZ/LIZ motifs. In addition to AKAP6 (mAKAP, AKAP100), we identified LZ/LIZ motifs in AKAP1 (AKAP84, AKAP149), AKAP2 (AKAP-KL), AKAP9 (Yotiao, AKAP120, AKAP350, AKAP450), AKAP13 (HT31), and Scar (wave-1) (Table I). We have not detected LZ/LIZ motifs in sequences of the other known AKAP proteins (31Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Google Scholar, 34Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Google Scholar), namely AKAP3 (AKAP110), AKAP4 (AKAP82), AKAP5 (AKAP75/79), AKAP7 (AKAP18), AKAP8 (AKAP95), AKAP10, AKAP11 (AKAP220), AKAP12 (Gravin, AKAP250), MAP2B, and myosin VIIA (data not shown). Using commercially available anti-AKAP1 and anti-AKAP2 monoclonal antibodies, we failed to detect AKAP1 and AKAP2 in fractions precipitated from rat brain lysates by anti-InsP3R1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Thus, we focused on AKAP9 (Yotiao), a multifunctional PKA adaptor protein expressed in brain, heart, and testis (20Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar). AKAP9 is a 1652-amino acid-long protein (molecular mass 191 kDa) that contains seven LIZ motifs (Table I), two LZ motifs (Table I), an NR1 NMDA receptor subunit-binding region, a PP1-binding site, and an RII-binding site (Fig. 3B) (20Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 35Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar, 36Feliciello A. Cardone L. Garbi C. Ginsberg M.D. Varrone S. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 174-178Google Scholar). When we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with rat brain lysates using anti-AKAP9 polyclonal antibodies, we discovered that anti-AKAP9 antibodies precipitated ∼50% of the [3H]InsP3-binding sites that could be precipitated by anti-InsP3R1 antibodies (Fig. 3C). Importantly, the precipitation of [3H]InsP3-binding sites by anti-AKAP9 antibodies was prevented in the presence of the GST-RT1-LIZ protein, but not in the presence of the GST protein (Fig. 3C). From these results we concluded that, in the brain, InsP3R1 forms a complex with AKAP9 but not with AKAP6. This conclusion was further supported by Western blotting of anti-AKAP6 and anti-AKAP9 immunoprecipitated fractions with anti-InsP3R1 polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Specific InsP3R1-AKAP9 Association Is Mediated by LIZ-LIZ Interactions—To further analyze the InsP3R1 association with AKAPs, we performed a series of in vitro binding experiments. In these experiments, LIZ-containing regions of AKAP6 (HAAKAP6-LIZ; Fig. 3A) and AKAP9 (HA-AKAP9-LIZ; Fig. 3B) were expressed as HA-tagged proteins in COS cells and mixed with lysates from Sf9 cells infected with the RT1 baculovirus. To further establish a role of LIZ motif in the InsP3R1 sequence, we generated a RT1-L1268A mutant baculovirus (Fig. 2A) in which the LIZ motif is disrupted. In control Western blotting experiments we confirmed that RT1 and RT1-L1268A express in Sf9 cells at similar levels (Fig. 4A). In immunoprecipitation experiments we found that the HA-AKAP9-LIZ protein forms a complex with RT1 but not with the RT1-L1268A protein (Fig. 4B). In agreement with in vivo precipitations, RT1 association with HA-AKAP9-LIZ was inhibited by GST-RT1-LIZ but not by the GST protein (Fig. 4B). Thus, we concluded that InsP3R1 and AKAP9 specifically associate via LIZ-mediated interactions. The LIZ motif is present in all InsP3R isoforms (Fig. 2A). Do InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 bind AKAP9? Does the InsP3R1-SII(-) splice variant bind AKAP9? To answer these questions we repeated HA-AKAP9-LIZ in vitro binding experiments with InsP3R2 (RT2) and InsP3R3 (RT3) isoforms and with the InsP3R1-SII(-) (RT1-SII(-)) splice variant expressed in Sf9 cells by baculoviral infection (21Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Google Scholar, 23Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Google Scholar). 2H. Tu, Z. Wang, E. Nosyreva, H. De Smedt, and I. Bezprozvanny, submitted for publication. In these experiments we found that AKAP9-LIZ fragment binds to both InsP3R1 SII splice variants, but not to the InsP3R2 or InsP3R3 isoforms (Fig. 4B). The specificity of the AKAP9-LIZ fragment for InsP3R1 agrees with the ability of GST-RT1-LIZ, but not GSTRT3-LIZ, to disrupt InsP3R1-PKA association immunoprecipitation experiments from brain lysates (Fig. 2B). Do any of the InsP3R isoforms bind AKAP6? To answer this question, we performed in vitro binding experiments with InsP3R-expressing Sf9 cells lysates and HA-AKAP6-LIZ protein expressed in COS cells. We found that the AKAP-LIZ region failed to associate with any InsP3R isoform in vitro (Fig. 4C), which is in agreement with negative immunoprecipitation results with anti-AKAP6 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3C). Sequence analysis predicts seven LIZ motifs and two canonical LZ motifs in the AKAP9 sequence (Figs. 3B and 5A; also Table I). To determine which of these motifs mediate association with InsP3R1, we generated a series of truncated HA-AKAP9-LIZ constructs (Fig. 5A). These truncated HA-AKAP9-LIZ constructs were expressed in COS cells and tested for association with recombinant InsP3R1 (RT1) expressed in Sf9 cells by baculoviral infection as described above. We found that HA-AKAP9-LIZ_1-7 and HA-AKAP9-LIZ_1-4 fragments bind to InsP3R1 in a similar fashion as the HA-AKAP9-LIZ construct (Figs. 4B and 5B). In contrast, the HA-AKAP9-LIZ_1-3 fragment did not bind to InsP3R1 (Fig. 5B). These results clearly indicated that association with InsP3R1 is mediated by the LIZ4 motif (amino acids 364-392; Table I) in the AKAP9 sequence. InsP3R1-NR1 and InsP3R1-PP1 Association—AKAP9 is a multifunctional adaptor protein that was initially isolated as a C1 exon-dependent binding partner for the NR1 NMDA receptor subunit (20Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar). The results described above suggest that AKAP9 mediates InsP3R1 association with PKA. To test if AKAP9 also mediates InsP3R1 association with NR1 NMDA receptors, we performed InsP3R1 immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain synaptosomal lysates and analyzed precipitated fractions by Western blotting with anti-NR1 purified mouse monoclonal antibodies. We discovered that NR1 receptors were efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-InsP3R1 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6A). Precipitation of NR1 subunits by anti-InsP3R1 antibodies was inhibited by the addition of the GST-RT1-LIZ protein but not by the addition of the GST protein to the immunoprecipitation reaction (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with AKAP9-LIZ mediated association. In the previous studies we discovered the direct association of the InsP3R1 carboxyl-terminal region with the PP1α catalytic subunit (16Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Google Scholar). AKAP9 also contains the PP1-binding site (35Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar) (Figs. 3B and 5A). To compare the relative contribution of direct and AKAP9-mediated interactions between InsP3R1 and PP1 in the brain, we performed a series of InsP3R1 immunoprecipitation experiments with rat brain synaptosomal lysates and analyzed precipitated fractions by Western blotting with anti-PP1 mouse monoclonal antibodies. In agreement with the previous findings (16Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Google Scholar), we found that anti-InsP3R1 antibodies efficiently precipitated PP1 from synaptosomal lysates (Fig. 6B). In the previous studies we demonstrated that the GST-IC4 protein (previously described as GST-IC1) acts as an inhibitor of direct association between PP1 and the InsP3R1 carboxyl terminus (16Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Google Scholar). Addition of the GST-IC4 protein to the InsP3R1 immunoprecipitation reaction resulted in an ∼75% reduction in the amount of PP1 precipitated from synaptosomal lysates (Fig. 6B). Some, but not all, of this reduction could be attributed to GST-IC4 interference with the immunoprecipitating ability of anti-InsP3R1 antibodies (Fig. 3C). Addition of the GST-RT1-LIZ protein resulted in an ∼30% reduction in the amount of precipitated PP1 (Fig. 6B). When both GST-IC4 and GST-RT1-LIZ proteins were included in the immunoprecipitation reaction, PP1 immunoreactivity disappeared from the InsP3R1 immunoprecipitates (>80% reduction) (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that both direct and AKAP9-mediated interactions are important for InsP3R1-PP1 association in the brain. The non-additive inhibitory effects of GST-IC4 and GSTRT1-LIZ proteins (Fig. 6B) most likely result from the nonlinear nature of the enhanced chemiluminescence used to quantify immunoprecipitated PP1. A cross-talk between the cAMP and Ca2+ signaling systems plays an important role in the brain (37Greengard P. Allen P.B. Nairn A.C. Neuron. 1999; 23: 435-447Google Scholar). InsP3R1 is one of the most prominent substrates of PKA phosphorylation in the brain (4Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 954-961Google Scholar, 5Supattapone S. Danoff S.K.

Here we demonstrate that InsP3R1 and PKA associate in a complex mediated by the adaptor protein AKAP9 (Yotiao) (20Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the previous biochemical studies that demonstrated InsP3R1-PKA association in immunoprecipitation experiments (27DeSouza N. Reiken S. Ondrias K. Yang Y.M. Matkovich S. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39397-39400Google Scholar). AKAP9 belongs to a class of AKAPs (protein kinase A anchoring proteins) that play an important role in the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling in cells (31Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Google Scholar). Discovery of LIZ-mediated InsP3R1-AKAP9 interactions (present report) adds to the previously described association of AKAP6 (mAKAP) with RyanR2 and RyanR1 (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar) and AKAP15 (AKAP7, AKAP18) with the carboxyl-terminal region of the CaV1.1 L-type Ca2+ channel subunit (38Hulme J.T. Ahn M. Hauschka S.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4079-4087Google Scholar) (via partial LZ motif in AKAP15 sequence). The presence of LZ/LIZ motifs in AKAP1 (AKAP84, AKAP121, AKAP149), AKAP2 (AKAP-KL, KIAA0920), AKAP13 (HT31) and Scar (wave-1) (Table I) indicate that additional interactions of this type are likely to be discovered. AKAP9 is a multi-functional AKAP that also binds the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (20Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 36Feliciello A. Cardone L. Garbi C. Ginsberg M.D. Varrone S. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 174-178Google Scholar) and PP1 (35Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). Thus, InsP3R1-AKAP9 binding is important not only for InsP3R1-PKA association but also for InsP3R1-NR1 (Fig. 6A) and InsP3R1-PP1 (Fig. 6B) association in synaptic locations. The AKAP9-mediated association between the coupling region of InsP3R1 and the NR1 NMDA receptor (present report) adds to a previously reported Homer-mediated association of the InsP3R1 amino terminus with mGluR1α/5 receptors (39Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Google Scholar) and a 4.1N-mediated association of the InsP3R1 carboxyl terminus with syndecan-2 and CASK (40Maximov A. Tang T.-S. Bezprozvanny I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 271-283Google Scholar). Thus, InsP3R1 has at least three potential links to postsynaptic plasma membrane signaling proteins, with some or all of these interactions likely playing an important role in the highly compartmentalized Ca2+ signaling in postsynaptic spines. The LIZ region of AKAP9 specifically binds to the SII(+) and SII(-) splice variants of InsP3R1 (Fig. 4B). Although InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 also contain LIZ motifs (Fig. 2A), they do not bind the LIZ region of AKAP9 (Fig. 4B). In the previous studies we demonstrated specific association of PP1α with the type 1 InsP3R carboxyl-terminal region (16Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Google Scholar). Thus, when compared with InsP3R2 and InsP3R3, InsP3R1 appears to be unique in its ability to associate with components of the cAMP signaling cascade. PKA phosphorylates InsP3R1 at two sites, Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 (7Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Google Scholar, 8Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 192-198Google Scholar, 9Haug L.S. Jensen V. Hvalby O. Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7467-7473Google Scholar, 10Pieper A.A. Brat D.J. O'Hearn E. Krug D.K. Kaplin A.I. Takahashi K. Greenberg J.H. Ginty D. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 433-444Google Scholar, 11Wagner II, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis reveals the presence of a single PKA phosphorylation consensus site at Ser-1687 in rat InsP3R2 and three PKA consensus phosphorylation sites in rat InsP3R3 (Ser-934, Ser-1133, and Ser-1460). Thus, for all three InsP3R isoforms, potential PKA phosphorylation sites are located in the middle coupling domain of the InsP3R (2Furuichi T. Kohda K. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 294-303Google Scholar). Interestingly, when agonist-induced PKA phosphorylation of endogenous InsP3R was compared in the SH-SY5Y (InsP3R1), AR4-2J (InsP3R2) and RINm5F (InsP3R3) cell lines (15Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Google Scholar), it was concluded that PKA phosphorylated InsP3R1 efficiently (0.65 mol Pi/mol), InsP3R3 less efficiently (0.14 mol Pi/mol), and InsP3R2 very inefficiently (0.04 mol Pi/mol). It is likely that AKAP9-mediated recruitment of PKA facilitates efficient phosphorylation of InsP3R1 in vivo when compared with InsP3R2 and InsP3R3. It is also possible that PKA association with AKAP9 affects the accessibility of the Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 sites in the InsP3R1 sequence to phosphorylation by PKA. Future experiments will be needed to test this hypothesis. It is interesting to compare the modes of InsP3R1 and RyanR association with components of the cAMP signaling cascade. The cardiac RyanR2 isoform contains three LIZ motifs, which associate with spinophilin/PP1 (LIZ1), PR130/PP2A (LIZ2), and AKAP6/PKA (LIZ3), respectively (Fig. 7A) (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle RyanR1 isoform lacks the LIZ2 (PR130-binding) motif but contains the LIZ1 (spinophilin-binding) and LIZ3 (AKAP6-binding) motifs (Fig. 7B) (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar). Our sequence analysis demonstrated that the motifs homologous to RyanR2-LIZ1 and RyanR2-LIZ2 are absent in the InsP3R1 sequence (data not shown) but that InsP3R1 contains a LIZ motif homologous to the RyanR2-LIZ3 (AKAP6-LIZ2-binding) motif (Figs. 2A and 7C). Interestingly, the InsP3R1-LIZ motif does not bind AKAP6 (Figs. 3C and 4C) but instead binds the AKAP9-LIZ4 motif (Figs. 3C, 4B, and 5B). Consistent with the absence of the LIZ1 (spinophilin-binding) motif in the InsP3R1 sequence, the catalytic subunit of PP1α binds directly to the InsP3R1 carboxyl terminus (16Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Google Scholar) (Fig. 7C). In addition, the catalytic subunit of PP1 also binds to the PP1-binding motif in the AKAP9 sequence (35Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar) (Figs. 3B, 5A, and 7C). The experiments with GST-IC4 and GST-RT1-LIZ competitive peptides indicate that both direct and AKAP9-mediated interactions are important for InsP3R1-PP1 association in the brain (Fig. 6B). Although the LIZ2 (PR130-binding) motif is absent in the InsP3R1 sequence, InsP3R1-PP2A association has been reported in immunoprecipitation experiments (27DeSouza N. Reiken S. Ondrias K. Yang Y.M. Matkovich S. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39397-39400Google Scholar). It is not clear if InsP3R1-PP2A association is direct or involves an adaptor protein. Interestingly, AKAP450 (CG-NAP), a longer splice-variant of AKAP9, binds to PR130/PP2A (35Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if AKAP450 plays a role in InsP3R1 association with PP2A. It is notable that critical PKA phosphorylation sites (Ser-1854 in CaV1.1 L-type Ca2+ channels (38Hulme J.T. Ahn M. Hauschka S.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4079-4087Google Scholar), Ser-2843 in RyanR1 (41Suko J. Maurer-Fogy I. Plank B. Bertel O. Wyskovsky W. Hohenegger M. Hellmann G. Biochim. Biophys.

Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4079-4087Google Scholar), AKAP6 (for RyanR1 and RyanR2) (17Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar), and AKAP9 (for InsP3R1; present report) (Fig. 7). The proximity of AKAP15/AKAP6/AKAP9 docking and PKA phosphorylation sites is likely to play an important role in facilitating efficient phosphorylation of the large proteins such as the CaV1.1 L-type Ca2+ channels RyanR and InsP3R1. Indeed, the importance of CaV1.1-AKAP15 and RyanR1-AKAP6 association for PKA-mediated effects on CaV1.1 L-type Ca2+ channels and RyanR1 has been demonstrated recently in a heterologous system (38Hulme J.T. Ahn M. Hauschka S.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4079-4087Google Scholar, 43Ruehr M.L. Russell M.A. Ferguson D.G. Bhat M. Ma J. Damron D.S. Scott J.D. Bond M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24831-24836Google Scholar). Future experiments will be needed to establish the physiological relevance of InsP3R1 association with AKAP9 and PKA for cross-talk between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways in the brain.

Factor Va functions both as a receptor for factor Xa and a positive effector of factor Xa catalytic efficiency and thus is key to efficient conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The activation of the procofactor, factor V, to factor Va is an essential reaction that occurs early in the process of tissue factor-initiated blood coagulation; however, the catalytic sequence leading to formation of factor Va is a subject of disagreement.

Prevailing accounts of tissue factor-initiated blood clotting (for a review, see Ref. 1Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) propose that membrane-localized tissue factor, either exposed or expressed as a consequence of physical trauma or ongoing pathology, binds circulating factor VIIa, forming an enzyme cofactor complex (the extrinsic tenase) that activates the zymogens factor IX and factor X to their respective serine proteases, factor IXa and factor Xa. Both factor IXa and factor Xa require cofactors to function effectively; factor VIIIa complexes with factor IXa (the intrinsic tenase) and functions to convert factor X to factor Xa, and factor Va complexes with factor Xa (prothrombinase) and catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to α-thrombin. Factor Va and factor VIIIa are proteolytically derived from their circulating inactive precursors, factor V and factor VIII. Thus, to proceed beyond the products of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex to the robust thrombin generation characterizing the normal hemostatic response, a catalyst(s) is essential early in the process that can activate factors V and VIII. Studies detailing the evolution of reactants in a number of models of the tissue factor-initiated process (2Butenas S. van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2423-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have indicated that α-thrombin generation is a biphasic phenomenon characterized by an initiation phase in which relatively low levels of thrombin are produced and a propagation phase in which the rate of thrombin generation increases dramatically and greater than 96% of prothrombin activation occurs. The transition region between these phases corresponds roughly to the time of formation of insoluble fibrin; the level of active thrombin present in this transitional region is about 2–5 nm and is derived from low levels of prothrombinase (∼7 pm) (7Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) formed during the initiation phase. The propagation phase is driven by rapid factor Xa production derived from the emergence of the intrinsic tenase complex; thus, the requirement for factor VIIIa has proven to be a relatively delayed event (8Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin concentrations at this time are sufficient to account for both the formation of factor VIIIa and the increased rates of factor Va production needed to exploit the growing concentration of factor Xa. However, the prothrombinase complexes forming earlier during the initiation phase require a source of factor Va that precedes the thrombin formed by these same factor Xa-factor Va complexes. Clarifying the route(s) by which initial levels of factor Va are formed has proven difficult, because the self-amplifying properties of α-thrombin within the process of tissue factor-initiated blood clotting make even a relatively inefficient catalyst(s) of factor V activation a potential initiating source of factor Va. The procofactor factor V does not function as a cofactor for factor Xa catalysis of the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The initial studies into the potential of intact factor V to function as a cofactor showed that substitution of factor V for factor Va in a prothrombinase assay format resulted in prothrombinase activity ≤0.4% that of factor Va (9Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a level of catalysis sufficient to function as the first source of α-thrombin in the initiating phase of clot generation (9Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the subsequent observation that factor Xa could directly activate factor V (10Foster W.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13970-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided a mechanism for generating low levels of factor Va in mixtures of factor V and factor Xa. Further studies showed no physiologically significant binding interaction between factor V and membrane-bound factor Xa (Kd ≥ 140 nm), 1K. Cawthern and K. G. Mann, manuscript in preparation. 1K. Cawthern and K. G. Mann, manuscript in preparation. effectively ruling out a prothrombinase complex incorporating factor V as an initiating source of α-thrombin during the blood clotting process. Human factor V (for a review, see Ref. 11Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2003; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is a single chain glycoprotein present in plasma at a concentration of 20 nm; an additional pool comprising 18–25% of the total factor V in whole blood is sequestered in the α-granules of platelets (12Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of factor V occurs when α-thrombin cleaves peptide bonds at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 (13Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J.

This results in the noncovalently associated heterodimer factor Va composed of a heavy chain (residues 1–709, Mr = 104,000) and a light chain (residues 1546–2196, Mr = 74,000, 71,000). The B region is released as two fragments (residues 710–1018, Mr = 71,000; residues 1019–1545, Mr = 150,000) that are not found associated with factor Va. Cleavage rates at Arg709 and Arg1018 are roughly equivalent and greater than that at Arg1545, resulting in a characteristic subset of high molecular weight intermediates and the delayed appearance of the light chain relative to the heavy chain when the process is visualized by SDS-PAGE (15Suzuki K.

When compared with α-thrombin, meizothrombin species have shown similar levels of activities with low molecular weight substrates (30Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Meizothrombin is an unstable species, undergoing autolytic cleavages at Arg155 or Arg284 that yield meizothrombin(desF1) or α-thrombin, respectively (35Morita T. Iwanaga S. Suzuki T. J. Biochem.

A recombinant mutant meizothrombin (R155A), resistant to autocatalytic removal of the fragment 1 domain, has been reported to be a better activator than α-thrombin for phospholipid-bound factor V (29Tans G. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. van Zonneveld A.J. Pannekoek H. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15969-15972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of factor Va, the prevailing order of prothrombin bond cleavages by phospholipid-bound factor Xa is the opposite of that followed in the presence of factor Va; an initial cleavage at Arg271 in prothrombin produces a noncovalently associated two-chain molecule (F1.2·prethrombin 2) with no enzymatic activity (Fig. 2). The overall rate of α-thrombin formation by phospholipid-bound factor Xa is decreased about 10,000-fold in the absence of factor Va (9Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study reexamines the activation of factor V by meizothrombin and factor Xa and the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa using a combination of biophysical and biochemical approaches. The resulting rate constants characterizing these activation processes are then evaluated in a numerical model of the tissue factor-initiated procoagulant pathway (5Hockin M.F. Jones K.C. Everse S.J.

Thromboplastin reagent for use in clotting assays was obtained from bioMerieux Inc. (Durham, NC). Spectrozyme TH and Spectrozyme Xa were purchased from American Diagnostica Inc (Greenwich, CT). 6-(d-Val-Pro-Arg)-amino-1-naphthalenebutylsulfonamide was synthesized as previously described (39Butenas S. Orfeo T. Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5399-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type thrombin and the recombinant mutant (R155A/R271A/R284A) meizothrombin were prepared as described previously (37Cote H.C. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.

Factor V was purified from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography as previously described (41Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For use in light scattering experiments, human factor V in 50% glycerol was dialyzed at 4 °C against 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS) for 4 h; the concentration of recovered factor V was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ1cm0.1% at 280 nm = 0.96); and the factor V was aliquoted in suitable amounts, flash-frozen in dry ice/methanol, and stored at –80 °C. Human prothrombin was prepared as described (42Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was prepared as described (43Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa was a gift from Hematologic Technologies or was prepared from human plasma factor X (42Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V-deficient plasma was prepared via immunodepletion of a freshly isolated five-donor pool of human plasma (41Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Preparation of Meizothrombin from Plasma Prothrombin— Meizothrombin from human plasma prothrombin was prepared essentially as described previously (30Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10693-10701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by activation of prothrombin with Echis carinatus prothrombin activator (Pentapharm Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) in the presence of DAPA. Briefly, 3 ml of 7 μm prothrombin was prepared in HBS plus 30 μm DAPA at 25 °C, E. carinatus activator (16 nm) was added, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by the increase in fluorescence signal at 565 nm as described previously (45Hibbard L.S. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction was completed in 90 min, and the mixture was placed on ice. Analysis of the products of this reaction by SDS-PAGE demonstrated that greater than 95% of the prothrombin was converted to meizothrombin, with the remainder appearing as the prothrombin fragments Pre-1 and F1. At 4 °C in the presence of 30 μm DAPA, no autolysis of meizothrombin was evident after 3 h. Preparation of Prothrombin Fragment F1.2 plus α-Thrombin—A mixture of prothrombin fragment F1.2 plus α-thrombin was prepared from human prothrombin (7 μm) by activation with the prothrombinase complex (10 nm factor Xa, 12 nm factor Va, 10 μm DOPC/DOPS) in the presence of 30 μm DAPA. The progress of the reaction was monitored by the increase in fluorescence at 565 nm (9Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When completed, the reaction mixture was placed on ice. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that only the expected products (F1.2 and α-thrombin) were present and that these products were stable for at least 3 h at 4 °C in the presence of 30 μm DAPA. Preparation of Prothrombin Fragments F1 plus F2 and α-Thrombin—A mixture of prothrombin fragments F1 plus F2 and α-thrombin was prepared from human prothrombin (7 μm) by activation with the prothrombinase complex (10 nm factor Xa, 12 nm factor Va, 10 μm DOPC/DOPS). The progress of the reaction was monitored by sampling into an equal volume of HBS plus 10 mm EDTA and assaying for α-thrombin levels using the DAPA assay described previously (46Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When completed, the reaction mixture was placed on ice. The presence of the expected products was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Preparation and Characterization of Phospholipid Vesicles for Light Scattering Experiments—Preparation of single bilayer phospholipid vesicles of uniform size was carried out as described by Hockin et al. (47Hockin M.F. Cawthern K.M. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6918-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, DOPC/DOPS (75%/25%) vesicles were prepared from mixtures of chloroform stocks of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (37.5 mg) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (12.5 mg), which were shell-dried under a nitrogen stream. The lipids were then dispersed in 15 ml of CHELEX 100 (Bio-Rad)-treated HBS and subjected to sonication for 60 min. Following sonication, the vesicle preparation was subjected to ultracentrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was then subjected to gel filtration. The selected pool contained about 10% of the pregel filtration phospholipid. The phospholipid concentration of the final isolate was quantified by phosphate assay (48Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). Characterization of the DOPC/DOPS vesicles with respect to molecular weight and homogeneity was routinely performed by sedimentation velocity analysis as described previously (47Hockin M.F. Cawthern K.M. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6918-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The selected DOPC/DOPS pool from each preparation exhibited a single g(s*) peak with S values ranging from 2.7 to 3. Quasielectric light scattering measurements (Dynapro Ms/X; Proterion Co.) on these phospholipid vesicle isolates showed that greater than 99% of the scattering mass in each preparation was characterized by a mean radius of ∼10 nm (range 9.5–10 nm), with the entire population contained within a 5–15-nm range of radii. From these data, vesicles were assigned a molecular weight of 2 × 106, with the number of phospholipid molecules per vesicle calculated to be 2525 (49Huang C. Mason J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Thus, 1 μm DOPC/DOPS is approximately equivalent to 0.4 nm vesicle. Vesicles were stored at room temperature in the dark under nitrogen and used within a 1-week period. Light Scattering Measurements—Right angle light scattering measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Spex, Instruments S.A., Inc.). Light scattering experiments were routinely conducted with the emission and excitation spectrometers set at 320 nm with band passes of 1.5 and 2 nm, respectively. Signal was acquired at 0.5-s intervals. All experiments were performed in degassed HBS that had been filtered using syringe filters with 0.2-μm pore size. Concentrated stock solutions of other components (e.g. CaCl2) were also filtered. An appropriate amount of the DOPC/DOPS stock was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at room temperature for 2 min immediately prior to use. Protein stocks were also centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min prior to addition. To minimize the presence of dust particles, fluorimeter cuvettes were washed and loaded with buffer components in a biosafety cabinet with a filtered air supply. Solutions with a 3-ml final volume were constructed at 25 °C in a 4-ml quartz cuvette and were stirred gently with a magnetic microstir bar. In general, 3 ml of HBS was added to the cuvette, and the scattering signal was observed for 60 s. Signal intensity routinely ranged from 10,000 to 12,000 counts/s with a 10% variation across the collection period. A volume of HBS equivalent to all other additions was then removed from the cuvette; CaCl2 and DOPC/DOPS were then added, and the signal intensity was established with a 3-min observation period. Other additions made prior to the addition of protein required brief periods of observation to acquire a stable signal. Binding of factor V to the vesicles was usually carried out for 15 min. The time periods required to measure changes in light scattering induced by proteolysis of vesicle-bound protein varied as a function of the catalyst and its concentration. Controls of identical duration were routinely performed to monitor any changes in the signal from the untreated factor V-vesicle complexes; in general, a stable signal was achieved from the factor V-vesicle complexes with systematic change over the experimental time periods involved of less than 5% that observed in the presence of enzymes. In most cases, additions other than buffer and DOPC/DOPS constituted less than 1% of the total volume and did not exceed 3% in the reported experiments. Data acquisition could be carried out continuously during additions of components and removal of samples for assay. Factor V and Factor Va Binding to DOPC/DOPS Vesicles— Light scattering measurements of the binding of factor V binding to the 10-nm radius DOPC/DOPS vesicles used in this study yielded a Kd of ∼3 nm with 80 phospholipid molecules bound per factor V molecule (data not shown). Binding of factor Va to similar sized vesicles has been characterized (Kd = 2.7 nm, 42 phospholipid molecules bound per factor Va molecule) (50Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calculation, using expressions reported previously (47Hockin M.F. Cawthern K.M. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6918-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), of the percentage of factor V and protease-derived factor Va bound to DOPC/DOPS vesicles under the conditions used (62.5–125 μm phospholipid, 100 nm FV/FVa species), indicated that for both factor V and factor Va greater than 99% of each protein is bound to the vesicles. Light scattering data were analyzed by the method of Nelsestuen and Lim (51Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using the formula I2/I1 = ((∂n/∂c)2/(∂n/∂c)1)2 × (M2/M1)2.

To explore the biochemical and structural bases for the adenosine phosphoramidate hydrolase activity of rabbit Hint, we synthesized novel substrates linking a p-nitroaniline group to adenylate (AMP-pNA) and inhibitors that consist of an adenosine group and 5′-sulfamoyl (AdoOSO2NH2) or N-ethylsulfamoyl (AdoOSO2NHCH2CH3) group. AMP-pNA is a suitable substrate for Hint that allowed characterization of the inhibitors; titration of each inhibitor into AMP-pNA assays revealed their Ki values. The N-ethylsulfamoyl derivative has a 13-fold binding advantage over the sulfamoyl adenosine. The 1.8-Å cocrystal structure of rabbit Hint with N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine revealed a binding site for the ethyl group against Trp-123, a residue that reaches across the Hint dimer interface to interact with the alkyl portion of the inhibitor and, presumably, the alkyl portion of a lysyl substrate. Ser-107 is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the leaving group nitrogen. Consistent with a role in acid-base catalysis, the Hint S107A mutant protein displayed depressed catalytic activity.

Histidine triad proteins are a superfamily of enzymes that act as hydrolases and transferases on substrates that contain a nucleoside monophosphate group linked to an amino group, a nucleotide, or a phosphorylated sugar (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar). The first branch of the histidine triad superfamily is the most ancient and contains enzymes related to rabbit Hint (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Hint demonstrated that the protein is a dimer with two identical AMP/GMP-binding sites for each dimer formed by the most highly conserved amino acids in the superfamily (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar). By screening a large number of compounds, the adenosine monophosphoramidates AMP-NH2, AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-acetyl lysine methyl ester), and AMP-N-alanine methyl ester were identified as rabbit Hint and yeast Hnt1 substrates (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Google Scholar). Building on the observation that the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase Cdk7/Kin28 may be functionally linked to Hint/Hnt1 (4Korsisaari N. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34837-34840Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that, in yeast, Hnt1 enzymatic activity acts as a positive regulator of Kin28 function (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Google Scholar). Based on the observation that Hint and Hnt1 hydrolyze AMP linked to lysine (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Google Scholar), we developed the hypothesis that Hint homologs may hydrolyze adenylyl-modified proteins to regulate their functions in vivo (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar). The mouse homolog of rabbit Hint, termed hint1, has been knocked out and found to be encoded by a nonessential gene (5Korsisaari N. Rossi D.J. Luukko K. Huebner K. Henkemeyer M. Makela T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3929-3935Google Scholar) that may protect the forestomach from carcinogenesis induced by N-nitrosomethylbenzamine (6Su T. Suzui M. Wang L. Lin C.S. Xing W.Q. Weinstein I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7824-7829Google Scholar). In birds, Hint-related genes are sex-linked. Male birds are homogametic (ZZ), whereas females are heterogametic (ZW). A typical HINT gene is located on the Z chromosome (7Hori T. Asakawa S. Itoh Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3645-3660Google Scholar), whereas an extremely unusual HINT-related gene, termed ASW was found repeated ∼40 times on the female-specific W chromosome (7Hori T. Asakawa S. Itoh Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3645-3660Google Scholar, 8Sinclair A.H. Berta P. Palmer M.S. Hawkins J.R. Griffiths B.L. Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1990; 346: 240-244Google Scholar). Although every Hint-related sequence examined to date conserved the 15 amino acids surrounding the AMP-binding site more than any other amino acids (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar), these residues were specifically altered in Asw, apparently to eliminate or modify catalytic activity (9Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R18Google Scholar). Molecular modeling indicated that the Asw protein has conserved the amino acids required to heterodimerize with avian Hint and, potentially, to insert across the dimer interface a nonconserved Gln-127 in the vicinity of the Hint active site to depress or alter Hint specificity in a putative Hint-Asw heterodimer (9Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R18Google Scholar). Additional interest in Hint-related hydrolases was generated by the observation that human ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 1, the second most common of the autosomal recessive ataxias, is caused by loss of a gene on 9p13 that encodes Aprataxin, a Hint-related hydrolase with an N-terminal FHA domain and a C-terminal sequence reminiscent of a zinc finger (10Date H.

The physical association of Aprataxin with DNA repair proteins Xrcc1 and Xrcc4 suggests that a repair deficiency may underlie the ataxia-telangiectasia-like neurological symptoms of ataxiaoculomotor apraxia. 1P.

Although Hint genes are found in all organisms, reasonable Hint substrates were only identified (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol.

To study the mechanism and specificity of Hint hydrolases, here we developed adenosine 5′-O-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate (AMP-pNA) 2The abbreviations used are: AMP-pNA, adenosine 5′-O-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate; DBU, 1,8-diazabicyclo-(5.4.0)-undec-7-ene; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESMS, electrospray MS; HRMS, high resolution MS. 2The abbreviations used are: AMP-pNA, adenosine 5′-O-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate; DBU, 1,8-diazabicyclo-(5.4.0)-undec-7-ene; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESMS, electrospray MS; HRMS, high resolution MS. as a novel spectroscopic substrate (see Fig. 1).

Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Google Scholar), we titrated nonlabeled inhibitors into assays of wild-type and mutant Hint enzymes to determine their equilibrium inhibitory binding constants. Biochemical and crystal-lographic analysis of wild-type Hint with newly synthesized adenosine sulfamoyl inhibitors indicated and located a binding site for an alkylamino leaving group. The inhibited Hint crystal structure also provides information about hydrogen bonding that suggests that the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-105 may assist the side chain hydroxyl of Ser-107 as the acid-base catalyst, in contrast to the earlier suggestion of His-114 as the acid-base catalyst (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar). Indeed, biochemical characterization of the S107A mutant indicates that the Ser hydroxyl plays a facilitative role in catalysis, although in its absence, the Gly-105 carbonyl may assist a water molecule bound by the S107A enzyme to provide residual activity for protonation of the leaving group and activation of the hydrolytic water. Synthesis of Substrates—AMP-pNA was prepared in a three-step procedure employing oxathiaphospholane ring opening condensation chemistry (13Guga P. Okruszek A. Stec W.J. Top. Curr. Chem. 2002; 220: 169-200Google Scholar). First, to a solution of p-nitroaniline (0.276 g, 2 mmol) in dry pyridine (10 ml), elemental sulfur (0.128 g, 4 mmol) was added followed by a dropwise addition of 2-chloro-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholane (0.314 g, 2.2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Solvent was then removed in vacuo, and the residue was triturated with 15 ml of acetonitrile. Excess sulfur was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 2.5 ml of chloroform and applied to a silica gel column (2.5 × 18 cm). The column was eluted with methanol in chloroform (0→1%). Appropriate fractions were combined and evaporated to give N-(2-thiono-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholanyl)-p-nitroaniline (0.348 g, 63%), 31P NMR (CD3OD) δ: 91.09 ppm, FAB-MS m/z (M-1) 275. Second, to a solution of N-(2-thiono-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholanyl)-p-nitroaniline (0.276 g, 1 mmol) in dry acetonitrile (10 ml), N6,N6,O2′,O2′-tetrabenzoyladenosine (0.683 g, 1 mmol) was added followed by 1,8-diazabicyclo-(5.4.0)-undec-7-ene (DBU) (0.182 g, 1.2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature at which time solvent was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (50:1, v/v) and chromatographed on a silica gel column. The column was eluted with methanol in chloroform (2→10%). The appropriate fractions were combined and evaporated to give N6,N6,O2′,O2′-tetrabenzoyladenosine-5′-O-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidothioate (0.557 g, 62%), 31P NMR (CD3CN) δ: 49.66 and 49.93 ppm, FAB-MS m/z (M-1) 898. Third, a solution of N6,N6,O2′,O2′-tetrabenzoyladenosine-5′-O-p-nitrophenyl-phosphoramidothioate (0.449 g, 0.5 mmol) in acetonitrile (3 ml) was added a solution of oxone (Dupont Chemicals, 0.41 g, 0.65 mmol) in sodium citrate (pH 6.2, 7 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at room temperature. Aqueous Na2SO3 (1.0 ml) was then added, and a solid precipitate was removed by filtration. The filtrate was extracted with three 2-ml volumes of chloroform, and the solvent was removed from the filtrate. Residual solid was suspended in 10 ml of 20% aqueous ammonia and left for 24 h at room temperature in a tightly closed vial. Ammonia was then evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and water (6:1, v/v) and purified on a Sephadex A-25 column, which was eluted with a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.5) from 0.05 to 0.5 m. The appropriate fractions were combined and evaporated to yield adenosine 5′-O-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate (0.047 g, 20%), 31P NMR (D2O) δ: 0.76 ppm, FAB-MS m/z (M-1) 466. AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-Boc-lysinamide) was obtained in a three-step procedure. First, a reaction of N-α-Boc-lysine methyl ester with one molar equivalent of 2-chloro-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholane in the presence of pyridine and elemental sulfur gave N-ϵ-(2-thiono-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholanyl)-N-α-Boc-lysine methyl ester in 51% yield (31P NMR (CD3OD) δ: 97.04 and 96.99 ppm, FAB-MS m/z (M-1) 397). This compound in reaction with a molar equivalent of N6,N6,O2′,O2′-tetrabenzoyladenosine in acetonitrile solution, in the presence of DBU, provided N6,N6,O2′,O2′-tetrabenzoyladenosine-5′-O-(N-ϵ-(N-α-Boc-lysinamide))-phosphoramidothioate (31P NMR (CD3CN) δ: 59.62 and 59.45 ppm, FAB-MS m/z (M-1)1019), which subsequently under treatment with oxone followed by aqueous ammonia was converted into AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-Boc-lysinamide) (yield 26%, 31P NMR (D2O) δ: 9.94 ppm, FAB-MS m/z (M-1) 573). Synthesis of Inhibitors—5′-O-Sulfamoyladenosine was synthesized by modification of the methods of Shuman et al. (14Shuman D.A. Robins R.K. Robins M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 3391-3392Google Scholar). 2′,3′-O-Isopropylidene-5′-O-sulfamoyladenosine was first purified as follows. A mixture of 2′,3′-O-isopropylidene adenosine (3.00 g, 9.76 mmol) and hexabutyld-istannoxide (11.50 g, 20 mmol) in anhydrous benzene was heated to reflux under argon for 2 h. The resulting clear solution was cooled to 5 °C, and a solution of sulfamoyl chloride (4.50 g, 39 mmol), synthesized as described (15Graf R. Chem. Ber. 1959; 92: 509-555Google Scholar), in dioxane (80 ml) was added dropwise. After stirring at room temperature for 30 min, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was extracted with two 50-ml volumes of hexane. The insoluble residue was treated with a dilute solution of methanolic ammonia (50 ml), evaporated and purified by SiO2 column chromatography using 9 volumes of chloroform to 1 volume of methanol as the mobile phase. The appropriate fractions were evaporated to give pure 2′,3′-O-isopropylidene-5′-O-sulfamoyl adenosine (2.27 g, 60%) as a white foam. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) δ 1.31 (s, 3H, CH3-isopropylidene), 1.50 (s, 3H, CH3-isopropylidene), 4.20 (m, 2H, H-5′,5″), 4.36 (m, 1H, H-4′), 5.05 (dd, 1H, H-3′), 5.45 (dd, 1H, H-2′), 6.20 (d, 1H, H-1′, J1–2 = 2 Hz), 7.35 (br s, 2H, NH2, D2O-exchangeable), 7.60 (br s, 2H, SO2-NH2, D2O exchangeable), 8.15 (s, 1H, H-2), 8.30 (s, 1H, H-8). 2′,3′-O-Isopropylidene-5′-O-sulfamoyl adenosine (386 mg, 0.10 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (90%, 20 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was then evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 15 ml of aqueous methanolic ammonia and evaporated to dryness leaving a white residue crystallized from water yielding pure 5′-O-sulfamoyl adenosine (246 mg, 72%) as white needles. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) δ 4.25 (m, 4H, H-5′,5″, H-4′, and H-3′), 5.51 (m, 1H, H-2′), 5.45 (d, 1H, OH, D2O-exchangeable), 5.65 (d, 1H, OH, D2O-exchangeable) 5.90 (d, 1H, H-1′, J1–2 = 4 Hz), 7.30 (s, 2H, SO2-NH2, D2O-exchangeable), 7.65 (s, 2H, NH2-6, D2O-exchangeable, H 8.15 (s, 1H, H-2), 8.30 (s, 1H, H-8). ESMS (m/z) 347 (M+1, 100%), 338 (10%), 308, 280, 250. 5′-O-Ethylsulfamoyl adenosine was synthesized as follows. Adenosine (3.26 g, 12.2 mmol) was dissolved in dry dimethylformamide (40 ml), heated to 50 °C, and the resulting solution was treated with excess imidazole (1.66 g, 24.4 mmol). Ethylsulfamoyl chloride (1.75 g, 12.2 mmol), purified by modification of the method of Weiss and Schultz (16Weiss G. Schultz G. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1969; 729: 40-51Google Scholar), was added at 0 °C, and the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting oil was dissolved in dichloromethane and methanol (9:1), then solvent-evaporated, and the oily product was decanted from a solid residue, which was twice extracted with dichloromethane. The crude oily product crystallized on standing. The dichloromethane extracts and the solid product were dissolved in methanol, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was taken up in dichloromethane and methanol (9:1) for silica chromatography, eluting with a gradient of methanol (10–20%) in dichloromethane. Appropriate fractions were identified by TLC, pooled, and evaporated to give 5′-O-ethylsulfamoyladenosine as a white solid, further purified by reverse phase HPLC. 1H NMR (Me2SO) δ 0.95 (t, 3H, Me), 2.85 (q, 2H, CH2), 4.10–4.25 (m, 4H, H-3′,4′,5′,5″), 4.65 (dd, 1H, H-2′), 5.45 (d, 1H, OH, D2O-exchangeable), 5.65 (d, 1H, OH, D2O-exchangeable), 5.90 (d, 1H, H-1′, J1–2 = 4 Hz), 7.30 (bs, 2H, NH2-6, D2O-exchangeable), 7.85 (bs, 1H, SO2NH, D2O-exchangeable), 8.15 (s, 1H, H-2), 8.35 (s, 1H, H-8). HRMS (FAB) found 375.1072, calculated for C12H19N6O6S 375.1087. Substrates and inhibitors are shown in Fig. 1. Mutagenesis and Enzymology—Wild-type rabbit Hint was expressed and purified in bacteria using pSGA02-HINT as described (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Google Scholar). The S107A mutant of rabbit Hint was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type expression vector using primer 7129 (5′-ATGAACGTGATAGACGGCCTGTCCACCATCGGA) to generate plasmid pB415, which was used to produce homogeneous mutant Hint enzyme as above. AMP-pNA substrate at concentration of 1 mm was incubated with homogeneous rabbit Hint enzymes in reactions at 30 °C containing 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Reaction samples were spotted on silica TLC plates (Merck). Plates were developed in 2-propanol:NH4OH:1,4-dioxane:H2O (50:35:8:7). Developed plates were imaged by epi-UV illumination on a Bio-Rad Fluor S instrument. Initial rate assays for AMP-pNA were performed in spectrophotometric cuvettes. Premixes containing AMP-pNA (50, 100, 300, 400, or 700 μm), 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 were equilibrated at 30 °C and then reactions were initiated with addition of 97.5–239.3 pmol of rabbit Hint. To determine kinetic parameters for AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-Boclysinamide), initial rate reactions were completed in the same buffer at 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 μm concentration of substrate, and the products were analyzed by HPLC on a HQ column (Applied Biosystems) with NH4HCO3, pH 8, as the mobile phase. The pH dependence of kcat/Km was determined at six pH values (5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, and 7.25) with four or five concentrations of AMP-pNA (from 12 to 400 μm) for the wild-type and mutant enzyme. These reactions were performed in 66 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffers with 0.5 mm MgCl2 using 964 pmol of wild-type Hint, or 1776 pmol of S107A mutant Hint. Ki values for sulfamoyl and N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine were obtained by titrating the inhibitors (0, 5, 10, 40, 60, and 100 μm) into complete digests of 100 μm AMP-pNA. Using a known amount of enzyme (96 pmol), first order decay curves for remaining substrate were used to calculate kcat/Km and the inhibitor concentration dependence of reduction of kcat/Km (apparent) was calculated as described (12Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Google Scholar). X-ray Crystallography—Rabbit Hint crystals were grown as described (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar). Crystals were soaked in a well solution saturated with either sulfamoyl or N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine for 2 h. Cryoprotectant solutions were prepared from the well solution containing 13% glycerol and saturated with the inhibitor. Crystals were scooped from the soak solution and briefly submerged in cryoprotectant solution just prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Hint-sulfamoyl adenosine data were collected in the cryostream at -180 °C at the X-25 beamline of the National Sychrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Hint-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine data were collected on the Kimmel Cancer Center home source. We employed CNS (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.-S.

To test whether Hint would tolerate pNA as a leaving group, we incubated Hint with AMP-pNA and analyzed the progress of the reaction by TLC and HPLC. Both assays made it clear that Hint cleaves this molecule generating one equivalent of AMP and pNA (data not shown). Release of the chromophore allowed the new substrate to be followed spectroscopically at 410 nm. To compare AMP-pNA with a more biologically authentic substrate, AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-Boc-lysinamide) was prepared and assayed by HPLC. As shown in Table I, consistent with rabbit Hint as an AMP-lysine hydrolase, the enzyme liberated AMP from AMP-N-ϵ-(N-Boc-lysinamide) with a kcat of 0.23 s-1 and a Km of 470 nm. In contrast, the convenience of the continuously and spectroscopically monitored substrate came at the cost of a 280-fold higher Km and about 100-fold lower kcat presumably because the enzyme tolerates the bulky leaving group very poorly. As the hydrolytic step for both of these substrates is expected to proceed identically through adenylylated His-112 (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar), the pNA leaving group is expected to inhibit adenylylation, i.e. the productive covalent attack of the α-phosphate by His-112.Table ISteady state characterization of Hint substrates and inhibitorsCompoundkcatKmKcat/KmKis-1μmm-1 s-1μmAMP-pNA0.00187 ± 0.00006134. ± 1114.0AMP-N-ϵ-(N-Boc-Lys-NH2)0.234 ± 0.0110.472 ± 0.057496,000Ado-SO2-NH216.1 ± 0.2Ado-SO2-NH-C2H21.26 ± 0.28 Open table in a new tab Despite the relatively poor kinetic values, the AMP-pNA substrate is reasonably suited for assays of competitive inhibitors and determination of their Ki values with methods we established for GpppBODIPY and Fhit (12Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Google Scholar). We synthesized new Hint inhibitors consisting of adenosine and 5′-sulfamoyl or N-ethylsulfamoyl groups (Fig. 1). Both were titrated into AMP-pNA assays and competitive Ki values were obtained by calculating the inhibitor concentration-dependence in reduction of kcat/Km (apparent) for substrate hydrolysis (12Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the sulfamoyl adenosine inhibited Hint with a Ki value of 16.1 μm, whereas addition of the ethyl group to sulfamoyl adenosine resulted in an inhibitor with a Ki value of 1.25 μm. The 13-fold advantage in equilibrium binding conferred by an addition of the ethyl group suggests a favorable interaction with an alkylamine leaving group such as a lysine or protein-lysine. Crystallographic Identification of the Alkylamine-binding Site in rabbit Hint—Previously, the most informative crystal structures of Hint have been bound to GMP, 8-Br-AMP (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar), and adenosine tungstate (19Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Google Scholar). The GMP and 8-Br-AMP crystal structures can be considered product complexes that represent the form of the enzyme bound to a nucleoside monophosphate following hydrolysis of a putative nucleoside monophosphoramidate substrate, whereas the adenosine tungstate structure can be considered to be an analog of the transition state. An additional crystal structure of human Hint bound to adenosine α,β-methylenediphosphonate was described as an analog of a substrate complex (19Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Google Scholar), but as ADP is an extremely poor substrate of Hint (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Google Scholar), it is not clear that this complex can serve as a model of a good enzyme-substrate complex. To examine active site geometry with amine-containing nucleotides, we soaked rabbit Hint crystals (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar) with the two inhibitors synthesized in this study. Both soaks resulted in crystals that diffracted to 2.0 Å or higher resolution. When the difference electron density of the sulfamoyl adenosine-soaked crystal was examined, we could easily identify the adenosine density and place the sulfur atom in the position of the 5′-phosphorus but we could not interpret which two of the sulfur ligands were oxygen and which one was the amino group (not shown). In contrast, the ethyl group of N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine allowed unequivocal assignment of every nonhydrogen atom at 1.8 Å resolution. Because this inhibitor was shown to possess a 13-fold binding advantage over the sulfamoyl adenosine, we suggest that the alkyl portion of this inhibitor is bound in a substrate-analogous fashion. Data collection and refinement statistics for this crystal structure are provided in Table II. Representative electron density and the overall structure of the Hint dimer bound to N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine are shown in Fig. 2. Difference electron density for the inhibitor is shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Active-site geometry of Hint. Stereo view depicting the refined N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine inhibitor inside 1.5 σ Fo - Fc difference electron density calculated from protein and water coordinates alone. As in Fig. 2, the Hint monomer binding the inhibitor is in green and Trp-123 from the other monomer is in purple. Atomic distances (Å) are shown for the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-105 and the γ-oxygen of Ser-107 to the nitrogen of N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine, the hydrogen bond network connecting His-51, His-114, and the 5′-oxygen of the inhibitor, and for the two interactions of the adenylylating His-112.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As observed earlier in crystal structures of rabbit Hint bound to GMP and 8-Br-AMP (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar), the most highly conserved amino acids in Hint homologs and, indeed among all histidine triad enzymes, surround the purine base, the ribose, and the 5′-phosphate groups. Recently, we observed that an additional amino acid is highly conserved in Hint hydrolases. The amino acid was missed in our initial analysis because one monomer is not in contact with the nucleotide bound in that monomer but rather makes a close approach to the nucleotide across the dimer interface (9Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R18Google Scholar). This amino acid is one of a remarkable 15 residues that are sexually dimorphic in avian Hint-related genes; it is Trp-123 in the typical Hint polypeptide encoded on the Z chromosome, and it is Gln on the unusual and potentially inhibitory Asw polypeptide that is encoded in a tandem array of ∼40 repeats on the female-specific W chromosome (9Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R18Google Scholar). The present biochemical studies establish a binding site for the alkyl portion of the alkylamine leaving group of Hint substrates. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, that site is located across the Hint dimer interface against Trp-123. Evidence That Ser-107 Is the Acid-Base Catalyst for Hint— Earlier we argued that for Hint hydrolases, whose phosphoramidate substrates necessarily have an amine leaving group, protonation of the phosphoramidate nitrogen may be an important kinetic component of the adenylylation step in catalysis (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Hint bound to N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine allowed us to analyze how conserved features of Hint hydrolases interact with an analog of the 5′-phosphoramidate nitrogen, equatorial oxygens, and the alkylamine leaving group. Although we considered His-114 to be the candidate hydrogen bond donor (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar) extrapolating from product complexes (2Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Google Scholar), this structure suggests that the Ser-107 hydroxyl is positioned for proton donation with alignment that is assisted by the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-105. In the present structure the ϵ-nitrogen of His-114 is 3.1 Å from the ribose 5′-oxygen and 3.3 Å from one of the equatorial oxygen atoms of α-sulfur and not in hydrogen-bonding distance or orientation with the sulfamoyl nitrogen. In contrast, the sulfamoyl nitrogen is 2.7 Å from the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-105 and 3.2 Å from the Ser-107 γ-oxygen. Thus, we propose that Ser-107 donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphoramidate nitrogen of a Hint substrate. To test the hypothesis that Ser-107 plays a role in catalysis, we performed a site-directed alteration of this residue to Ala. Rabbit Hint-S107A was expressed and purified in Escherichia coli and characterized with respect to AMP-pNA hydrolysis. The pH-dependence of kcat/Km was determined at six pH values for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. When, as shown in Fig. 4, the specificity constant, kcat/Km was plotted as a function of pH, we were able to model Hint enzymatic activity on AMP-pNA as being controlled by a single titratable group with a pKa of 6.0 ± 0.1 and maximal activity in the protonated form. The S107A mutant, in the same assays, exhibited ∼3-fold reduced activity at all pH values with little alteration (a 0.4 unit drop) in pKa. Given the position of the Ser-107 hydroxyl, the reduced activity of this mutant was expected, although one might have expected the magnitude of the defect to be greater than 3-fold. To test whether a larger catalytic defect of the S107A mutant was masked by the AMP-pNA substrate, we determined kcat and Km for AMP-N-ϵ-(N-Boc-lysinamide). Although the Km of the mutant was unaffected, the kcat was depressed by 4-fold. In the absence of the Ser-107 hydroxyl, Hint clearly has the ability to adenylylate and hydrolyze substrates at a reduced rate. We hypothesize that the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-105 assists the function of Ser-107 as the acid-base catalyst for Hint. In the absence of Ser-107, we propose that a water molecule bound to the S107A enzyme functions as the acid-base catalyst and that the cost of loss of the protein-positioned hydroxyl group is the observed 3–4-fold-reduced activity of the mutant enzyme. In GalT, a member of the distinctive branch three-histidine triad nucleoside monophosphate transferases (1Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Google Scholar), the corresponding Ser-161 also functions on the leaving group side (20Geeganage S. Ling V.W. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5397-5404Google Scholar). However, rather than donating a hydrogen bond to the α-β-bridging oxygen in a UDP-hexose substrate, which would be analogous to donating a hydrogen bond to the phosphoramidate nitrogen in a Hint substrate, Ser-161 donates to a β-phosphate equatorial oxygen (20Geeganage S. Ling V.W. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5397-5404Google Scholar). Conclusions—We have used organic synthesis, enzymology, x-ray crystallography, and mutagenesis to develop novel substrates and inhibitors of the Hint adenosine monophosphoramidate hydrolase. Consistent with our view that adenylylated lysine residues are natural substrates, this work establishes that Hint kinetics are superior with an alkylamine substrate such as AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-Boc-lysinamide) versus AMP-pNA and that the ethyl group of an ethylsulfamoyl adenosine inhibitor confers a 13-fold binding advantage over the nonderivatized sulfamoyl adenosine. The crystal structure of the N-ethylsulfamoyl adenosine inhibitor identified the location of the alkylamine-binding site against conserved residue Trp-123, which interacts with the inhibitor across the dimer interface and also identified Ser-107 as the candidate acid-base catalyst for the enzyme. pH titration of wild-type and mutant enzymes establishes that Hint functions with a protonated titratable group and that Ser-107 may donate and receive back a proton in a manner that can be substituted by bound water in adenosine monophosphoramidate hydrolysis. Our proposed catalytic mechanism for Hint hydrolases is provided in Fig. 5."

Upon insulin stimulation GLUT4 vesicles translocate to, and fuse with, the plasma membrane. To determine the effect of GLUT4 content on the distribution and subcellular trafficking of GLUT4 and other vesicle proteins, adipocytes of adipose-specific, GLUT4-deficient (aP2-GLUT4-/-) mice and adipose-specific, GLUT4-overexpressing (aP2-GLUT4-Tg) mice were studied.

Insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) protein amount was decreased 35% in aP2-GLUT4-/- adipocytes and increased 45% in aP2-GLUT4-Tg adipocytes.

The binding of insulin to its receptor initiates a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation events that promote translocation, docking, and fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, promoting glucose uptake by the cell (7White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process plays a key role in normal physiology, and dysregulation of GLUT4 expression or trafficking is a major pathogenic factor in the insulin resistance seen in obesity and type 2 diabetes (8Shepherd P.R. Kahn B.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 9Shepherd P.R. Abel E.D. Kahn B.B. LeRoith D.R. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S.I. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia2000: 627-641Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that, in addition to trafficking through the endosomal recycling pathway, GLUT4 vesicles consist of a unique intracellular storage compartment, separate from this pathway (10Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Bryant N. Govers R. James D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary rat adipocytes, GLUT4 is targeted to intracellular vesicles that are distinct from those containing GLUT1 (12Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of GLUT4 in neuroendocrine PC12 cells shows that GLUT4 is targeted to neither synaptic vesicles nor secretory granules, suggesting that GLUT4 forms a distinct class of storage vesicles (13Hudson A.

In addition, diaminobenzidine treatment of adipocytes specifically ablates transferrin receptor (TfR) 1The abbreviations used are: TfR, transferrin receptor; IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; LDM, low density microsomal membranes; PM, plasma membranes; β-COP, β-coatomer protein; WT, wild type. and cellubrevin-containing endosomes, without eliminating a large portion of GLUT4-containing endosomes (15Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J. Gould G. James D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) was the first protein identified that co-localizes with GLUT4 specifically in its unique intracellular compartment (16Kandror K. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Like GLUT4, IRAP is expressed in adipocytes and skeletal muscle (17Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and in other tissues. IRAP translocates with GLUT4 to the cell surface in response to insulin (16Kandror K. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of IRAP and its relationship to GLUT4 are unknown, although a recent study shows that IRAP-null mice have decreased GLUT4 expression in muscle and adipocytes (18Keller S.R. Davis A.C. Clairmont K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17677-17686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Incorporation of vesicles into target membranes is mediated by a high affinity interaction between a ligand on the vesicle SNARE and receptors on the target membrane (target SNARE) which mediate docking and fusion (11Bryant N. Govers R. James D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 19Holman G.D. Sandoval I.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two vesicle SNAREs, VAMP2 (vesicle associated membrane protein 2) and VAMP3 (cellubrevin), are expressed in adipocytes (20Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike VAMP3, a large portion of adipocyte VAMP2 is targeted to the GLUT4 vesicle, suggesting a role for VAMP2 in the mediating GLUT4 trafficking (15Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J. Gould G. James D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Adipocytes express two different target SNAREs, syntaxin4 (21Volchuk A. Wang Q. Ewart H.S. Liu Z. He L.

Tamori Y. Okazawa H. Araki S. Shinoda H. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interaction between syntaxin4 and Munc-18c, which inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by blocking binding of syntaxin4 and VAMP2, may also be required for proper incorporation of the GLUT4 vesicle into the plasma membrane (26Thurmond D.C. Kanzaki M. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of VAMP2, SNAP23, syntaxin4, and Munc-18c in GLUT4-vesicle trafficking in normal adipocytes has been established (11Bryant N. Govers R. James D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 19Holman G.D. Sandoval I.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), many questions remain regarding the nature and regulation of GLUT4 vesicle number, size, protein content, and trafficking. Adipocytes from transgenic mice in which GLUT4 has been markedly reduced or overexpressed provide unique tools to learn more about the regulation of GLUT4 vesicles. We hypothesized that altering adipocyte GLUT4 content may alter the protein composition, number, and/or sequestration of GLUT4-containing vesicles but not affect plasma membrane proteins mediating GLUT4 trafficking or other proteins trafficking through endosomes in response to insulin. We showed previously (27Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10490-10494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in adipocytes from GLUT4-overexpressing mice that the polypeptide composition of immunoabsorbed GLUT4 vesicles was similar to control except for increased GLUT4 and a modest increase in aminopeptidase activity (presumably IRAP). We hypothesized that there were either more GLUT4 per vesicle or more vesicles with GLUT4. However, we did not assess the distribution of GLUT4 or other vesicle proteins between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes nor the effect of GLUT4 deficiency on vesicle characteristics. Here we employ complementary techniques to determine whether adipocyte GLUT4 content changes the characteristics of GLUT4 vesicles, using adipocytes of adipose-specific, GLUT4-deficient (aP2-GLUT4-/-) mice (28Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) or adipose-specific, GLUT4-overexpressing (aP2-GLUT4-Tg) mice (29Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Tozzo E. Yang H. Leach F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22243-22246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that overexpression or deficiency of GLUT4 in adipocytes causes a corresponding change in IRAP and VAMP2 protein levels. IRAP and VAMP2 mRNA levels are unaltered by GLUT4 overexpression, suggesting that increased GLUT4 may alter the turnover of these proteins. Levels of plasma membrane proteins syntaxin4, SNAP23, and Munc-18c, which mediate GLUT4-vesicle docking and fusion with plasma membranes, are unchanged. Levels of GLUT1, which traffics to the plasma membrane primarily from a different intracellular compartment than GLUT4, are unchanged. Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of TfR, an early endosomal protein, is altered by high level GLUT4 overexpression, whereas the distribution of GLUT1 is not affected. Immunogold EM analysis shows that overexpression of GLUT4 increases the amount of GLUT4 per vesicle as well as the number of GLUT4- and IRAP-containing vesicles per cell. In addition, GLUT4 overexpression results in an increased proportion of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane in the absence of insulin, supporting the notion that GLUT4 sequestration is saturable. This could occur at the level of retention, endocytosis, and/or recycling of GLUT4 from the plasma membrane to intracellular stores. Our results also indicate that GLUT4 is a major determinant of GLUT4 vesicle net biogenesis and sequestration in vivo. Mice—Adipose-specific GLUT4-/- mice (28Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B.

Mice were genotyped as described previously (28Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B.

All studies were carried out in mice 12-16 weeks of age in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Similar results were observed in adipocytes from male and female mice. Isolation of Adipocytes and Determination of Glucose Transport and Cell Size and Number—Perigonadal fat pads (1-2 g) from fed male or female mice sacrificed by CO2 inhalation (∼10 per genotype for each experiment) were weighed, finely minced in Krebs buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 2.5% bovine serum albumin (Internee, New York), and 200 nm adenosine, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, and digested for 30-40 min at 37 °C with constant shaking by addition of collagenase (1 mg/ml, Worthington). Following digestion, cells were passed through a 200-μm mesh (Tekko, Kansas City, MO) and washed four times with buffer, and 20% suspensions of cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm regular porcine insulin (Lilly) for 30 min with constant shaking at 37 °C (29Shepherd P.R.

To determine cell size, adipocyte mass was determined in quadruplicate by dividing the lipid content of the cell suspension by the cell number (31Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Total Membranes from Adipose Tissue and Isolated Adipocytes—Adipose tissue (from either perigonadal or subcutaneous fat depots) or isolated adipocytes were homogenized with a Polytron (“Tissue Tearer” homogenizer; Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) in 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose with 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was centrifuged at 223,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended to a concentration of ∼2 μg/μl in homogenization buffer, and total membrane proteins were stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Subcellular Membrane Fractions from Isolated Adipocytes—Isolated adipocytes (20% cell suspensions), after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in the absence or the presence of 80 nm insulin, were washed twice with TES buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, pH 7.4 at 20 °C) at 15-18 °C and homogenized in TES at 4 °C using 15 strokes of a Potter drill per sample. Aliquots of homogenates were collected and stored at -80 °C. Remaining homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at -4 °C, and surface solidified fat was removed. High density microsomal membranes and low density microsomal membranes (LDM) were isolated from supernatants, and plasma membranes (PM) were isolated from the pellets. Pellets containing PM were resuspended in TES, using 10 strokes of a Potter drill, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g 4 °C for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in TES, layered on a 1.12 m sucrose cushion in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Plasma membranes at the interface between the sucrose cushion and buffer were collected, resuspended in TES, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Plasma membrane pellets were resuspended to ∼2 μg/μl in TES. For preparation of microsomal membrane fractions, supernatants were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 50,000 × g. LDM was isolated from supernatants, and high density microsomal membranes were isolated from pellets. Pellets were resuspended in TES and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 50,000 × g and resuspended at ∼1 μg/μl. Supernatants containing LDM were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min 4 °C; LDM pellets were resuspended at ∼2 μg/μl. All membranes were kept at -80 °C until use. Purity, Enrichment, and Recovery of Subcellular Fractions—Purity of PM fractions was determined by immunoblotting for Ras, which is located exclusively in PM (32Matsuoka I. Dolly J.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1026: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Purity of LDM fractions was determined by immunoblotting for β-coatomer protein (β-COP), a marker for LDM (33Mastick C.C. Falick A.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross-contamination of fractions was negligible by immunoblotting. Immunoblots were quantitated by densitometry (Amersham Biosciences). PM enrichment was calculated as (OD of Ras in the PM/μg of PM protein)/(OD of Ras in the homogenate/μg of homogenate protein); similarly, LDM enrichment was calculated as (OD of β-COP in the LDM/μg of LDM protein)/(OD of β-COP in the homogenate/μg of homogenate protein). PM enrichment with Ras averaged 9-fold greater than in homogenates. LDM enrichment with β-COP averaged 20-fold greater than in homogenates. Protein recoveries for all membrane fractions were similar between aP2-GLUT-/-, aP2-GLUT4-Tg, and control adipocytes. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated in 10 or 14% SDS-PAGE (NOVEX gels, Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose.

Quantitative Real-time PCR—IRAP and VAMP2 mRNA from isolated adipocytes of control and aP2-GLUT4-Tg mice were quantified by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA was extracted from isolated adipocytes using Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA concentrations were quantified in triplicate, and reverse transcriptase-PCRs for IRAP and 18 S RNA or VAMP2 and 18 S RNA were done in duplicate using 100 ng of total RNA for each sample.

Total RNAs were reverse-transcribed and amplified using the Taqman One-step PCR Master Mix Reagent (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out at 48 °C for 30 min and terminated at 95 °C for 10 min. Reactions were amplified for 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Photolabeling of Glucose Transporters—Photolabeling was carried as described (36Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes from 5 g of perigonadal fat of control and aP2-GLUT4-Tg mice were isolated, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or the presence of 80 nm insulin, washed with bovine serum albumin-free KRBH buffer, and UV-irradiated 3 times for 1 min in the presence of 500 μCi of ATB-BMPA. After insulin incubation, 1 aliquot was separated for glucose transport measurements in the same cells. The cells were separated from unincorporated label by centrifugation through dinonyl phthalate oil and solubilized for 30 min in room temperature in 2% Thesit plus protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, α2 macroglobulin and pepstatin). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C, and GLUT4 was immunoprecipitated from supernatants with anti-GLUT4 antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:4), washed twice with 0.2% Thesit plus inhibitors and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and GLUT4 was eluted with 2.3 m urea, 1.5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue, pH 6.8. The eluate was separated from GLUT4 antibody-protein A-Sepharose beads by filtration through 0.45-μm filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Eluate proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% Tris-glycine gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Each lane of protein was cut into 25 slices perpendicular to the direction of migration; slices were baked in glass vials for a minimum of 3 h at 80 °C, cooled to room temperature, solubilized in H2O2/NH3OH (98:2), baked for 3 h at 80 °C, cooled to room temperature, and counted in scintillation fluid. Results are expressed as counts/min per gel slice and corrected for the number of cells in each genotype. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Intracellular membrane vesicles were prepared from isolated adipocytes from control and aP2-GLUT4-Tg mice. Adipocytes were homogenized in HES buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4), and homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 13,000 × g to remove cellular debris, plasma membranes, mitochondria, and nuclei. Supernatants were layered over a 1.5 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 111,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Intracellular membranes were harvested at the interface and were fixed with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. Vesicles were adsorbed to Formvar-coated copper grids that were incubated sequentially with primary antibody (GLUT4 1:400, or VAMP2 10 μg/ml, or IRAP 1:500) followed by protein A gold. For double labeling, the first label was stabilized on 1% glutaraldehyde. Vesicles were stained with a mixture of uranyl acetate and methylcellulose. Effect of GLUT4 Amount on Fat Pad Weight, Adipocyte Size, and Glucose Transport in Adipocytes—Adipose-specific GLUT4-overexpressing (aP2-GLUT4-Tg) mice have increased perigonadal fat pad weight (Table I) due to adipocyte hyperplasia (29Shepherd P.R.

The mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Mpr) 300 on target cells has been reported to function as receptor for secreted granzyme B. Using lymphoblasts and mouse embryonal fibroblast lines from Mpr300 and Mpr46 knockout mice, we show here that both receptors are not essential for CTL-induced apoptosis. Similarly, cells exposed to either monomeric granzyme B or granzyme B-serglycin complexes readily internalize the granzyme and undergo apoptosis in the absence of Mpr300 and Mpr46. Further, no colocalization of granzyme B and Mpr300 could be observed in target cells after internalization. In conclusion, these results strongly argue against an Mpr300- or Mpr46-dependent pathway of granzyme-mediated killing and provide new insight in the internalization of monomeric and complexed granzyme B.

Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), and the granule-exocytosis pathway that leads to the secretion of preformed toxins stored in specialized secretory lysosomes of cytotoxic lymphocytes (2Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Liebermann J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 4Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Essential components of cytotoxic granules are granzyme B (GrB) and perforin (PFN). PFN-formed pores in the plasma membrane have long been considered as the entry sites for granzymes into the cytoplasm of target cells (5Young J.D.-E. Hengartner H. Podack E.R. Cohn Z.A. Cell. 1986; 44: 849-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast to this model, GrB has been shown to bind to target cells in a specific, saturable manner in the absence of PFN and to remain in endocytotic vesicles after internalization without exerting a cytotoxic activity (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is assumed that GrB is internalized by a specific receptor, and a sublytic PFN concentration is then required for its release from the endocytic compartment into the cytosol of target cells (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is strongly supported by the finding that endosomolytic agents other than PFN, such as non-replicating adenovirus (AD) and the bacterial toxins listeriolysin O and streptolysin O are able to substitute for PFN in GrB-mediated apoptosis (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8604-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that granzyme molecules in the cytotoxic granules are non-covalently bound to the ∼250 kDa proteoglycan serglycin (SG), and are secreted in this macromolecular form and delivered by PFN to target cells through a process that does not require the formation of plasma membrane pores (8Metkar S.S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The finding that granzymes are secreted as macromolecular complexes with SG rather than as isolated molecules has important implications for the understanding of granule-mediated apoptosis, because GrB cell surface binding, internalization, intracellular trafficking, as well as targeting and processing of putative substrates have to be reconsidered (8Metkar S.S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Mpr) 300 has been reported to be the cell surface receptor for GrB and to be essential for CTL-mediated apoptosis of target cells and the rejection of allogeneic cells in vivo (10Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A. Hobman M. Barry M. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Holmes C.F. Gauldie J. Bleackley R.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Mpr300, besides the Mpr of 46 kDa, is known to be essential for the delivery of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes. Mpr300 also binds and endocytoses insulin-like growth factor II (Igf2) (11Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Interestingly in this context, the same receptor is involved in sorting newly synthesized GrB molecules to the cytotoxic granules of lymphocytes (12Griffiths G.M. Isaaz S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the role of Mpr300 in GrB-mediated killing is controversial, because an additional, but Mpr300-independent pathway for GrB-induced cell death, has been described (13Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Thia K.Y. Li Y.Q. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Sandrin M.S. Browne K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The results presented here clearly establish that apoptosis induced by CTL and mediated by the granule-exocytosis killing pathway is not dependent on Mpr300 or Mpr46 expression in target cells. This conclusion is based on the analysis of genetically defined target cells that are derived from Mpr300 and, in addition, Mpr46 knockout mice in lieu of previously used (10Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A. Hobman M. Barry M. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Holmes C.F. Gauldie J. Bleackley R.C.

Furthermore, internalization of monomeric as well as complexed GrB and their capacity to induce apoptosis remain unimpeded in Mpr300- and Mpr46-deficient targets. Reagents—All chemicals, unless specified, were purchased from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany) or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Human GrB and PFN were prepared from cultures of YT cells as previously described (14Hanna W.L. Zhang X. Turbov J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Froelich C.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Froelich C.J. Turbov J. Hanna W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cavitation of YT cells, cytotoxic granules were enriched by differential centrifugation and solubilized in buffers suitable for isolation of GrB and PFN, respectively, by cation exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The isolated GrB is fully glycosylated and phosphorylated as determined by the reduction in Mr from 32 to 27 following exposure to endoglycosidase H. For the labeled granzyme preparations used in this study, ∼70% of the protease retain functionality as determined by cleavage of the IETD-pNA substrate. Human SG was purified as described previously (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B. Spiegel K. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GrBAlexa 488 was fabricated as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and either used in monomeric form or complexed to SG (GrBAlexa 488-SG) (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M.

Mice—Mice were bred in the central animal facility of the Medical Faculty, University of Göttingen. Animal experiments were approved by local authorities. As a source for Mpr300-deficient lymphoblasts, we used Mpr300-/-/Igf2-/-/Mpr46+/- mice that carried a mixed C57BL/6 (H2b) × 129/Sv (H2bc) background (17Dittmer F. Hafner A. Ulbrich E.J. Moritz J.D. Schmidt P. Schmahl W. Pohlmann R. von Figura K. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lethal effect of Mpr300 deficiency in these mice is avoided by an additional knockout of Igf2. Mice that are triple deficient for Mpr300, Mpr46, and Igf2 (obtained by intercrossing Mpr300-/-/Igf2-/-/Mpr46+/- mice, Ref. 17Dittmer F. Hafner A. Ulbrich E.J. Moritz J.D. Schmidt P. Schmahl W.

OT-I mice, transgenic for a Vα2Vβ5 T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the H2-Kb-restricted ovalbumin-derived peptide SIINFEKL (18Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Heath W.R. Howard J.L. Bevan M.J. Carbone F.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar) served as donors for peptide-specific CTL. The OT-I mice used carry a mixed C57BL/6 × 129/Sv background. C3H/HeN (H2k), BALB/c (H2d), and FVB/N (H2q) mice were used to raise alloreactive CTL from spleen cells. From C57BL/6, 129/Sv, and (129/Sv × C57BL/6)F1 mouse lymphocytes were obtained to serve as target cells after stimulation with concanavalin A (Con A). Cells, Cell Culture, and Generation of CTL—The mouse embryonal fibroblast (MEF) lines (Table I) derived from Mpr knockout or control mice have been described earlier (19Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Their genetic background is of mixed C57BL/6 and 129/Sv origin. RMA cells (H2b) served as highly CTL susceptible controls. All cell lines were maintained in NaHCO3-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in Petri dishes for tissue culture (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Lymphocytes were obtained from spleens using a Tenbroeck homogenizer. Lymphoblasts to be used as target cells in cytotoxicity experiments were generated from spleen cells by 4 days of mitogenic stimulation with 5 μg/ml Con A and were then separated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Biochrom). To generate alloreactive CTL, mice of the inbred strains C3H/HeN (H2k), BALB/c (H2d), and FVB/N (H2q) were injected intraperitoneally with 30 × 106 spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice (H2b). Ten days after immunization spleen cells were restimulated in round-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) with C57BL/6 spleen cells. For this purpose 0.75 × 106 responder cells were cocultured with 0.75 × 106-irradiated (30 Gray) stimulator cells in 200 μl of NaHCO3-buffered DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS, 10-5 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μl of supernatant from Con A-stimulated lymphocytes. After 4 days of mixed lymphocyte culture, vital mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque and used as alloreactive CTL for cytotoxicity assays. To obtain peptide-specific CTL, spleen cells from naive OT-I mice were stimulated in vitro with irradiated C57BL/6 spleen cells in the presence of 1 nm SIINFEKL (Ovalbumin 257–264; Bachem Biochemica, Heidelberg, Germany) under conditions described above for alloreactive CTL.Table IMpr status of the MEF lines The MEF lines have been described previously (19Pohlmann R.

Effector cells were added to 104 51Cr-labeled target cells in triplicate at ratios of 100:1 to 1.5:1 for alloreactive CTL and 10:1 to 0.6:1 for OT-I-derived peptide-specific CTL in 200 μl of HEPES-buffered DMEM, 10% FCS per well of round-bottomed microtiter plates. Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of target cells in the absence of CTL. When OT-I effector cells were used, 0.5 μg/ml SIINFEKL peptide was added. To determine the calcium dependence of killing, 2 mm EGTA and 4 mm MgCl2 were added (21Dressel R. Lübbers M. Walter L. Herr W. Günther E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The microtiter plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 40 × g and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h before being centrifuged again, and supernatant and sediment were separately taken to determine radioactivity in each well using a Wallac MicroBeta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Köln, Germany). Percentage of specific lysis was calculated by subtracting percent spontaneous 51Cr release. [3H]Thymidine Release Assay—Target cells were labeled by adding 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) for 20 h to cell cultures in the logarithmic growth phase. Afterward, the cells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered DMEM, and effector cells were added to target cells in a final volume of 100 μl of medium as described above for 51Cr release assays. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (at a final concentration of 40 μm) and the caspase-3-specific inhibitor Ac-AAVALLPAVLLALLAPDEVD-CHO (at a final concentration of 20 μm) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany) and were added to certain tests in order to determine caspase dependence of apoptosis.

Briefly, the cells were lysed with an equal volume (100 μl) of 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Tris HCl, 50 mm EDTA, transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, vortexed, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g to pellet intact nuclei. For analysis of total DNA labeling, the respective samples (designated as “totals”) were lysed with an equal volume of 2% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH and vigorously vortexed. Afterward 50 μl of supernatant or 50 μl of the total were removed to scintillation plates, mixed with 200 μl of scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and counted on a Wallac MicroBeta Trilux counter. The specific 3H release was calculated as described (10Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A. Hobman M. Barry M. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Holmes C.F. Gauldie J. Bleackley R.C.

Chromogenic GrB Assay—To determine GrB release from CTL 105 target cells were incubated in HEPES-buffered phenol red-free DMEM with OT-I-derived CTL as described above for 51Cr release assays in triplicate at ratios of 1:1, 0.5:1, and 0:1. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was harvested. The GrB activity in these samples was determined as described (23Ewen C. Kane K.P. Shostak I. Griebel P.J. Bertram E.M. Watts T.H. Bleackley R.C. McElhaney J.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 276: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by hydrolysis of the paranitroanilide substrate Ac-IEPD-pNA (Alexis Biochemicals). Briefly, 50 μl of supernatant were incubated at 37 °C with 200 μm substrate in a final volume of 100 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. Released chromogenic paranitroanilide was measured as absorbance at 405 nm on a MR580 Microelisa Auto Reader (Dynatech, Denkendorf, Germany) after 4 h. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). For determining cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on MEF lines or lymphoblasts anti-H2-Kb (clone CTKb, mouse IgG2a, PE-labeled), anti-H2-Db (clone CTDb, mouse IgG2a, PE-labeled) and, as isotype control, mouse IgG2a (PE-labeled, code MG2a04) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Caltag Laboratories, Hamburg, Germany) were used. To assess the effect of exogenous SIINFEKL peptide on H2-Kb cell surface density, cells were incubated for 4 h (the duration of a 51Cr or 3H release assay) at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered DMEM, 10% FCS with 0.5 μg/ml peptide. Then 5 × 105 cells were washed twice in 5-ml polystyrene tubes (BD Biosciences) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Biochrom) before resuspension in 100 μl of PBS containing 1 μg of the respective mAb. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in transfected cells (see below) was determined directly after washing the cells twice with PBS. Cell death was determined by staining with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) in PBS at 4 °C for 15 min before flow cytometry. To measure GrB or GrB-SG-induced apoptosis, the proportion of cells appearing in the sub-G1 peak of DNA histograms was analyzed as described (24Dressel R. Elsner L. Quentin T. Walter L. Günther E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2362-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To measure CTL-induced apoptosis by sub-G1 peak determination, the target cells had been labeled before with the fluorescent dye CM-DiI (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were resuspended in 3 ml of HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 15 μl of the cell labeling solution, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and then washed three times with HEPES-buffered DMEM. OT-I-derived CTL were added to 105 CM-Dil-labeled target cells in 5-ml polystyrene tubes at ratios of 10:1, 5:1, and 1:1 or were omitted (ratio 0:1). One of two duplicates for each ratio was supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml SIINFEKL peptide before incubation at 37 °C for 4 h in 1 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS. Afterward the cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 0.05% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, PBS to obtain a single cell suspension, and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton-X 100, PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS the cells were stained with 0.1 μg/ml 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) and subjected to flow cytometry. The percentage of CM-Dil-labeled target cells appearing in the sub-G1 peak was determined. To determine the internalization of GrB cells were grown in 24-well plates and exposed to the Alexa 488-labeled GrB or GrB-SG in DMEM, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the concentration of 1 μg/ml for 60 min at 37 °C. Afterward the cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, PBS and washed with PBS, 1% BSA before PI staining and flow cytometry. To determine expression of Mpr300 and Mpr46, previously described (25Klumperman J. Hille A. Veenendaal T. Oorschot V. Stoorvogel W. von Figura K. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) rabbit antibodies (Ab) specific for Mpr300 or the cytoplasmic tail of Mpr46 were used. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 10 min at 20 °C and permeabilized with 0.25% saponin, PBS before incubation with the 1:100 diluted anti-Mpr46 or anti-Mpr300 Ab and subsequently with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary Ab (Jackson Laboratories, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). In certain experiments, cells were exposed to anti-Mpr300 Ab first for 1 h at 37 °C to allow for its internalization together with Mpr300, followed by fixation, permeabilization, and incubation with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary Ab as described above. Immunoblot—To determine uptake of GrB by immunoblot 1 × 105 cells were incubated with GrB or GrB-SG in DMEM, 1% BSA at the indicated concentrations for 60 min at 37 °C. Afterward the cells were washed three times with 0.05% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, PBS. Then the cells were resuspended in 20 μl of sample buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.75, containing 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) was separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schüll, Dassel, Germany) before staining with anti-GrB mAb (clone B18.1, mouse IgG1, Alexis Biochemicals) and anti-Hsc70 mAb (clone 1B5, rat IgG2a, StressGen, Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) used as loading control at dilutions of 1:2000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Subsequently, blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG Ab (Jackson Laboratories) or goat anti-rat IgG + IgM Ab (Jackson Laboratories) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG Ab (Jackson Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:10,000. Blots were analyzed using an ECL chemiluminescent Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and a CCD camera (Fuji LAS-1000plus, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) with AIDA software supplied by the manufacturer. Immunofluorescence—MEF lines were grown on cover slips for 1 day before incubation with fluorochrome-labeled GrB or GrB-SG complexes in DMEM, 1% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C or 60 min at 37 °C. After, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, PBS. For colocalization experiments cells were permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100, PBS or 0.1% saponin, PBS) and incubated with 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-Mpr300 (25Klumperman J. Hille A. Veenendaal T.

Texas Red-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) was used for endocytosis experiments. The samples were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany) and analyzed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2 AOBS, Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Delivery of GrB and GrB-SG to Induce Cell Death—PFN was used for GrB delivery as described (8Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J.

In some experiments type 5 AD subtype delta L327 containing the GFP gene under the control of the immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter was used to deliver GrB into the cytosol of target cells. The construct lacks a XbaI fragment of 1.89 kb that covers almost all of the E3 region from 28,593 to 30,471 (78.5–84.3 map units; the nucleotide positions are based on the AD5 wild-type sequence) and nucleotides 358–3,332 of the E1 region (map units 1.4–9.4). The virus was amplified in HEK293 cells (26Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation followed by dialysis against a sucrose buffer (27Nyberg-Hoffman C. Aguilar-Cordova E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Plaque purification was carried out to minimize wildtype AD contamination, which was tested by PCR with primers specific for the E1 region. Biological activity on HEK293 cells was 1011 plaque forming units/ml supernatant. To insure equivalent delivery of the GrB and GrB-SG complexes by AD, the multiplicity of infection (MOI)/cell had been adjusted in initial experiments for each fibroblast line such that 24 h later about 80% cells were found to express GFP as determined by fluorescent microscopy. Target cells were cultured in 24-well plates. For the test, culture medium was replaced by DMEM, 1% BSA, and GrB or GrB-SG complexes were added before the cells were infected with AD at a MOI of 100–500. Cell death and apoptosis were determined after incubation for 5 h at 37 °C. Transfection was assessed in simultaneously infected cells 24 h later by GFP expression using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Lysis of Lymphoblast Target Cells by Alloreactive and Peptide-specific CTL—The Mpr300 has been reported not only to function as GrB receptor on target cells but also to be essential for the rejection of allogeneic cells (10Motyka B.

Herein, we report that in addition to phosphorylating TyrT, CHK can inhibit SFKs by a novel non-catalytic mechanism. First, CHK directly binds to the SFK members Hck, Lyn, and Src to form stable protein complexes. The complex formation is mediated by a non-catalytic TyrT-independent mechanism because it occurs even in the absence of ATP or when TyrT of Hck is replaced by phenylalanine. Second, the non-catalytic CHK-SFK interaction alone is sufficient to inactivate SFKs by inhibiting the catalytic activity of autophosphorylated SFKs. Third, CHK and Src co-localize to specific plasma membrane microdomains of rat brain cells, suggesting that CHK is in close proximity to Src such that it can effectively inactivate Src in vivo. Fourth, native CHK·Src complex exists in rat brain, and recombinant CHK·Hck complex exists in transfected HEK293T cells, implying that CHK forms stable complexes with SFKs in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that CHK inactivates SFKs (i) by phosphorylating their TyrT and (ii) by this novel TyrT-independent mechanism involving direct binding of CHK to SFKs. It has been documented that autophosphorylated SFKs can still be active, in some cases even when their TyrT is phosphorylated. Thus, the ability of the TyrT-independent mechanism to suppress the activity of both non-phosphorylated and autophosphorylated SFKs represents a fail-safe measure employed by CHK to down-regulate SFK signaling under all circumstances.

CSK is ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian tissues, whereas the expression of CHK is much more restricted; it is expressed predominantly in neurons and hemopoietic cells. Extensive biochemical evidence indicates that CSK inactivates SFKs primarily by phosphorylating their TyrT. Although there are several pieces of preliminary evidence suggesting that CHK can also phosphorylate TyrT of several SFK members, including c-Src, Lyn, Lck, and Fyn (10Chow L.M.L. Jarvis C. Hu Q.L.

Using Hck, Lyn, and Src as model targets, we investigated the mechanism by which CHK inactivates SFKs. We discovered that in addition to inactivation of SFKs by specifically phosphorylating their TyrT, CHK could inactivate SFKs by a novel inhibitory mechanism. In this mechanism CHK directly binds to SFKs to form stable complexes, and this binding alone is sufficient to inactivate SFKs. To further confirm the validity our in vitro observations, we attempted to determine if CHK could bind and inactivate Hck in transfected HEK293T cells. Results of our experiments using the transfected HEK293T cells reveal that CHK·Hck complex formation and inactivation of Hck occurred even when TyrT of Hck was replaced by phenylalanine. The results indicate that CHK·Hck complex formation and Hck inactivation by this novel inhibitory mechanism are not mediated by binding of TyrT of Hck to the active site of CHK. Hence, this novel inhibition occurs by a non-catalytic mechanism. To support the physiological relevance of our findings, we reveal that CHK and Src co-localize to specific microdomains of rat brain plasma membrane and that CHK and Src form stable protein complex(es) in rat brain. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interaction can suppress SFK activity regardless of the level of autophosphorylation of TyrA. Thus, by binding to and suppressing the activity of both the less active unphosphorylated form and the fully active autophosphorylated form of SFKs, CHK is capable of providing a fail-safe mechanism to down-regulate SFK signaling under all circumstances.

Chemical Cross-linking of Antibodies to Protein A-Sepharose—Data generated by the use of these reagents are shown in Fig. 10C. Rabbit IgG from preimmune sera, anti-CHK, and anti-CSK antibodies were chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma-Aldrich) following the procedures described by Harlow and Lane (16Harlow E.

Mutagenesis and Construction of Expression Vectors—The cDNA fragment encoding full-length CHK was retrieved from the pRK7-BatK-flagC plasmid by digestion with EcoR1 and BamH1. It was then used as template for a PCR reaction that introduced EcoR1 and BglII restriction sites, and the stop codon. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CCG GAA TTC GCT AAG ATG CCA ACG CAA CGC-3′ (Primer 1 sense) and 5′-G ACT AGA TCT TCA GGG GTC CTG GCT CCG-3′ (Primer 2 antisense); the restriction sites are underlined, and the start and stop codons are in bold italics. The PCR product generated was cloned into the pBAK-PAK9 vector (Clontech) using procedures described previously (4Johnson T.M. Williamson N.A. Scholz G. Jaworowski A. Wettenhall R.E. Dunn A.R.

For the K221M mutation pBacPAK9-CHK plasmid was used as template for PCR-based mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides used were Primer 1 Sense, Primer 2 Antisense, and Primer 3 Antisense (5′-G TAC TTG GGA CAG AAG GTG GCC GTG ATG AAT ATA-3′); the A to T codon change is underlined in the sequence. The resultant plasmids, pBacPAK9-CHK or pBacPAK9-CHK(K221M), were sequenced to confirm that only the required mutation was introduced during the PCR procedure. Both plasmids were used to co-transfect with BAC-PAK6 baculoviral DNA into Sf9 cells to generate the recombinant CHK and CHK(K221M) baculoviruses according to manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Purification of Recombinant CHK and Its Mutant Expressed in Sf9 Insect Cells—All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. One liter of CHK baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (0.7 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm sodium potassium tartrate, 1 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 50 mm NaF). The supernatant was applied to a DEAE column (80-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF). The unbound fraction, which contained the majority of the CHK protein was then loaded onto a carboxymethyl cation exchange column (100 × 22 mm). Proteins bound to the carboxymethyl column were eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Fractions containing CHK were further purified on a Superose-12 gel-filtration column equilibrated in Buffer A with 0.2 m NaCl. The CHK-containing column fractions were pooled and applied to a phosphotyrosine-agarose column (5-ml bed volume, 5–15 μmol of immobilized phosphotyrosine per ml). The column was washed with Buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted from the column with 100 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate in Buffer A. Fractions containing CHK were pooled and purified by Mono S cation exchange column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1C, the final CHK preparation was >90% pure. The recombinant CHK(K221M) mutant was also purified using an identical procedure. Preparation of Crude Rat Brain Lysate for Detection of CHK·Src Protein Complexes—All procedures described were performed at 4 °C. Brain tissues from 10 adult rats were homogenized in 140 ml of lysis buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 40,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was separated into aliquots and frozen at –70 °C before immunoprecipitation analysis to generate the data shown in Fig. 10C. Fractionation of Rat Brain Membrane—This section describes Fig. 10B. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Brain tissues from 10 adult rats were homogenized in Buffer B (0.32 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to remove the nuclei and large debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The crude membrane was further separated into different membrane microdomains by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and treatment with Triton X-100 using a procedure adapted from Prior et al. (17Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and Waheed et al. (18Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Iwashita S. Slot J.W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude membrane was resuspended in 2 ml of 45% (w/v) sucrose in MBS solution (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was loaded into a centrifuge tube and then overlaid with a MBS-sucrose gradient of 35% sucrose (2.8 ml), 30% sucrose (2.4 ml), 25% sucrose (2.4 ml), and 5% sucrose (2.4 ml). After centrifugation at 300,000 × g in the Beckman SW41 rotor for 16 h, 12 1-ml fractions were harvested from the top of the tube. Fractions 2–5 and 9–12 correspond to the low and high density membrane microdomains, respectively. To pellet the membrane in each fraction, MBS (9 ml) was added to the individual fractions, and the mixture was centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet from each fraction was treated with 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in Buffer B. The samples were again subjected to centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant corresponds to the Triton X-100-soluble portion, whereas the pellet corresponds to the Triton X-100-insoluble portion. Aliquots of both portions were analyzed for the presence of CHK and Src by Western blotting. Assay of CHK Protein Kinase Activity—Three different substrates, poly(Glu/Tyr), Hck(K267M), and SFK C-terminal peptide were used to assay CHK activity. For poly(Glu/Tyr) phosphorylation the kinase assay mixture (25 μl) consisted of 8–12 μg of CHK, kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 μm Na3VO4), 2.5 mg/ml poly(Glu, Tyr), and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. An assay mixture without CHK was used as a blank to quantify the background radioactivity. Phosphorylation was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min. After termination of the reaction, CHK activity was determined following procedures previously described (3Cheng H.C. Bjorge J.D. Aebersold R. Fujita D.J. Wang J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11874-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1B. Hck(K267M) was used as a bona fide substrate of CHK to investigate the efficiency of CHK in catalyzing TyrT phosphorylation. The reaction mixture contained kinase assay buffer, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, CHK (0.33 μm), and varying concentrations of Hck(K267M) (0–5.8 μm). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C. After termination of the reaction, Hck(K267M) was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. The individual protein bands corresponding to Hck(K267M) were excised, and the associated radioactivity was quantitated (Fig. 2C). An SFK C-terminal"

High fidelity of DNA polymerization is essential for preservation of genomic integrity and survival of organisms. When a DNA polymerase inserts an incorrect nucleotide, mutations can result (1Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-83Google Scholar). Mutation can be an advantage for bacteria, but it can lead to detrimental effects in humans, including aging and cancer. Although having intrinsic high fidelity with unmodified DNA bases (10-3 to 10-6 error rate per base), DNA polymerases often have potent miscoding abilities (altered base pairing with incoming dNTPs) opposite modified DNA adducts, thus inducing mutations during replication (2Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Google Scholar, 3Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Google Scholar). DNA adducts act as core sources of misincorporation because they are inevitably formed by endogenous sources and exogenous mutagens in cellular DNA (4Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984Google Scholar). Some adducts that escape repair are usually present in replicating DNA, and therefore, the ability of polymerases to incorporate the appropriate base partner in the presence of a modification to the base in DNA is critical to preserving genetic information. Moreover, some DNA adducts can cause stalling of DNA polymerases at those sites during DNA replication, which in turn can lead to cellular death, depending on the extent. Therefore, DNA polymerases play key roles in both misincorporation and blockage during DNA replication when DNA adducts are present. Depending on the DNA adduct, different DNA polymerases show different degrees of misincorporation and blockage (1Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-83Google Scholar, 2Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Google Scholar, 3Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Google Scholar). Some DNA adducts are small (e.g. abasic sites and oxidative adducts), but others range in size to very bulky adducts, e.g. pyrimidine dimers, photoproducts, large carcinogen-bound adducts, and cross-links (4Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984Google Scholar). The molecular size of DNA adducts might be a key differentiating factor in the misincorporation and blockage of DNA polymerases, which have confined active site pockets. The bulkiness of DNA adducts may be more important in mutagenesis by environmental xenobiotics, because many of these are larger than “endogenous” DNA adducts such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroG. 1The abbreviations used are: G, guanine; T7-, bacteriophage DNA polymerase T7 (exonuclease deficient); dGuo, 2′-deoxyguanosine; 3′-dGuo (or 3′-dG), 3′-deoxyguanosine; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl), N2-methyl(9-anthracenyl); dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); RT, human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: G, guanine; T7-, bacteriophage DNA polymerase T7 (exonuclease deficient); dGuo, 2′-deoxyguanosine; 3′-dGuo (or 3′-dG), 3′-deoxyguanosine; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl), N2-methyl(9-anthracenyl); dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); RT, human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. We have studied some details of misincorporation and blockage with the model replicative polymerases T7- and RT in work focused on small modifications of guanine at the C-8 (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroG) and O-6 atoms (O6-methylG, O6-benzylG) of guanine (5Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Google Scholar, 6Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Google Scholar, 7Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1039-1050Google Scholar). These adducts are bypassed fairly readily, and the misincorporations are considerable. We have also found that large groups (glutathionylethylene) at the O-6 and N-2 atoms are very blocking to several polymerases (8Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 311-316Google Scholar). In this work we decided to evaluate systemically the effect of varying bulk at the guanine N-2 atom.

Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide N2-G adducts have been studied extensively; they are mutagenic and generate G to T transversions in Escherichia coli and simian kidney (COS7) cells and are readily bypassed by DNA polymerase κ, depending upon the base sequence context (14Fernandes A.

Terashima I. Matsumoto Y. Yabushita H. Matsui S. Shibutani S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 929-935Google Scholar). Even the relatively small N2-methylG and N2-ethylG adducts have been reported to be miscoding. The Klenow fragment (of E. coli DNA polymerase I) incorporated mainly dCTP, along with some dTTP, opposite N2-methylG in an oligonucleotide (9Yasui M. Matsui S. Ihara M. Laxmi Y.R. Shibutani S. Matsuda T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1994-2001Google Scholar). The same enzyme (exonuclease- form) incorporated dGTP and dCTP to similar extents opposite N2-ethylG and also efficiently incorporated N2-ethylGTP opposite a template C (10Terashima I. Matsuda T. Fang T.-W. Suzuki N. Kobayashi J. Kohda K. Shibutani S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4106-4114Google Scholar). In this study, we prepared site-specifically modified oligonucleotides containing N2-methylG, N2-ethylG, N2-isobutylG, N2-benzylG, and N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)G, with gradually increasing bulk at the guanine N2-alkyl adduct (Fig. 1), and we used these with the replicative DNA polymerases T7- and RT, which have been good models of replicative polymerases (19Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Google Scholar) and have advantages over E. coli polymerase I (and Klenow fragment) (20Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Google Scholar). We investigated steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics and also the features of DNA substrate binding to polymerase. With both polymerases, we found that even N2-methylG exerted a strong effect, and a further dramatic difference on both misinsertion and blockage was seen in increasing the bulk from N2-methylG to N2-ethylG. The results are considered in the context of knowledge about replicative polymerases and their kinetic behavior. Materials—Unlabeled dNTPs, dCTPαS, and dATPαS were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Bio-spin columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. Most chemicals used for synthesis were purchased from Aldrich. Synthesis of 9-(Aminomethyl)anthracene—The amine was prepared by a modified Gabriel procedure. 9-(Chloromethyl)anthracene (Aldrich, 9.0 g, 13 mmol) was stirred with potassium phthalimide (2.5 g, 13.5 mmol) in 80 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide at 60 °C for 3 h. The mixture was diluted with 100 ml of H2O, and the product (9-[N-phthalimido-(methyl)]anthracene) was extracted with three 200-ml portions of CHCl3. The organic layers were combined, dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo (2.35 g, 57% yield). The product was dissolved in 450 ml of C2H5OH and heated with 1.0 ml of NH2NH2·H2O (21 mmol) under reflux for 4 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the resulting 9-(aminomethyl)anthracene was purified by chromatography on a 2 × 25-cm silica gel column, eluting with CH2Cl2-CH3OH (98-2, v/v) (1.22 g, 84% yield): MS (electron impact) m/z 207 (relative abundance 100, M+), 206 (57, M - 1), 191 (49, M - 16), 178 (80, M - 29); 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 4.82 (s, 2H, -C H2NH2), 5.28 (s, -NH2), 7.54 (m, 4H, H-2, H-3, H-6, and H-7), 8.03 (d, 2H, H-1 and H-8), 8.33 (d, 2H, H-4 and H-5), 8.39 (s, 1H, H-10). Enzymes—RT and T7- were expressed and purified as described previously (5Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Google Scholar) by using stock plasmids provided by S. Hughes (RT, Frederick Cancer Facility, Frederick, MD) (21Lunn C.A. Kathju S. Wallace B.J. Kushner S.R. Pigiet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10469-10474Google Scholar, 22Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Google Scholar). The T7- expression and purification procedures were as modified by Zang et al. 2H. Zang, T. M. Harris, and F. P. Guengerich, submitted for publication. T7- was reconstituted with thioredoxin immediately prior to use as described (22Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using ϵ280 values of 144 mm-1 cm-1 for T7-, 13.7 mm-1 cm-1 for thioredoxin, and 522 mm-1 cm-1 for RT (24Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4818-4825Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides—18-FAM-mer, 24 (3′-dGuo)-mer, and the unmodified 24-mer and 36-mer (Table I) were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Four 36-mers, each containing a guanine N2-adduct (e.g. N2-methylG, N2-ethylG, N2-isobutylG, or N2-benzylG), were synthesized on an Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) from tert-butylphenoxyacetyl-protected cyanoethyl phosphoramidites and the adducted phosphoramidites (see below) by using standard DNA synthesis protocols. N2-Alkyl adducts of dGuo were synthesized from dGuo or 2-fluoro-(O6-trimethylsilylethyl)-2′-deoxyinosine (25Decorte B.L. Tsarouhtsis D. Kuchimanchi S. Cooper M.D. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 630-637Google Scholar) as described below, and the correct structures and molecular masses were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray MS. The 5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-3′-phosphoramidite derivatives of dGuo N2-alkyl adducts were prepared by standard procedures (26Meyer R.B. Agrawal S. Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates.

Toxicol. 2002; 15: 607-613Google Scholar) with minor modification and then introduced into oligonucleotides. We found that protection of the N-2 atom was not needed in the preparation of the phosphoramidites used for synthesis, due to the effect of the added bulk (even with N2-methyldGuo). DNA oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC and denaturing PAGE (see below). MALDI-TOF MS was used to confirm correct mass/charge ratios (m/z) of the oligonucleotides (see Supplemental Material). Purity was analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis on a Beckman P/ACE 2000 instrument as described previously (6Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Google Scholar). We estimated the purity of the oligonucleotides used here to be ∼99% (see Supplemental Material). The extinction coefficients for the oligonucleotides, estimated by the Borer method (28Borer P.N. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Cleveland, OH1975: 589-590Google Scholar), were as follow: 18-FAM-mer, ϵ260 = 196 mm-1 cm-1; 24-mer, ϵ260 = 224 mm-1 cm-1; and 36-mer, ϵ260 = 310 mm-1 cm-1.Table IOligodeoxynucleotides used in this study18-FAM-mer5′ (FAM)-AGCCAGCCGCAGACGCAG24-mer5′-GCCTCGAGCCAGCCGCAGACGCAG24-(3′-dGuo)mer5′-GCCTCGAGCCAGCCGCAGACGCA (3′-dG)36-mer3′-CGGAGCTCGGTCGGCGTCTGCGTCG*CTCCTGCGGCT Open table in a new tab Synthesis of N2-MethyldGuo (29Sako M.

Formaldehyde (840 μl, 11.2 mmol) was added, and the sample was kept at room temperature for 2 days. The pH was then lowered to 4 by using 1 n HCl. After several days the solvent was removed, and the sample was redissolved in H2O with a small amount of CH3OH. The N2-methyldGuo was purified using a semi-preparative octadecylsilane (C18) HPLC column (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a 4.0 ml/min gradient composed of 10 mm NH4HCO3 (solvent A) and CH3OH (solvent B) as follows: 90% A and 10% B at 0 min, 90% A and 10% B at 5 min, and 70% A and 30% B at 30 min (all v/v).

Residual benzaldehyde was removed by extraction with diethyl ether. The product was purified using a Sep-Pak Vac C18 column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by applying the sample and eluting sequentially with 50 ml each of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% CH3OH in H2O (v/v). The product was eluted in the 30 and 40% CH3OH (v/v) fractions. The total yield after purification was 60 mg (15%).

Synthesis of 5′-O-Dimethoxytrityl-3′-phosphoramidite Derivatives of dGuo N2-Adducts and Site-specifically Modified 36-mers—Dimethoxytritylation and phosphitylation of dGuo N2-alkyl adducts were performed according to standard methods (26Meyer R.B. Agrawal S. Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 73-91Google Scholar, 27Nechev L.V. Kozekov I.D. Brock A.K. Rizzo C.J. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 607-613Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, for the dimethoxytritylation of each dGuo N2-adduct, the N2-dGuo adduct (∼50 mg, ∼0.2 mmol) was dried with anhydrous pyridine (3 × 10 ml). The sample was redissolved in 6 ml of pyridine. 4,4′-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (∼70 mg) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for ∼5 h, until the disappearance of starting material, as judged by TLC (CH2Cl2/CH3OH/(C2H5)3N, 95:4:1, v/v/v) during the course of the reaction. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2/CH3OH/(C2H5)3N, 98:1.5:0.5 to 90:9.5:0.5, v/v/v). The identities of products were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray MS. For the further phosphitylation, dimethoxytrityl derivatives of dGuo N2-adducts (∼100 mg) were dried with anhydrous pyridine (3 × 10 ml) and placed under vacuum overnight (vacuum pump, <0.1 mm Hg). Dry CH2Cl2 (∼2.5 ml), tetrazole (∼10 mg), and 2-cyanoethyl-N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropyl phosphoramidite (∼60 μl) were added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The solvent was removed, and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2/CH3OH/(C2H5)3N, 98:1.5:0.5 to 90:9.5:0.5, v/v/v). The 36-mer oligonucleotides containing dGuo N2-adducts were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer on a 1-μmol scale using the corresponding phosphoramidites and a standard DNA synthesis protocol. After overnight deprotection in aqueous 0.1 n NaOH, the beads were pelleted, and the solution was neutralized. The supernatant was filtered and lyophilized before oligonucleotide purification. Synthesis of N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)dGuo-containing 36-mer—The 36-mer oligonucleotide containing N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)dGuo adduct was prepared according to the post-oligomerization methodology developed by Harris and co-workers (25Decorte B.L. Tsarouhtsis D. Kuchimanchi S. Cooper M.D. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 630-637Google Scholar, 31Harris C.M. Zhou L. Strand E.A. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4328-4329Google Scholar). (An alternative approach had been used by Casale and McLaughlin (32Casale R. McLaughlin L.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5264-5271Google Scholar).) A 2-fluoro-O6-[2-(p-nitrophenyl)ethyl]-2′-deoxyinosine-containing 36-mer was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer on a 1-μmol scale using the phosphoramidite of 2-fluoro-O6-[2-(p-nitrophenyl)ethyl]-2′-deoxyinosine and a standard DNA synthesis protocol. After synthesis, oligonucleotide-bound beads were dried and reacted with 9-(aminomethyl)anthracene (100 mg, see above) in a mixture of anhydrous Me2SO (350 μl) and diisopropylethylamine (100 μl) for 24 h at 65 °C. Beads were washed three times with Me2SO and then CH3CN. The dried beads were reacted with 1 m 1,8-diazabicyclo(5,4,0)undec-7-ene in CH3CN (1 ml) at room temperature for 4 h to remove the p-nitrophenylethyl protecting group. Beads were washed three times with CH3OH and then CH3CN. After overnight deprotection of the oligonucleotide in aqueous 0.1 n NaOH, the beads were pelleted, and the solution was neutralized. The supernatant was filtered and taken to dryness by lyophilization prior to oligonucleotide purification. The presence of N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)G in the oligonucleotide was confirmed using MALDI-TOF MS: m/z calculated for [MH]+ 11244.4 and found 11244.2. Purification of Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were purified on a Zorbax Oligo HPLC column (mixed ion-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography, 9.4 × 250 mm, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) using the following gradient with the solvents A (20% CH3CN, 80% 20 mm NH4CH3CO2 (pH 7.0), v/v) and B (20% CH3CN, 80% 20 mm NH4CH3CO2, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0), v/v): 0 - 40% B (all v/v) over 15 min; 40-55% B over 30 min; 55-60% B over 5 min, and 60-100% B over 10 min, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was heated to 45 °C to increase the resolution. The fractions were collected, concentrated by lyophilization, and desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.5 × 40 cm, Amersham Biosciences) using only H2O as solvent. For the further purification of the 36-mer, gel electrophoresis was also done using gels containing 8.0 m urea and 13% acrylamide (w/v) as described previously (6Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Google Scholar). Reaction Conditions for Enzyme Assays—Unless indicated otherwise, standard DNA polymerase reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml (w/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template at 37 (for RT) or 22 °C (for T7-). Primers were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with template (36-mer) as described previously (6Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Google Scholar). All reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP and MgCl2 (12.5 mm final concentration) to preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. Full-length Extension Assay with All Four dNTPs—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) for 30 min. Reaction mixtures (8 μl) were quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) gel system containing 8 m urea and visualized using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Steady-state Reactions—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of increasing concentrations of a single dNTP. The molar ratio of primer-template to enzyme was at least 10:1 except for the 36-mer template containing N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)G (molar ratio of 2-4:1). Enzyme concentrations and reaction times were chosen so that maximal product formation would be ∼20% of the substrate concentration (33Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). The unmodified primer-template was extended in the presence of 0.1-0.8 nm enzyme for 5 min. For the primer-template with G N2-modification (or when using unmodified template with a dNTP other than dCTP), the reaction was done in the presence of 0.5-10 nm enzyme (or 25-50 nm enzyme with the 36-mer containing N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)G) for 5-30 min. All reactions (8 μl) were done at nine dNTP concentrations (in duplicate) and quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) gel containing 8 m urea and quantitated by PhosphorImaging analysis using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX instrument and Quantity One software. Graphs of rates versus dNTP concentration were fit using nonlinear regression (hyperbolic fits) in GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (San Diego, CA) for the determination of kcat and Km values. Pre-steady-state Reactions—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer/template/polymerase mixtures (12.5 μl) with the dNTP-Mg2+ complex (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after times varying from 5 ms to 5 s.

https://openalex.org/W2114837309,"We present structural data on the RIα isoform of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A that reveal, for the first time, a large scale conformational change within the RIα homodimer upon catalytic subunit binding. This result infers that the inhibition of catalytic subunit activity is not the result of a simple docking process but rather is a multi-step process involving local conformational changes both in the cAMP-binding domains as well as in the linker region of the regulatory subunit that impact the global structure of the regulatory homodimer. The results were obtained using small-angle neutron scattering with contrast variation and deuterium labeling. From these experiments we derived information on the shapes and dispositions of the catalytic subunits and regulatory homodimer within a holoenzyme reconstituted with a deuterated regulatory subunit. The scattering data also show that, despite extensive sequence homology between the isoforms, the overall structure of the type Iα holoenzyme is significantly more compact than the type IIα isoform. We present a model of the type Iα holoenzyme, built using available high-resolution structures of the component subunits and domains, which best fits the neutron-scattering data. In this model, the type Iα holoenzyme forms a flattened V shape with the RIα dimerization domain at the point of the V and the cAMP-binding domains of the RIα subunits with their bound catalytic subunits at the ends.

Many cellular signaling pathways in eukaryotes involve protein kinases, which phosphorylate Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues in a variety of target proteins. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; R, regulator subunit; C, catalytic subunit; RC, R and C heterodimer; AKAP, A-kinase anchoring protein; D/D, dimerization/docking; SANS, small-angle neutron scattering; and SAXS, small-angle x-ray scattering. or protein kinase A) is one of the best-studied members of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. PKA is known to be involved in the regulation of a large number of cellular processes including metabolism, contractile activity, growth, apoptosis, and ion flux (1Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Google Scholar). Mutations in PKA can lead to diseases such as Carney complex (2Kirschner L.S. Carney J.A. Pack S.D. Taymans S.E. Giatzakis C. Cho Y.S. Cho-Chung Y.S. Stratakis C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 89-92Google Scholar) and lupus (3Laxminarayana D. Kammer G.M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1521-1529Google Scholar). The catalytic (C) subunits of PKA are responsible for catalyzing the phospho-transfer reaction, whereas the regulatory (R) subunits serve both to confer cAMP dependence and to localize the holoenzyme to discrete subcellular locations via interactions with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (4Skälhegg B.S. Tasken K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Google Scholar). At low cAMP concentrations, PKA is maintained as an inactive tetrameric holoenzyme complex (R2C2) consisting of a homodimeric R2 subunit and two C subunits. When intracellular concentrations of cAMP increase in response to specific cellular stimuli, four cAMP molecules bind to each R2 subunit. This event causes a release of inhibition of C by R, allowing the C subunits to phosphorylate their target proteins. There are four major isoforms of PKA, types Iα, Iβ, IIα, and IIβ, which differ with respect to their R subunits (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ, respectively). The isoforms have different biological functions, as determined by genetic studies using mice. For instance, mice lacking the RIα gene die in utero (5Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 968: 75-92Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking the RIIβ gene are viable, lean, and resistant to diet-induced obesity (6Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Google Scholar). Despite their differing biological functions, all of the R isoforms share the same domain organization. At the N terminus of each R subunit is a dimerization/docking (D/D) domain that serves both to dimerize and anchor the R subunits to AKAPs. The C terminus of the R subunit consists of tandem cAMP-binding domains. Between the D/D domain and the cAMP-binding domains is a linker region that contains a pseudo-substrate inhibitor region that binds to the active site of the C subunits. Mutagenesis (7Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16343-16350Google Scholar) and hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments (8Anand G.S. Hughes C.A. Jones J.M. Taylor S.S. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 377-386Google Scholar) have identified the helical subdomain in the more N-terminal cAMP-binding domain (domain A) of RIα as an additional region of contact between the R and C subunits. There is high sequence homology between the isoforms in the D/D domain and the cAMP-binding domains, but the linker regions are quite different in length and sequence (9Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 17-29Google Scholar). High-resolution structures of the C subunit (10Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar), cAMP-binding domains of RIα (11Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Google Scholar) and RIIβ (12Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Google Scholar), and the D/D domains of RIIα (13Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Google Scholar) and RIα (14Banky P. Roy M. Newlon M.G. Morikis D. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Jennings P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1117-1129Google Scholar) are available and provide important molecular insights into the activation process. The C subunit is a globular, bilobal protein with the active site in a cleft between the lobes. The cAMP-binding domains of the R subunits each consist of a β-barrel region that binds cAMP, and a helical region, whereas the D/D domain consists of an antiparallel four-helix bundle. There are no high-resolution structures of the linker regions, which are thought to be relatively flexible in solution (15Li F. Gangal M. Jones J.M. Deich J. Lovett K.E. Taylor S.S. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15626-15632Google Scholar). Similarly, there are no high-resolution structures of the full-length R homodimers or holoenzyme complexes, which is likely due to the inherent flexibility of the linker regions. Ultracentrifugation and analytical gel filtration indicate that there are significant structural differences between the isoforms. Specifically, the type IIα holoenzyme is more elongated than the type Iα. The reported Stokes radii range from 56.8-60 Å for the type IIα holoenzyme, and 47.4-53.8 Å for the type Iα holoenzyme (16Erlichman J. Rubin C.S. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7607-7609Google Scholar, 17Zoller M.J. Kerlavage A.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2408-2412Google Scholar, 18Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Google Scholar). This difference in Stokes radii is larger than expected for the relatively small difference in isoform molecular weight. Neutron scattering with contrast variation and deuterium labeling is a useful technique for determining the relative shapes and positions of subunits within a molecular complex. The technique was used previously to investigate the subunit arrangement of the PKA type IIα holoenzyme (19Zhao J.K. Hoye E. Boylan S Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Google Scholar). The neutron data and associated modeling revealed an extended dumbbell shape for the holoenzyme, with the C subunits located in the lobes of the dumbbell and separated by ∼120 Å. To further investigate the structural differences between the PKA isoforms and the conformational changes involved in the activation process, we completed small-angle neutron scattering experiments with contrast variation on the type Iα holoenzyme with deuterated R subunits. To aid in the interpretation of the scattering data, we built models of the RIα holoenzyme using the NMR structure of the RIα D/D domain (14Banky P. Roy M. Newlon M.G. Morikis D. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Jennings P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1117-1129Google Scholar) and two previously published models of the RC heterodimer (20Tung C.S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12423-12431Google Scholar, 21Anand G.S. Law D. Mandell J.G. Snead A.N. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 13264-13269Google Scholar) to determine the arrangements of subunits that best fit the contrast series data. The models and the structural parameters derived from the scattering data (Rg, dmax, and P(r)) indicate that the RIα holoenzyme is significantly more compact than the type IIα holoenzyme studied previously by small-angle neutron scattering with contrast variation (19Zhao J.K. Hoye E. Boylan S Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Google Scholar) as well as a recombinant RIIα holoenzyme prepared similarly to the RIα holoenzyme studied here. The two C subunits in the RIα complex are well separated and do not interact with each other, just as in the type IIα isoform. However, the R subunit homodimer in the type Iα complex forms a flattened V-shape in contrast to the more extended dumbbell shape seen for the RIIα homodimer. Interestingly, the RIα homodimer is more extended when bound to the C-subunits than when it is free in solution (22Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1183-1194Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that the interaction of the C subunits with the R subunits plays a critical role in defining the domain organization within the holoenzyme. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—To create an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible construct that makes more efficient use of the expensive deuterated media required to produce deuterated R, the wild-type bovine RIα gene was subcloned out of a wild-type RIα pUC118 vector into an ampicillin-resistant pRSET vector (Invitrogen) using standard methods. After optimizing media deuteration levels to maximize protein yield, large scale expression was performed in 2 liters of 97% deuterated Martek-9 media and unlabeled Martek-9 media at a 7:3 ratio. Recombinant bovine R (RIα and RIIα) was purified from Escherichia coli Bl21-DE3 cells using cAMP-agarose resin (23Diller T.C. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 357-364Google Scholar) and eluted with 25 mm cGMP instead of cAMP. Recombinant, non-myristoylated bovine catalytic subunit was purified from E. coli Bl21-DE3 cells as described previously (24Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Google Scholar). Holoenzymes were then reconstituted as described elsewhere (8Anand G.S. Hughes C.A. Jones J.M. Taylor S.S. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 377-386Google Scholar). Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) Measurements—The SAXS data were collected using the line source instrument at Los Alamos National Laboratory (25Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 27: 909-915Google Scholar). Intensity data were reduced to I(q) versus q using standard procedures to correct for detector sensitivity and background signal, and a smearing procedure was used to correct for the slit geometry of the instrument (25Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 27: 909-915Google Scholar). The SAXS data from the holoenzyme were compared with a lysozyme standard (26Krigbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Google Scholar) to verify that the samples were free from nonspecific aggregation and the influence of inter-particle interference. Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) Measurements—Samples of the type Iα holoenzyme with deuterated R subunit in H2O/D2O mixtures containing 0, 20, 40, 80, and 90% D2O were prepared by mixing stock solutions of the holoenzyme dissolved in H2O and D2O to provide five neutron contrast values. The samples and corresponding solvent blanks with 0, 20, and 40% D2O were measured in 1-mm path length cells, whereas 20-mm path length cells were used for the samples with 80 and 90% D2O buffer. The precise D2O content of each sample was determined by comparing the neutron absorbance, μ, to that of pure H2O and D2O. The neutron absorbance is obtained from the measured sample transmission using the relationship μ = ln(T)/d, where μ is the neutron absorbance, T is the transmittance, and d is the sample path length. Neutron absorbance varies linearly with hydrogen content of the buffer; thus, using the relation presented below in Equation 1, P=1-((μsam-μD2O)/(μH2O-μD2O))(Eq. 1) the solvent deuteration fraction of the sample, P, can be determined. The D2O content of each sample determined in this manner was used throughout the analysis of the data. The SANS data were collected at the Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD) using the NG-3 30m SANS instrument (27Hammouda B. Barker J.G. Krueger S. Small Angle Neutron Scattering Manuals. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1996Google Scholar). A neutron wavelength of 5.5 Å was used with a wavelength spread Δλ/λ of 0.26 to provide the maximum flux. Sample and background intensities were collected at sample-to-detector distances of 1.5 and 6 m to obtain data over the required q-range. Data reduction to one-dimensional scattered intensity profiles, I(q) versus q, followed standard procedures to correct for detector sensitivity and sample background (27Hammouda B. Barker J.G. Krueger S. Small Angle Neutron Scattering Manuals. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1996Google Scholar). The reduced intensities from the two detector distances were merged using routines included with the data reduction software provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Small-Angle Scattering Data Analysis—The small-angle scattering intensity profile of monodisperse, identical particles in solution is given by Equation 2, I(q)=|〈∫V(ρ(r→)-ρs)e-iq→⋅r→d3r〉|2(Eq. 2) where ρ(r→) is the scattering length density of the particle as a function of position r→ within the volume V, ρs is the average scattering length density of the solvent, and q→ is the momentum transfer, having the magnitude 4π(sinθ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength. The integration is averaged over all conformations and orientations of the particles in solution, because small-angle solution scattering measures the time- and ensemble-averaged information from all of the particles in the sampled volume. As shown below in Equation 3, P(r)=12π2∫0∞dq⋅(qr)⋅I(q)sin(qr)(Eq. 3) the inverse Fourier transform of I(q) versus q gives P(r) versus r, the probable distribution of vector lengths, r, between scattering centers within the scattering object. P(r) is readily interpreted in terms of the shape of the scattering object. The indirect Fourier transform algorithm originally described by Moore (28Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Google Scholar) was used to determine P(r) from I(q). The boundary conditions P(r)/r = 0 at r = 0 and the maximum linear dimension, dmax, are applied to P(r). The contrast series intensity profiles I(q) can be written as a set of linear equations in the three basic scattering functions, i.e. the scattering functions of the labeled and unlabeled components and a cross-term (29Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Wang C.-L.A. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Google Scholar, 30Ibel K. Stuhrmann H B. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 93: 255-265Google Scholar). The P(r) calculated from the cross-term gives the distribution of vector lengths between the labeled and unlabeled components of the complex. A multiple linear regression routine (31Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 164-176Google Scholar) implemented in the C programming language at Los Alamos National Laboratory was used to solve for the three basic scattering functions using the contrast series data. These basic scattering functions were used to derive information on the shapes and relative dispositions of deuterated and non-deuterated components in the system. Structural Models—Structural models of the isotopically labeled subunits and the overall complex were determined from the SANS data using an algorithm developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and implemented in the program CONTRAST (32Heller W.T. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N. Rosevear P.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15654-15663Google Scholar). This program can take a set of known high-resolution structures, and/or shapes, and find the relative position and orientation of the components that give the best fit to a set of intensity profiles measured in a neutron contrast series. The best fit model structures are generated using a Monte Carlo approach employed previously (19Zhao J.K. Hoye E. Boylan S Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Google Scholar, 25Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 27: 909-915Google Scholar). To evaluate the quality of the fit of each model to the data, CONTRAST uses the fitting parameter F, as shown below in Equation 4, F=1Npts(∑Npts(I(q)-Im(q))2σ(q)-2)(Eq. 4) where Npts is the number of points in the data set, I(q) and Im(q) are the experimental and model intensities, respectively, and σ(q) is the experimental uncertainty of I(q). The D/D domain used was the NMR structure of the RIα isoform (Protein Data Bank entry 1R2A, Ref. 14Banky P. Roy M. Newlon M.G. Morikis D. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Jennings P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1117-1129Google Scholar). The modeling was done using two different high-resolution models of the Δ(1-91)RIIα/C heterodimer based on the crystal structures of the RIα cAMP binding domain and C subunit (Protein Data Bank entry 1PVK, Ref. 20Tung C.S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12423-12431Google Scholar, and Protein Data Bank entry 1KMU, Ref. 21Anand G.S. Law D. Mandell J.G. Snead A.N. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 13264-13269Google Scholar). To simulate the volume occupied by the linker region, cylinders of 8, 10, 12, and 14 Å radii were generated with a volume calculated from the molecular weight of the linker sequence missing from the structures. The cylinders were filled with random points to the same density of points as used by the other structures. The structure was chained together in the sequence RC heterodimer:linker cylinder:D/D domain:linker cylinder:RC heterodimer. All of these structural components were then allowed to rotate freely with respect to each other about their connection points. The angles were chosen randomly with no constraints applied. A 2-fold axis of symmetry about the natural axis of symmetry of dimerization/docking domain was enforced for all models. Two independent runs of CONTRAST were performed per cylinder length for each of the two RC heterodimer models, each testing in excess of 250,000 possible models. SAXS Data from the Type Iα and IIα Holoenzymes—The small-angle x-ray scattering intensity profiles and associated distance distribution functions, P(r), for the type Iα PKA holoenzyme (in H2O and in D2O) and the type IIα PKA (in H2O) holoenzyme, which was similarly prepared for this study, are shown in Fig. 1. The P(r) functions of the type Iα holoenzyme in H2O and D2O are identical within the error of the measurements, indicating that the overall conformation of the holoenzyme is unaltered by D2O. All of the samples were free of nonspecific aggregation and the effects of inter-particle interference, as judged by the lack of an upturn or downturn, respectively, in the low q region of the scattering intensity plot. Comparison of the forward scattering (I(0)) intensity with that from a lysozyme standard also supported this conclusion. The P(r) function for the type Iα holoenzyme peaks at ∼40 Å, has a strong shoulder at 112 Å, goes to zero at 150 Å, and is indicative of a bilobal object. The P(r) curve for the type IIα holoenzyme peaks just below 40 Å with shoulders at 112 and 140 Å and extends out to ∼210 Å, indicative of a significantly more extended, asymmetric shape. The structural parameters Rg and dmax, derived from the P(r) plots, are summarized in Table I. Two sets of parameters are given for the type IIα holoenzyme; one is derived from samples prepared for this study, and the other one is from an earlier study (19Zhao J.K. Hoye E. Boylan S Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Google Scholar). Although both data sets show a more extended structure than what we see for the type Iα isoform, the earlier study found an even more extended structure than what we see here for the type IIα samples reconstituted using the same methods employed for the type Iα isoform. The samples used in the earlier study of the type IIα holoenzyme were reconstituted using native, myristoylated C subunits, and a urea unfolding step was used to remove cAMP from R in order to reconstitute holoenzyme, whereas this study used a recombinant, unmyristoylated C subunit and no urea unfolding step. These differences in sample preparation are the likely source of differences in the type II holoenzyme structures. However, both studies show the type IIα holoenzyme to be significantly more extended than the type Iα holoenzyme. Thus, our observation of the large isoform differences between the two holoenzymes is not an artifact of the sample preparation conditions.Table IScattering parametersRgaRg and dmax were determined from the R(r) as discussed under “Materials and Methods.” P(r) was determined using the method of Moore (28).

Open table in a new tab SANS Data, with Contrast Variation, from the Type Iα Holoenzyme—The intensity profiles collected for the neutron contrast variation series on the type Iα holoenzyme reconstituted with deuterated R are plotted in Fig. 2. The quality of the data is good as judged by the counting statistics. The 40 and 80% D2O data sets are close to the match points of the unlabeled C and deuterium-labeled R components, respectively. As a result, these two intensity profiles closely match the basic scattering functions for the R and C components within the holoenzyme complex, respectively. The basic scattering functions extracted from the full contrast series data and corresponding to the scattering functions for the deuterated and non-deuterated components in the complex, plus a cross-term, are plotted in Fig. 3A. The P(r) functions derived from the basic scattering functions corresponding to the scattering profiles of the deuterated and non-deuterated components in the holoenzyme are shown in Fig. 3B, and the corresponding structural parameters are presented in Table I along with those derived from SAXS data for the free RIα homodimer (22Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1183-1194Google Scholar). As observed previously for the type IIα holoenzyme (19Zhao J.K. Hoye E. Boylan S Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Google Scholar), the P(r) curve for the C subunits in the complex shows two well separated peaks, indicating that they are not in contact with each other. The peak at ∼25 Å resembles the P(r) expected for the isolated C subunit (19Zhao J.K. Hoye E. Boylan S Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Google Scholar) and corresponds to the intermolecular vector lengths within each individual C subunit. The peak at ∼112 Å corresponds to the inter-atomic distances between the two C subunits in the holoenzyme complex. The areas under the two peaks are the same, as is expected for two identical subunits separated in space. The P(r) of the R dimer in the complex has a peak at ∼37 Å with a broad shoulder ∼85-90 Å, indicating a bilobal structure. There is a striking difference between this shape and RIα dimer free in solution, which is significantly more compact as evidenced by its P(r), which has a peak at ∼33 Å, a high shoulder at ∼80 Å, and goes to zero at 117 Å. Thus, we see that the C subunit binding to the RIα homodimer results in increases in Rg by∼10 Å (25%) and dmax by 33 Å (28%) (Table I). Taken together, the scattering parameters and the P(r) functions indicate that the RIα homodimer undergoes a large extension upon binding C subunits.Fig. 3Scattering functions for the RIα PKA subunits. Basic scattering functions derived from the contrast variation series data are plotted along with the SAXS data for the RIα homodimer (A) for comparison and the corresponding P(r) functions (B). The C subunit pair (▪), the R homodimer (○), and the cross-term (▵) from the neutron-derived basic scattering functions are shown along with the SAXS data for the free RIα homodimer (▾), which has been offset for clarity. The free RIα homodimer SAXS data are taken from another study (22Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1183-1194Google Scholar). Simplified versions of the models shown in Fig. 4 are shown on the right to help visualize which P(r) function represents which subunit within the holoenzyme. For the C subunit basic scattering function, the C subunits within the model to the right are highlighted in black, and the R dimer is in light gray. For the R homodimer basic scattering function, the color scheme is reversed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Structural Models of the Type Iα Holoenzyme—Using high-resolution structures of the RIα D/D domain (14Banky P.

Here we confirm that the ethanolamine phosphate side chain added by Mcd4p to the first mannose is a prerequisite for the addition of the third mannose to the GPI precursor lipid and demonstrate that, contrary to an earlier report, an ethanolamine phosphate can equally be found on the majority of yeast GPI protein anchors. Curiously, the stability of this substituent during preparation of anchors is much greater in gpi7Δ sec18 double mutants than in either single mutant or wild type cells, indicating that the lack of a substituent on the second mannose (caused by the deletion of GPI7) influences the stability of the one on the first mannose. The phosphodiester-linked substituent on the second mannose, probably a further ethanolamine phosphate, is added to GPI lipids by endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes in vitro but cannot be detected on GPI proteins of wild type cells and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis in saline. Genetic manipulations to increase phosphatidylethanolamine levels in gpi7Δ cells by overexpression of PSD1 restore cell growth at 37 °C without restoring the addition of a substituent to Man2.

This report concerns the ethanolamine phosphate (EtN-P) side chains, which are often present on mannoses 1 and 2 of the core structure (Man1 and Man2 in Fig. 1).

These genes are homologous to each other, are found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, possess an N-terminal globular domain facing the lumen of the ER or the extracellular space and multiple transmembrane domains in their C terminus. They are good candidates for the EtN-P transferases themselves, as the N-terminal, globular domains have a distinct homology with verified phosphodiesterases and because the corresponding mutants accumulate GPI lipid intermediates that lack EtN-P residues. A further gene named PIG-F has been implied in the addition of EtN-P side chains, as PIG-F mutants fail to add EtN-P to Man3 in mammalian cells (8Kamitani T. Menon A.K. Hallaq Y. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.

GPI11, the yeast homologue of PIG-F, is not required for the addition of EtN-P to Man3 but may be required for the addition of a hydrofluoric acid (HF) labile substituent to Man2 (18Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of MCD4, GPI11, or GPI13 is lethal, whereas deletion of GPI7 only compromises cell wall integrity (15Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

This is not unexpected for GPI13, as in all GPI proteins analyzed it invariably is the EtN-P on Man3 that links the GPI to the protein, and even in mutants that cannot add EtN-P to Man3 or cannot add Man3, the GPI proteins were never found to be attached through an EtN-P on Man1 or Man2. Whereas at present we have a good overall picture of the major stages of the GPI biosynthesis pathway, many questions concerning the sequence of events and their importance for the biosynthetic process remain to be elucidated. One particular difficulty is to know which GPI lipid is attached to nascent proteins by the GPI transamidase complex in the ER. Even though there is a wealth of partial structures of lipids accumulating in mutants that are unable to synthesize or to attach GPI lipids to proteins, or of lipids that are synthesized by microsomes in vitro, it is doubtful that all these lipids are normal intermediates of the pathway. Thus, it cannot be excluded a priori that under physiological conditions certain EtN-Ps are added to GPI anchors only after the GPI lipid has been added to proteins or the protein has left the ER. Here we describe our attempts to address a few of the several unresolved questions about the biosynthetic route and the role of the EtN-P residues on Man1 and Man2 in yeast.

CP lipids were purified by preparative TLC and then incubated under exactly the same conditions as used for preparing GPI anchor peptides. In some experiments we added a mixture of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pentoxifylline, dipyramidole, ethaverine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and papaverine at 1, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.25 mm final concentrations, respectively. To test for a phosphodiesterase activity that would remove EtN-P, CaCl2 in GPI-PLD buffer was replaced by 10 mm EDTA so that the GPI-PLD itself was inactive (31Davitz M.A. Hom J. Schenkman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13760-13764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation the potential degradation of CP lipids and the appearance of less polar lipids was assessed by TLC in solvent 1 followed by radioscanning/fluorography. Analysis of Head Groups—Liberated head groups were subjected to acetolysis, JBAM and HF treatments, N-acetylation using methods listed in Ref. 11Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, and paper chromatography in solvent methyl ethyl ketone/pyridine/water (20:12:11) (9Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7215-7224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). myo-[14C]Ins was added to each sample as an internal standard before paper chromatography allowing for exact positioning of Man-GlcNAc-Ins and GlcNAc-Ins peaks. Lipid Analysis—Lipids were extracted from labeled cells using CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), desalted by butanol/water partitioning, and analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates using the same solvent (solvent 1) followed by fluorography. Biosynthesis of GPI Lipids in Vitro—For GPI biosynthesis in microsomes in vitro we followed a previously used protocol (11Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, spheroplasts were generated by incubation for 60 min at 37 °C in buffer A (10 mm azide, 1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) using Zymolyase (0.2 mg/ml) or Quantazyme (3 units/1 A600 unit of cells), spheroplasts were washed 2 times in the same buffer but without 2-mercaptoethanol, were broken by forcing them through a 0.4-mm needle using a syringe, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 3000 × g for 5 min, and then 75,000 × g for 60 min. Pellets P3 and P75 were resuspended in 0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml antipain and could be frozen at that stage. For the standard assay the two pellets were pooled, diluted into 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CoA, 1 mm GDP-mannose, 20 μg/ml tunicamycine, and 50 μg/ml nikkomycin and incubated in a final volume of 100 μl with 3–6 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc for 60–90 min at 30 °C. Plasmids and Plasmid Construction—A pUPRE expressing lacZ from an artificial promoter containing UPRE was obtained from Dr. Ralph Menzel, Berlin (32Menzel R. Vogel F. Kargel E. Schunck W.H. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1211-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For Fig. 10A we used multicopy TOp2141, TOp662, or YEp24 containing PSD1, ECM33, or no insert that all were contributed by Dr. Akio Toh-e (33Toh-e A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 2002; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). pBF111 containing GPI7 with a deletion of amino acids 192–321 was constructed by opening pBF43 (YCplac33 containing GPI7 behind its own promoter) with SmaI and BssHII. The gap was filled with the EcoRV-BssHII fragment excised from the same plasmid, pBF43. pBF112 containing GPI7 with a deletion of amino acids 54–191 was generated by opening pBF43 with PflMI, blunting with Klenow polymerase, and then cutting with BssHII. The thus generated gap was filled with a SmaI-BssHII fragment from pBF43. pBF113 was constructed by amplifying the N-terminal part of Gpi7p by PCR using primers 5′-agacgttcaacaaattgatatcgt-3′ and 5′-cgcgACGCGTACCGGTcaaaagaggataattataatttgt-3′ having restriction sites MluI and AgeI (uppercase). The last 39 amino acids of Wbp1p (including its transmembrane domain and the KKXX motif), the stop codon plus the transcription terminator were amplified with primers 5′-cgcgACGCGTACCGGTtcttgggtttatattagcgccattt-3′ and 5′-cgcggaattcgagctcGGTACCccttaatacaaactgcaaaagagttt-3′. The two PCR fragments were cut with MluI and EcoRV and MluI and KpnI, respectively, and ligated into pBF43 opened with EcoRV and KpnI. pBF114 was constructed by amplifying nucleotides 409–1197 of GPI7 with primers 5′-tggCTGCAGcagttcatccaacata-3′ and 5′-gGTTTAAACGGTACCttacaattcatcgtgtgcagacttggttaacgtttcttga-3′. The PCR fragment was cut with PstI and KpnI and inserted into pBF43 opened with the same two enzymes. To obtain multicopy plasmids, the XhoI-KpnI fragments of pBF111, pBF112, pBF113, pBF114, and pBF43 were transferred into YEplac195, which was opened with SalI (same overhang as XhoI) and KpnI, thus yielding vectors pBF116, pBF117, pBF118, pBF119, and pBF120, respectively. In pBF121, Gpi7p contains an additional 6 amino acids (RSKKHQ) at its C terminus. pBF121 was obtained by amplifying the C terminus of Gpi7p with primers 5′-acttGCGCGCgttttcttccaa-3′ (uppercase is the RS of BssHII) and 5′-TCTATGTTAGTTTGTTTTTTTCGACCTatcaagagcgcaaaggaggg-3′ and amplifying the transcription terminator of GPI7 with primers 5′-AGGTCGAAAAAAACAAACTAAcatagaattgttcacgtggtctaaa-3′ (sequence encoding RSKKHQ in uppercase) and 5′-agtgagtacatGGTACCaccttattat-3′. The two PCR fragments were used as templates for crossed PCR and the final product was cut with BssHII and KpnI and then ligated into pBF43 that was opened in the same way. The multicopy version pBF122 was obtained as described above. Addition of Ethanolamine Phosphate to Man1 Is a Prerequisite for the Addition of Man3 by Gpi10p—During GPI biosynthesis, Man3 is transferred from dolicholphosphomannose to Man2 by PIG-B in mammals and its homologue GPI10 in yeast (11Canivenc-Gansel E.

When treated with the fungal inhibitor YW3548, yeast cells accumulate Man-Man-GlcN-(acyl→)PI and YW3548 has therefore been postulated to be an inhibitor of the EtN-P transferase PIG-N/MCD4 (35Sutterlin C.

This notion was confirmed by the finding that overexpression of MCD4 made yeast cells resistant to YW3548, whereas overexpression of GPI10 had a much smaller, albeit significant effect, especially at low inhibitor concentrations (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35Sutterlin C.

The implication is that Gpi10p cannot add onto Man-Man-GlcN-(acyl→)PI and requires a substrate that contains EtN-P on Man1. This hypothesis, however, was difficult to reconcile with the occurrence of major GPI lipids accumulating in mutants such as smp3 (lipid 3-1-2), gpi11 (lipid 11-2), and gpi13 (part of lipid a) as these lipids contain 3 or 4 mannoses but lack EtN-P on Man1. In this context it was of interest to know the structure of the intermediates accumulating in mcd4 mutants. Several mcd4 mutants had previously been labeled with [3H]inositol but accumulated only very small amounts of Ins-labeled GPI lipids that could not be structurally analyzed (15Gaynor E.C.

https://openalex.org/W2012129187,"We examined the effect of deletion of different segments in the helical subdomain (the so-called “lid”) of the DnaK peptide-binding domain on peptide binding and protein stability. At 25 °C, wt DnaK and the deletion mutant proteins are able to stably bind peptides with similar affinity. However, at physiological (37 °C) and stress (42 °C) temperatures, removal of the N-terminal half of αB and the rest of the lid drastically decreases the ability of the protein to bind substrates. Differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy show that this behavior is accompanied by destabilization of the peptide-binding domain. Our data suggest that the reversible interaction between the lid and β-sandwich subdomains of DnaK peptide-binding domain is required for the stabilization of the loops that form the peptide-binding site, which in turn modulates the protein affinity for peptide substrates. This interaction might have functional implications because it could prevent rebinding of the peptide substrate, which would be forced to fold.

This interaction might have functional implications because it could prevent rebinding of the peptide substrate, which would be forced to fold. DnaK is the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone with both constitutive and stress-induced functions. Among different biological activities, DnaK is engaged in preventing the aggregation of thermally denatured proteins, thus becoming essential for cell viability under heat-shock conditions (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). It consists of two domains, a 45-kDa N-terminal ATPase domain and a 25-kDa C-terminal substrate-binding domain (2Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). The ATPase domain is a bilobed structure that contains the nucleotide-binding site in a channel between the two lobes (3Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding domain is composed of two subdomains, each with characteristic structural and most likely functional properties. The β-sandwich subdomain holds the hydrophobic substrate-binding cavity, and it is followed by an α-helical subdomain that consists of five antiparallel helices (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). This subdomain acts as a lid, folding over the β-sandwich subdomain without contacting the peptide substrate (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar).It has been postulated that during the functional cycle of DnaK, the protein adopts two conformational states, one with high affinity for the peptide substrate, which maintains the substrate locked in the binding cavity, and another one consisting of an open conformation in which the lid is displaced, leaving the binding cavity uncapped (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Peptide dissociation would require the destabilization of the DnaK substrate complex and thus the weakening of the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize it in a polar environment.The role of the lid in the functional cycle of DnaK is far from being understood. It has been shown that it is not involved in interdomain coupling (5Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), although the lid is essential in maintaining long-lived substrate-DnaK complexes, because in its absence, ATP-induced peptide dissociation is significantly accelerated (6Buczynski G. Slepenkov S.V. Sehorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12224-12235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this context, a recent work indicates that helix D is engaged in maintaining stable DnaK-peptide complexes, and that helix E and the last 31 residues at the C terminus might contact the ATPase domain (8Slepenkov S.V. Patchen B. Peterson K.M. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5867-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding that helix A and the C-terminal half of helix B are involved in interdomain communication (9Moro F. Fernandez V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) points to the importance of the lid subdomain in maintaining the functionality of DnaK. Besides these functions, it has also been proposed that the lid of DnaK and other Hsp70 proteins might interact with DnaJ (10Qian X. Hou W. Zhengang L. Sha B. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The interaction between the two subdomains of the substrate peptide-binding domain is stabilized through a network of hydrogen bonds and several salt bridges (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The structural and functional consequences of these interactions are unknown. It has been reported that the overall fold of the β-sandwich is not significantly modified in the absence of the lid, although the above mentioned interactions seem to stabilize the conformation of the loops that build the substrate-binding site (5Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Stevens S.Y. Cai S. Pellecchia M. Zuiderweg E.R. Prot. Sci. 2003; 12: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following this suggestion, the role of the lid subdomain in maintaining the ability of the protein to stably bind substrates at physiologically relevant temperatures has been analyzed using several deletion mutants (Fig. 1). Our data indicate that the interactions between the lid and the β-subdomain are responsible for the ability of the protein to bind peptide substrates at physiological (37 °C) and stress (42 °C) temperatures. A mechanism is proposed in which the displacement of the lid coupled to the destabilization of the substrate-binding site upon ATP binding might weaken the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the complex, so that the peptide would be efficiently released to a polar medium and substrate rebinding would be prevented.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—DnaK and the deletion mutants were expressed in the BB1553 strain and purified as described (9Moro F. Fernandez V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).ATPase Activity—Steady-state ATPase activity was measured as in Ref. 9Moro F. Fernandez V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Assays were performed in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 11 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, and 5 μm DnaK. Reactions were monitored at 30 °C measuring the absorbance decay at 340 nm for 30 min in a Cary spectrophotometer (Varian). In the peptide stimulation assays, NRLLLTG (NR) 1The abbreviations used are: NR, NRLLLTG peptide; peptide F-APPY, fluorescein-CALLQSRLLLSAPRRAAATARY; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; IR, infrared; wt, wild-type. peptide was added at 500 μm concentration.Peptide Binding—Peptide binding was carried out in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm ADP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fluorescein-CALLQSRLLLSAPRRAAATARY (peptide F-APPY) and DnaK concentrations were 35 nm and 1 μm, respectively, to ensure 100% binding at 25 °C. Binding was started by the addition of F-APPY to the protein solution thermostated at the desired temperature. Fluorescence anisotropy was continuously measured on an SLM8100 spectrofluorometer (Aminco) with excitation at 492 nm, emission at 516 nm, and 8 nm excitation and emission slit widths.Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Differential scanning calorimetry was performed in a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Prior to DSC experiments, samples were dialyzed against 25 mm glycine, pH 9.0. Sample and reference solutions were properly centrifuged to remove protein aggregates, degassed, and loaded into the calorimeter. Experiments were carried out under positive pressure to avoid degassing during heating. Protein concentration was 1–2 mg/ml, and the scan rate was 60 °C/h. The calorimetric data were analyzed using Origin software provided with the calorimeter.Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy—Purified proteins were concentrated on Centricon-30 (Amicon) filters, and the medium was exchanged with deuterated buffer (25 mm Na borate, pD 8.6 (pD = pH + 0.4)) through concentration and dilution steps, reaching a final protein concentration of 15–20 mg/ml. For the same experiments in aqueous buffer, proteins were extensively dialysed against 25 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, and concentrated on Microcon-30 (Amicon) filters to 30–40 mg/ml. The filtrates obtained in the last concentration step were used as references. Samples were placed in a thermostated cell, between two calcium fluoride windows separated by 50 μm (D2O) or 6 μm (H2O) spacers. Infrared spectra were recorded in a Nicolet Magna spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. Data acquisition and analysis were performed as described previously (12Arrondo J.L. Castresana J. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11650-11655Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Temperature was controlled by a thermocouple in direct contact with the windows.RESULTSFunctionality of the Different DnaK Variants: ATPase Activity—To investigate the functionality of the mutants, the steady-state and peptide-stimulated ATPase activities were determined. The ATPase activity of the DnaK1–554 mutant (0.42 mol ATP (mol protein)–1 min–1) was higher than those of wt DnaK and the other deletion mutants, which were found to be similar to the published value of 0.12 mol ATP (mol protein)–1 min–1 (9Moro F. Fernandez V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This result might be caused by a cis-interaction of hydrophobic residues at the C-terminal half of helix B with the peptide-binding site, as was shown recently for a similar construct (8Slepenkov S.V. Patchen B. Peterson K.M. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5867-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DnaK1–554 was stimulated only 2-fold by NR, because of its high basal activity, in contrast to the 5-fold activation observed for wt DnaK, DnaK1–537, and DnaK1–507. Despite this difference, the activity of the peptide-induced activated state was similar for all of the proteins (0.62 mol ATP (mol protein)–1 min–1).Peptide Substrate Binding: Effect of Temperature—The binding kinetics of a fluorescently labeled peptide to wt DnaK and to the above-mentioned deletion mutants were followed at different temperatures. To choose the appropriate experimental conditions, the affinity of each protein variant for peptide F-APPY was estimated as described previously (13Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). At 25 °C, the estimated dissociation constants (Kd) were 0.11, 0.24, and 0.20 μm, for wt DnaK, DnaK1–537, and DnaK1–507, respectively. Therefore, protein and peptide concentrations were fixed so that more than 95% of the peptide was bound at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), F-APPY binding to wt DnaK was faster at higher temperatures.Fig. 2DnaK1–537 and DnaK1–507 have impaired binding activities at 37 °C and 42 °C. A, F-APPY binding kinetics of DnaK (upper panel) and DnaK1–507 (lower panel) at 25, 37, and 42 °C. Binding was carried out in the presence of 0.5 mm ADP to avoid thermal denaturation of DnaK ATPase domain (14Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding was initiated by addition of F-APPY (35 nm final concentration) to a thermostated solution of protein (1 μm). B, anisotropy increment at the saturation plateau for DnaK, DnaK1–537, and DnaK1–507 at 25, 37, and 42 °C, respectively. Values were obtained after fitting the experimental data to single exponential curves. C, the temperature-induced inhibition of substrate binding to DnaK1–507 is reversible. 1 μm DnaK1–507 and 35 nm F-APPY were incubated at 25 °C for 45 min to achieve maximum binding. Temperature was then raised to 42 °C and lowered again to 25 °C after 15 min by using a water bath. Similar results were obtained for DnaK1–537.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Unfortunately, DnaK1–554 could not be included in this type of experiments, because the high peptide concentration required to displace part of the lid from the peptide-binding site hampers data analysis. Both DnaK1–537 (data not shown) and DnaK1–507 (Fig. 2A, bottom panel) bound F-APPY faster than DnaK at 25 °C, as reported previously for lidless mutants (6Buczynski G. Slepenkov S.V. Sehorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, their ability to bind the peptide was significantly reduced at physiological temperatures (37 °C) and almost abolished at heat-shock temperatures (42 °C) (Fig. 2, A and B). The conformational change responsible for the temperature-induced decrease in the F-APPY affinity of these mutants was reversible, because heating the samples from 25 to 42 °C promoted peptide dissociation, and cooling them back to 25 °C completely restored peptide binding (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data indicate that the lid is an important structural element to stabilize the DnaK-peptide complex against the thermal challenge.Protein Stability and Conformation: DSC Studies—The wt DnaK thermogram showed three endotherms centered at 43.5, 57.5, and 74 °C (Fig. 3A; Table I). Although the first and second peaks have been associated with the unfolding of the 45-kDa N-terminal, ATPase domain and of the 25-kDa substrate-binding domain, respectively, the high temperature transition contains contributions from both protein domains (14Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic parameters derived from the DSC profiles of wt DnaK agree very well with previously reported data (Table I; Ref. 14Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletion of 85 residues at the C terminus of the protein, corresponding to helices C–E and the last 31 unresolved residues (DnaK1–554), slightly modified the temperature and enthalpy of the low temperature transitions. However, it decreased substantially the enthalpy of the high temperature peak (Fig. 3B; Table I). The latter effect was also observed in the DnaK1–537 mutant, in which the C-terminal half of αB (residues 539–554) was deleted (Fig. 3C). The thermogram corresponding to this mutant showed in addition a decrease in the temperature of the second transition (ΔT = 4.7 °C), with a 30% reduction in the denaturation enthalpy (Table I). The denaturation enthalpy of this transition was further reduced in the DnaK1–507 mutant (Fig. 3D; Table I). The thermal unfolding profile of the ATPase domain showed two endotherms centered at 47.5 and 75.8 °C (Fig. 3E; Table I), as reported previously (14Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Thermal stability of wt DnaK and deletion mutants.

Open table in a new tab IR Spectroscopy: Assignment of the Amide I Band Components—IR spectroscopy has been shown to be a useful tool to characterize both the conformational properties and stability of proteins (15Barth A. Zscherp C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 369-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 16Arrondo J.L. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the IR spectra of wt DnaK and its deletion mutants with the aim of assigning the major spectral features. The original and deconvolved IR spectra of wt DnaK in H2O and D2O buffers at 20 °C are shown in Fig. 4A. The original spectra displayed the absorption maximum at 1650 and 1640 cm–1 in H2O and D2O buffer, respectively. These findings, and the fact that the intensity of the amide II band at 1550 cm–1, due mainly to N-H bending vibrations, was drastically reduced upon deuteration, are in good agreement with previous studies (17Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overlapping bands within the amide I band (1700–1600 cm–1) can be resolved by deconvolution of the original spectra. The deconvolved spectra showed several components that can be assigned to turns (H2O, 1673 and 1668 cm–1; D2O, 1678 and 1668 cm–1), α-helix (1650 cm–1), and extended structures (1688 and 1629 cm–1). The most interesting deuteration-sensitive spectral feature was the change in the relative intensities of the components at 1650 and 1640 cm–1. This behavior could be due to aperiodic structures such as loops (18Taneva S.G. Kaiser U. Donchev A.A. Dimitrov M.I. Mantele W. Muga A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9640-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Galan A. Sot B. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Muga A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7219-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Considering the x-ray structure of the ATPase and substrate-binding domains, both possibilities might actually occur, and progressive deletion of the α and β subdomains of the peptide-binding domain should help to distinguish between these alternatives. Thus the IR spectra of DnaK1–507 and of the ATPase domain (DnaK 1–385) were characterized in H2O and D2O buffers (Fig. 4B). As compared with wt DnaK, the DnaK1–507 spectra recorded in either solvent were similar regarding the number and position of the component bands. However, the intensity ratio of the band components at 1650/1640 decreased in H2O (from 0.7 to 0.4) and increased in D2O (from 0.8 to 1.4) buffer upon lid deletion. This result indicates that the helical structure forming the C terminus of the DnaK peptide-binding domain contributes to the absorbance at 1650 and 1640 cm–1 in H2O and D2O, respectively, a behavior characteristic of solvent-exposed helical conformations. Following a similar comparison strategy between DnaK and the ATPase domain, it is clear that the β-sandwich subdomain that holds the substrate-binding pocket is the main structure responsible for the band components at 1688 and 1629 cm–1, because its deletion eliminates these vibrations from the spectrum (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4IR spectroscopy.

The IR spectrum corresponding to the thermally denatured protein recorded at 82 °C showed a broad band at 1646 cm–1 and a shoulder at 1676 cm–1 (Fig. 5A). Although the former indicated the presence of unordered structures, the latter arose from turns remaining in the denatured structure. Similar band components have been described for thermally denatured RNase (21Fabian H. Schultz C. Naumann D. Landt O. Hahn U. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and plastocyanin (18Taneva S.G. Kaiser U. Donchev A.A. Dimitrov M.I. Mantele W. Muga A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9640-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We did not observe aggregation of the thermally unfolded protein as in a previous work (17Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most likely because of the different experimental conditions (pH 9.0) and to the significantly lower protein concentration used in this study. Positive and negative features in the temperature-induced IR difference spectra reflected fine structural differences between conformations obtained at consecutive temperatures (every 1–2 °C) during the heating procedure (Fig. 5B). In the 20–52 °C temperature range, when (according to DSC data) the ATPase domain unfolds, differential signals at 1676(+)/1653(–) and 1640(–)/1629(+) were observed above 38 °C, indicating a temperature-induced change in the protein secondary structure. The former is probably caused by the unfolding of the peripheral helical conformation of the ATPase domain, which could convert at least partially into turns, and the latter may be related to solvent exchange in the core β-strands of this domain. This interpretation is supported by the presence of a negative band at 1550 cm–1, arising from unexchanged NH groups of the protein, in the same temperature interval. The difference spectra obtained in the 52–64 °C temperature range, at which peptide-binding domain denatures according to DSC, showed a broad differential signal at 1673(+)/1640(–) (Fig. 5B). The upward position of the positive component of this differential signal indicated that this conformational change is not due to solvent exchange, as reflected by the absence of a negative signal at 1550 cm–1. Both solvent-exposed helical or loop conformations could contribute to the observed absorbance change at 1640 cm–1. However, a predominant contribution from helical elements can be excluded, considering that the thermal unfolding of wt DnaK did not show a pronounced change in the ellipticity value at 222 nm in the same temperature range (22Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5279-5285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in the 64–80 °C interval (Fig. 5B), the difference spectra showed a feature at 1665(+)/1629(–), representing mainly the unfolding of the remaining β-structure.Fig. 5Temperature-induced difference IR spectra of DnaK.

Deconvolution was performed as in Fig. 4. Protein concentration was 20 mg/ml. B, difference IR spectra of DnaK. The sample in deuterated buffer was heated from 20 to 82 °C, at 60 °C/h, and spectra were recorded every 1–2 °C during the process. Infrared difference spectra were obtained by subtracting two original spectra recorded at consecutive temperatures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To compare in an easier way the results obtained with wt DnaK and the different deletion mutants, the intensities of four differential signals (1650, 1640, 1629, and 1550 cm–1) were represented as a function of temperature (Fig. 6). These profiles revealed three temperature intervals at which variations of the above-mentioned intensities occurred. These intervals correspond rather closely to the three endotherms detected by DSC. The four differential signals underwent changes in the temperature interval corresponding to the denaturation of the ATPase domain (38–52 °C). At intermediate and high temperatures, only the 1640 and 1629 cm–1 differential signals were significantly affected (Fig. 6A). The 1640 cm–1 signal was of particular interest because, as shown above, it arises from both solvent-exposed α-helices at the lid subdomain and loops from the peptide-binding domain. Denaturation of the lid subdomain took place in the 64–80 °C temperature range, because its deletion induced the disappearance of the absorbance changes at 1640 cm–1 (Fig. 6, A–C). We should note that a resolved differential signal at 1640 cm–1 is not clearly observed in Fig. 5B for wt DnaK because of overlapping with the more intense differential band at 1629 cm–1. The remaining contributions from loop structures to the 1640 cm–1 signal were observed in the 52–64 °C temperature range (Fig. 6A), as was the endotherm corresponding to the denaturation of the peptide-binding domain. Although deletion of αC–E and the last 31 residues did not significantly modify this signal (Fig. 6, A and B), removal of αA-B downshifted this spectral feature, which merged with those originating from the unfolding of the ATPase domain (Fig. 6C), in good agreement with DSC data. Similar results were observed for DnaK1–537 (not shown). These findings reinforced the idea that the interaction between both subdomains of the peptide-binding domain stabilized loop conformations against the thermal challenge. When the same data were analyzed for the ATPase domain, it was evident that the high temperature transition monitored by the 1629 cm–1 signal disappeared (Fig. 6D) and, therefore, it was assigned to denaturation of the β-sandwich.Fig. 6Temperature dependence of selected infrared differential signals. Intensities of differential signals at 1550 (▵), 1629 (□), 1640 (▾), and 1650 (○) cm–1 for DnaK (A), DnaK1–554 (B), DnaK1–507 (C), and DnaK ATPase domain (D), as a function of temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONBesides other biological functions, DnaK binds and prevents aggregation of polypeptide substrates under stress conditions and during protein folding (1Hartl F.U.

The binding site of DnaK consists of a hydrophobic cavity, which accommodates a single hydrophobic side chain, formed by two pairs of inner and outer loops that protrude from the β-sandwich, and an arch formed by residues Met-404 and Ala-429 (4Zhu X.

Here we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in association with cyclin A or cyclin E directly binds to β-catenin. In vivo and in vitro kinase assays with cyclin-CDK2 demonstrate β-catenin phosphorylation on residues Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45. This phosphorylation promotes rapid degradation of cytosolic β-catenin via the β-TrCP-mediated proteasome pathway. Moreover, cyclin E-CDK2 contributes to rapid degradation of cytosolic β-catenin levels during G1 phase by regulating β-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. In this way, CDK2 may “fine tune” β-catenin levels over the course of the cell cycle. β-Catenin functions as a downstream component of the Wnt/Wingless signal transduction pathway, and inappropriate control of cytosolic β-catenin is a crucial step in the genesis of several human cancers.

It thus appears that fine control of β-catenin levels probably contributes to the maintenance of a normal cell cycle. It is noteworthy in that regard that levels of cytosolic β-catenin fluctuate over the course of the cell cycle, increasing during S phase, peaking in late G2/M phase, and then abruptly declining in G1 phase (30Olmeda D. Castel S. Vilaro S. Cano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2844-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for this oscillation in β-catenin levels remains unknown, however.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells (e.g. cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 promote progression from G1 phase into and through S phase) (32Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 33Sherr C.J.

The presence of the RXL motif in the primary sequence of β-catenin suggests that it, too, is a substrate for the cyclin-CDK2 complex.

For protein purification, β-catenin was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), after which site-directed mutants P1 (S33Y), P2 (S33Y/S37A), and P3 (S33Y/S37A/S41A) were generated from pGEX-4T-1-β-catenin using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purification of recombinant proteins was carried out as described (40Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using pGEX-4T-1-β-catenin and site-directed mutants. Baculovirus-produced cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2 were gifts from Dr. Boris Sarcevic (41Sarcevic B. Mawson A. Baker R.T. Sutherland R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia).Antibodies and Reagents—The following Abs were used for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry according to standard protocols: anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-β-catenin (Ser33/Ser37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-β-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GFP (Clontech), and anti-N-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories). Abs against cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2, and cyclin D1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). LiCl was purchased from Sigma. Histone H1, CDK2 inhibitory peptides, roscovitine, and MG-132 were from Calbiochem.Cell Cultures and Transfections—HeLa, Rat-1, and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized by the addition of empty pCMV vector.In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—[35S]Met-labeled CDK2, β-catenin or β-catenin deletion mutants were synthesized using a coupled transcription-translation TNT system (Promega). GST and GST fusion protein (8 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with in vitro translated proteins in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors mix) for 4 h at 4 °C. After five washes with binding buffer, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. GST binding experiments were then carried out as described above, except that 500 μg of cell extract was used instead of the in vitro translated products. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting.Cell Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cell fractionation was carried out as described (42Giarre M. Semenov M.V. Brown A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using subconfluent cells. The resultant supernatants were analyzed as the cytosolic lysates. For immunoprecipitation, subconfluent cells were extracted for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), after which the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.For co-immunoprecipitation in vivo, 800 μg of cell extract were incubated with 4 μl of anti-CDK2, anti-cyclin E, or anti-cyclin A Ab or 2 μl of anti-β-catenin Ab at 4 °C for 4 h. The resultant immune complexes were then immobilized on protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times with extraction buffer. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in an 8 or 10% acrylamide gel, after which Western blots were probed with the indicated Abs. Primary Abs were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences).For analyzing β-catenin phosphorylation in vivo, subconfluent cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and boiled for 5 min. The lysates were passed several times through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were diluted into 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-β-catenin Ab.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Kinase assays were carried out as described (43Zhang T. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29702-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using CDK2 immune complexes from Rat-1 extracts, baculovirus-produced cyclin A-CDK2 (20 units), and cyclin E-CDK2 (20 units) from Dr. Boris Sarcevic (41Sarcevic B. Mawson A. Baker R.T. Sutherland R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For autoradiography, aliquots (2 μg) of purified GST-β-catenin, GST-β-catenin point mutant or histone H1 were used as substrates. For immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-β-catenin Abs, aliquots (200 ng) of purified GST-β-catenin or GST-β-catenin point mutant were used as substrates.Cell Synchronization and Cell Cycle Analysis—To synchronize Rat-1 cells at the G1 or early S phase, subconfluent cells were cultured in the presence of 50 nm rapamycin (Calbiochem) for 18 h or 2 μg/ml aphidicolin (Calbiochem) for 18 h. The DNA content of cells was determined by analyzing parallel cultures using flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was carried out as described (31Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).RESULTSCyclin-CDK2 Interacts with β-Catenin—In order to identify cell cycle regulators interacting with β-catenin, we mixed bacterially produced GST-β-catenin with cell extracts and then identified the bound proteins by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, cyclin A and E were found to preferentially bind to β-catenin. Because both are known to associate with CDK2, the membrane was also probed with anti-CDK2 Ab, which indeed revealed the presence of CDK2 (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the detected CDK2 were interacting directly with β-catenin, we assessed the ability of GST-β-catenin to bind in vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled CDK2. Fig. 1B shows that GST-β-catenin bound CDK2, whereas GST alone did not, suggesting that β-catenin associates with cyclin A-CDK2 and/or cyclin E-CDK2 complexes in vitro. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays carried out using HEK293T and Rat-1 fibroblast cells (Fig. 1C) confirmed that complexes containing β-catenin, cyclins, and CDK2 also exist in vivo.The RXL motif is required for stable binding of cyclin-CDK2 complexes to substrates (34Adams P.D.

We showed this also to be true for β-catenin by testing the ability of a series of deletion mutants to interact with CDK2 (Fig. 1D). Mutants BD2, BD3, and BD4, which all contained RXL motifs, were all able to bind GST-CDK2 (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, BD1, which was composed of the N terminus of β-catenin and lacked an RXL motif, did not bind GST-CDK2 (Fig. 1D).Cyclin-CDK2 Phosphorylates β-catenin on Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45—We next determined the extent to which β-catenin is phosphorylated by cyclin-CDK2 in vitro. Anti-CDK2 Ab was used to immunopurify cyclin-CDK2 complexes from Rat-1 cells, after which we examined the ability of the isolated complexes to phosphorylate purified GST-β-catenin or histone H1, a known CDK2 substrate in the presence of either with 50 μm roscovitine (a CDK2 inhibitor) (44Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) or with Me2SO (the vehicle). CDK2 immune complexes from Rat-1 cells in the presence of Me2SO efficiently phosphorylated both GST-β-catenin and histone H1, whereas their phosphorylation was dramatically inhibited in the presence of roscovitine (Fig. 2A). To identify the specific CDK2-associated cyclin responsible for phosphorylating β-catenin, we carried out in vitro kinase assays with purified recombinant cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2 and found that β-catenin was phosphorylated efficiently by cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2. Thus, β-catenin proteins can serve as substrates for cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2 (Fig. 2B). We then carried out in vitro kinase assay to reveal whether the cyclin-CDK2 complex associated with β-catenin retain kinase activity. In vitro kinase assays results showed that the cyclin-CDK2 complex interacting with β-catenin has the kinase activity, and histone H1 phosphorylation was mediated by a β-catenin-associated cyclin-CDK2 complex, but not by GSK-3β, since the effect was completely blocked by roscovitine, whereas LiCl had no effect (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Cyclin-CDK2 phosphorylates β-catenin in vitro. A, recombinant GST-β-catenin (2 μg, gel 1), GST (2 μg, gel 2), or histone H1 (2 μg, gel 3) were incubated with CDK2 immune complex from Rat-1. The in vitro kinase reactions using [γ-32P]ATP were carried out either in the presence (+) or absence (–) of 50 μm roscovitine, a CDK2 inhibitor. The amount of CDK2 immune complex was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis using anti-CDK2 Ab (gel 4). B, GST-β-catenin (2 μg) or histone H1 (2 μg) was incubated with purified cyclin E-CDK2 complex (20 units) or cyclin A-CDK2 complex (20 units), after which in vitro kinase reactions were carried out. C, β-catenin was immunoprecipitated and incubated with histone H1 (2 μg), after which in vitro kinase reactions using [γ-32P]ATP were carried out either in the presence (+) or absence (–) of 20 mm LiCl, a GSK-3β inhibitor, or 50 μm roscovitine, a CDK2 inhibitor (top panel). The amount of β-catenin immune complex was determined by immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblot analysis using anti-β-catenin Ab (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To reveal whether cyclin-CDK2-mediated phosphorylation occurs at residues known to be targets of GSK3β (Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45), we performed in vitro kinase assay using purified cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, GST-β-catenin, and cold ATP. The phosphorylation was analyzed by validated phospho-β-catenin Abs (45Amit S. Hatzubai A. Birman Y. Andersen J.S. Ben-Shushan E. Mann M. Ben-Neriah Y. Alkalay I.

As shown in Fig. 3A, we found that phosphorylation occurred at Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 residues on β-catenin.Fig. 3β-Catenin is phosphorylated on Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 by cyclin-CDK2 in vitro and in vivo. A, GST-β-catenin (200 ng) was incubated with purified cyclin A-CDK2 or cyclin E-CDK2 (20 units) in the presence (+) or absence (–) of ATP, after which the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-33/37/41- or anti-phospho-41/45-β-catenin Ab. B, wild type β-catenin and β-catenin point mutants P1 (S33Y), P2 (S33Y/S37A), and P3 (S33Y/S37A/T41A) are shown; the asterisks (*) indicate the substituted amino acids. C, purified cyclin A-CDK2 complex was incubated with recombinant wild type β-catenin, P1, P2, or P3 (2 μg) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by autoradiography. D, purified cyclin A-CDK2 complex was incubated with recombinant wild type β-catenin, P1, P2, or P3 (200 ng) in the presence of cold ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-33/37/41- or anti-phospho-41/45-β-catenin Ab. E, Rat-1 cells were incubated with or without 5 μm CDK2 inhibitory peptides for 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-33/37/41-β-catenin (gel 1), anti-phospho-41/45-β-catenin (gel 3), anti-β-catenin (gels 2 and 4), or CDK2 Ab (gel 6). Endogenous CDK2 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from CDK2-inhibitory peptides-pretreated or untreated Rat-1 cells and then immunoblotted with anti-β-catenin Ab (gel 5). F, HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with an internal control (pEGFP) and the indicated DNAs (empty vector, cyclin A-CDK2, or cyclin E-CDK2), followed by treatment with 20 μm MG-132 for 2 h. β-Catenin was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-33/37/41- or anti-phospho-41/45-β-catenin Ab. The band density was quantified by densitometry and normalized to the amount of β-catenin immunoprecipitates. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP Ab for transfection efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the identity of the cyclin-CDK2 phosphorylation sites in β-catenin, three β-catenin point mutants were generated in which one (P1 (S33Y)), two (P2 (S33Y/S37A)) or three (P3 (S33Y/S37A/T41A)) potential phosphorylation sites were substituted (Fig. 3B). We then carried out in vitro kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP to assess phosphorylation of the mutants and found that the intensity of the respective autoradiograms for P1, P2, and P3 declined in that order (Fig. 3C), supporting the idea that Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are phosphorylation sites on β-catenin. In parallel experiments, anti-phospho-33/37/41-β-catenin Ab detected wild type (WT) β-catenin as well as P1 and P2, but not P3, whereas anti-phospho-41/45-β-catenin Ab recognized all four proteins (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that cyclin-CDK2 phosphorylates β-catenin on residues Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 in vitro.To determine whether CDK2 activity is responsible for β-catenin phosphorylation in vivo, Rat-1 cells were treated with CDK2-inhibitory peptides, which bind to CDK2 at or near its active site (48Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 49Cohen B.A. Colas P. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed, CDK2 inhibitory peptides inhibited the association between CDK2 and β-catenin (Fig. 3E, gel 5) and suppressed β-catenin phosphorylation on residues Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 in vivo (Fig. 3E, gels 1 and 3). To confirm whether cyclin-CDK2 phosphorylates the same residues in vivo, we transfected HEK293T cells with empty vector (control), cyclin A-CDK2, or cyclin E-CDK2, after which phosphorylation of β-catenin was examined using anti-phospho-33/37/41- or anti-phospho-41/45-β-catenin Ab (Fig. 3F). Overexpression of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 enhanced phosphorylation of β-catenin on all four residues (Fig. 3F), indicating that cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 might be implicated in phosphorylation on residues Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 in vivo.Cyclin-CDK2 Down-regulates Cytosolic β-Catenin—To determine the extent to which phosphorylation by cyclin-CDK2 facilitates degradation of cytosolic β-catenin, we transfected HEK293T cells with WT β-catenin along with cyclin A-CDK2 or cyclin E-CDK2, after which cytosolic lysates from the transfectants were analyzed by immunoblotting. Overexpression of WT β-catenin led to increased levels of cytosolic β-catenin; however, cytosolic WT β-catenin was then efficiently down-regulated by cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2 (Fig. 4A), whereas β-catenin S37A was largely resistant to cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that degradation of cytosolic β-catenin is dependent on its phosphorylation by cyclin-CDK2.Fig. 4Cyclin-CDK2 down-regulates cytosolic β-catenin. A, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated DNAs and pEGFP vector (250 ng) as an internal transfection efficiency control. Cytosolic lysates were immunoblotted with anti-β-catenin or anti-GFP Ab. B, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with cyclin A-CDK2 or cyclin E-CDK2 (100 ng) and WT β-catenin or its S37A mutant (600 ng). pEGFP vector (250 ng) was used as an internal transfection efficiency control. Cytosolic lysates were immunoblotted with anti-β-catenin or anti-GFP Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cyclin-CDK2 Down-regulates β-Catenin via the β-TrCP-mediated Proteasome Pathway—Phosphorylated β-catenin is known to be subject to ubiquitination, which is reflected in the accumulation of high molecular weight species (7Ikeda S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). To determine whether cyclins-CDK2-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin proceeds via the ubiquitin/proteasome system, Rat-1 cells were treated with MG-132, a 26 S proteasome inhibitor, and/or roscovitine, after which the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-β-catenin or anti-phospho-33/37/41-β-catenin Ab. Treatment with MG-132 led to the accumulation of high molecular weight β-catenin species detectable by both Abs, indicating ubiquitination of the phosphorylated protein (Fig. 5A). The necessity for phosphorylation was confirmed by the finding that accumulation of high molecular weight β-catenin species was dramatically diminished by treatment with roscovitine (Fig. 5A). That β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination was the pathway via which β-catenin is degraded was confirmed by the observation that expression of a dominant-negative β-TrCP F-box deletion mutant able to bind to phosphorylated β-catenin, but unable to form a SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex (17Hart M.

We now report that G protein-coupled receptors can themselves undergo regulated metalloproteinase-dependent shedding. The N-terminal exodomain of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor for thrombin, displayed regulated shedding in endothelial cells, which normally express this receptor. Cleavage occurred at a site predicted to render the receptor unresponsive to thrombin. A chimeric protein in which the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 was fused to an unrelated transmembrane segment was shed as efficiently as PAR1, shedding of both proteins was stimulated by phorbol ester and by a PAR1 agonist. TNFα protease inhibitor-2 (TAPI-2), phenanthroline, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) but not TIMP-1 or -2 inhibited such shedding. These and other data suggest that the information that specifies PAR1 shedding resides within its N-terminal exodomain rather than its heptahelical segment, that activation of protein kinase C or of PAR1 itself can stimulate PAR1 shedding in trans, and that ADAM17/TACE or a metalloproteinase with similar properties mediates PAR1 shedding. Regulated shedding reduced the amount of cell surface PAR1 available for productive cleavage by thrombin by half or more, but thus far we have been unable to demonstrate an effect of PAR1 shedding on cellular responsiveness to thrombin.

PAR1 is the main thrombin receptor in human platelets and probably plays an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis (14Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 15Hung D.T. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 1350-1353Google Scholar). PAR1 is also the main thrombin receptor on vascular endothelial cells, and activation of endothelial PAR1 by thrombin and related proteases triggers a host of signaling responses that may participate in inflammation and contribute to embryonic development (16Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1656-1661Google Scholar, 17Ueno A. Murakami K. Yamanouchi K. Watanabe M. Kondo T.

Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1666-1670Google Scholar). In the course of beginning to probe the signaling pathways by which PAR1 controls the shedding of other cell surface proteins, we noted that a chimeric protein in which the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 was used to tether alkaline phosphatase (AP) to the cell membrane displayed regulated shedding. The possibility that the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 might be subject to shedding in the context of the receptor itself was of interest given the mechanism by which PAR1 is normally activated (Fig. 1A). Thrombin recognizes and cleaves the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 between Arg41 and Ser42. This cleavage event generates a new receptor N terminus that serves as a tethered peptide ligand that docks with the receptor heptahelical segment to cause transmembrane signaling and G protein activation (14Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar). In accord with this model, deletion of the PAR1 N-terminal exodomain in a manner that removes the tethered ligand by either mutation or proteolysis renders PAR1 insensitive to thrombin (20Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269Google Scholar, 21Ishii K. Gerszten R. Zheng Y.W. Welsh J.B. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that regulated shedding of the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 by cleavage C-terminal to the tethered ligand might occur and its possible significance for regulation of PAR1 function. Reagents—Phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA), 1,10-phenanthroline, and other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless noted. Human α-thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Peptide SFLLRN was synthesized as a C-terminal amide and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (ANASPEC, San Jose, CA). TAPI-2 was from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Recombinant human TIMPs 1, 2, and 3 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Ecotin, E-64, and pepstatin A were generous gifts from Dr. Charles Craik (University of California, San Francisco). Cells, cell culture media, and supplements were from University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility unless otherwise specified. Antibodies—Rabbit antiserum 1809, “anti-hirudin-like sequence antibody,” was raised against the peptide antigen YEPFWDEEKNESGLTEY (25Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Google Scholar). ATAP2, a mouse monoclonal antibody to PAR1 N-terminal exodomain (26Brass L.F. Vassallo R.J. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Google Scholar), was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-alkaline phosphatase monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat antimouse antibodies were from Bio-Rad, except in assays for detection of soluble native PAR1 N-terminal exodomain by ELISA, in which horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA). Plasmid cDNAs—AP-PAR1 encoded secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) fused to human PAR1 at Ala36 with an intervening linker region containing the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDD). The amino acid sequence of the fusion region reads:... AAHPGLQDYKDDDDVD-ATLDPR↓SFLLR... where the alkaline phosphatase sequence is underlined, (-) marks the linker junction to native PAR1 sequence shown in bold, and (↓) indicates the thrombin cleavage site. Additionally, sequence 5′ of the SEAP Ile18 codon had been replaced with a secretory sequence derived from mast cell growth factor that included a Myc epitope tag. AP-PAR1 cDNA was inserted into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), at HindIII/NotI cloning sites. AP-ATE-CD8 was derived from a previously described PAR1 mutant, ATE-CD8 (27Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Google Scholar). Briefly, ATE-CD8 encodes the FLAG epitope-tagged human PAR1 amino terminal exodomain, up to and including residue Asp91, fused to the extracellular aspect of the CD8 single transmembrane domain at CD8 residue Ile162. To make AP-ATE-CD8, a PCR product beginning at the ATE-CD8 5′-FLAG epitope codon and ending at the stop codon was generated with flanking PvuII and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The PvuII-XbaI fragment was ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector, pCMV/SEAP (Tropix, Bedford, MA) at the HpaI and XbaI restriction sites, resulting in a fusion product containing the entire SEAP coding sequence (excluding the stop codon) joined by a FLAG epitope-containing linker sequence to the PAR1 Ala36 of ATE-CD8. The predicted amino acid sequence of the product is:... AAHPGSDYKDDDDVD-ATLDPR↓SFLLRNPNDKYEPFWEDEEKNESGLTEYRLVSINKSSPLQKQLPAFISED-IYIWA... Labeling is as above for AP-PAR1; the CD8 sequence is italicized. AP-PAR4 was derived from a FLAG epitope-tagged human PAR4 construct in a manner directly analogous to AP-ATE-CD8. A PCR product beginning at the 5′ FLAG epitope codon and ending at the stop codon was generated with flanking PvuII and XbaI restriction sites, and the PvuII-XbaI fragment ligated into pCMV/SEAP as above, resulting in a fusion product containing the SEAP coding sequence (excluding the stop codon) joined by a FLAG epitope-containing linker sequence to PAR4 Val25. The predicted amino acid sequence of the junction is:... AAHPGSDYKDDDDVDAL-VYDESGSTGGGDDSTPSILPAPR↓G-YPGQV...; labeling is as above for AP-PAR1. The sequence of the junctions regions for AP-PAR1, AP-ATE-CD8, and AP-PAR4 were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cells, Cell Culture, and Shedding Assays—All cells were cultured and incubations conducted at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; Clonetics, San Diego, CA), were maintained in Clonetics EGM-2 complete growth media and cultured on gelatin-coated Falcon cell culture 24-well plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Chinese hamster ovary CHO-M1 mutant cells were a generous gift from Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital, New York). The ATE7/CHO cell line stably expressing AP-ATE-CD8 was generated by transfecting wild-type CHO cells with AP-ATE-CD8 cDNA, selecting G418-resistant clones (neo is contained in the AP-ATE-CD8 vector), exposing each to PMA, then screening for the presence of alkaline phosphatase activity in the culture media. CHO-M1 cells, ATE7/CHO cells, and wild-type CHO cells were maintained in F-12 Ham's nutrient mix medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml), and were plated on Falcon Primaria 24-well or 96-well plates. For CHO-M1 mutant and wild-type CHO cell assays, cells were transiently transfected in 24-well plates with LipofectAMINE-PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions 2 days before the assay. To examine shedding, cells were incubated in serum-free medium (for CHO cells, Ham's F-12 with 15 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) overnight. Cells were then washed and further incubated in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of TAPI-2 or other protease inhibitors for 15–20 min prior to the addition of agonist. For endothelial cell assays in which AP-tagged proteins were used, passage 5 or 6 HUVECs at 80–85% confluence in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with AP-PAR1 or AP-ATE-CD8 in antibiotic-free EGM-2 complete growth medium using the polyamine transfection reagent, TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the following day, the cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium (for HUVECs, Clonetics basal EBM-2 media with 15 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 5 h, washed again, and preincubated with inhibitor or control medium alone for 15–20 min prior to the addition of agonist. In all cases, cells were incubated for an additional 45 or 60 min, as indicated, after which conditioned medium was collected, spun at 14,200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, then assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity (see below). To determine the amount of intact “unshed” receptor remaining on the cell surface and available for activation by thrombin after agonist-stimulated shedding, cells were washed three times and then exposed to 10 nm thrombin for an additional 20 min, at which time supernatant was collected and shed product was again measured. To assay shedding of native PAR1, passage 5 or 6 HUVECs were grown to confluence on gelatin-coated 60-mm dishes. The cells were then washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 5 h as described above for transfected HUVECs. Cells were then washed again and incubated in the presence or absence of TAPI-2 for 15–20 min. Agonist or medium alone was then added, and the cells incubated for an additional 60 min, at which time 1.8 ml (of a total 2.2 ml) of conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 14,200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Approximately 1.4 ml of the cleared conditioned medium was concentrated to a volume of ∼150 μl using Microcon Centrifugal filter units with a 3,000-dalton cut-off (Millipore) and assayed for the presence of soluble native PAR1 N-terminal exodomain (see below). Measurement of Shed AP-tagged Product—The amount of alkaline phosphatase shed from the cell surface was determining by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity present in the culture medium of treated cells expressing the AP-tagged proteins (28Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Google Scholar). AP activity was quantified using the Phospha-Light™ chemiluminescent reporter assay for secreted alkaline phosphatase kit (Tropix) and a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. After centrifugation, 50 μl of conditioned medium was added to 150 μl of dilution buffer (0.l m diethanolamine, 1 mm MgCl2) and heated to 65 °C for 30 min (to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase). After briefly cooling the heat-treated sample, 50 μl was added to 50 μl of assay buffer (proprietary mixture of phosphatase inhibitors in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.8, 1 mm MgCl2) and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 5 min, at which time 50 μl of reaction buffer, containing 1.25 mm CPSD (chemiluminescent substrate, disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate), was added, and the sample was analyzed for chemiluminescence. Subpicogram quantities of recombinant AP could be detected by this assay, and the relationship between chemiluminescence and protein was linear from 0.1 pg to at least 10 ng. Activity levels in the experiments presented here generally ranged from 5 pg to 1 ng. Background luminescence from untransfected cells was equivalent to less than 1 pg. Cell Surface Antibody Binding Assay—Binding of anti-hirudin-like sequence and anti-AP antibodies to cells was measured as previously described (25Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Google Scholar) and was dependent upon transfection of cells with AP-ATE-CD8. Wild-type CHO cells were transiently transfected with AP-ATE-CD8 cDNA using LipofectAMINE-PLUS as above 2 days before the assay. Cells were then incubated overnight in serum-free medium, washed twice, and then preincubated for 15–20 min in the presence or absence of TAPI-2 prior to the addition of agonist. After an additional 45 min, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed twice in serum-free medium, incubated with either anti-AP mAb (1:1,000) or anti-hirudin-like sequence (1809) antiserum (1:200) for 1 h, washed three times, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000) for 30 min, and then washed three times (PBS was used for the final rinse). Immediately following the final rinse, the cells were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase substrate 1-Step ABTS (2, 2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Pierce). After 10 min, an aliquot was removed, and the optical density was read at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). ELISA for Shed PAR1 N-terminal Exodomain—To detect shed native PAR1 N-terminal exodomain in conditioned medium, a two-antibody capture and detection method was used. The mouse monoclonal antibody ATAP2, which was raised to a peptide SFLLRNPNDKYEPF corresponding to the 14 residues that constitute the new PAR1 N terminus after thrombin cleavage (26Brass L.F. Vassallo R.J. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Google Scholar) was adsorbed to 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) by incubating plates with antibody (5 μg/ml in PBS) at 4 °C for 48 h. Wells were washed three times and blocked with M199 medium containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1–3 h at room temperature, then washed once more with blocking solution, and incubated with 150 μl of concentrated conditioned medium (see above) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, plates were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0.2 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with anti-hirudin-like sequence (1809) antiserum (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (0.6 μg/ml) for 1 h, and then washed three times (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 was used as diluent for both antibodies). Immediately following the final wash, 1-step ABTS was added to the wells, and optical density was read at 405 nm after ∼30 min. A purified, bacterially expressed recombinant soluble form of the PAR1 N-terminal exodomain in fresh medium was used as a standard to assess the selectivity and sensitivity of this system. The peptide, dubbed ATE-H6, and previously described (21Ishii K. Gerszten R. Zheng Y.W. Welsh J.B. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16435-16440Google Scholar), contained the antigenic regions for both the capture (ATAP2) and detection (anti-hirudin-like sequence) antibodies. The ELISA signal was approximately linear between peptide concentrations of ∼3 and 60 pg/ml, and little signal was obtained in the absence of either the capture antibody or the detection antibody (not shown). To study GPCR-regulated shedding, we generated a number of vectors to direct expression of chimeric proteins in which secreted AP was fused to the extracellular N terminus of a transmembrane protein. Among these was AP-ATE-CD8, a chimeric protein in which secreted alkaline phosphatase was fused to the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1, which was in turn joined to the transmembrane domain of CD8 (Fig. 1). The resulting protein tethered alkaline phosphatase to the cell surface via the PAR1 N-terminal exodomain such that proteolytic cleavage of that domain by thrombin released alkaline phosphatase into the culture medium. AP-ATE-CD8 was intended for use in developing an assay for regulated shedding with thrombin cleavage acting as a positive control. As expected, treatment of CHO cells transfected with AP-ATE-CD8 with 10 nm thrombin led to a rapid increase in soluble alkaline phosphatase activity in the culture medium, with over 90% of cell surface alkaline phosphatase being released within 10 min. Virtually no alkaline phosphatase activity was released from untransfected cells. Surprisingly, we also noted that exposure of AP-ATE-CD8-expressing CHO cells to the protein kinase C activator PMA triggered the appearance of alkaline phosphatase activity in the medium (Fig. 2). The increase in soluble alkaline phosphatase activity was linear for ∼60 min after addition of PMA, and peak activity at this time ranged from 50 to 100% of that released by thrombin. Concentrations of the thrombin inhibitor hirudin that completely blocked thrombin-induced shedding had no effect on PMA-induced shedding (not shown), suggesting that AP-ATE-CD8 was being cleaved by a protease other than thrombin in this system. PMA is known to trigger shedding of the exodomains of integral membrane proteins by a metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism. Indeed, the metalloproteinase inhibitors TAPI-2, 1,10 phenanthroline (1,10-PA), and TIMP-3 blocked PMA-induced shedding and reduced unstimulated shedding of AP-ATE-CD8 (Fig. 2). At the concentrations used in these experiments, neither TAPI-2 nor TIMP-3 had any effect on thrombin-induced shedding (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The serine, cysteine, and aspartyl protease inhibitors ecotin, E-64, and pepstatin A had no effect on PMA-induced shedding (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data suggested that AP-ATE-CD8 was undergoing regulated metal-loproteinase-dependent shedding. In contrast to TIMP-3, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 did not block PMA-induced shedding in this system. This pattern of inhibitor specificity is consistent with the possibility that the metalloproteinase responsible for AP-ATE-CD8 shedding is TACE (30Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Google Scholar). To further test this possibility, we examined shedding in CHO-M1 cells, a CHO variant in which TACE biogenesis is defective (31Borroto A. Ruiz-Paz S. de la Torre T.V. Borrell-Pages M. Merlos-Suarez A. Pandiella A. Blobel C.P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25933-25939Google Scholar). Both AP-ATE-CD8 and AP-PAR1, a construct in which alkaline phosphatase was fused to the N-terminal exodomain of human PAR1 six codons N-terminal to the thrombin cleavage site (Fig. 1), were examined. Basal shedding of AP-ATE-CD8 and AP-PAR1 in CHO-M1 cells was similar to that seen in wild-type CHO cells, but, in contrast to wild-type CHO cells, no PMA-induced shedding was detected in the CHO-M1 line (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Thus the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 can undergo PMA-regulated metalloproteinase-dependent shedding in the context of the full-length receptor just as it does in AP-ATE-CD8, and this may be mediated by TACE or another metalloproteinase with similar inhibitor specificity and similar requirements for proper biogenesis. The site within PAR1 that is recognized and cleaved by thrombin as well as the tethered ligand that triggers transmembrane signaling reside in the sequence LDPR↓ SFLLRNPNDKYEPFWEDEE in the N-terminal exodomain of the receptor. This sequence represents receptor amino acids 38–60; ↓ indicates location of the peptide bond cleaved by thrombin, and SFLLRN is the tethered ligand. To determine whether these functionally important sequences are removed from the receptor during shedding, we examined loss of binding sites for antibodies that recognize the C-terminal portion of this sequence (peptide antigen YEPFWEDEEKNESGLTEYC, the so-called hirudin-like sequence, see “Materials and Methods”). Loss of binding sites for an antibody to AP, which is at the extreme N terminus of the target protein, was determined in parallel. AP-ATE-CD8 was chosen as the target protein because, in contrast to the full-length receptor, it undergoes relatively little internalization in response to either PMA or thrombin activation. Exposure of AP-ATE-CD8-expressing CHO cells to PMA yielded a 70–80% decrease in both AP and hirudin-like sequence binding sites, and both decreases were inhibited by TAPI-2 (Fig. 4). By contrast, exposure to thrombin led to a virtually complete loss of the AP epitope, which is N-terminal to the thrombin cleavage site, but only an ∼45% decrease in hirudin-like sequence binding sites. TAPI-2 had no effect on thrombin-triggered loss of the AP epitope but did partially inhibit thrombin-triggered loss of the hirudin-like sequence epitope. The parallel decrease in the AP and hirudin-like sequence epitopes trigged by PMA, and the parallel inhibition of this decrease by TAPI-2 is consistent with metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of the PAR1 N-terminal exodomain at a site C-terminal to the hirudin-like sequence. By contrast, the greater loss of the AP epitope compared with the hirudin-like sequence epitope in response to thrombin and the insensitivity of this loss of the AP epitope to TAPI-2 is consistent with thrombin cleaving the PAR1 N-terminal exodomain at the known thrombin cleavage site between the AP and hirudin-like sequence epitopes. The partial decrease in surface hirudin-like sequence epitope in response to thrombin may be due to some shedding caused by activation of endogenous thrombin receptors in CHO cells (see below) together with some internalization and/or non-productive cleavage at other sites. These data suggest that metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of the PAR1 N-terminal exodomain occurs between the receptor hirudin-like sequence and the plasma membrane. Because a receptor processed in this manner would lack a tethered ligand, it would be incapable of mediating signaling to thrombin. We next asked whether regulated shedding might be a general property of PAR N-terminal exodomains. A construct analogous to AP-PAR1 was made for the other thrombin receptor, PAR4, which is primarily expressed on platelets. Alkaline phosphatase activity was readily released when cells expressing the AP-PAR4 construct were exposed to thrombin. By contrast, PAR4 exhibited low basal and PMA-induced release of alkaline phosphatase activity compared with PAR1 (expressed as a fraction of the total alkaline phosphatase activity released by thrombin, PAR4 showed basal and PMA-induced shedding of ∼4 and ∼6%, respectively, versus ∼12 and ∼35% for PAR1) (Fig. 5). Given that the N-terminal exodomain o"

Mutants in eight Drosophila genes, designated ninaA through ninaH, are characterized by reduced rhodopsin levels in photoreceptors and altered electroretinograms (1Pak W.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2340-2357Google Scholar). The opsin protein component of rhodopsin is coded by the ninaE gene (2O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L.

The low rhodopsin phenotypes observed in other nina mutants are caused by deficits in the post-translational rhodopsin maturation process. For example, ninaA encodes a molecular chaperone required for movement of newly synthesized rhodopsin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the photosensitive rhabdomeric membranes (4Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Google Scholar, 5Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Google Scholar). In the case of ninaB and ninaD, defective rhodopsin production is the result of a failure to generate the chromophore of rhodopsin, 3-OH retinal (6Stephenson R.S. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N.J.

Plants and microorganisms produce C40 carotenoids such as β-carotene and zeaxanthin, which animals metabolize to C20 retinoids. In Drosophila, the ninaD gene encodes a membrane “scavenger” receptor proposed to mediate the cellular uptake of carotenoids (7Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

It has now been renamed BCO (9von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 251S-256SGoogle Scholar) in light of recent data showing related enzymes act as monooxygenases (10Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 2613-2617Google Scholar). In vertebrates, vitamin A is essential for development and differentiation processes as well as its role in vision. The availability of vitamin A for metabolic processes is governed by multiple factors, including dietary absorption, transport, metabolism, and storage (11Yeum K.J. Russell R.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 483-504Google Scholar). A human BCO is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and also in the kidney, intestine, liver, brain, stomach, and testis (12Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Google Scholar, 13Yan W. Jang G.F. Haeseleer F. Esumi N. Chang J. Kerrigan M. Campochiaro M. Campochiaro P. Palczewski K. Zack D.J. Genomics. 2001; 72: 193-202Google Scholar), suggesting that the processing of dietary carotenoids occurs in a variety of vertebrate tissues. Additional studies show that centric cleavage of β-carotene plays a major role in the processing of carotenoids (14Barua A.B. Olson J.A. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1996-2001Google Scholar, 15Yeum K.J. dos Anjos Ferreira A.L. Smith D. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 105-114Google Scholar). In Drosophila, vitamin A is only needed for vision, as animals grown on medium lacking vitamin A show only nonlethal visual deficits (16Stark W.S. Schilly D. Christianson J.S. Bone R.A. Landrum J.T. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1990; 166: 429-436Google Scholar). Thus, the Drosophila experimental system is easily amenable to the genetic and molecular analysis of the components and cellular sites responsible for vitamin A metabolism. In this report, we used targeted expression studies to show that the ninaB and ninaD genes did not act within photoreceptors to produce rhodopsin chromophore. Rather, only nonretinal neuronal cells were identified as being capable of supporting the conversion of β-carotene to retinal. These results showed that, despite a requirement for retinal only within photoreceptors, other cell types are responsible for carotenoid metabolism. Drosophila Maintenance—Unless specified, all flies were reared on standard corn medium at 25 °C in a 12-h light/dark cycle. For medium supplementation experiments, β-carotene or all-trans-retinal (Sigma) was dissolved in EtOH to create 10 mm solutions, and then 200 μl was added to vials of ∼5 ml standard medium. Adult flies were maintained on the supplemented medium for 3 days prior to examination. For the experiments involving heat shock treatment, adult flies were placed at 37 °C for 1 h. FLP/FRT Mosaic Analysis—-ninaBP315 mosaic flies were created using the FLP/FRT (flippase recombinase/flippase recombinase target) system (17St. Johnston D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 176-188Google Scholar) with the following components: P(ry+ hs-neo::FRT)82B (18Xu T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Google Scholar), eyFLP (19Newsome T.P. Asling B. Dickson B.J. Development. 2000; 127: 851-860Crossref Google Scholar), and GMRhid (20Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1631-1639Google Scholar). The genotype of the ninaB mosaics was y w eyFLP; P(ry+ hs-neo::FRT)82B ninaBP315/P(ry+t7.2 = neoFRT)82B P(w+mC = GMR-hid)SS4, l(3)CL-R. The ninaEP334 mosaics were similar. The ninaDP246 and ninaAP263 mosaics were created in an analogous manner with strains containing FRT40A (18Xu T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Google Scholar). The procedures for this analysis have been described by Stowers and Schwarz (20Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1631-1639Google Scholar) and Stowers et al. (21Stowers R.S. Megeath L.J. Gorska-Andrzejak J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1063-1077Google Scholar). Transgenic Drosophila Strains—The pUAST-ninaB plasmid was constructed by inserting a sequence (5′ NotI-ninaB open reading frame-XbaI 3′) into pUAST (22Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Google Scholar). The hs-ninaB (heat shock promoter ninaB) plasmid was constructed in a similar way using the pCaSpeR-hs plasmid (23Thummel C.S. Boulet A.M. Lipshitz H.D. Gene. 1988; 74: 445-456Google Scholar). All constructed plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The plasmids were used to create transgenic Drosophila stocks by standard P element transformation methodology (24Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila, a Practical Approach. IRL Press Limited, Oxford1986: 175-196Google Scholar). The transgenes were chromosome-mapped and moved into the appropriate mutant background using conventional genetic crosses. Other transgenic strains were obtained from the Drosophila Stock Center, Bloomington, IN. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins from two adult heads were extracted in 0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Rhodopsin proteins were detected using the polyclonal rabbit antirhodopsin antibody. 2T. Washburn and J. E. O'Tousa, unpublished data. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). In many experiments, the rhodopsin blots were stripped and reblotted with anti-actin antibody to be sure similar amounts of protein were present in each lane. Rescue of ninaB and ninaD by Dietary Vitamin A—We examined the rhodopsin content in ninaB and ninaD mutant flies fed on diets supplemented with either β-carotene or all-trans-retinal as the form of vitamin A (Fig. 1). The ninaB mutant was unable to use β-carotene or all-trans-retinal as the source of rhodopsin chromophore when reared in the dark but could use all-trans-retinal when reared in a 12-h light/dark cycle. The ninaD mutant can use both sources to synthesize rhodopsin, again with the requirement that the flies are exposed to light. These findings are consistent with earlier results showing dietary supplementation of these mutants (6Stephenson R.S. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N.J. Randall L.L. Pak W.L. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1983; 36: 477-501Google Scholar, 8von Lintig J. Dreher A. Kiefer C. Wernet M.F. Vogt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1130-1135Google Scholar) and the requirement of light to convert all-trans-retinal to the 11-cis retinal form needed for rhodopsin biogenesis (25Satoh A. Tokunaga F. Kawamura S. Ozaki K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2943-2953Google Scholar). The current results are also consistent with the postulated role of ninaB as the gene encoding BCO (26von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Google Scholar), because retinal is the product of this reaction and, therefore, the enzyme would not be required if retinal was supplied in the diet. The rescue of the ninaD mutant by both β-carotene and all-trans-retinal is also consistent with the postulated role as a β-carotene membrane receptor (7Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Google Scholar), with the assumption that high levels of dietary β-carotene allow sufficient entry of this compound into cells, even in the absence of the NinaD receptor. Nonretinal Expression of ninaB—To test the requirement of ninaB activity within photoreceptors, genetic mosaics were constructed in which the eye tissues, but not other tissues of the fly, were mutant for ninaB. Fig. 2A assesses the rhodopsin content in a set of control genotypes and the ninaB mosaic. The controls establish Rh1 rhodopsin specificity of the protein blot (compare wild type with the Rh1 null) as well as the presence of ninaB on the FRT-ninaB chromosome. In the ninaB mosaic, animals (Fig. 2A, at the far right, labeled nina patch), the retinal tissue is mutant for ninaB, but the rest of the animal is ninaB+. These mosaic flies possess normal levels of rhodopsin, showing that NinaB BCO activity is not required in the photoreceptors or other cell types of the retina for normal rhodopsin expression. The lower blot in Fig. 2A shows a control experiment carried out with a ninaE mutation. The ninaE gene is also on chromosome arm 3R, and therefore the same procedures and parent stocks were used in the construction of these mosaics. However, the results show that, unlike ninaB, the ninaE+ gene must be present within photoreceptors to generate rhodopsin expression. This is the expected result, because the ninaE gene codes for the protein moiety of rhodopsin. For the ninaB and ninaE mosaics, we also assayed the original phenotype used to characterize the nina mutants, that is, the lack of the prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA) in the electroretinogram response (27Pak W.L. Breakefield X.O. Neurogenetics: Genetic Approaches to the Nervous System. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1979: 67-99Google Scholar). These results, displayed in Fig. 2B, show that the ninaB mosaic has a wild type photoreceptor response, consistent with the conclusion that NinaB BCO activity is not required within the photoreceptors. The complementary experiment is to express ninaB solely within photoreceptors to determine whether photoreceptors were able to serve as a site of NinaB BCO activity. This was accomplished by generating transgenic animals that carried the ninaB coding sequence under control of a UASGAL4 promoter (UAS-ninaB). The expression of this construct was restricted to R1–R6 photoreceptors by providing the pninaE-GAL4 element, Rh1-GAL4 (28Tabuchi K. Sawamoto K. Suzuki E. Ozaki K. Sone M. Hama C. Tanifuji-Morimoto T. Yuasa Y. Yoshihara Y. Nose A. Okano H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 94-99Google Scholar). These animals were also homozygous for the ninaB mutant, therefore the UAS-driven ninaB was the only source of NinaB BCO protein. Fig. 3A shows the results of a protein blot assessing the rhodopsin content of experimental and control animals. The control animals include siblings carrying only the UAS-ninaB to determine the basal level of expression from this transgene. The results show there is no increase in rhodopsin production over the basal levels when pninaE-GAL4 is present to elicit NinaB BCO expression in the R1–R6 photoreceptor cells. Two other retinal-specific GAL4 driver strains confirmed and extended this result. The first of these is the enhancer trap line P(Gaw-B)LL54, in which GAL4 is expressed exclusively in the retinal pigment cells (29Lee T. Luo L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Google Scholar). A second, P(GAL4-ninaE.GMR)12, expresses GAL4 in all cells of the retina (30Freeman M. Development. 1997; 124: 261-270Google Scholar). In both of these experiments, no rescue of the ninaB mutant phenotype was observed. Thus, retinal cell types are not able to support NinaB BCO activity. As a control for these experiments, the same ninaB open reading frame was placed under the heat shock promoter. Even in the absence of heat shock, there is partial rescue of rhodopsin in ninaB mutant flies carrying hs-ninaB (Fig. 3B), showing that there is a basal level of hs-ninaB expression in the absence of heat shock treatment. However, heat shock treatment during the adult stage dramatically enhanced the rhodopsin content of these flies. Thus, the restriction of ninaB expression to adult tissues does not explain the failure of photoreceptors to serve as a site for NinaB BCO activity. Nonretinal Expression of ninaD—ninaD is postulated to encode the scavenger receptor responsible for β-carotene cellular uptake (7Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Google Scholar). The cell-type specificity requirements of ninaD were determined using similar strategies as described previously for ninaB, except the effort involved the generation of chromosome arm 2L mosaic genotypes. ninaA, a chaperone required for rhodopsin transport through the secretion pathway, is on the same chromosome arm as ninaD. For this reason, ninaA was expected to require photoreceptor cell-autonomous expression and served as a convenient control for the mosaic construction protocols. ninaD, but not ninaA, was able to be rescued by gene expression outside of the retina (Fig. 4A). The protein blot results were confirmed by assessing the presence of the PDA in the electroretinogram response of these ninaD mosaics (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that, like ninaB, ninaD can act outside of the retina to promote rhodopsin biogenesis. Exclusive photoreceptor expression of ninaD was examined by placing the UAS-ninaD construct (7Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Google Scholar) and pninaE-GAL4 in ninaD mutant flies. No rescue of the ninaD phenotype was observed in this experiment (Fig. 4C). These results show that photoreceptors cannot serve as the sole site of ninaD activity. Molecular analysis suggested sequential roles of ninaD and ninaB in the same cell. ninaD is involved in the cellular uptake of β-carotene and ninaB is responsible for the cleavage of β-carotene to generate the retinal chromophore. For this reason, we investigated whether photoreceptors failed to serve as the site of chromophore production in each mutant because both genes need to be simultaneously expressed. However, the results (Fig. 4D, upper panel) show that simultaneous expression of the ninaB and ninaD genes in photoreceptors failed to rescue the ninaB mutant. Further, results shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4D demonstrate that providing excess β-carotene in the diet sufficient to overcome the requirement for ninaD still did not permit formation of chromophore in ninaB mutants. Drosophila Nervous System Tissues Support ninaB and ninaD Activity—The results presented above show that retinal cells are not required and cannot serve as the sole cell type supporting ninaB or ninaD activities. These results prompted us to identify the Drosophila tissues that would support ninaB or ninaD activities. To address this question, a set of genotypes in which GAL4 was expressed in discrete subsets of Drosophila tissues was created and analyzed. For analysis of ninaB, the genotypes were homozygous for ninaB, carried the UAS-ninaB transgene on the X chromosome, and carried one additional transgene that specified GAL4 expression in defined tissues. Each of these strains, with appropriate control strains, was assessed for rhodopsin content. In Fig. 5A, these results show that GAL4 expression in some, but not all, nonretinal tissues will support the ninaB activity. The pan-neuronal driver elav-GAL4 element, C155 (31Yao K.M. White K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 41-51Google Scholar), showed complete rescue of ninaB with similar results observed for V55. The V55 element was previously reported to express GAL4 in the larval peripheral nervous system but also shows uniform expression within the adult central nervous system (data not shown). No rescue was observed when ninaB was expressed solely within the mushroom bodies of the central nervous system using the OK107 driver (32Lee T. Lee A. Luo L. Development. 1999; 126: 4065-4076Google Scholar). Similarly, no rescue is observed with GAL4-twi.G and GAL4-how24B, two strains with broad expression of GAL4 within embryonic mesodermal cells (33Cheng L. Roemer N. Smyth K.A. Belote J. Nambu J.R. Schwartz L.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 13-20Google Scholar, 34Zaffran S. Astier M. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1997; 124: 2087-2098Crossref Google Scholar). Our analysis showed that these two strains express prominently in adult muscle and fat body cells (data not shown), which rules out these tissues as sites of chromophore production. Thus, the analysis shows that productive ninaB activity is confined to a limited number of cell types and that only central nervous system neurons have been identified as possible sites for ninaB activity. To test whether ninaD showed a similar profile of rescue, we generated ninaD mutants carrying UAS-ninaD and several of these GAL4 drivers. These results are shown in Fig. 5B. As with ninaB, the C155 elav-GAL4 driver provided the best rescue, with AB1 also showing substantial rescue. OK107, allowing ninaD expression only in the mushroom bodies of the central nervous system, provided minimal rescue. Thus, the results are similar to those obtained in the ninaB studies, suggesting a nonretinal neuronal cell type as the site of action for both genes. The series of experiments described here establish that the ninaB and ninaD genes, although required for production of visual pigment chromophore, are not active within photoreceptors. By simultaneously expressing both genes in photoreceptors, we showed that this is not simply due to a requirement that both activities be present in the same cell. Rather, the results suggest that photoreceptors lack specific molecular components or appropriate cellular compartments required for ninaB activity. Alternatively, it is possible that β-carotene is not efficiently transported to the retina, and hence no substrate is available even when ninaB and ninaD are expressed. This latter explanation is considered unlikely for the following three reasons. First, rescue is still not observed when these flies are fed high doses of β-carotene, which eliminates the need for ninaD activity. Second, a previous study suggests that expression of ninaD in the photoreceptors does allow accumulation of carotenoids within head tissues (7Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Google Scholar). Finally, the failure of other tissues to allow ninaB activity suggests specialized components are required that are not represented in most cell types. Although photoreceptor expression is not effective, central nervous system expression of ninaB and ninaD is sufficient for production of chromophore. Previously, von Lintig and Vogt (26von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Google Scholar) showed that ninaB expression is limited to head tissue, consistent with the results here showing that ninaB is not active in a variety of tissues and may be expressed exclusively in central nervous system tissue. ninaD appears to have a broad expression pattern in embryos (7Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Google Scholar); larval and adult expression patterns have not been reported. The model shown in Fig. 6 summarizes these results. Uptake, presumably through the digestive tract, allows transport of β-carotene to a nonretinal neuronal cell likely located within the central nervous system. The transport of β-carotene uptake into this cell by the NinaD scavenger receptor provides the substrate for processing of β-carotene to retinal by the NinaB BCO. We assume here that ninaD and ninaB are acting in the same cells based on the rescue with the same two GAL4 driver strains. However, because both of these GAL4 strains show broad central nervous system activity, the requirement for NinaD in additional or different neuronal cells cannot be ruled out. The requirement of β-carotene as the C40 carotenoid acted on by the NinaB BCO is suggested by the observation that bacterially expressed NinaB BCO does not process zeaxanthin or other hydroxylated C40 carotenoids to the C20 3-OH retinal (26von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Google Scholar). Similar specificity was observed for mammalian BCO homologs (12Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Google Scholar, 13Yan W. Jang G.F. Haeseleer F. Esumi N. Chang J. Kerrigan M. Campochiaro M. Campochiaro P. Palczewski K. Zack D.J. Genomics. 2001; 72: 193-202Google Scholar). If Drosophila in vivo conditions of NinaB BCO activity are the same, the successful use of zeaxanthin or lutein (16Stark W.S. Schilly D. Christianson J.S. Bone R.A. Landrum J.T. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1990; 166: 429-436Google Scholar) as a dietary source for the 3-OH retinal requires that these hydroxylated C40 carotenoids are first converted to β-carotene. The cellular location of these processes is not known and could not be addressed in the current study. After cleavage of β-carotene in the “ninaB cell,” the retinal is hydroxylated to form 3-OH retinal. The location of this reaction is also not known; therefore retinal or 3-OH retinal may be the compound transported to photoreceptors for use in vision. This view of Drosophila β-carotene metabolism is remarkably different from the current view of vertebrate metabolism. In vertebrates, β-carotene processing occurs in a variety of different tissues including the intestines, liver, testis, and lungs. The identified β,β-carotene-15,15-oxygenase (12Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Google Scholar, 13Yan W. Jang G.F. Haeseleer F. Esumi N. Chang J. Kerrigan M. Campochiaro M. Campochiaro P. Palczewski K. Zack D.J. Genomics. 2001; 72: 193-202Google Scholar) has an expression profile in good agreement with these identified sites. In many cases, such as in the testis, the β-carotene is a source for retinoic acid (35Livera G. Rouiller-Fabre V. Habert R. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1307-1314Google Scholar, 36Maden M. Hind M. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 237-244Google Scholar) acting in cellular differentiation. The lack of retinoic acid signaling in Drosophila likely limits the cell types required to process β-carotene. The reason the processing occurs within a subset of neuronal cells needs to be determined. One possibility is a requirement for retinoids in the extra-retinal noncryptochrome photoreceptors involved in circadian clock activity (37Hall J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 456-466Google Scholar, 38Malpel S. Klarsfeld A. Rouyer F. Development. 2002; 129: 1443-1453Google Scholar). Further work is needed to determine the identity and the properties of the nonretinal neuronal cells supporting NinaB BCO activity. The failure to rescue ninaB by expression in photoreceptors, salivary glands, fat body and muscle cells suggests these cells lack specific molecular components or appropriate cellular compartments. At least for photoreceptors, the only cell type tested in this regard, the expression of the NinaD receptor is not sufficient. For this reason, NinaD cannot be the only missing component, and other components need to be identified. Mammalian BCO activity also may be restricted to particular cell types, as the majority of the intestinal activity comes from jejunal enterocytes (39Duszka C. Grolier P. Azim E.M. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Borel P. Azais-Braesco V. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2550-2556Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that mammals also retain cellular specializations supporting β-carotene metabolism in a limited number of cell types. In summary, the work described here establishes that photoreceptors are not the site of dietary vitamin A processing for use in vision. A subset of neuronal cells in the central nervous system are the only cells identified as capable of supporting this reaction, and the results show that a limited number of cell types supports the production of retinal from β-carotene. The reason for this restriction is not known, as activity of the NinaB BCO enzyme from E. coli expression has been achieved (26von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Google Scholar). One experimental approach that will address this question is the identification and characterization of the cell types, probably a subset of nonretinal neuronal cells within the central nervous system, responsible for the ninaB activity. We thank William L. Pak for providing the nina mutant strains, Drs. Johannes Von Lintig and Cornelia Kiefer for the UAS-ninaD transgenic strain, and Drs. Johannes Von Lintig and Klaus Vogt for the ninaB cDNA."

Rat Tom22 (rTOM22) is a 142-residue protein, embedded in the outer membrane through the internal transmembrane domain (TMD) with 82 N-terminal residues in the cytosol and 41 C-terminal residues in the intermembrane space. We analyzed the signals that target rTOM22 to the mitochondrial outer membrane and assembly into the TOM complex in cultured mammalian cells. Deletions or mutations were systematically introduced into the molecule, and the intracellular localization of the mutant constructs in HeLa cells was examined by confocal microscopy and cell fractionation. Their assembly into the TOM complex was also examined using blue native gel electrophoresis. These experiments revealed three separate structural elements: a cytoplasmic 10-residue segment with an acidic α-helical structure located 30 residues upstream of the TMD (the import sequence), TMD with an appropriate hydrophobicity, and a 20-residue C-terminal segment located 22 residues downstream of the TMD (C-tail signal). The import sequence and TMD were both essential for targeting and integration into the TOM complex, whereas the C-tail signal affected the import efficiency. The import sequence combined with foreign TMD functioned as a mitochondrial targeting and anchor signal but failed to integrate the construct into the TOM complex. Thus, the mitochondrial-targeting and TOM integration signal could be discriminated. A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that the import sequence interacted with two intramolecular elements, the TMD and C-tail signal, and that it also interacted with the import receptor Tom20.

In most outer membrane proteins that are anchored to the membrane through an α-helical TMD, the TMD and the flanking short segments function as the signal anchor for mitochondrial translocation. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tom70 targets and inserts into the mitochondrial outer membrane by a signal anchor composed of two domains: a positively charged N-terminal hydrophilic region (residues 1–10) followed by the TMD (residues 11–29). McBride et al. (5McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the TMD functions as the signal anchor sequence that is both necessary and sufficient for targeting and insertion, whereas the N-terminal hydrophilic region enhanced import. In Tom20, the N-terminal TMD and a net positive charge within five residues of the C-terminal flanking region function together as the mitochondrial targeting signal anchor (7Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). During translation, the signal recognition particle (24Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) recognizes the TMD of Tom20; basic amino acid residues in the C-terminal flanking region, however, interfere with the function of the signal recognition particle, thus preventing signal recognition particle-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting (7Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The C-terminal positive charge and the TMD length are important determinants for the signal anchor of C-anchored proteins (25Kuroda K. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Isenmann S. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol.

Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In Tom5, an appropriate length TMD and a specific sequence containing proline in the TMD are required for functional targeting and assembly into the TOM complex (29Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41462-41471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other C-tail-anchored proteins that are dispersed in the outer membrane depend on both an appropriate length TMD and positive charges of the C-terminal flanking segment (25Kuroda K. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Isenmann S. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol.

Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the signal for mitochondrial targeting and assembly of Tom6 and Tom22 is composed of the TMD and separately localized segments. The targeting signal of S. cerevisiae Tom6 is composed of a 10-residue internal segment in the cytoplasmic domain, TMD, and the following C-terminal 9-residue segment (30Cao W. Douglas M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In vitro import studies of Neurospora crassa Tom22 demonstrated that a segment of the cytosolic domain (encompassing residues 45–75) resembling matrix-targeted presequences is essential for import and assembly into the TOM complex (10Rodriguez-Cousino N. Nargang F.E. Baardman R. Neupert W. Lill R. Court D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11527-11532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This segment is potentially amphiphilic, carries a net positive charge, and is enriched in serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues, and it is referred to as the “import sequence.” The precise character of the internal import sequence, how the signal is recognized by the TOM components, and the mechanism by which the import signal and TMD determine the membrane topology during membrane disposition, however, remain unclear. Human TOM22 exhibited overall sequence identities of 19 and 20% to Tom22 from S. cerevisiae and N. crassa, respectively (31Saeki K. Suzuki H. Tsuneoka M. Maeda M. Iwamoto R. Hasuwa H. Seiichiro S.

Terada K. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7205-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the sequence identity is low, these proteins share a structural similarity in the distribution of clusters of acidic amino acid residues along the cytoplasmic domain toward the N terminus and in the hydropathy profile. The distribution of acidic amino acid residues along the intermembrane segments, however, is distinct. The C-terminal tails of N. crassa and S. cerevisiae Tom22 have an overall negative charge with a net charge of -5. In marked contrast, human TOM22 has a C-terminal tail with a neutral net charge. These differences led us to investigate the signal of rat TOM22 (rTOM22) that determines mitochondrial targeting and integration into the TOM complex using in vivo and in vitro systems. rTOM22 is composed of 142 amino acid residues and has an overall sequence identity of 93% to human TOM22. Materials—Antibodies against rTOM20 and rTOM70 were prepared as previously described (31Saeki K. Suzuki H. Tsuneoka M. Maeda M. Iwamoto R. Hasuwa H. Seiichiro S. Takahashi T. Sakaguchi M. Endo T. Miura Y. Mekada E. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31996-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria and the mitochondrial outer membrane were prepared as previously described (33Hachiya N. Komiya T. Alam R. Iwahashi J. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5146-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Nishino H. Ito A. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—All TOM22-based constructs were prepared by PCR, and the fragments were cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-10 vectors (Sigma) and used for the expression experiments in HeLa cells. Thus, all of the expressed constructs were FLAG-tagged at the N terminus. For construction of the in vitro expression vectors for the constructs in which the three internal elements of rTOM22 were ligated separately or in combination with the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP), the rTOM22 cDNA segments produced by PCR or Kunkel protocol were co-ligated with GFP cDNA into pSP64 vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). Information on the nucleotide sequences of the primers used in this study is available on request. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biosciences) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DNA transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using FuGene6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Plasmid DNA (1 μg) was transfected to HeLa cells, and the cells were incubated in 3.5-cm dishes at 37 °C for 24 h. Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips in 35-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 24 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Transfection was performed as above, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. To locate mitochondria with MitoTracker, HeLa cells cultured for 24 h were incubated in the presence of 50 nm Mito-Tracker for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were cultured on coverslips and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and treated with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 4 min. After washing sequentially with PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG M2-monoclonal IgG (Sigma) or anti-FLAG IgG plus anti-calnexin IgGs (Stressgen) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, washed five times with PBS, and then immunostained using fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs (for rTOM22 constructs) or Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (for calnexin). Fluorescent images were taken and analyzed using a confocal laser microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad). Subcellular Fractionation—The transfected HeLa cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes for 24 h and washed twice with PBS. The collected cells were washed twice with the homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) (35Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) containing protease inhibitor (Complete, EDTA Free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and suspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer. The cells were disrupted by five-stroke aspiration through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondria-enriched fraction (P1). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate the ER-enriched fraction (P2) and the supernatant. The subcellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. The immunoblots were visualized by electrochemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and the images were analyzed by LAS-1000 (Fuji Film). Preparation of Rat Liver Mitochondrial Outer Membrane—Rat liver mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) were prepared essentially as described by Nishino and Ito (34Nishino H. Ito A. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria (33Hachiya N. Komiya T. Alam R. Iwahashi J. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5146-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were suspended in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then sonicated with a Branson sonifier at 150 watts for 10 s, six times at 30-s intervals. The mixture was layered over 1.25 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The 1.25 m sucrose layer was collected and diluted with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 h. The OMV precipitates were suspended in the homogenization buffer. Binding of the GFP Constructs Carrying the rTOM22 Elements to OMV—The internal import sequence in the cytoplasmic segment, TMD, C-tail signal, or their combinations was fused to the N terminus of GFP on the cDNA level, and the proteins were synthesized and labeled with [35S]methionine using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Synthesized products (5 μl each) were incubated in 40 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 μg of OMV, 0.25 m sucrose, and 0.1 mg/ml α2-macroglobulin at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture was mixed with 120 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 m sucrose, placed at the bottom of discontinuous layers of 0.25 m sucrose (150 μl) and 1.25 m sucrose (150 μl) in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The OMV, which floated to the upper 240 μl of the tube, was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by digital autoradiography (Fuji BAS-2000). Blue Native PAGE—Blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) was performed essentially as described previously (36Suzuki H. Okazawa Y. Komiya T. Saeki K. Mekada E. Kitada S. Ito A. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37930-37936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells expressing the rTOM22 mutants were solubilized in 30 μl of homogenization buffer containing 2% digitonin, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was mixed with 2 μl of sample buffer (5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid) and electrophoresed through 5–16% polyacrylamide gradient gels. The gels were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against FLAG. Import of rTOM22 into Mitochondria in Vitro—Import of rTOM22 precursor into mitochondria was performed essentially as described previously (7Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture containing 50 μg of mitochondria and 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate-synthesized 35S-rTOM22 constructs was incubated in 20 μl of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitor mix (Complete, EDTA Free; Roche Applied Science) at 30 °C for 1 h. The mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, washed with homogenizing buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE or BN-PAGE. The gels were analyzed by digital autoradiography using a BAS2000 (Fuji). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 system 3 (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cytosolic domains of rTOM20 (Asp25–Glu145), rTOM22 (Met1–Arg82), rTOM70 (Arg64–Leu610), and three internal sequence elements of rTOM22 (the import sequence (residues 41–60), TMD (residues 83–101), and C-tail signal (residues 123–142)) were amplified by PCR, and the PCR fragments were inserted separately downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) on the pAS2-1 plasmid (TRP1) or into the GAL4-activating domain (AD) on the pACT2 plasmid (LEU2). Two-hybrid interactions were assayed using the HIS3 reporter system. Co-transformation of two hybrid vectors into S. cerevisiae AH109 (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UASGAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformants were screened for their potential to grow on synthetic complete medium lacking adenine, tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. The Internal Sequence with an Acidic Amphiphilic Helical Structure in the Cytoplasmic Segment Is Required for Mitochondrial Targeting of rTOM22—To define the mitochondrial targeting signal of rTOM22 (the primary sequence shown in Fig. 1), consecutive 10-residue deletions were introduced into rTOM22 carrying FLAG and HA tags at the N and C terminus, respectively, and expressed in HeLa cells, and their intracellular localization was examined by confocal microscopy and cell fractionation. Merged images of FLAG tag and MitoTracker immunofluorescence are shown in Fig. 2A. The mutant with a deletion in the cytoplasmic domain, Δ41–50, exhibited clear mislocalization to the cytoplasm, which was also confirmed by cell fractionation (Fig. 2B). The TMD-deleted construct (deletion of residues 83–101; ΔTM) also mislocalized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the other constructs were all correctly targeted to mitochondria (fractionation data are shown for Δ21–30, Δ51–60, and Δ133–142 and are typical for the constructs that displayed mitochondrial localization in Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A short cytoplasmic segment and the TMD are critical for mitochondrial targeting of rTOM22. A, 10-amino acid residue deletions were introduced into rTOM22 sequentially from the N terminus and expressed in HeLa cells. The expressed constructs were immunostained (green), and mitochondria were stained by MitoTracker (red), and fluorescent images were obtained with a confocal microscope. Merged fluorescent images are shown. B, rTOM22 deletion constructs were expressed in HeLa cells, and the cells were fractionated into low speed precipitate (P1; mitochondria-enriched fraction), high speed precipitate (P2; microsome-enriched fraction), and the supernatant (S) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The isolated fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using antibodies against HA for TOM22 constructs or against the indicated proteins. Tom40, PDI, and H450 were used as markers for mitochondria, microsomes, and supernatant fractions, respectively. C, assembly of the rTOM22 mutants into the TOM complex as revealed by BN-PAGE. Mitochondria were prepared from HeLa cells expressing the indicated constructs and were solubilized by 2% digitonin. The cleared lysate was split into two. One fraction was subjected to BN-PAGE (upper panel), whereas the other fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE (lower panel), and the gels were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined whether the deletion constructs targeted to the mitochondria were correctly assembled into the TOM complex using BN-PAGE. The constructs with deletions encompassing residues 1–40 were efficiently integrated into the ∼400-kDa TOM complex (36Suzuki H. Okazawa Y. Komiya T. Saeki K. Mekada E. Kitada S. Ito A. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37930-37936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The constructs with deletions in the C-terminal intermembrane segment (residues 103–142) were integrated into the TOM complex with slightly reduced efficiency, and unassembled products were detected, suggesting that the deletion of the C-terminal segment affected assembly into the TOM complex. The immunoblot signals were not detected either in the TOM complex or in the position of the unassembled species of the constructs with deletions encompassing residues 51–80 (Fig. 2C, upper panel), notwithstanding their presence in the digitonin-solubilized fraction (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Confocal microscopy and cell fractionation clearly indicated that these constructs were targeted to mitochondria, and, as such, the proteins were detected in the mitochondria by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting (Fig. 2A; Fig. 2B for Δ51–60). We have no explanation for this phenomenon. Secondary structure prediction indicated that residues 41–58 potentially formed an acidic amphiphilic α-helical structure, in which four glutamic acid residues were placed on one side of the helix and hydrophobic residues including leucine on the other side; the critical segment in the cytosolic domain as assigned above (residues 41–50) was contained in this helix (Fig. 3E). We therefore addressed the importance of the predicted helical structure as well as the acidic or hydrophobic residues in this segment. First, an increasing number of alanine residues were inserted in the middle portion of this segment to disturb the topology of authentic amino acid residues in the helical wheel. All of the constructs except for the four-alanine insertions (+4A) failed to produce correct mitochondrial targeting; they were mislocalized to the cytoplasm, indicating that some defined amino acid residues must be placed in the helix with the correct topology (Fig. 3A; cell fractionation data in Fig. 3C). Furthermore, when amino acid residues in this segment were replaced by a helix-breaking proline, the constructs (E46P and W49P in Fig. 3A) were also mislocalized to the cytoplasm. These results indicated that the α-helical structure of this segment is essential for correct mitochondrial targeting. We then addressed the importance of leucine residues in this segment. For this purpose, three leucine residues in this segment were replaced by alanine in various combinations (Fig. 3B). When at least two leucine residues were replaced by alanine, the correct mitochondrial targeting was lost (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating the importance of hydrophobicity of the face in the predicted helix where the leucine residues are placed. Because four glutamic acid residues at 42, 46, 53, and 57 are on the same face of the helix (see Fig. 3E), we examined the importance of these residues by replacing them with glutamine in different combinations. A single mutation from glutamic acid to glutamine at residue 42 (1Q in Fig. 3D; E42Q), but not at the other positions, induced partial mislocalization of the construct. Strikingly, more than two glutamic acid substitutions coupled with residue 42 always induced a strong mistargeting phenotype (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that glutamic acid residues in this potential helical structure are critical for the targeting function. Taken together, these results indicated that the segment encompassing residues 41–50 is essential for correct mitochondria targeting and must have an acidic amphiphilic α-helical structure to function. When the amino acid sequences of rat and N. crassa Tom22 were compared, this short segment localized at the N-terminal region corresponding to the “import sequence” of N. crassa Tom22 (10Rodriguez-Cousino N. Nargang F.E. Baardman R. Neupert W. Lill R. Court D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11527-11532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although the sequence similarity was low. We therefore named this segment the “import sequence,” referring to that of N. crassa Tom22. A Segment in the C-termi"
https://openalex.org/W2035799101,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can modulate synaptic transmission by acting directly on the neurotransmitter secretory machinery. Here, we identify one possible target: syntaphilin, which was identified as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 and dynamin-1 availability and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Deletion mutation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments pinpoint dominant PKA phosphorylation sites to serines 43 and 56. PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin significantly decreases its binding to syntaxin-1A in vitro. A syntaphilin mutation of serine 43 to aspartic acid (S43D) shows similar effects on binding. To characterize in vivo phosphorylation events, we generated antisera against a peptide of syntaphilin containing a phosphorylated serine 43. Treatment of rat brain synaptosomes or syntaphilin-transfected HEK 293 cells with the cAMP analogue BIMPS induces in vivo phosphorylation of syntaphilin and inhibits its interaction with syntaxin-1 in neurons. To determine whether PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin is involved in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, we investigated the effect of overexpression of syntaphilin and its S43D mutant on the regulated secretion of human growth hormone from PC12 cells. Although expression of wild type syntaphilin in PC12 cells exhibits significant reduction in high K+-induced human growth hormone release, the S43D mutant fails to inhibit exocytosis. Our data predict that syntaphilin could be a highly regulated molecule and that PKA phosphorylation could act as an “off” switch for syntaphilin, thus blocking its inhibitory function via the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can modulate synaptic transmission by acting directly on the neurotransmitter secretory machinery. Here, we identify one possible target: syntaphilin, which was identified as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 and dynamin-1 availability and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Deletion mutation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments pinpoint dominant PKA phosphorylation sites to serines 43 and 56. PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin significantly decreases its binding to syntaxin-1A in vitro. A syntaphilin mutation of serine 43 to aspartic acid (S43D) shows similar effects on binding. To characterize in vivo phosphorylation events, we generated antisera against a peptide of syntaphilin containing a phosphorylated serine 43. Treatment of rat brain synaptosomes or syntaphilin-transfected HEK 293 cells with the cAMP analogue BIMPS induces in vivo phosphorylation of syntaphilin and inhibits its interaction with syntaxin-1 in neurons. To determine whether PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin is involved in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, we investigated the effect of overexpression of syntaphilin and its S43D mutant on the regulated secretion of human growth hormone from PC12 cells. Although expression of wild type syntaphilin in PC12 cells exhibits significant reduction in high K+-induced human growth hormone release, the S43D mutant fails to inhibit exocytosis. Our data predict that syntaphilin could be a highly regulated molecule and that PKA phosphorylation could act as an “off” switch for syntaphilin, thus blocking its inhibitory function via the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway. Neurotransmitter release involves a series of protein interactions between the membranes of synaptic vesicles and presynaptic terminals, culminating in the calcium-dependent fusion of the two membranes (for reviews see Refs. 1Jahn R.

Formation of the SNARE complex has been proposed to bring the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes into close apposition and provide the energy that drives the mixing of the two lipid bilayers (6Trimble W.S. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 85: 4538-4542Google Scholar, 7Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Google Scholar, 10Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). Calcium influx into the presynaptic terminal triggers the calcium sensor of the fusion machinery, upon which the SNARE core complex binding matures from a trans-state to a cis-state, resulting in the complete fusion of the two membranes and the release of neurotransmitter. The very stable cis-SNARE core complex is then dissociated by the action of α-SNAP and the ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (10Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). The assembly and disassembly of the SNARE complex must be highly regulated to gain plasticity in neurotransmitter release. Recent studies have made significant progress in understanding this regulatory mechanism by the isolation of the SNARE complex interacting proteins, including Munc18/nSec1/rbSec1, complexins, Munc-13, tomosyn, cysteine string protein, snapin, and syntaphilin (13Pevsner J.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 593-605Google Scholar), which bind to individual SNARE proteins and regulate their availability to form functional SNARE complexes at release sites. Second messenger regulation of the protein interactions underlying neurotransmission is one mechanism by which cellular events modulate synaptic transmission (4Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Google Scholar). Although the time course between action potential arrival at the nerve terminal and synaptic vesicle fusion is too short for protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation to exact a direct and acute role in a single round of vesicle exocytosis, protein kinases and phosphatases may have significant effects on subsequent neurotransmitter release events. It is reasonable to speculate that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation states of synaptic proteins that mediate vesicle exocytosis could regulate the biochemical pathways leading from synaptic vesicle docking to fusion. Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been shown to facilitate synaptic transmission at many synapses (20Dixon D. Atwood H.L. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 4246-4252Google Scholar, 21Chavez-Noriega L.E. Stevens C.F. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 310-317Google Scholar, 22Klein M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 159-166Google Scholar, 23Weisskopf M.G.

Application of the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin on adult rat and mouse hippocampal slices or hippocampal neuron cultures increased the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents without affecting their amplitude (21Chavez-Noriega L.E. Stevens C.F. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 310-317Google Scholar, 25Yasuda H. Barth A.L. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 15-16Google Scholar, 26Bouron A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4446-4450Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons, activation of PKA increases neurotransmitter release by directly acting on the exocytotic apparatus (27Trudeau L.E. Emery D.G. Haydon P.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 789-797Google Scholar). The number of functional presynaptic boutons of hippocampal neuron cultures increased after long term exposure to the cAMP analogue (28Ma L. Zablow L. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 24-30Google Scholar, 29Kohara K. Ogura A. Akagawa K. Yamaguchi K. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 41: 79-88Google Scholar). However, there was no change in the number of functioning terminals and nor in the number of docked vesicles within individual synapses after 3 min of treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with forskolin (27Trudeau L.E. Emery D.G. Haydon P.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 789-797Google Scholar), suggesting that the short term effects of cAMP may affect the secretory machinery directly. Thus, identifying the PKA target(s) that regulates assembly/disassembly of the fusion machinery and the priming of docked vesicles is critical to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission and presynaptic plasticity. Syntaphilin is a brain-enriched protein that we first characterized as a binding partner of syntaxin-1 (18Lao G. Scheuss V. Gerwin C.M. Su Q. Mochida S. Rettig J. Sheng Z.-H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 191-201Google Scholar). Binding of syntaphilin to syntaxin inhibits the binding of syntaxin to SNAP-25 and thus prevents the formation of the SNARE core complex. Functionally, overexpression of syntaphilin in cultured hippocampal neurons inhibits neurotransmitter release; furthermore, injection of the syntaphilin syntaxin-binding peptide into the presynaptic cell body of superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture results in the inhibition of neurotransmission, suggesting that syntaphilin may function as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 availability for the assembly of the SNARE complex and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Syntaphilin also binds to dynamin-1 and inhibits its interaction with amphiphysin, suggesting an inhibitory role for this protein in dynamin-mediated endocytosis (30Das S. Gerwin C. Sheng Z.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41221-41226Google Scholar). The expression of syntaphilin is developmentally regulated, and it is more prominently expressed in the mature rat brain in areas undergoing synaptic plastic changes (31Das S. Boczan J. Gerwin C. Zald P.B. Sheng Z.-H. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 38-49Google Scholar). Our finding that syntaphilin expression is limited to a subset of synapses led us to ask whether it might be an expression-limited modulator of synaptic activity. Syntaphilin is serine-rich (12% of total amino acid content) and contains numerous consensus sites for protein phosphorylation, suggesting that its functional roles on synaptic vesicle recycling are further regulated through phosphorylation. In this study we show that syntaphilin can be phosphorylated by PKA both in vitro and in vivo and that this phosphorylation inhibits its binding to syntaxin-1A. Furthermore, mutation of the phosphorylation site serine 43 to aspartic acid (mimicking a constitutive phosphorylation) annuls the inhibitory effect of syntaphilin on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in PC12 cells. Thus, PKA activation could act as an “off” switch for syntaphilin by blocking its inhibitory functions at the nerve terminal. Preparation of Fusion Proteins and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Full-length and truncated mutants of syntaphilin were subcloned into the hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein vectors pET28A (Novagen) and pcDNA 3.1 His-A (Invitrogen). Wild type syntaphilin 1–469 was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Syntaxin-1A 1–265 was subcloned into pET-28A vector. His-tagged proteins in pcDNA vectors were prepared as lysates of transfected HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). His-tagged proteins in pET28 and GST fusion proteins were prepared as crude bacterial lysates using BL21-competent cells (Star-DE3-pLysS One Shot; Invitrogen) and purified as previously described (17Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.-H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Google Scholar, 18Lao G. Scheuss V. Gerwin C.M. Su Q. Mochida S. Rettig J. Sheng Z.-H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 191-201Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Phosphorylation State-specific Antibody—Rabbit polyclonal antibody pS43 was raised against the following cysteine-containing phosphopeptide Ac-LTRTH(pS)LMAC-amide (residues 38–45). Affinity purification was performed using dephospho- and phosphopeptides coupled to thiol coupling gels (BIOSOURCE Int., Hopkinton, MA). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Recombinant His-tagged full-length syntaphilin was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cell lysate using anti-T7-His monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts (∼7 pmol) of resin-bound proteins were incubated either with or without the catalytic subunit of PKA to a final concentration of 0.5 unit/μl or 100 μg of PKA inhibitor peptide PKI (Promega) in phosphorylation buffer (Buffer A: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP) containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. The 25-μl reactions were terminated by boiling with 12.5 μl of Tricine sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 4.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 45 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma). Phosphorylation products were separated by 10–20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE; the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Bacterially expressed His-tagged syntaphilin 1–130, 130–205, and 203–469 (50 pmol of each) was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and phosphorylated as described for the full-length protein. 1 μg of syntaphilin mutants of affinity-purified GST-syntaphilin 1–469 were phosphorylated by the same method. For back-phosphorylation assays, glutathione-Sepharose bound in vitro phosphorylated GST-syntaphilin 1–469 and His-syntaphilin immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells was subjected to back-phosphorylation by incubating with PKA catalytic subunit (to a final concentration of 0.5 unit/μl) and 0.125 mm [γ-32P]ATP in Buffer A for 1 h at 30 °C. The products were separated by 10–20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and then the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Stoichiometric Measurements—For phosphorylation time course experiments, 60 pmol of purified recombinant GST-syntaphilin 1–469 was phosphorylated by 80 units of PKA catalytic subunit in Buffer A at 30 °C. 6 μl of each sample (containing 7.5 pmol of GST-syntaphilin) was removed from the reaction mixture between 5 and 240 min, and these reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and exposed to x-ray film. The gel slices containing syntaphilin were excised and scintillation-counted, and the molar ratio of inorganic phosphate incorporated per mol of syntaphilin was calculated and plotted as a function of time. In Vitro Binding Experiments—Equal amounts (5 μg) of GST-syntaphilin 1–469 or GST alone were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The resin-bound proteins were incubated either with or without the catalytic subunit of PKA (247.5 units/reaction) in Buffer A at 30 °C for 3 h under continuous agitation. After washing with TBST/PI buffer (50 mm TBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm aprotinin), one-fifth of each phosphorylation reaction was subjected to back-phosphorylation to verify the initial phosphorylation. One-third of each reaction was incubated with equal volumes of bacterial lysates containing syntaxin-1A in TBST/PI on a microtube rotator at 4 °C for 3 h. After washing with TBST/PI, the bound complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-syntaxin-1 (10H5) antibody. The membranes were stripped in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% SDS) at 60 °C for 20 min and blotted with anti-GST antibody (Pierce). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize the bands. For the binding dose-response curve, GST-syntaphilin 1–469 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was divided into two parts and incubated either with or without the catalytic subunit of PKA (410 units/reaction) in Buffer A at 30 °C for 3 h under continuous agitation. After washing with TBST/PI, each phosphorylation reaction was divided into seven equal aliquots, and each part was incubated with increasing amounts of purified His-syntaxin-1A (0, 15, 30, 50, 100, 150, and 450 pmol, respectively) and 200 μg of bovine serum albumin for blocking nonspecific binding in TBST/PI on a microtube rotator at 4 °C for 3 h. After washing with TBST/PI, the bound complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-syntaxin-1 (10H5) antibody, followed by stripping, and blotting with anti-GST antibody. For quantitative analysis, the binding intensities were measured with National Institutes of Health Image 1.61. Care was taken during exposure of the ECL film to ensure that all readings were in the linear range of a standard. The percentage of binding relative to the nonphosphorylated or wild type syntaphilin was calculated based on standard curves. Student's t tests were performed, and the results are presented as the means ± S.E. of three or four independent experiments. Preparation of Synaptosomes, Stimulation of PKA in Vivo, and Immunoprecipitation—Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared by differential and discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation (32Sheng Z.-H. Rettig J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Google Scholar). Briefly, whole rat brains were homogenized in ice-cold 21.9% sucrose buffer, pH 7.4. The homogenates were centrifuged in a Beckman GSR-6RHT centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was placed on top of Percoll gradients (23, 15, 10, and 3% in sucrose buffer) and spun in an SS34 rotor at 17,250 rpm for 5 min. The synaptosome bands between the 15 and 23% gradients were collected, mixed with Wash Buffer (122.8 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.15 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm PIPES, 0.1% d(+)-glucose, pH 6.8), and then spun in an SS34 rotor at 11,000 rpm for 15 min. The synaptosomes were resuspended in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (both from Invitrogen), then divided into two equal volumes, and incubated in the presence of either 50 μm of the cAMP analogue Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS (BIMPS) or Me2SO alone (vehicle control) at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were then lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm TBS, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 nm cyclosporin A, 10 nm okadaic acid; all from Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged by 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Solubilized proteins from both BIMPS- and Me2SO-treated synaptosomes (300 μg each) were incubated with anti-syntaxin-1 (10H5) antibody or normal mouse IgG as control in 500 μl of TBST/PI supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and co-precipitated syntaphilin was detected by immunoblotting with syntaphilin polyclonal antibody. Phosphorylation of syntaphilin in Me2SO- and BIMPS-treated synaptosomes was detected by immunoblotting with the phospho-specific syntaphilin antibody anti-pS43. For semi-quantitative analysis, the intensity of the syntaphilin signals was measured with National Institutes of Health Image 1.61, and the relative amounts were calculated using a linear standard curve of syntaphilin from the synaptosomal lysates using a paired Student's t test for statistical analysis. High K+-stimulated Exocytosis in PC12 Cells—Exocytosis assays were generally conducted as previously described, with a few modifications (33Sugita S. Janz R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18893-18901Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells (2 × 106 cells grown in 35-mm collagen-coated dishes (Corning Inc.)) were co-transfected the next day with a plasmid expressing human GH (pXGH5) along with 3.6 μg of empty pcDNA vector or pcDNA vector encoding either wild type syntaphilin or its mutant by using LipofectAMINE 2000 in OPTI-MEM (both from Invitrogen). After 48 h of incubation in RPMI culture medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum (all from ATCC) and 100 unit/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (both from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 10% CO2, the cells were lifted and replated (split from one 35-mm dish into two 22-mm dishes). 24 h after replating, the cells were subjected to exocytosis assays by incubating in low K+ (basal) and high K+ (stimulated) release conditions. Release buffers consisted of low (5.6 mm) or high (56 mm) KCl solutions in 145 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 30 min. The medium was then removed and centrifuged by 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Human growth hormone (hGH) in the supernatant was taken as secreted hGH. The cells from the dishes were harvested in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and added to the centrifuged pellet of the secretion medium. Following a 20-min incubation at 4 °C on a microtube rotator, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant of this step was taken as the intracellular hGH that was not secreted after K+ stimulation. hGH levels in the various samples were measured by the hGH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of hGH released was calculated as the hGH in supernatant divided by the total hGH obtained from solubilized cells plus hGH in the supernatant. All of the experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate each time. The statistical analyses were performed with the Student's t test, and the results are presented as the means ± S.E. of five independent experiments. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Syntaphilin by PKA—Our previous studies indicate that syntaphilin is a developmentally regulated and expression-limited protein capable of inhibiting both synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis (18Lao G. Scheuss V. Gerwin C.M. Su Q. Mochida S. Rettig J. Sheng Z.-H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 191-201Google Scholar, 30Das S. Gerwin C. Sheng Z.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41221-41226Google Scholar, 31Das S. Boczan J. Gerwin C. Zald P.B. Sheng Z.-H. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 38-49Google Scholar). Syntaphilin is serine-rich (12% of total amino acid content) and contains numerous sites for protein phosphorylation, suggesting that its role is further regulated through phosphorylation. Because PKA activation induces vesicle cycling at both previously silent cerebellar granule cell synapses (34Chavis P. Mollard P. Bockaert J. Manzoni O. Neuron. 1998; 20: 773-781Google Scholar) and in synapses of hippocampal cultures (35Trudeau L.E. Fang Y. Haydon P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7163-7168Google Scholar), we wondered whether PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin could influence its inhibitory functions at the nerve terminal via the cAMP signaling pathway. To address this question, we examined the ability of recombinant syntaphilin to serve as a substrate for PKA. 7 pmol of immunoprecipitated His-tagged syntaphilin expressed in HEK 293 T cells was incubated with PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and heating, and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film to detect 32P incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1A, syntaphilin functions as a substrate for PKA, and its phosphorylation is blocked by the pseudosubstrate PKA inhibitor peptide PKI. To map phosphorylation sites in syntaphilin, we examined the capacity of syntaphilin truncated mutants to serve as PKA substrates. We incubated 50 pmol of purified His-tagged syntaphilin truncated mutants including 1–130, 130–205, and 203–469 with PKA and found that syntaphilin amino-terminal domain (1–130) was efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (Fig. 1B, upper panel). In contrast, both the coiled-coil domain (130–205) and the carboxyl half (203–469) could not serve as a PKA substrate under our experimental conditions. Immunoblotting of the reaction mixtures with anti-T7-His antibody demonstrated that approximately equal amounts of proteins were used for in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lower panel). We then conducted a sequence search against the Scansite Motif Scanner Program (36Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Google Scholar), and several consensus PKA phosphorylation residues were predicted between amino acids 1 and 130. We focused on three serine residues at positions 43, 56, and 64 that show high potential as PKA targets. To identify the amino acid residue(s) phosphorylated by PKA, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate syntaphilin mutants where the serine at positions 43, 56, or 64 was substituted with alanine. Approximately 1 μg of the GST-syntaphilin mutants were incubated with PKA catalytic subunit at 30 °C for 1 h, separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2A, lower panel), and then exposed to x-ray film (Fig. 2A, upper panel). To quantitate 32P incorporation, the gel slices corresponding to phosphorylated syntaphilin bands were excised and scintillation counted. Although the S64A mutant was as efficiently phosphorylated as the wild type syntaphilin, the 32P incorporation into S43A and S56A mutants was significantly decreased. Double mutation of S43A and S56A resulted in further reduction of the phosphorylation signal, suggesting that both the Ser43 and Ser56 residues serve as primary PKA phosphorylation sites in syntaphilin. Furthermore, we confirmed the site-directed mutagenesis results by mass spectrometry analysis using the phosphorylated syntaphilin and found that serine 43 is indeed a primary target for PKA phosphorylation in vitro. The surrounding sequence of syntaphilin serine 43 (RTHS43) and serine 56 (RRTS56) match one of the consensus sequences for PKA (RRX(S/T), RX(S/T), and RX2(S/T)). To further confirm that PKA phosphorylates only two residues in syntaphilin, we performed stoichiometric analysis of phosphorylation for purified recombinant syntaphilin protein. The reactions included 60 pmol of GST-syntaphilin and [γ-32P]ATP. 6 μl of samples containing 7.5 pmol of GST-syntaphilin were removed from the reaction mixture at various time points between 5 and 240 min, and these reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and inorganic P incorporation was quantitated by scintillation counting of excised gel slices corresponding to phosphorylated syntaphilin bands. The stoichiometry values are expressed as the ratios of moles of inorganic phosphate (Pi) incorporated per mole of syntaphilin protein and plotted against reaction time (Fig. 2B). Under conditions optimized for maximal phosphorylation, we found that PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin reached a plateau level after 120 min of incubation at 30 °C, and the maximal stoichiometry is nearly 2, consistent with the two primary PKA sites identified by the mutagenetic studies. In Vivo Phosphorylation of Syntaphilin by PKA—Although our biochemical experiments showed that PKA incorporates 32P into syntaphilin, the conditions used for in vitro phosphorylation may not reflect conditions found in the native cellular environment. In addition, treatment of proteins with detergent for solubilization may expose sites that are normally not available for phosphorylation in vivo. Therefore, to investigate in vivo phosphorylation, we performed back-phosphorylation assays. We transfected a"

FAN-deficient mice do not exhibit any gross abnormality. To further explore the functions of FAN in vivo and because CD120a-deficient mice are resistant to endotoxin-induced liver failure and lethality, we investigated the susceptibility of FAN-deficient animals to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show that after d-galactosamine sensitization, FAN-deficient mice were partially resistant to LPS- and TNFα-induced lethality. Although LPS challenge resulted in a hepatic ceramide content lower in mutant mice than in control animals, it triggered similar histological alterations, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation in the liver. Interestingly, LPS-induced elevation of IL-6 (but not TNFα) serum concentrations was attenuated in FAN-deficient mice. A less pronounced secretion of IL-6 was also observed after LPS or TNFα treatment of cultured peritoneal macrophages and embryonic fibroblasts isolated from FAN-deficient mice, as well as in human fibroblasts expressing a mutated FAN. Finally, we show that d-galactosamine-sensitized IL-6-deficient mice were partially resistant to endotoxin-induced liver apoptosis and lethality.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-6, interleukin-6; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-6, interleukin-6; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. α is a potent cytokine produced by many cell types that exerts pleiotropic functions, mediating inflammation, immunity, and modulation of cell death, differentiation, and survival (1Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar, 2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Google Scholar). As a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human disorders, including sepsis, diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory diseases (3Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Google Scholar, 4McDermott M.F. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 619-635Google Scholar, 5Aggarwal B.B. Nat Rev Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Google Scholar). TNFα elicits its biological effects through binding to two cell surface receptors, a 60-kDa receptor (TNFαRSF1A or CD120a) and a 80-kDa receptor (TNFαRSF1B or CD120b), which belong to a superfamily of proteins regulating host defense, organogenesis, immune, and inflammatory responses (5Aggarwal B.B. Nat Rev Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Google Scholar, 6Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Google Scholar, 7Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L.

Most TNFα activities appear to be mediated by CD120a. These are signaled through a complex network of intracellular pathways that involve adapter proteins and lead to activation of the caspase cascade or AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors (1Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar, 6Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Google Scholar, 7Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L.

The crucial role of the TNFα/CD120a system in host defense and immunity is well illustrated by the observation that mice lacking CD120a are highly susceptible to infections by intracellular pathogens but are protected from acute hepatotoxicity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after sensitization with the liver-specific transcriptional inhibitor d-galactosamine (10Pfeffer K.

Kontgen F. Althage A. Zinkernagel R. Steinmetz M. Bluethmann H. Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Google Scholar).In the last decade, sphingolipids have emerged as a novel class of biomodulators that can regulate a wide spectrum of cellular responses (12Hannun Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar, 13Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Google Scholar, 14Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Google Scholar). In particular, sphingomyelin metabolites, i.e. ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, have been shown to signal some TNFα biological effects (for reviews, see Refs. 15Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar and 16Malagarie-Cazenave S. Andrieu-Abadie N. Ségui B. Gouazé V. Tardy C. Cuvillier O. Levade T. Exp. Rev. Mol. Med. 2002; 2002: 1-15Google Scholar). Engagement of TNFα with CD120a has been reported to activate both acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases, resulting in sphingomyelin degradation and formation of ceramide (17Kim M. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Google Scholar, 18Dressler K.A. Mathias S. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1992; 255: 1715-1718Google Scholar, 19Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A.

This lipid molecule and/or its metabolites are believed to mediate various TNFα-induced responses, including differentiation of leukemic cells, IL-6 secretion by osteoblasts, and apoptosis of various cell types (16Malagarie-Cazenave S.

Tokuda H. Uematsu T. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 435-441Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, however, TNFα stimulation of sphingosine kinase is accompanied by cell survival (23Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Google Scholar).TNFα-triggered activation of neutral sphingomyelinase is mediated by the adapter protein FAN (factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation), which binds a short motif of the intracellular part of CD120a termed the neutral sphingomyelinase domain (24Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Google Scholar, 25Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Google Scholar). FAN is a member of the WD repeat family that is required for neutral sphingomyelinase-mediated generation of ceramide following cell stimulation with TNFα (25Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K.

Mice harboring a targeted disruption of the gene encoding FAN exhibit no gross phenotypic abnormalities but display a delayed (possibly TNFα-mediated) cutaneous barrier repair (29Kreder D. Krut O. Adam-Klages S. Wiegmann K. Scherer G. Plitz T. Jensen J.M. Proksch E. Steinmann J. Pfeffer K. Krönke M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2472-2479Google Scholar).To further investigate the physiological functions of FAN and based on the role of CD120a in the inflammatory response and liver failure, we have analyzed the response of FAN-deficient mice to LPS or TNFα challenges. Here, we show that after sensitization with d-galactosamine, these knockout animals are partially resistant to LPS- and TNFα-induced lethality.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCytokines and Antibodies—Recombinant human and murine TNFαs were purchased from PeproTech (Tebu-Bio, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-CD95 (clone Jo2) was from Pharmingen (BD Biosciences, Le-Pont-de-Claix, France), and anti-β-actin was from Sigma (L'Isle d'Abeau, France).Animals and Treatments—FAN-deficient (FAN -/-) mice were obtained from FAN +/- embryos (kindly provided by Drs. S. Adam and M. Krönke, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany) (29Kreder D. Krut O. Adam-Klages S. Wiegmann K. Scherer G. Plitz T. Jensen J.M. Proksch E. Steinmann J. Pfeffer K. Krönke M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2472-2479Google Scholar) that were implanted in C57BL/6 females (in Centre de Développement des Techniques Avanceés; CNRS, Orléans, France). Embryo freezing was done exactly after 10 backcrosses into the C57BL/6 strain. The mice were genotyped by PCR using tail DNA and the following primers: Typ4 (sense), 5′-CCT TAG TTA TCT CGG TGC CAG G-3′; Typ4rev (antisense), 5′-GGA AGC CAC ACT GCT ACA CAG G-3′; and Neo1500, 5′-TCG CCT TCT ATC GCC TCC TTG-3′. Each DNA sample was amplified with primers Typ4 and Typ4rev (giving a 1000-bp product in wild-type and heterozygous mice), and, independently, with all three primers (giving either a 1000-bp product in wild-type mice or a 800-bp fragment in FAN -/- mice). FAN +/+ mice obtained from heterozygous breeding pairs served as controls. IL-6-deficient mice, maintained in C57BL/6 background (31Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Google Scholar), were obtained from Drs. M. Thomsen and F. Bayard (Institut Louis Bugnard, Toulouse, France). All of the animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and maintained on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle with lights on at 07.00. The animal studies were ethically approved and carried out in agreement with national and international policies.At the age of 7–10 weeks, mice (weighing ∼20–25 g) were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of d-galactosamine (20Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Google Scholar mg; Sigma) followed by either intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.1–10 μg; Salmonella minnesota; Sigma) or intravenous injection of murine recombinant TNFα (1–10 μg/kg of body weight) in a total volume of 0.1 ml of PBS alone or PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, respectively. Alternatively, mice received intraperitoneally only LPS (100 μg) or anti-CD95 antibody (0.36 μg/g of body weight) in PBS. The animals were continuously monitored for survival. Any animal that appeared moribund was euthanized to avoid undue pain and suffering. Blood was collected by retro-orbital puncture for the determination of cytokine concentrations and liver enzyme activities. The mice were sacrificed at designated time points for histology and biochemical studies under anesthesia. The right lateral lobe of the liver was preserved for routine histology, and the remainder of the tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.Histological Analyses—Liver specimens were rapidly washed with saline and immediately fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde. Five-μm sections were obtained from paraffin-embedded blocks and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Liver injury was assessed (by a blinded pathologist) by evaluating lobular necrosis, presence of apoptotic bodies, hemorrhage (peliosis hepatis), and portal inflammation.Detection of DNA Fragmentation—Frozen liver specimens (∼0.2 g) were homogenized with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.5 mg of proteinase K/ml. After incubation for 1 h at 50 °C, the lysates were centrifuged for 15,000 × g for 5 min. DNA in the supernatants was extracted using phenol/chloroform and treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of RNase A to eliminate overlapping bands of RNA. The sample equivalents to 25 μg DNA were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV illumination.Determination of Caspase Activity—Effector caspase activity was measured on liver lysates using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Bachem, Voisins-Le-Bretonneux, France) as described (32Cuvillier O. Edsall L. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15691-15700Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared by homogenizing liver specimens (∼100 mg) in 1 ml of ice-cold DEVDase buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) with a Dounce homogenizer. DEVDase activity was determined by incubating at room temperature for 30 min the 300 × g supernatant with 40 μm of the substrate. Fluorescence intensity was recorded on a Jobin-Yvon spectrofluorometer at 351 and 430 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Alternatively, caspase-3 cleavage was examined by Western blot using a rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody that recognizes the cleaved forms (Cell Signaling-Ozyme, St Quentinen-Yvelines, France).Lipid Concentration Measurements—The lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol from the liver lysates prepared for DEVDase assay. Aliquots of lipid extracts were used for determining total phospholipid and sphingomyelin contents by measuring inorganic phosphorus before and after mild alkaline methanolysis (33Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Google Scholar). The ceramide content was determined using Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (kindly provided by Drs. D. Perry and Y. A. Hannun, Charleston, SC) and [γ-32P]ATP (6 000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously reported (34Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Google Scholar).Cell Culture—SV40-transformed fibroblasts from wild-type and FAN -/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. S. Adam (Kiel, Germany) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Human SV40-transformed skin fibroblasts transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3) or with a plasmid carrying a truncated version (encoding amino acids 703–917) of the FAN cDNA (pcDNA3-ΔFAN) were obtained as described (28Ségui B. Cuvillier O. Adam-Klages S. Garcia V. Malagarie-Cazenave S. Lévêque S. Caspar-Bauguil S. Coudert J. Salvayre R. Krönke M. Levade T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 143-151Google Scholar). Transfected cells were maintained in the presence of G418 (0.2 mg/ml). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected by lavage of the peritoneal cavity with serum-free medium and then cultured in Macrophage-SFM medium (Invitrogen). Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test. Mycoplasma contamination was checked by PCR using appropriate primers.IL-6 and TNFα Assay—Cultured cells were stimulated under serum-free and nontoxic conditions. Unless otherwise stated, culture medium was collected after a 24-h incubation. The cells were harvested to determine viability and protein content (to ensure that wells contained similar cell numbers). IL-6 in serum or extracellular medium was quantified by enzyme immunoassay using a kit (Immunotech, Marseille, France) or a set (Pharmingen) for the human and murine cytokine, respectively. Murine TNFα was similarly quantified using an EIA set from Pharmingen.Other Determinations—Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartic aminotransferase activities were determined using an Ektachem 950 automatic analyzer. The cell surface expression of CD120a was assessed by flow cytometry using a rat anti-mouse CD120a antibody conjugated to R-phycoerythrin (Serotec, Cergy, France) on a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson) cytometer. The protein content was determined using bicinchoninic acid.Statistical Studies—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. and are the averages of at least three values/experiment. The mean values were compared using the Student's t test. For the animal studies, Kaplan-Meier survival rates were compared using the log rank test. When 75% or 50% survival times were compared, the Student's t test was employed.RESULTSd-Galactosamine-sensitized FAN-deficient Mice Partially Resist LPS—Sensitivity of mice to LPS injection after sensitization with d-galactosamine is known to critically depend on functional TNFα/CD120a signaling (10Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Kronke M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Google Scholar, 11Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lotscher H. Lang Y. Koebel P. Kontgen F. Althage A. Zinkernagel R. Steinmetz M. Bluethmann H. Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Google Scholar). Because FAN has been reported to transduce some TNFα signals through CD120a, we tested the susceptibility of FAN-deficient mice to titrated doses of LPS. FAN-deficient and wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with varying doses of LPS, and survival was monitored. As previously observed, the mice were unsensitive to LPS (100 μg) in the absence of pretreatment with d-galactosamine (Table I). As indicated in Table I and illustrated in Fig. 1, after sensitization with d-galactosamine FAN-deficient animals were more resistant to the lethal effects of low doses (0.1–10 μg) of LPS than their control counterparts.Table ISusceptibility of FAN -/- mice to the lethal effects of LPS The mice received intraperitoneally d-galactosamine (GalN) and/or LPS, and lethality was monitored up to 72 h.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 3480-3486Google Scholar), we analyzed histologically and biochemically the livers of FAN-deficient and wild-type mice challenged with d-galactosamine and LPS. No significant genotype-dependent differences could be morphologically observed in the extent of parenchymal damage characterized by apoptosis, caspase activation (as assessed by DEVDase activity or, alternatively, immunoblotting for caspase-3), and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2). Accordingly, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartic aminotransferase activities were similarly elevated in the two animal groups (data not shown).Fig. 2Induction of apoptosis in livers of d-galactosamine-sensitized wild-type and FAN-deficient mice treated with LPS. Liver specimens were harvested 5–6 h after LPS (10 μg) injection.

D, analysis of DNA fragmentation. Liver genomic DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Lane M, DNA marker. Samples from untreated animals showed no laddering but sometimes a smeary pattern (data not shown). E, hepatic content of ceramide in FAN +/+ and FAN -/- mice. Liver concentration of ceramide was determined using the diacylglycerol kinase assay and is expressed as the ratio to liver sphingomyelin concentration. In control mice, concentrations of sphingomyelin and ceramide averaged 4052 and 190 nmol/g of fresh tissue, respectively (i.e. 104 and 4.9 nmol/μmol of lipid phosphorus). The numbers of mice and the p values for statistical analysis are indicated in the plots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)However, the ceramide content of the livers from FAN-deficient mice was lower than that found in the livers from control animals (Fig. 2E), although they were still elevated as compared with untreated mice (the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio reached 166 and 257% in FAN-deficient and wild-type mice, respectively). This finding is consistent with the notion that FAN is required for CD120a-mediated formation of ceramide via activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (29Kreder D. Krut O. Adam-Klages S. Wiegmann K.

As shown in Fig. 3, FAN knockout mice were less sensitive to rather low doses (2.5 to 5 μg/kg) of TNFα than wild-type mice. This partial resistance was overcome by increasing the TNFα dose (Fig. 3). Moreover, a comparable susceptibility of mutant and control mice to the lethal effects of an anti-CD95 agonist antibody was seen (data not shown), indicating that not all death receptor pathways are affected in FAN-deficient animals. As observed for LPS-induced liver injury, hepatic damage (as assessed by histopathology and measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartic aminotransferase activities), caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation were essentially the same in FAN-deficient and wild-type mice (data not shown).Fig. 3Mice survival after intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (20 mg) followed by intravenous injection of murine TNFα (1–10 μg/kg of body weight). The numbers of mice are given in the plots. The log rank test indicated a statistically significant difference (p < 0.03) in survival between the two animal groups for the 3.5 μg/kg TNFα dose but not for the other doses. However, actuarial analysis of the 75% (as well as 50%) survival times showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the two animal groups for the 2.5-, 3.5-, and 5-μg/kg TNFα doses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Impaired IL-6 Secretion in FAN-deficient Mice—The inflammatory response initiated by LPS and mediated by TNFα implicates the production and release of other cytokines such as IL-6 (6Vandenabeele P.

Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1185-1195Google Scholar). As a potential mediator of TNFα, ceramide has been shown to stimulate IL-6 secretion (e.g. (22Shinoda J. Kozawa O. Tokuda H. Uematsu T.

Because FAN regulates TNFα-induced ceramide generation, we investigated whether IL-6 secretion can be modulated by FAN. First, we measured IL-6 in the serum of FAN-deficient and wild-type mice that were challenged with LPS. Injection of 10 μg LPS in d-galactosamine-sensitized wild-type mice resulted in a robust IL-6 secretion that peaked at about 2.5 h (Fig. 4B). Serum IL-6 levels were markedly lower (up to 2.6-fold) in FAN-deficient mice. When mice were challenged with 100 μg of LPS alone, serum IL-6 levels were also reduced in the mutant mice (Fig. 5B). Of note, serum TNFα levels were similar in the two animal groups (Figs. 4A and 5A). In the serum from animals injected with TNFα, IL-6 levels in mutant mice were 36 ± 5% lower than in wild-type animals (n = 18 mice), where the levels averaged 480 and 790 pg/ml at 2 and 3.5 h, respectively.Fig. 4Serum concentrations of TNFα (A) and IL-6 (B) in FAN +/+ and FAN -/-mice after challenge with d-galactosamine (20 mg) and LPS (10 μg).

Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from FAN-deficient and wild-type mice and treated with LPS. As shown in Fig. 6A, mutant macrophages secreted less IL-6 than their normal counterparts. IL-6 secretion by FAN-deficient resident peritoneal macrophages was also lower than that of control cells after challenge with 50 ng/ml TNFα (IL-6 secretion was 49 ± 32 and 11 ± 20 pg/ml in wild-type and mutant cells (n = 10 mice; p < 0.05). A similar difference was noted on thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). We then tested murine embryonic fibroblasts treated with TNFα. Again, mutant cells secreted less IL-6 than their normal counterparts (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, human and murine TNFα gave comparable results, indicating that these effects are mediated by CD120a because human TNFα specifically binds murine CD120a (6Vandenabeele P. Declercq W.

We isolated mutants resistant to paraquat from nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. One mutant named mev-4 was long-lived and showed cross-resistance to heat and Dyf phenotype (defective in dye filling). Genetic and sequence analysis revealed that mev-4 had a nonsense mutation on the che-11 gene, homologues of which are involved in formation of cilia and flagella in other organisms. The paraquat resistance was commonly observed in various Dyf mutants and did not depend on the daf-16 gene, whereas the extension of life span did depend on it. Expression of antioxidant enzyme genes seemed normal. These results suggest that chemosensory neurons are a target of oxidative stress and influence longevity dependent on the daf-16 signaling in C. elegans.

The life spans of animals are determined by both environmental and genetic parameters. Accumulating evidence in model organisms demonstrates the importance of genetic approaches with the findings that single gene mutations affect the life span in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and laboratory mice. The key to understanding longevity seems to lie in the network of cell maintenance systems that reduce accumulation of deleterious stresses. The life span of nematodes is controlled by the insulin-like signals from the nervous system (1Morris J.Z. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G.

It is invoked by reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IFT, intraflagellar transport. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IFT, intraflagellar transport. generated as chemical by-products of normal cellular metabolisms. Caloric restriction is shown to be beneficial in decreasing the production of ROS in metabolic pathways such as the mitochondrial electron transport system (13Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). Animals have evolved defense mechanisms against ROS; antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase work to eradicate ROS as a first aid (14Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7195) Google Scholar). However, much remains to be understood as regards the defense mechanisms in diverse tissues of vertebrates. To facilitate understanding of the mechanisms, C. elegans and D. melanogaster are frequently used as a multi-cellular model organism because powerful genetic analysis is possible.In C. elegans, longevity is affected by particular genes involved in dauer larvae formation (15Johnson T.E.

Although multiple factors seem to be involved in the longevity, there exist a positive relationship between the capacity to resist oxidative stress and the longevity (12Martin G.M. Austad S.N. Johnson T.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the target of oxidative stress is yet to be understood even in this model organism. To address this question empirically, we isolated mutants of C. elegans with altered sensitivity to oxidative stress using paraquat (methyl viologen) as a selecting agent. In this study, we report that one of the paraquat-resistant mutants with extended life span is defective in the che-11 gene that seems to be involved in the function of chemosensory cilia (33Apfeld J. Kenyon C. Nature. 1999; 402: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 36Perkins L.A. Hedgecock E.M. Thomson J.N. Culotti J.G. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 456-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We also examined sensitivity to paraquat in various mutants of chemosensory perception.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Culture Conditions—The C. elegans strains used were obtained from the C. elegans Genetic Center. Worms were grown and maintained at 20 °C on NG plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 as a food source as described by Brenner (37Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unless otherwise mentioned.Mutant Isolation—L4 larvae of wild-type N2 were treated with 50 mm ethylmethane sulfonate for 4 h and cultured to bear F2 progenies. The worms were cultured singly on 96-well titer plates containing bacteria in liquid medium. These worms were allowed overnight to lay eggs, and mixtures of the eggs and hatched L1 larvae were transferred to fresh NG plates containing 0.4 mm paraquat. After incubation for 4–5 days, the plates were examined under a microscope to find adult worms. Eggs from these worms were prepared individually by treatment with alkaline hypochorine as described previously (37Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and placed on agar medium containing 0.4 mm paraquat to isolate worms that can grow under the selective conditions.Genetic Analysis—Genetic crosses were performed as described previously (37Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assign a chromosome (LG V) to mev-4 locus, its linkage with the following genetic markers were examined: dpy-5(e61) for LG (linking group) I, rol-5(sc13) for LG II, dpy-1(e1) for LG III, unc-22(e66) for LG IV, dpy-11(e224) for LG V, and lon-2(e678) for LG X. To regionally map mev-4 locus on LG V, three factor-crosses were carried out with the following combinations of the markers: dpy-11(e224) unc-42(e270), rol-4(sc8) lin-25(n545), him-5(e1467) unc-76(e911), rol-4(sc8) unc-61(e228), unc-42(e270) rol-4(sc8), sma-1(e30) unc-76(e911), and unc-42(e270) lon-3(e2175).Analysis of Brood Size—The eggs were prepared and allowed to hatch by overnight incubation in S-basal buffer. Hatched L1 larvae were transferred to NG plates and incubated to develop to L3–L4 larvae. Individual worms were transferred to fresh plates every 24 h, and the numbers of laid eggs were scored until the worms ceased to lay eggs.Assay of Sensitivities to Stresses—Sensitivity to paraquat was determined as described by Ishii et al. (38Ishii N. Takahashi K. Tomita S. Keino T. Honda S. Yoshino K. Suzuki K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The eggs, instead of L1 larvae, were placed on growth medium containing various concentrations of paraquat. After incubation for 4–5 days, the number of adult worms was scored. Sensitivity to thermal stress was determined as described by Lithgow et al. (20Lithgow G.J. White T.M. Melov S. Johnson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7540-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Briefly, L1 larvae were cultured on NG plates for 4 days. Then 50 adult worms were incubated at 36 °C on fresh NG plates, and their survival was examined at intervals. Similarly, 50 adult worms were placed on bacteria-free plates and exposed to UV light (40 J/m2) as described by Murakami and Johnson (39Murakami S. Johnson T.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then they were transferred to NG plates and examined for their survival during subsequent culture at 20 °C.Assay of Life Span—Life span was determined as described by Ishii et al. (38Ishii N. Takahashi K. Tomita S. Keino T. Honda S. Yoshino K. Suzuki K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). L1 larvae were allowed to hatch by overnight incubation in S buffer and transferred to NG plates to develop to L4 larvae. A hundred of the L4 larvae were transferred to NG plates supplemented with 40 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine to suppress the production of their progenies. The worms were examined daily, and dead worms, which did not move after we touched their heads with a platinum wire, were removed to count. The worms dead by desiccation at the walls of plates were excluded from the analysis. The worms on the plates contaminated by other microorganisms were also excluded from analysis because the life spans of the worms were affected by the concentration of dietary bacteria (40Hosono R. Nishimoto S. Kuno S. Exp. Gerontol. 1989; 24: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Staining of Chemosensory Neurons with FITC—Chemosensory neurons of worms were stained as described previously (41Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Thomson J.N. Perkins L.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Gravid adult worms were collected in S buffer, washed once, and incubated at 4 °Cin S buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml of FITC for 4 h. The worms were fixed with formaldehyde after washing with S buffer, and fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA samples were prepared from worms using the acid-guanidine-phenol-chloroform method as described previously (42Fujii M. Ishii N. Joguchi A. Yasuda K. Ayusawa D. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RNAs were resolved by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nylon membrane (Biodyne). The membrane was hybridized with each cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random-primed DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (43Fujii M. Ogata T. Takahashi E. Yamada K. Nakabayashi K. Oishi M. Ayusawa D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After washing, the filer was exposed to x-ray film, and the signals were quantified by image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film).DNA Sequencing—Sequences of the che-11 gene (C27A7.4) were amplified by PCR using mev-4(qa5000) and che-11(e1810) genomic DNA as templates and primers: 5′-ATGGAGGAGTTTGTTTTATTCC-3′ and 5′-TTACGAAACATTTTGTCTCCGT-3′. PCR products were cut into several fragments with appropriate restriction endonucleases and cloned into a plasmid vector. Several clones obtained from each fragment were sequenced with a DNA sequencer LI-COR 2000 (LI-COR) as described previously (42Fujii M. Ishii N. Joguchi A. Yasuda K. Ayusawa D. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of mev-4 Mutant—To isolate mutants with altered sensitivity to oxidative stress, we used paraquat as a selective agent. This herbicide is known to generate superoxide radicals in a living cell and confer oxidative stress in various organisms including C. elegans (38Ishii N. Takahashi K. Tomita S. Keino T. Honda S. Yoshino K. Suzuki K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 44Yamamoto K. Honda S. Ishii N. Mutat. Res. 1996; 358: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We screened a total of ∼2,500 F2 worms born from the wild-type N2 worms that had been mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate and isolated several mutants capable of vigorously growing on the selective plate. Among them, we successfully characterized one mutant named mev-4(qa5000) after purifying its mutation by backcrossing five times to N2 worms.This mutant was highly resistant to paraquat (Fig. 1A). For example, N2 worms hardly grew to adulthood in the presence of 0.3 mm paraquat, and none reached adulthood in the presence of 0.4 mm paraquat within 4 days. In contrast, all of the mutant worms grew normally under these conditions, and more than half of them grew to adulthood even in the presence of 0.6 mm paraquat. The mean and maximum life spans of mev-4 were 30 and 20% longer on averages than those of N2, respectively, when cultured at 20 °C (Fig. 1B). When cultured at 26 °C, they were 15 and 23% longer than those of N2, respectively (data not shown).Then we investigated sensitivity to thermal stress and UV light, both typical stress markers in C. elegans. When incubated at 36 °C, mean and maximum survival times were significantly longer in mev-4 than in N2 (Table I). Then adult worms were irradiated with UV light and cultured until all died. The mean and maximum survival values were not significantly different between mev-4 and N2 (Table I). We also examined fecundity in the mutant and N2 because the reproduction system is shown to affect longevity in C. elegans (30Van Voorhies W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Hsin H. Kenyon C. Nature. 1999; 399: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 32Arantes-Oliveira N. Apfeld J. Dillin A. Kenyon C. Science. 2002; 295: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). N2 and mev-4 laid 276 ± 15 (n = 19) and 280 ± 25 (n = 11) eggs, respectively, thereby showing no difference between these strains.Table ISurvival after exposure to heat or UV light in mev-4 and N2 n, number of individuals tested.

Linkage analysis revealed that the trait was concordant with the genetic marker dpy-11 located on LG V. Therefore, we regionally mapped mev-4 locus on LG V using three factor crosses with appropriate genetic markers. We obtained the following results: (dpy-11 unc42) (8/8) mev-4, mev-4 (14/14) (rol-4 lin-25 him-5 unc-76), mev-4 (4/4) (rol-4 unc-61), unc-42 (15/18) mev-4 (3/18) rol-4, sma-1 (1/20) mev-4 (19/20) unc-76, and (unc-42 lon-3) (29/29) mev-4. Thus, mev-4 mutation was mapped to a region close to lon-3 locus. This region contains che-11 locus. che-11 exhibits a defect in chemosensory perception because of irregular sensory cilial segments with the extension of the life span (33Apfeld J. Kenyon C. Nature. 1999; 402: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 36Perkins L.A. Hedgecock E.M. Thomson J.N. Culotti J.G. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 456-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested a possibility that mev-4 is allelic to che-11. As expected, the chemosensory neurons of mev-4(qa5000) were not stained or very weakly stained with FITC similar to che-11(e1810), whereas those of N2 were clearly stained (Fig. 2). Consistent with this finding, they showed a defect in osmotic avoidance (not shown). In addition, che-11 was found to be resistant to paraquat as mev-4 (Fig. 3A). We thus constructed worms (rol-4 mev-4/che-11) heterozygous for mev-4 and che-11 mutations and found that this heterogenote was as resistant to paraquat as mev-4 (data not shown). These results suggest that the two mutants are identical.Fig. 2Staining of chemosensory neurons with FITC.

Triple mutants were made by crossing mev-4 or che-11 to daf-16(m26) unc-75(e950) double mutant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sensitivity to paraquat and longevity in the triple mutants and their related strains were determined as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Based on the above data, we sequenced the che-11 gene (C27A7.4) that contains an open reading frame of 4,260 bp encoding a putative protein of 1,419 amino acids (Sanger Center web site and Ref. 45Qin H. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 457-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of mev-4 was found to have a transition from G to A at position 2,474, which results in conversion of 825Trp (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). che-11(e1810) mutant also had a transition from C to T at position 2,464, resulting in the conversion of 822Gln (CAA) to a stop codon (TAA) (Fig. 4). This putative protein is homologous to human hypothetical protein KIAA0590 with 29.9% identity and 55.4% similarity and Drosophila protein CG11838 with 24.0% identity and 49.4% similarity. This protein is also homologous to IFT140 protein involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT) in Chlamydmonas reinhardtii (45Qin H. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 457-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In Chlamydmonas, the biochemically identified IFT particle is composed of 16 polypeptides that can be classified into two complexes: complex A containing four polypeptides and complex B containing 12 polypeptides. IFT140 constitutes one of the complex A proteins with TRP motifs necessary for protein-protein interaction (46Piperno G. Siuda E. Henderson S. Segil M. Vaananen H. Sassaroli M. J.

Similar to mev-4/che-11, other cilial mutants in C. elegans seem to have a defect in its possible IFT complex proteins (45Qin H. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 457-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, when CHE-11 protein was expressed using a che-11::gfp construct in C. elegans, GFP fluorescence was found in IFT particles in sensory neurons (45Qin H. Rosenbaum J.L. Barr M.M. Curr.

Taken together, we conclude that mev-4 is defective in the function of chemosensory cilia.Fig. 4Schematic illustration of putative protein encoded by the mev-4/che-11gene.

However, levels of the residual activity to uptake FITC did not clearly correlate with their resistance to paraquat, because one of such mutants che-12(e1812) (36Perkins L.A. Hedgecock E.M.

Mechanical activity is also impaired in gastrointestinal muscles, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this pathological state have not yet been investigated. We showed, in mdx duodenal myocytes, that both caffeine- and depolarization-induced calcium responses were inhibited, whereas acetylcholine- and thapsigargin-induced calcium responses were not significantly affected compared with control mice. Calcium-induced calcium release efficiency was impaired in mdx duodenal myocytes depending only on inhibition of ryanodine receptor expression. Duodenal myocytes expressed both type 2 and type 3 ryanodine receptors and were unable to produce calcium sparks. In control and mdx duodenal myocytes, both caffeine- and depolarization-induced calcium responses were dose-dependently and specifically inhibited with the anti-type 2 ryanodine receptor antibody. A strong inhibition of type 2 ryanodine receptor in mdx duodenal myocytes was observed on the mRNA as well as on the protein level. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of type 2 ryanodine receptor expression in mdx duodenal myocytes may account for the decreased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and reduced mechanical activity.

Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal structural protein present in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles (1Gillis J.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 605-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that the lack of dystrophin expression is the primary genetic defect in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, functionality of smooth muscles in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and in mdx mice has received little attention. However, different degrees of disorders have been observed in mdx smooth muscles of the digestive track (impaired nitrergic relaxation and increase of spontaneous tone, Refs. 2Baccari M.C. Romagnani P. Calamai F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 282: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 3Mule F. Serio R. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1430-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and different clinical manifestations, including gastric dilatation and intestinal pseudo-obstructions, have been reported in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (4Barohn R.J. Levine E.J. Olson J.O. Mendell J.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Leon S.H. Schuffler M.D. Kettler M. Rohrmann C.A. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 455-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of dystrophin in smooth muscle contraction is still largely unknown. In skeletal and cardiac muscles, it has been suggested that an elevation in [Ca2+]i under resting conditions may activate Ca2+-dependent proteases inducing muscle damage (1Gillis J.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 605-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In fact, some groups have found a difference in [Ca2+]i between normal and dystrophic skeletal muscles from patients and mdx mice (6Turner P.R. Westwood T. Regen C.M. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7Bakker A.J. Head S.I. Williams D.A. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 460: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other groups have not been able to confirm these data (8Collet C. Allard B. Tourneur Y. Jacquemond V. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although an elevated subsarcolemmal Ca2+ concentration has been reported by studying activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels (9Mallouk N. Jacquemond V. Allard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4950-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An increased Ca2+ influx through cationic channels has been detected in mdx skeletal fibers, suggesting that a dysregulation of channel activity may be involved in this neuromuscular disorder (10Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Controversial data also have been reported for the peak Ca2+ responses upon stimulation. Some groups have found larger Ca2+ rises in mdx mice (7Bakker A.J. Head S.I. Williams D.A. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 460: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), others have found them to be similar to controls (11Head S.I. Williams D.A. Stephenson D.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and some have even reported reductions (12Rivet-Bastide M. Imbert N. Cognard C. Duport G. Rideau Y. Raymond G. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A key aspect of the Ca2+ signaling pathway is represented by its spatial and temporal complexity. Localized changes in [Ca2+]i are pivotal events in triggering important cellular responses such as contraction, secretion, gene expression, and metabolic activation.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that, in visceral smooth muscle lacking dystrophin, the Ca2+ responses evoked by the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism could be affected by the mutation. We addressed this issue by using patch clamp technique coupled to confocal microscopy with Fluo-4 to analyze Ca2+ signals, binding experiments, and Western blotting to evaluate the expression of ryanodine receptors (RYRs) in duodenal myocytes from wild-type and mdx mice. We show for the first time that the RYR2 expression is impaired in mdx duodenal myocytes and that this alteration may account for the reduced Ca2+ responses evoked by caffeine and activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Cell Preparation—The investigation conformed with the European Community and French guiding principles in the care and use of animals. Authorization to perform animal experiments (A-33-063-003) was obtained from the Préfecture de la Gironde (France). Wild-type control (C57BL/10) and mdx (C57BL/10 mdx) mice aged 5-8 months were killed by cervical dislocation. Isolated myocytes were obtained from the longitudinal layer of the duodenum by enzymatic dispersion as described previously (16Morel J.L. Macrez N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on glass slides in M199 culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were kept in an incubator gassed with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C and used within 8 h. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated mouse duodenal smooth muscle cells using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the instructions of the supplier. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed using a Sensiscript RT kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was incubated with oligo(dT) primers (Promega, Lyon, France) at 65 °C for 5 min. After a cooling time of 15 min at 25 °C, RT mixture was added, and the total mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The resulting cDNA was stored at -20 °C. The PCR was performed with 1 μg of cDNA, 1.25 units of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), a 1 μm concentration of each primer, and a 200 μm concentration of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate in a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 15 min, then 25-35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C (RYR1 and RYR2) or 56 °C (RYR3) for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. At the end of PCR, samples were kept at 72 °C for 10 min for final extension and then stored at 4 °C. Reverse transcription and PCR were performed with a thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Le Pecq, France). Amplification products were separated by electrophoresis (2% agarose gel) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The minimum detection of RYR amplification products was obtained with 15 ng of cDNA. Gels were photographed with EDAS 120 and analyzed with KDS1D 2.0 software (Kodak Digital Science, Paris, France). The relative amount of the amplification products was determined and normalized to that of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment. The identity of the PCR products was verified by DNA sequencing. Sense (s) and antisense (as) primer pairs specific for RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3 were designed on the known cloned receptor sequences deposited in the GenBank™ sequence data base (accession numbers X83932, X83933, and X83934, respectively) with Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequence and the length of the expected PCR products (in parentheses), respectively, for each primer pair were as follows: RYR1(s), GAAGGTTCTGGACAAACACGGG; RYR1(as), TCGCTCTTGTTGTAGAATTTGCGG (435 bp); RYR2(s), GAATCAGTGAGTTACTGGGCATGG; RYR2(as), CTGGTCTGAGTTCTCCAAAAGC (635 bp); RYR3(s), AGAAGAGGCCAAAGCAGAGG; RYR3(as), GGAGGCCAACGGTCAGA (269 bp) (17Coussin F.

Western Blot—The longitudinal layer of the duodenum from wild-type and mdx mice was homogenized in an appropriate volume of 10% SDS. After centrifugation (10 min, 2700 rpm), supernatants were collected, and the protein content was measured according to Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) from wild-type and mdx tissues were heated at 95 °C for 3 min in Laemmli buffer, separated by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (70 min, 100 V, 4 °C). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating membrane in phosphate buffer/Tween 20 (0.1%) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, and blots were incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with anti-RYR1 (1:1000), anti-RYR2 (1:500), or anti-RYR3 (1:500) antibody (19Jeyakumar L.H.

RYR subtypes were detected using an enhanced chemoluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were quantified using the KDS1D 2.0 software. Fluorescence and Patch Clamp Measurements—Measurements of [Ca2+]i were performed, in part, with an Indo-1 setup as described elsewhere (16Morel J.L. Macrez N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were loaded either with 1 μm Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min or with 50 μm Indo-1 added to the pipette solution and entering the cells after establishment of the whole-cell recording mode. [Ca2+]i was estimated from the 405/480 nm fluorescence ratio using a calibration determined within cells (16Morel J.L. Macrez N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly fluorescence ratios were calculated for each cell with a pipette solution containing 10 mm EGTA (Rmin) or after application of a 200-mV hyper-polarizing step causing membrane breakdown (Rmax). Rmin and Rmax values from control (n = 94) and mdx myocytes (n = 95) were 0.36 ± 0.05, 4.27 ± 0.03, 0.38 ± 0.05, and 4.44 ± 0.09, respectively. An intracellular value for the quantity K = Kdβ was determined according to Almers and Neher (21Almers W. Neher E. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) in control and mdx duodenal myocytes. β is defined as F480 (at Rmin)/F480 (at Rmax). K values from control (n = 94) and mdx myocytes (n = 95) were 979 ± 116 and 1357 ± 376 nm, respectively. These parameters were used to calculate the [Ca2+]i values according to Grynkiewicz's formula (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All measurements were made at 25 ± 1 °C. For other experiments, Fluo-4 (50 μm) was dialyzed into the cell through the patch clamp pipette. Images were acquired using the line scan mode of a confocal Bio-Rad MRC1024 microscope connected to a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Excitation light was delivered by a 25-milliwatt argon ion laser (Ion Laser Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) through a Nikon Plan Apo ×60, 1.4 numerical aperture objective lens. Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm, and emitted fluorescence was filtered and measured at 522 ± 35 nm. At the setting used to detect Fluo-4 fluorescence, the resolution of the microscope was near 0.4 × 0.4 × 1.5 μm (x, y, and z axis). Scanned lines were plotted vertically, and each line was added to the right of the preceding line to form the line scan image. Fluorescence signals are expressed as pixel per pixel fluorescence ratios (F/F0) where F is the fluorescence during a response and F0 is the rest level fluorescence of the same pixel. Image processing and analysis were performed by using Lasersharp 2000 (Bio-Rad) and IDL softwares (Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, CO). Voltage clamp was made with a standard patch clamp technique using a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (Darmstadt-Eberstadt, Germany). Patch pipettes had resistances of 3-4 megaohms. Anti-ryanodine receptor antibodies were added to the pipette solution to allow dialysis of the cell after a breakthrough in whole-cell recording mode for at least 5 min, a time longer than that expected for diffusion of substances in solution (23Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nurnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Flash Photolysis—Caged Ca2+, 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl) EDTA (1 mm, in the presence of 0.25 mm CaCl2) was introduced into the cell via the patch clamp pipette with 5 min allowed for equilibration. Photolysis was produced by a 1-ms pulse from a xenon flash lamp (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) focused to a ∼2-mm-diameter spot around the cell. Light was band pass-filtered with a UG11 glass between 300 and 350 mm. Flash intensity could be adjusted by varying the capacitor-charging voltage between 0 and 380 V, which corresponded to a change in the energy input into the flash lamp from 0 to 240 J. On flash photolysis, Ca2+ was released within 2-4 ms, and the small percentage of conversion of the caged compound (∼20%) allows the application of a second pulse without altering the Ca2+ responses (13Arnaudeau S.

RYR Immunostaining—Myocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml saponin for 20 min. Cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline, saponin (1 mg/ml), and either specific anti-RYR2 or anti-RYR3 antibody (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C (25Mironneau J. Coussin F. Jeyakumar L.H. Fleischer S. Mironneau C. Macrez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11257-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Then cells were washed (4 × 5 min) and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for 45 min at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were mounted in Vectashield (Ab-Cys, Paris, France). Images of the stained cells were obtained with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1024), and fluorescence was estimated by gray level analysis using Laserpix software (Bio-Rad) in 0.5-μm confocal sections. On each cell, fluorescence was acquired from a z-series analysis (20 ± 5 sections) using Lasersharp software (Bio-Rad) and expressed by volume unit. Cells were compared by keeping acquisition parameters (gray scale, exposure time, iris aperture, gain, laser power, etc.) constant. Nonspecific fluorescence (NSF) was determined when specific anti-RYR subtype antibody was preincubated with its antigen peptide for 1 h before application of the immunostaining protocol. When the cell fluorescence obtained with the anti-RYR sub-type antibody was higher than NSF, the cell was considered to be immunopositive, and specific fluorescence (F - NSF) was estimated. [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—Microsomal membranes from the longitudinal layer of mouse duodenum were prepared by homogenization with a Kontes Potter-Elvehjem pestle in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Microsomal membranes were obtained as a pellet by centrifugation of the supernatant at 40,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. Microsomal membranes were then resuspended in the buffer and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). [3H]Ryanodine binding was carried out as described previously (26Morel J.L. Boittin F.X. Halet G. Arnaudeau S. Mironneau C. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2867-H2875PubMed Google Scholar). For saturation experiments, the incubation medium contained 1 m KCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 37 °C), and 0.1 mm CaCl2. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, aliquots were filtered through Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed three times with 8 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4 at 4 °C). The filters were placed into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of liquid scintillation mixture, and the retained radioactivity was measured in a Packard 1500 Tri-Carb counter. The specific binding was defined as the difference between binding in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μm ruthenium red. Nonspecific binding accounted for less than 5% of total binding at 2 nm [3H]ryanodine. Solutions—The physiological solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH. The basic pipette solution contained 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 with CsOH. Acetylcholine and active compounds were applied to the recorded cell by pressure ejection for the period indicated on the records. Chemicals and Drugs—Collagenase was obtained from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). M199 medium, streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, and pyruvate were from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum was from BioMedia (Boussens, France). Indo-1 and Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester were from Calbiochem. Fluo-4 was from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montluçon, France). All other products were from Sigma. The rabbit anti-RYR3-specific antibody was directed against the deduced amino acid sequence, residues 4326-4336 (11 amino acids), of rabbit RYR3 (19Jeyakumar L.H.

Data Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E.; n represents the number of cells or experiments. Significance was tested by means of paired Student's t test when cells were their own control; otherwise an unpaired t test was used. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Ca2+ Responses in Duodenal Myocytes from mdx Mice—In control duodenal myocytes from C57BL/10 mice, dystrophin was present and located at the periphery of the cell sections, whereas dystrophin was absent in mdx mice (not shown). In freshly isolated single myocytes from control and mdx mice, the resting [Ca2+]i levels were estimated to be 61 ± 5 nm (n = 94) and 59 ± 5nm (n = 95), respectively, and were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Applications of caffeine (10 mm) or acetylcholine (ACh, 10 μm) activated transient increases in [Ca2+]i that have been shown to depend essentially on Ca2+ release from the SR (16Morel J.L. Macrez N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). With time intervals of 3 min between successive applications of the stimulating substances, similar Ca2+ responses were obtained in the same cell, indicating complete refilling of the internal Ca2+ store within 3 min (16Morel J.L. Macrez N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses were decreased by about 50% in mdx duodenal myocytes, whereas the ACh-induced Ca2+ responses were not significantly reduced when compared with control mice. As caffeine is known as a pharmacological activator of RYRs, we tested the effects of membrane depolarizations on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. In control mice, maximal Ca2+ inward currents in response to depolarizing steps from -70 to 0 mV triggered maximal transient Ca2+ responses (Fig. 2A). In mdx mice, the Ca2+ responses were reduced by about 45%, whereas the Ca2+ currents were similar (Fig. 2, A and B). Quantitative results indicated that Ca2+ current densities evoked by a depolarizing step from -70 to 0 mV were similar in control (13.4 ± 1.4 pA/picofarad, n = 13) and mdx mice (14.1 ± 1.1 pA/picofarad, n = 14). This current is due to activation of two different types of calcium channels: a typical L-type calcium channel and a second type resistant to dihydropyridines but inhibited by mapacalcine (27Morel J.L. Drobecq H. Sautière P. Tartar A. Mironneau J. Quar J. Lavie J.L. Hugues M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, in the presence of a mixture of 1 μm oxodipine and 5 μm mapacalcine for 5 min to block sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels, both inward current and increase in [Ca2+]i were suppressed during test depolarizations in control and mdx mice (not shown). As illustrated by the current-voltage relationships in Fig. 2B, the threshold potential and the potential corresponding to peak current were not different in control and mdx mice. The Δ[Ca2+]i-voltage relationship revealed that, in mdx mice, the peak Ca2+ responses were significantly reduced in the voltage range from -10 to +20 mV (Fig. 2B). To establish whether mdx mutation may reduce the loading of the intracellular Ca2+ store, we studied the effect of thapsigargin (a SR Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor) to deplete the SR. In myocytes from control mice, application of 1 μm thapsigargin (in Ca2+-free 0.5 mm EGTA-containing solution for 30 s) evoked a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i of 112 ± 14 nm (n = 11). In mdx mice, the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response was not significantly affected (110 ± 21 nm, n = 13). Taken together, these results indicate that, in mdx mice, the decrease of Ca2+ responses evoked by caffeine and depolarizing steps did not appear to be due to an inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels or Ca2+ loading of the SR.Fig. 2Ca2+ current and increase in [Ca2+]i as a function of membrane potential in control and mdx mice.

Various experimental conditions, such as applications of low concentrations of caffeine or Bay K 8644 (an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist) or low membrane depolarizations, have been reported to trigger and increase the frequency of Ca2+ sparks in vascular myocytes (17Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Applications of 5 nm Bay K 8644 (n = 79), low depolarizations (from -70 to -50 mV or from -50 to -20 mV, n = 41), or 1 mm caffeine (n = 35) were ineffective in inducing generation of Ca2+ sparks in control and mdx mice. In contrast, depolarizing steps applied from -70 mV elicited propagated Ca2+ waves. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, Ca2+ responses evoked by depolarizing steps from -70 to -30 mV were not statistically different in control and mdx mice, whereas Ca2+ responses evoked by higher depolarizing steps (from -70 to 0 mV) were reduced by about 40% in mdx mice compared with control mice (Fig. 3, A-C). These results show that inhibition of Ca2+ responses in mdx myocytes can also be detected in line scan images. RYRs can be directly activated by an increase in [Ca2+]i in the vicinity of the receptors as demonstrated previously in vascular myocytes (13Arnaudeau S. Boittin F.X. Macrez N. Lavie J.L. Mironneau C. Mironneau J. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Flash photolysis of DM-nitrophen (caged Ca2+) instantaneously elevated (within 2 ms) the Ca2+ concentration and evoked Ca2+ transients in the entire line scan image (Fig. 4A). Plotting the peak of the Ca2+ transients as a function of flash intensity revealed that the Ca2+-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in mdx mice was significantly reduced compared with control mice, particularly for high UV flash intensities (Fig. 4B). The Ca2+ sensitivity of RYRs can be estimated by plotting the ratio between the peak Ca2+ transients and the maximal Ca2+ transient at different UV flash intensities for control and mdx mice. The points appeared to be superimposed suggesting no changes in the Ca2+ sensitivity of RYRs in mdx mice (Fig. 4C). Applications of 10 mm caffeine evoked propagating Ca2+ waves in duodenal myocytes from control and mdx mice. The peak amplitude of these responses was reduced by about 40% in mdx compared with control mice (Fig. 8) in good agreement with the results obtained from experiments using whole-cell Indo-1 fluorescence. [3H]Ryanodine Binding in Duodenal Microsomes—The [3H]ryanodine binding in microsomal preparations was saturable, reached equilibration after 90 min of incubation, and remained stable for at least 180 min in control and mdx mice. Typical saturation isotherms of [3H]ryanodine binding to control and mdx mice are shown in Fig. 5A. Scatchard plots of specific [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 5B) revealed that the maximal binding capacity decreased by about 40% (control: 633 ± 47 fmol/mg of protein, n = 4; mdx: 382 ± 14 fmol/mg of protein, n = 4), whereas the dissociation consta"

The vertebrate enzymes are α2β2 tetramers, the β subunit being identical to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The main Caenorhabditis elegans collagen P4H form is an unusual PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI)2 mixed tetramer consisting of two types of catalytic α subunit, but the PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides also form active PHY/PDI dimers. The lengths of peptide substrates have a major effect on their interaction with the P4H tetramers, the Km values decreasing markedly with increasing chain length. This phenomenon has been explained in terms of processive binding of the two catalytic subunits to long peptides. We determined here the Km values of a collagen P4H having two catalytic sites, the C. elegans mixed tetramer, and a form having only one such site, the PHY-1/PDI dimer, for peptides of varying lengths. All the Km values of the PHY-1/PDI dimer were found to be about 1.5–2.5 times those of the tetramer, but increasing peptide length led to identical decreases in the values of both enzyme forms. The Km for a nonhydroxylated collagen fragment with 33 -X-Y-Gly-triplets but only 11 -X-Pro-Gly-triplets was found to correspond to the number of the former rather than the latter. To study the individual roles of the two catalytic sites in a tetramer, we produced mutant PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI)2 tetramers in which binding of the Fe2+ ion or 2-oxoglutarate to one of the two catalytic sites was prevented. The activities of the mutant tetramers decreased to markedly less than 50% of that of the wild type, being about 5–10% and 20–30% with the enzymes having one of the two Fe2+-binding sites or 2-oxoglutarate-binding sites inactivated, respectively, while the Km values for these cosubstrates or peptide substrates were not affected. Our data thus indicate that although collagen P4Hs do not act on peptide substrates by a processive mechanism, prevention of hydroxylation at one of the two catalytic sites in the tetramer impairs the function of the other catalytic site.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the PHY-1 polypeptide efficiently forms an active collagen P4H dimer with the human PDI (15Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Google Scholar). The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by P4Hs requires Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate and involves oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Google Scholar, 2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398Google Scholar, 3Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Google Scholar). The Km values of the collagen P4Hs for peptide substrates decrease markedly with increasing chain length of the substrate (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Google Scholar, 2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398Google Scholar, 3Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Google Scholar). This finding has been explained by a processive mechanism of binding of long peptide substrates (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398Google Scholar, 21de Waal A. de Jong L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 150-155Google Scholar, 22de Jong L. van der Kraan I. de Waal A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 103-111Google Scholar). According to this model the enzyme-substrate complex is formed at one catalytic site upon the first encounter, and before the first hydroxylation is complete, the other catalytic site has a high chance of encountering another region of the peptide substrate (21de Waal A. de Jong L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 150-155Google Scholar, 22de Jong L. van der Kraan I. de Waal A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 103-111Google Scholar). Such a mechanism leads to a low Km for a long peptide by overcoming diffusional constraints on the association between the enzyme and the various substrate sites present in the peptide. The processive mechanism requires the presence of two active catalytic sites. The catalytic sites are located in the C-terminal regions of the collagen P4H α subunits and contain four conserved catalytically critical residues, two histidines and one aspartate that bind the Fe2+ atom and a lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate (23Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Google Scholar). The peptide-substrate-binding domain of the collagen P4Hs is separate from the catalytic domain and is located between residues 138 and 244 in the 517-residue human α(I) subunit (24Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Google Scholar). To study the proposed processive reaction mechanism further, we determined the Km values of the PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer and the PHY-1/human PDI dimer for peptide substrates of different lengths, the PHY-1/human PDI dimer being chosen because it is formed much more effectively than any PHY/PDI-2 dimer. Lower Km values with increasing substrate chain length were observed in the case of both the enzyme tetramer and the dimer, the results suggesting that these occur on account of the higher affinity of the peptide-substrate-binding domain for long peptides rather than through processive binding. To study the separate roles of the two catalytic sites in one collagen P4H tetramer, we generated mutant recombinant C. elegans PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramers in which the catalytic site of one α subunit was inactivated by mutation of either the Fe2+-binding aspartate or the 2-oxoglutarate-binding lysine residue. The P4H activities of the mutant tetramers were markedly less than 50% of that of the wild type, indicating that the remaining single wild-type catalytic site in the mutants does not function entirely independently. Expression and Analysis of the Recombinant PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 Tetramer and the PHY-1/Human PDI Dimer in Insect Cells—High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured on plates in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Euroclone). The cells, seeded at a density of 0.6 × 106/ml, were coinfected at a multiplicity of 5 with viruses coding for the C. elegans PHY-1 (15Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Google Scholar), PHY-2 (20Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Google Scholar), and the C. elegans PDI-2 polypeptides (25Veijola J. Annunen P. Koivunen P. Page A.P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 721-729Google Scholar) or the C. elegans PHY-1 and human PDI polypeptides (26Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Samples of the Triton X-100-soluble supernatants were analyzed by 8% nondenaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Production of Recombinant Nonhydroxylated Collagen Polypeptides in the Yeast Pichia pastoris—To generate a Pichia strain expressing recombinant nonhydroxylated type I collagen α1 chain fragments of 510 and 100 amino acids, cDNA products originating from the codons for amino acids 683 and 1093 of the proα1(I) chain, respectively, and extending to the codon for the last amino acid of the collagenous domain were generated by PCR. These fragments had an artificial EcoRI site at their 5′ ends and a stop codon followed by a NotI site at their 3′ ends. After digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes, the cDNA fragments were ligated to an EcoRI-NotI-digested pPIC9K expression vector (Invitrogen) in frame with the yeast α-mating factor secretory signal. The constructs were linearized with SalI and electroporated into a GS115 Pichia strain (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (27Invitrogen Manual of Methods for Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Pichia pastoris. Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA2002Google Scholar). The strains were cultured in 100-ml shaker flasks in a buffered glycerol complex medium, pH 6.0, with 1 g/liter yeast extract and 2 g/liter peptone. Expression was induced in a buffered minimal methanol medium, pH 6.0, and methanol was added every 12 h to a final concentration of 0.5%. The culture medium was collected 60 h after induction, concentrated in an Ultrafree 0.5 centrifugal filter unit with a Biomax-5 membrane (Millipore), and the recombinant type I collagen polypeptide fragments were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of Mutant C. elegans PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 Tetramers in Insect Cells—The C. elegans PHY-1 aspartate 407 (codon GAT) and lysine 486 (codon AAA) residues were converted individually to asparagine (codon AAT) and alanine (codon GCA), respectively, and the PHY-2 aspartate 405 (codon GAC) and lysine 484 (codon AAA) residues to asparagine (codon AAC) and alanine (codon GCA), respectively. The mutagenesis steps were performed in a pVL1392 vector (Invitrogen) containing the full-length C. elegans phy-1 (15Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Google Scholar) and phy-2 (20Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Google Scholar) cDNAs using the QuikChange™ XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The recombinant baculovirus constructs were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen). The resultant virus pools were collected and amplified (28Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System; Instruction Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Sf9 or H5 Insect cells were infected with the individual mutant viruses, harvested, and homogenized as described above. The remaining cell pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS and expression of the mutant polypeptides was analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. To express mutant C. elegans P4H tetramers, the cells were coinfected with the viruses coding for the mutant PHY-1 and wild-type PHY-2 or wild-type PHY-1 and mutant PHY-2 polypeptides together with the virus coding for the C. elegans PDI-2. The cells were homogenized as described above and samples of the Triton X-100-soluble fractions were analyzed by 8% nondenaturing PAGE followed by Western blotting with a polyclonal PHY-1 antibody (20Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Google Scholar) and ECL immunodetection (Amersham Biosciences). The expression levels of the wild-type and mutant tetramers were compared by densitometry of the ECL films using a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). P4H Activity Assay—The P4H activity of the recombinant wild-type and mutant C. elegans tetramers and the PHY-1/human PDI dimer was analyzed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (29Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Google Scholar) using the peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (Peptide Institute) and the recombinant nonhydroxylated 100 and 510-amino acid type I collagen α1 chain fragments as substrates. The amounts of the wild-type and mutant enzyme tetramers were adjusted to be equal in the activity assay reactions on the basis of densitometry of the tetramer bands on the ECL Western blots of nondenaturating PAGE gels. In the case of the mutant tetramers produced with the wild-type PHY-1 and mutant PHY-2 subunits, the amount of activity generated by the PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer was subtracted from the activity values. The activity of the PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer was determined based on the amount generated in insect cells expressing only the PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer and densitometry comparisons of the amount of this dimer and the dimer formed in addition to the mutant tetramer. Since assembly of the recombinant PHY-2/PDI-2 dimers in insect cells is very inefficient, lying below the detection limit of Western blot analysis (20Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Google Scholar), the activity generated by the recombinant PHY-2/PDI-2 dimer was regarded as nonsignificant and was not subtracted. Km values for the peptide substrates of different lengths and for the cosubstrates Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutarate were determined as described previously (29Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Google Scholar). In some experiments the amount of 4-hydroxyproline formed was determined by a colorimetric method in samples hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl at 120 °C overnight (30Kivirikko K.I. Laitinen O. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 19: 249-255Google Scholar). Increasing Substrate Chain Length Reduces the Km Values of the PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 Tetramer and PHY-1/Human PDI Dimer Equally—According to the hypothesis of processive action of the two peptide-binding sites in the collagen P4H tetramer, an enzyme with two such sites should be much more efficient in hydroxylating long peptide substrates than an enzyme with only one site, whereas the synergistic relation between the two sites should not be evident in the hydroxylation of short peptides (21de Waal A. de Jong L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 150-155Google Scholar, 22de Jong L. van der Kraan I. de Waal A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 103-111Google Scholar). To study the suggested co-operation between the two peptide-binding sites in more detail, a recombinant C. elegans PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer, i.e. a P4H with two peptide-binding and catalytic sites, and the PHY-1/human PDI dimer, i.e. a P4H with one peptide-binding and one catalytic site, were produced in insect cells (Fig. 1) and their Km values for peptide substrates of four lengths determined using an activity assay based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate. It has previously been reported that the Km for a nonhydroxylated full-length proα1 chain of type I procollagen, with a collagenous domain of about 1000 amino acids, is increased 5–10-fold when one of the two peptide-binding sites in the collagen P4H tetramer is blocked by a photoaffinity label, while this effect was not seen with a short 15-amino acid peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 (21de Waal A. de Jong L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 150-155Google Scholar). The substrates used here were the synthetic peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and recombinant nonhydroxylated 100 and 510-amino acid fragments of the α1 chain of human type I collagen produced in the yeast P. pastoris (Fig. 2). The two recombinant fragments have 11 and 55 potential hydroxylation sites, respectively, calculated from their amino acid sequence, while (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 have five and ten such sites. All the Km values of the PHY-1/human PDI dimer were found to be about 1.5–2.5 times those of the PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer (Table I), but the chain length of the peptide substrate was found to have an identical effect on both enzyme forms, as their Km values for the 510-amino acid fragment were 0.03% of those for (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and 0.8–1.4% of those for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (Fig. 3 and Table I). The effect of increasing peptide chain length on the Km values was also seen when expressed in terms of the molar concentration of the hydroxylatable -X-Pro-Gly-triplets (Table I). Interestingly, the Km values of the enzyme tetramer and dimer for the 100-amino acid fragment, when expressed per peptide, were 24 and 28% of those for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, respectively, although these two peptides differ by only one in terms of the number of possible hydroxylation sites. The Km values for this collagen fragment thus clearly corresponded to the number of all -X-Y-Gly-triplets in it rather than the number of -X-Pro-Gly-triplets (Table I).Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant nonhydroxylated type I collagen α1 chain fragments expressed in the yeast P. pastoris. Medium samples from yeast strains expressing the 100 and 510-amino acid fragments of the α1(I) chain (lanes 1 and 2), respectively, were concentrated and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IKm values of the C. elegans PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 collagen P4H tetramer and the PHY-1/human PDI dimer for peptide substrates of varying lengths Km values were determined using soluble extracts of insect cells expressing the recombinant collagen P4Hs as sources of the enzymes.SubstratePHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2PHY-1/human PDIKm of peptideKm of -X-Pro-Gly-Km of peptideKm of -X-Pro-Gly-μM(Pro-Pro-Gly)5660330014907450(Pro-Pro-Gly)102525036360100-Amino acid α1(I) collagen fragment66610110510-Amino acid α1(I) collagen fragment0.2110.527.5 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Effect of increasing peptide length on the Km values of the C. elegans PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer and the PHY-1/human PDI dimer.

Baculoviruses coding for C. elegans PHY polypeptides in which the iron-binding aspartate residue has been replaced by an asparagine, PHY-1(Asp407→Asn) or PHY-2(Asp405→Asn), or the lysine binding the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate has been replaced by an alanine, PHY-1(Lys486→Ala) or PHY-2(Lys484→Ala), were generated and used to infect Sf9 or H5 cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The cell pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS, and the Triton X-100 and SDS-soluble proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In agreement with the data previously reported for the C. elegans PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides (15Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Google Scholar, 20Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Google Scholar), the mutant PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides formed insoluble aggregates and their efficient extraction required the use of 1% SDS (Fig. 4). The expression levels of the mutant PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides were found to be comparable with those of the wild-type polypeptides (Fig. 4). Inactivation of One Catalytic Site in the Collagen P4H Tetramer Inactivates the Enzyme by More than Half—To express mutant C. elegans collagen P4H tetramers in which binding of the iron atom to one catalytic site was prevented by a point mutation, insect cells were coinfected with viruses coding for PHY-1(Asp407→Asn) and PHY-2 or PHY-1 and PHY-2(Asp405→Asn) together with the virus coding for the C. elegans PDI-2 (Fig. 5). Correspondingly, to express tetramers in which binding of the 2-oxoglutarate to one catalytic site is abolished, insect cells were coinfected with viruses coding for PHY-1(Lys486→Ala) and PHY-2 or PHY-1 and PHY-2(Lys484→Ala), and PDI-2 (Fig. 5). The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a Triton X-100 buffer, and the soluble fractions analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE followed by Western blotting with a PHY-1 antibody (Fig. 6). All the mutant PHY polypeptides became assembled into mixed tetramers with the wild-type polypeptides, a small amount of wild-type or mutant PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer also being detected (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Nondenaturing PAGE analysis of the expression of recombinant wild-type and mutant C. elegans PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramers and the PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer.
