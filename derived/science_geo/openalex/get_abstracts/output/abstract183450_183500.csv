LTA from both organisms induced cytokine synthesis in human mononuclear phagocytes. Activation was LBP- and CD14-dependent, and formation of complexes of LTA with LBP and soluble CD14 as well as catalytic transfer of LTA to CD14 by LBP was verified by PhastGelTM native gel electrophoresis. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293/CD14 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were responsive to LTA only after transfection with TLR-2. Additional transfection with MD-2 did not affect stimulation of these cells by LTA. Our data suggest that innate immune recognition of LTA via LBP, CD14, and TLR-2 represents an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of systemic complications in the course of infectious diseases brought about by the clinically most important Gram-positive pathogens. However, the involvement of TLR-4 and MD-2 in this process was ruled out.

Care Med. 2001; 163: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). During the last decade, the relative number of Gram-positive bacteria responsible for bloodstream infections has steadily increased, and recent epidemiological studies revealed that Gram-positive microorganisms cause the majority of systemic infections in the United States and Europe (3Pfaller M.A. Jones R.N. Doern G.V. Kugler K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fluit A.C. Schmitz F.J. Verhoef J. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2001; 20: 188-191PubMed Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus, followed byEnterococcus spp. in the United States andStreptococcus pneumoniae in Europe, is the organism most frequently isolated during invasive infections, playing an important role in hospital infections (3Pfaller M.A. Jones R.N. Doern G.V. Kugler K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fluit A.C. Schmitz F.J. Verhoef J. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2001; 20: 188-191PubMed Google Scholar). According to the Centers for Disease Control, S. pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) is the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media in the United States. Furthermore, invasive infections caused by pneumococci are responsible for about one million deaths in children in developing countries yearly, comparable with Plasmodium spp. causing malaria, with respect to the number of incidents (5Greenwood B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). During recent years, spreading of multiresistant staphylococci (i.e. methicillin-resistant S. aureus, MRSA, Ref.6Diekema D.J. Pfaller M.A. Jones R.N. Doern G.V. Kugler K.C. Beach M.L. Sader H.S. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2000; 13: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and pneumococci (drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, DRSP), has raised major problems concerning therapy for these infections, especially in intensive care units in the United States and South America (7Metlay J.P. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2002; 15: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For Gram-negative bacteria the pathogenesis of septic shock has been elucidated with the isolation of its major outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1(8Glauser M.P. Zanetti G. Baumgartner J.D. Cohen J. Lancet. 1991; 338: 732-736Abstract PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 9Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Holst O. Brade L. Muller-Loennies S. Mamat U. Zahringer U. Beckmann F.

Immunol. 1996; 216: 39-81PubMed Google Scholar, 10Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar). LPS, an amphiphilic molecule or glycolipid, is commonly released by bacteria during growth and cell death (11Leeson M.C. Fujihara Y. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4975-4980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of systemic infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, aggregates of LPS as well as intact bacterial cells are rapidly opsonized by LPS-binding protein (LBP), a serum protein synthesized in the liver (12Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). LBP effectively catalyzes the transfer of LPS to membrane-bound and soluble forms of CD14 (mCD14 or sCD14, Refs. 13Schumann R.R. Latz E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 74: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 379Google Scholar). GPI-anchored mCD14 is predominantly expressed by cells of the monocytic lineage (16Goyert S.M. Ferrero E. Rettig W.J. Yenamandra A.K. Obata F. Le Beau M.M. Science. 1988; 239: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and profoundly sensitizes myeloid cells to minute amounts of LPS. However, it has been predicted to require a co-receptor for the initiation of cellular signaling caused by the lack of a transmembrane domain (17Haziot A. Chen S. Ferrero E. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 is a member of a family of receptors displaying homology in their cytoplasmic domains to the interleukin-1 receptor (19Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and playing an important role in innate immunity by recognizing molecular patterns of a wide range of bacteria and protozoan species and molecules related to viral infections (20Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,21Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). TLR-4 has been identified as a specific receptor for LPS leading to the induction and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and macrophages upon LPS stimulation (22Beutler B. Du X. Poltorak A. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 277-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To induce cytokine release by monocytes in response to extracellular LPS via TLR-4, however, an accessory host molecule termed MD-2 is required (23Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), which binds with high affinity to the ectodomain of TLR-4 and affects subcellular distribution of TLR-4 (24Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). In contrast, detailed information on the molecular patterns of Gram-positive bacteria interacting with the innate immune system is still lacking. In several previous studies two molecules of the cell wall, peptidoglycan (PG) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) have been found to mediate inflammatory responses in the host. PG forms the murein layer of the bacterial cell wall and has been repeatedly described to activate immune cells (25Heumann D. Barras C. Severin A. Glauser M.P. Tomasz A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dziarski R. Jin Y.P. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Gupta D. Wang Q. Vinson C. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14012-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). LTA represents a class of amphiphilic molecules anchored to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane in Gram-positive bacteria and is commonly released during cell growth, especially under antibiotic therapy (28Schneider O. Michel U. Zysk G. Dubuis O. Nau R. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Heer C. Stuertz K. Reinert R.R. Mader M. Nau R.

Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It causes cytokine induction in mononuclear phagocytes (31Bhakdi S. Klonisch T. Nuber P. Fischer W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4614-4620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Keller R. Fischer W. Keist R. Bassetti S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3664-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a synergism with PG has been described resulting in higher cytokine levels (33De Kimpe S.J. Kengatharan M. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R.

Immun. 2001; 69: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After the identification of TLRs, a number of controversial reports on the involvement of TLR-2, TLR-4, and MD-2 in LTA-induced cell activation have been published (24Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 35Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). However, although LTA is meanwhile regarded as an important mediator of inflammation (38Ginsburg I. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 171-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the recruitment of TLRs is still unclear, because in most of these studies commercial LTA preparations were used (24Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 31Bhakdi S. Klonisch T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), which not only display a high degree of compositional heterogeneity but are contaminated by significant amounts of LPS (39Gao J.J. Xue Q. Zuvanich E.G. Haghi K.R. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 40Morath S. Geyer A. Spreitzer I. Hermann C. Hartung T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, we have described a novel purification protocol for LTA from S. aureus based on a butanol extraction procedure (41Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). LTA from S. aureusextracted by this protocol lacks LPS contamination, and being of high purity was found to strongly induce cytokines in a human whole blood assay. These results were confirmed by largely analogous data obtained with chemically synthesized LTA (42Morath S. Stadelmaier A. Geyer A. Schmidt R.R. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1635-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). All LTA described to date exhibit a common molecular architecture consisting of a diacylglycerol-containing glycolipid anchor and a covalently coupled polymeric backbone structure (43Fischer W. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1994; 183: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Greenberg J.W. Fischer W. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, LTA from different Gram-positive species have been found to differ in the chemical composition of the so-called “repeating units” of the polymeric backbone (44Greenberg J.W. Fischer W. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. aureus, the repeating units contain d-alanine and α-d-N-acetylglucosamine linked to a central linear 1–3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain (45Fischer W. Mannsfeld T. Hagen G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This structural motif has also been shown to be valid in LTA fromEnterococcus spp., Bacillus subtilis, and some streptococci (45Fischer W. Mannsfeld T. Hagen G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the polymeric chain of LTA fromS. pneumoniae exhibits a strikingly different polymeric structure, consisting of tetrasaccharide repeating units that contain phosphorylcholine and are linked to each other by ribitol phosphate (46Behr T. Fischer W. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that heat-killed whole cell preparations derived from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae induce activation of transcription factor NF-κB in transfected CHO cells in a TLR-2 and CD14-dependent fashion (47Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that TLR-2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to infection by S. aureus, compared with the wild type-like immune response of TLR-4-deficient mice (37Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). These mice were furthermore highly susceptible to pneumococcal meningitis (48Echchannaoui H. Frei K. Schnell C. Leib S.L. Zimmerli W. Landmann R. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, the particular TLR signaling pathway activated by LTA fromS. aureus has remained controversial, and no information has been available as yet on the potential contributions of LBP, CD14, TLR-2 or TLR-4, and MD-2 in the interaction of LTA from S. pneumoniae with the innate immune system. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of LBP and CD14 in cytokine induction caused by LTA of S. pneumoniae andS. aureus. Of further interest was the potential involvement of TLR-2, TLR-4, and MD-2 in signal transduction by LTA. Our data show that LBP and CD14 are involved in TLR-2-dependent initiation of immune responses to both staphylococcal and pneumococcal LTA. LTA of S. aureus DSM 20233 (SLTA) was prepared by butanol extraction followed by purification using HIC chromatography as described previously (41Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae strain R6 (49Holtje J.V. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6072-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by E. Tuomanen, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, was cultured in CSL medium to late log phase and harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Integrity of bacteria and potential contaminations by Gram-negative bacterial species were checked by Gram staining and microscopy. Pneumococcal LTA (PLTA) was extracted from defrozen bacterial cells employing a chloroform/methanol protocol as described earlier (46Behr T. Fischer W. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and then extracts were purified by HIC chromatography as described for the LTA of S. aureus (41Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide stacking gels (5%) and separating gels (16%) were cast without SDS. LPS and LTA preparations were mixed with 4× sample buffer and loaded onto the gel, and electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (68Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Gels were stained using the BioRad Silver Stain Plus kit (BioRad, Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturers protocol, except that gels were oxidized in 0.7% periodic acid prior to staining (50Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Colloidal gold staining was performed employing the colloidal gold staining kit (BioRad, Munich, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. For anti-phosphorylcholine Western blotting, gels were immersed in transfer buffer containing 25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 200 mmol/liter glycine, 20% methanol, and transferred to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting (Hölzel GmbH, Dorfen, Germany). Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Roth, Braunschweig, Germany) for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times. TEPC-15 (Sigma), a phosphorylcholine-specific IgA-antibody from murine ascites (51Cosenza H. Quintans J. Lefkovits I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1975; 5: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was diluted 1:250 in PBS/2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the membrane at 4 °C overnight. After washing, a rabbit anti-murine IgA antibody (Sigma), diluted 1:2000 in PBS/2% bovine serum albumin, was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After a final washing step, bands were visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) using Hyperfilm ECL films (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. To analyze binding of PLTA or SLTA to soluble CD14 (sCD14) and to investigate effects of LBP on complex formation, an automated form of non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed using the Phastsystem™ apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Highly purified LPS from Escherichia coli 515 was analyzed as a control. Briefly, LTA or LPS preparations at concentrations of 1.25 or 0.0625 μg/μl, respectively, were incubated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (d-PBS without magnesium or calcium; Invitrogen) in the absence or presence of 0.25 μg/μl recombinant human sCD14 (Biometec, Greifswald, Germany) at 37 °C for 10 min. For some experiments recombinant human LBP (Xoma Corp., Berkeley, CA) was added at a concentration of 0.025 μg/μl. For analysis of interaction of LBP with ligands, a set of samples was analyzed containing LBP at a final concentration of 0.25 μg/μl. After incubation at 37 °C samples were placed on ice and 4× native sample buffer (pH 7.6) was added. Native PhastGelTMelectrophoresis was performed at 4 °C by automated application of 1 μl of each sample to PhastGelTM Homogeneous-20 gels equipped with PhastGelTM native buffer strips. Electrophoretic separation was done at a constant voltage of 400 V. The integrity of sCD14 and LBP proteins during the incubation procedure was verified by adjusting native samples to denaturing conditions with the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2%, heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and PhastGelTM SDS electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, automated silver staining of native and SDS gels was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blood from healthy donors was drawn with heparin (50 units/ml) and diluted 1:2 in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). 30 ml were layered on 15-ml Pancoll (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and centrifuged at 600 × g at 21 °C for 15 min. The interphase was washed two times in RPMI 1640 and centrifuged at 600 ×g at 21 °C for 5 min. Thrombocytes were separated by another centrifugation step at 100 × g at 21 °C for 15 min. Remaining cells were diluted in RPMI 1640 containing 2% human albumin (Immuno, Heidelberg, Germany) and incubated in 96-well tissue culture plates for 2 h, followed by three washing steps with RPMI 1640 in order to remove non-adherent cells. Stimulation experiments were performed in a 100-μl volume in the presence of 2.5% human serum (Sigma) or recombinant human LBP (Xoma Corp., Berkeley, CA). The LBP preparation was found to be devoid of any endotoxin contamination employing a kinetic chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test (Bio Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium). For some experiments, cells were incubated with anti-CD14 antibody My4 (Coulter, Hamburg, Germany) prior to stimulation at 36 °C for 30 min. Stimulation was performed with PLTA and SLTA. S-Form LPS derived from Salmonella minnesota (Sigma) employed by us in earlier studies and shown to be devoid of any lipoprotein contamination (52Michelsen K.S. Aicher A. Mohaupt M. Hartung T. Dimmeler S. Kirschning C.J. Schumann R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25680-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) served as a control. For some experiments, cells were preincubated with muramyldipeptide (MDP, Bachem, King of Prussia, kindly provided by T. Hartung, Konstanz). After 4 h, supernatants were subjected to ELISA. Nunc Maxi Sorp ELISA plates were coated with 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-hTNF-α Ab diluted in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3 at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, samples and recombinant TNF-α (R&D, Wiesbaden, Germany) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing, biotinylated anti-hTNF-α antibody (BD Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) at 5 μg/ml was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min. Detection of bound TNF-α was carried out with ortho-phenylen-diphosphate (OPD, Sigma,) followed by measurement at 490 nm in an ELISA reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). Wild-type HEK293 cells and cells stably transfected with human CD14 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, transfectants were additionally supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Prior to transfection, cells were transferred to 12-well tissue culture plates at 3.5 × 104 cells per well and cultured overnight. After washing, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for hTLR-2 (0.002 μg), hTLR-4 (0.002 μg), hMD-2 (0.002–0.05 μg) β-galactosidase (0.1 μg), and the ELAM NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (0.25 μg) employing 4 μl/well LipofectAMINE® transfection reagent (Invitrogen). All plasmids were kindly provided by C. J. Kirschning, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany (69Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) except the hMD-2 plasmid, which was provided by K. Miyake, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. After 4 h, medium was changed, and cells were cultured in DMEM/10% FCS overnight. Stimulation was performed in DMEM without FCS for 16 h. Cells were lysed, and β-galactosidase and luciferase activity were measured using a kit based on chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Wild-type CHO cells stably transfected with human CD14 (53Hamann L. Schumann R.R. Flad H.D. Brade L. Rietschel E.T. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J.

For stimulation experiments, cells were cultured at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates without G418 overnight. Cells were washed with Ham's medium without FCS and transfection with expression plasmids encoding for hTLR-2 (0.01 μg), hCD14 (0.01 μg), β-galactosidase (0.1 μg), and the ELAM NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (0.25 μg) for 16 h was performed employing 0.8 μl/well FuGENE®(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were washed and stimulated with LPS and LTA preparations in 1 ml of Ham's medium for 24 h followed by lysis and measurement of β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. For some experiments, CHO cells expressing a mutant MD-2 defective in LPS-induced signaling (54Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A.

Enhancing effects of LBP, CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4 as well as inhibitory effects of anti-CD14 Ab My4 were statistically evaluated employing the Student's t test. Throughout the figures, p values of <0.05 are indicated by one asterisk, p values of <0.01 by double asterisks. Isolation procedures for pneumococcal LTA (PLTA) differ from any other known protocols for purification of LTA (46Behr T. Fischer W. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 55Holtje J.V. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To assess the purity and the structural integrity of the PLTA preparation extracted with chloroform/methanol and purified on octyl Sepharose, we performed periodic acid-sensitized silver stain analysis and anti-phosphorylcholine Western blotting (Fig.1). LTA derived from staphylococci displays a faint staining pattern when treated with silver staining reagents. Because of the higher carbohydrate content of PLTA, it exhibited a stronger staining pattern displaying two distinct major bands of ∼31 and 36 kDa in size. These failed to stain with gold colloid, indicating the absence of protein contamination (Fig. 1). Employing a phosphorylcholine-specific Western blot, the presence of phosphorylcholine could be demonstrated for the 31 and 36 kDa-size bands of the PLTA preparation as well as for a series of minor bands distributed in the 17–40 kDa range (Fig. 1 C). These bands most likely represent LTA molecules of different size present at lower quantities within the preparation. In fact, all bands detected by periodic acid-sensitized silver staining were also stained by the phosphorylcholine-specific immunodetection method. First, we tested the potential pro-inflammatory activation of human mononuclear phagocytes by LTA employing stimulation experiments with isolated peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) in the absence of serum. Both PLTA and SLTA induced TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner without substantial differences in the activation profiles (Fig.2 A). As compared with LPS, cytokine levels induced by LTA were lower, and under serum-free conditions, LTA had to be used at concentrations of up to 3 orders of magnitude greater compared with LPS to elicit comparable levels of TNF-α. Since synergistic effects of LTA and peptidoglycan partial structures in the activation of murine macrophages and human monocytic cells have been reported in prior studies (33De Kimpe S.J.

Here, an isoform of TRPM2 was identified in normal human bone marrow that consists of the TRPM2 N terminus and the first two predicted transmembrane domains. Because of alternative splicing, a stop codon (TAG) is located at the splice junction between exons 16 and 17, resulting in deletion of the four C-terminal transmembrane domains, the putative calcium-permeable pore region, and the entire C terminus. This splice variant was found in other hematopoietic cells including human burst forming unit-erythroid-derived erythroblasts and TF-1 erythroleukemia cells. Endogenous expression of both the short form of TRPM2 (TRPM2-S) and the full length (TRPM2-L) was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and localization of endogenous TRPM2 to the plasma membrane was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Heterologous expression of TRPM2-S in HEK 293T cells demonstrated similar membrane localization as TRPM2-L, and coexpression of TRPM2-S did not alter the subcellular localization of TRPM2-L. The direct interaction of TRPM2-S with TRPM2-L was demonstrated with immunoprecipitation. H2O2 induced calcium influx through TRPM2-L expressed in 293T cells. Coexpression of TRPM2-S suppressed H2O2-induced calcium influx through TRPM2-L. Furthermore, expression of TRPM2-S inhibited susceptibility to cell death and onset of apoptosis induced by H2O2 in cells expressing TRPM2-L. These data demonstrate that TRPM2-S is an important physiologic isoform of TRPM2 and modulates channel activity and induction of cell death by oxidative stress through TRPM2-L.

A widely expressed Ca2+-permeable cation channel, TRPM2, can be activated by micromolar levels of H2O2 and other agents that produce reactive oxygen species (3Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E.

TRPM2, also called LTRPC-2 or TRPC7, is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP)1 protein superfamily. This is a diverse group of calcium-permeable cation channels expressed on nonexcitable cells, related to the archetypal TRP,Drosophila Trp (5Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G.

The TRP superfamily, conserved fromCaenorhabditis elegans to humans, has been divided into six subfamilies. Mammalian isoforms share six putative transmembrane domains similar to the core structure of many pore-forming subunits of voltage-gated channels except that they lack positively charged residues necessary for the voltage sensor. One subfamily of TRP channels are referred to as TRPMs (3Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K.

Prior to implementation of a unified nomenclature for the TRP superfamily, this subfamily was also known as LTRPC, named because of longer open reading frames of ∼1600 amino acids (5Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of activation of specific TRPM are not known, some TRPM appear to have important roles in cell proliferation. For example, TRPM1 (MLSN) is expressed in melanocytes, and its level of expression correlates inversely with melanoma aggressiveness and the potential for melanoma metastasis (8Duncan L.M. Deeds J.

TRPM2 is activated by H2O2 and other agents that produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in an increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) (3Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M.

Heterologous expression of TRPM2 in 293 cells conferred susceptibility to H2O2-induced cell death, which correlated with the elevation in [Ca2+] i. Furthermore, suppression of endogenous TRPM2 expression in rat insulinoma RIN-5F or monocyte U937 cells resulted in significantly diminished Ca2+ influx and cell death induced by H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor α (3Hara Y.

These data strongly support the physiologic role of TRPM2 as an endogenous H2O2-activated calcium-permeable channel that mediates cell death following oxidative stress. In this report, a truncated isoform of TRPM2 was identified in human hematopoietic cells that lacks four of the six predicted C-terminal transmembrane domains and the putative pore region permeable to calcium. The short form of TRPM2 (TRPM2-S) was determined to interact directly with full-length (TRPM2-L). Using a digital video imaging system in which single 293T cells that express transfected TRPM2-S were identified by detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP), cells that express transfected TRPM2-L were identified by detection of blue fluorescent protein (BFP), and [Ca2+] i was simultaneously measured by Fura Red fluorescence, the ability of TRPM2-S to suppress H2O2-induced calcium influx through TRPM2-L was demonstrated. In addition, the short form of TRPM2 inhibited susceptibility to cell death induced by H2O2 through full-length TRPM2. These data suggest that the interaction between TRPM2-S and TRPM2-L is an important mechanism for regulating channel activity as well as the cellular response to oxidative stress. Jurkat cells, K562, AML-193, and TF-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). K562 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% FBS. AML-193 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 0.005 mg/ml insulin, 0.005 mg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 5% FBS. TF-1 cells were cultured in RMPI 1640 medium with 1 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and 293T cells were obtained from Dr. Dwayne Barber (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). Both were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. Peripheral blood from volunteer donors was obtained under protocols approved by the Geisinger Institutional Review Board. Human BFU-E were cultured in methyl cellulose medium, and BFU-E-derived cells were harvested at day 10 as described previously (18Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from human 293T, Jurkat, K562, AML-193, TF-1 cells, and BFU-E-derived cells. cDNA was prepared from RNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) for RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed for 35 cycles (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s). Primers for TRPM2 were 5′ primer (5′-TCGGACCCAACCACACGCTGTA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CGTCATTCTGGTCCTGGAAGTG-3′). Control 18 S rRNA primers used in RT-PCR were 5′ primer (5′-GAAAGT CGGAGGTTCGAAGA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ACCAACTAAGAACGGCCTG-3′). TRPM2 was cloned from human bone marrow Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by amplifying five adjacent cDNA fragments encoding the complete open reading frame of TRPM2 with five PCR reactions. The primers were chosen based on the published cDNA sequence of TRPM2 (GenBankTM accession number AB001535). For the first fragment, the primers were chosen to amplify the region between nucleotides 361 and 1572 (1447-nucleotide SmaI site); the second fragment was amplified with primers to the region between nucleotides 1350 and 2442 (1447-nucleotide SmaI and 2299-nucleotide NcoI sites); the third fragment was amplified with primers to the region between nucleotides 2261 and 3376 (2299-nucleotide NcoI and 3358-nucleotide AccI sites); the fourth fragment was amplified with primers to the region between nucleotides 3351 and 4351 (3358-nucleotide AccI and 4294-nucleotide NotI sites); and the fifth fragment was amplified with primers to the region between nucleotides 4243 and 5138 (4294-nucleotide NotI site and 4955-nucleotide stop codon). Each of these five fragments was sequenced following T/A cloning. Fragments 1–5 representing the published sequence of TRPM2 were cloned into pUC18 following appropriate restriction enzyme digestion to yield TRPM2-L (4.8 kb). The first segment was subcloned into pUC18 following restriction digestion with HindIII and SmaI. The second segment was ligated into pUC18 containing the first segment using the SmaI and EcoRI sites. The third segment was subcloned into pUC18 containing the first and second segments at the NcoI and EcoRI sites. The fourth segment was separately subcloned into pUC18 using the AccI andEcoRI restriction digestion sites, and the fifth segment was ligated into pUC18 containing the fourth segment at the NotI site. Subsequently, the fourth and fifth segments were subcloned into pUC18 containing the first, second, and third segments atAccI and EcoRI. For the short version TRPM2-S (3.0 kb), fragments 1–3 representing the isoform with the stop codon in the third fragment were cloned into pUC18 using the same restriction enzyme strategy described for TRPM2-L. For expression studies, TRPM2-L and TRPM2-S were subcloned from pUC18 into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and into pET-42b (Novagen, Madison, WI). TRPM2-L and TRPM2-S were also subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen) following amplification by PCR. For digital video imaging studies, TRPM2-L was subcloned into pQBI50 (QbioGene, Carlsbad, CA) and TRPM2-S into pTracer-CMV (Invitrogen). To demonstrate the presence of TRPM2-S in TF-1 cells and BFU-E derived cells, RNA was prepared from these cells, and cDNA was synthesized as described above for RT-PCR. PCR was used to amplify the third fragment between nucleotides 2261 and 3376 using the 5′ primer (5′-TCCCTCTACAAGCGTTCCTCAG-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-GGTGAGGTAGGAGTGGTAGACG-3′). The PCR products were subcloned into the T/A vector, and the insert was sequenced to confirm the presence or absence of the TAG stop codon. Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated to TRPM2 and affinity-purified by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). One of these antibodies (anti-TRPM2-N) was generated to an epitope in the N terminus of TRPM2 (ILKELSKEEEDTDSSEEMLA, amino acids 658–677) and recognized both TRPM2-L and TRPM2-S. A second antibody (anti-TRPM2-C) was generated to an epitope in the C terminus of TRPM2 (KAAEEPDAEPGGRKKTEEPGDS, amino acids 1216–1237) and was specific for TRPM2-L. Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed using in vitro translation products prepared with cDNAs for mTRPC2 clone 14 (19Vannier B. Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L.

The in vitro translation products were prepared with the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Human 293T cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent with vector alone, TRPM2-S, TRPM2-L, or both, in pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO. The cells were routinely studied 48 h after transfection. For Western blotting of whole cell lysates, the lysates were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following blocking, the blots were incubated with primary antibody (anti-TRPM2-N, 1:300; anti-TRPM2-C, 1:500; anti-V5, 1:2000 (Invitrogen); anti-TRPC6, 1:200 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel)), washed, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:2000). ECL was used for detection of signal. The crude membranes were also prepared from 293T cell pellets transfected with vector alone (pcDNA3.1), TRPM2-S, and/or TRPM2-L as described previously (21Chu X.

To determine whether anti-TRPM2-N and anti-TRPM2-C antibodies are able to immunoprecipitate their targets, TRPM2-S and TRPM2-L proteins were prepared from TRPM2-S and TRPM2-L cDNAs subcloned into pET-42b and expressed with the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system. In vitrotranslation was performed with labeling using TranscendTMBiotin-Lysyl-tRNA. TRPM2-S and TRPM2-L in vitro translated proteins were incubated with anti-TRPM2-N or anti-TRPM2-C antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was then added for 30 min, followed by washing and then boiling of beads to remove precipitated protein. Western blotting was performed with the supernatant and with pelleted proteins as described above, except that horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin was used for the detection of positive signals. To determine whether TRPM2-L interacts directly with TRPM2-S, 293T cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3.1), TRPM2-S in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO, TRPM2-L in pcDNA3.1, or both. The lysates were prepared from cell pellets and preabsorbed with protein A/G-agarose. 500 μg of each supernatant was incubated with anti-TRPM2-C (20 μg) or anti-V5 (5 μg) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G-agarose was then added, the immunoprecipitates were washed, and Western blotting was performed as described above. TF-1 cells were placed in each well of Lab-Tek Permanox Chamber Slides precoated with fibronectin. After 30 min, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Incubation for 10 min in 20% goat serum preceded staining with primary antibody (anti-TRPM2-N or anti-TRPM2-C, 1:50) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min in the dark. The slides were stained with propidium iodide (PI) in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 Confocal Microscope. 293T cells transfected with TRPM2-L in pcDNA3.1, TRPM2-S in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO, or both were plated on polylysine-coated chamber slides 24 h after transfection and incubated for 24 h more at 37 °C. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with primary (rabbit anti-TRPM2-C or mouse anti-V5) or secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate donkey anti-rabbit IgG; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA; Texas Red goat anti-mouse) as described above. The slides were stained with DAPI in Vectashield mounting medium to visualize DNA instead of PI, which could not be distinguished from Texas Red fluorescence. To visualize DAPI, the cells were viewed using a Nikon Opiphot-2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. The images were acquired with an air-cooled CCD SenSys digital camera from Photometrics (Tuscon, AZ) and processed using IPLab and Enhanced Photon Reassignment software programs obtained from Scanalytics (Fairfax, VA). 293T cells were transfected with TRPM2-S subcloned into pTracer-CMV, TRPM2-L subcloned into pQBI50, or both as described above. The pTracer-CMV vector contains an SV40 promoter driving expression of a GFP gene and a CMV promoter driving expression of TRPM2-S. The pQBI50 vector contains a CMV promoter that drives expression of SuperGlo BFP fused through a flexible linker to TRPM2-L. Successful transfection of 293T cells with TRPM2-S and TRPM2-L was verified by detection of GFP (excitation, 478 nm; emission, 535 nm) and BFP (excitation, 380 nm; emission 435 nm), respectively, in cells with our digital video imaging system (21Chu X.

To study changes in [Ca2+] i in transfected cells, we were not able to use Fura-2 as the detection fluorophore because its excitation and emission wavelengths overlap with those of GFP. Instead, we used the fluorescent indicator Fura Red (excitation, 460 and 490 nm; emission, 600-nm-long pass), a dual wavelength excitation probe. We determinedR min (minimum fluorescence intensity ratio (r) of the emission following excitation at 460 nm divided by the emission following excitation at 490 nm),R max (maximum r), and the constantsS f2/S b2 with Fura Red so that [Ca2+] i could be calculated using the formula [Ca2+] i =K′ D [(R −R min)/(R max −R)] (S f2/S b2). Transfected 293T cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded at 48 h with 5 μm Fura Red-AM for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of Pluronic F-127 to enhance loading. Transfected 293T cells were treated with 0–10 mm H2O2 and [Ca2+] i measured at base line and over a 20-min interval. Statistical significance of results was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. 293T cells transfected for 48 h with vector, TRPM2-S, TRPM2-L, or both in pQBI50 were treated with 0–10 mm H2O2 for 40 min. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Induction of apoptosis or necrosis was also assessed in these cells following treatment with H2O2 with the Vibrant apoptosis assay kit 2 (Molecular Probes), in which apoptotic cells are labeled with annexin V conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and necrotic cells are labeled with propidium iodide. TRPM2 has been reported to be highly expressed in lymphocytes as well as in granulocytes and other hematopoietic cell lines (4Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jungling E. Zitt C. Luckhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 17Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To study TRPM2 in human hematopoietic cells, the expression of TRPM2 in different hematopoietic lineages was first examined. RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from Jurkat (T cell lymphoblast cell line), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line), AML-193 (acute monocytic leukemia cell line), and TF-1 (erythroleukemia cell line) cells and from BFU-E-derived primary erythroid cells (18Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig.1. TRPM2 mRNA was highly expressed in Jurkat, K562, AML-193, and TF-1 cells. TRPM2 was also expressed, although at lower levels, in primary human erythroblasts at day 10 of culture, which are largely proerythroblasts (18Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRPM2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in 293 cells; these results differ from a previous report in which TRPM2 mRNA was undetectable in 293 cells (17Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), possibly because of differences in the RT-PCR conditions or in the 293 cells studied. No TRPM2 bands were observed when PCR was performed without the reverse transcriptase step, demonstrating that these products did not result from contaminating DNA. The identity of PCR bands was confirmed by sequencing. To clone TRPM2 for further study, a strategy was designed based on the published cDNA sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using Marathon-Ready cDNA from human bone marrow as the template, five adjacent cDNA fragments encoding the complete open reading frame of TRPM2 were amplified by PCR. Following sequencing, the fragments were ligated together to produce full-length TRPM2 (TRPM2-L). Sequencing of the third fragment resulted in two alternative sequences; one was identical to the published sequence, and the other included a TAG stop codon at nucleotides 2984–2986. This sequence is a result of alternative splicing of the 3′ end of the intron between exons 16 and 17. As shown on Fig. 2, this isoform, TRPM2-S, results in the deletion of the entire C terminus of full-length TRPM2, including the four C-terminal transmembrane domains and the putative pore region permeable to calcium. Because the TAG stop codon immediately follows the CAG encoding glutamine (Fig. 2), no unique amino acids are introduced in the TRPM2-S protein. The PCR products following amplification of bone marrow cDNA with primers for the third fragment of TRPM2 were subcloned into the T/A vector, and 13 clones were sequenced. The sequences of seven different clones were identical to TRPM2-S, and six were identical to TRPM2-L. To determine whether TRPM2-S is expressed in other hematopoietic cells, cDNA was also prepared with RNA from normal human BFU-E-derived cells and from TF-1 cells. As described above, PCR products amplified with primers for the third fragment were subcloned into the T/A vector, and the clones were sequenced. Four of eight clones from normal human BFU-E derived cells, and two of three clones from TF-1 cells were identical to TRPM2-S; the rest were id"

Their diverse biological actions are thought to be mediated by the products of specific but usually overlapping sets of cellular genes induced in the target cells. We have recently isolated a new human IFN-induced gene that we have termed ISG20, which codes for a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease with specificity for single-stranded RNA and, to a lesser extent, for DNA. In this report, we demonstrate that ISG20 is involved in the antiviral functions of IFN. In the absence of IFN treatment, ISG20-overexpressing HeLa cells showed resistance to infections by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus (three RNA genomic viruses) but not to the DNA genomic adenovirus. ISG20 specifically interfered with VSV mRNA synthesis and protein production while leaving the expression of cellular control genes unaffected. No antiviral effect was observed in cells overexpressing a mutated ISG20 protein defective in exonuclease activity, demonstrating that the antiviral effects were due to the exonuclease activity of ISG20. In addition, the inactive mutant ISG20 protein, which is able to inhibit ISG20 exonuclease activity in vitro, significantly reduced the ability of IFN to block VSV development. Taken together, these data suggested that the antiviral activity of IFN against VSV is partly mediated by ISG20. We thus show that, besides RNase L, ISG20 has an antiviral activity, supporting the idea that it might represent a novel antiviral pathway in the mechanism of IFN action.

IFNs also act directly at various steps of the viral multiplication cycle through the products of specific but usually overlapping sets of cellular genes induced in the target cells and involved in RNA and protein metabolism and signaling as well (7Der S.D.

Rev. Sci. Tech. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). PKR is a serine/threonine kinase that, after binding to dsRNA, phosphorylates the protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2 and the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (IκB), resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and specific transcription regulation (reviewed in Refs.17Clemens M.J.

RNase L is a dormant cytosolic endoribonuclease that is activated by short oligoadenylates produced by the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase after viral infection or IFN exposure (reviewed in Refs. 2Player M.R. Torrence P.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 55-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholarand 13Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Degradation of viral RNAs and cleavage of cellular 18 S and 28 S rRNAs by the activated RNase L lead to the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus preventing viral propagation (2Player M.R. Torrence P.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 55-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mx proteins are IFN-induced GTPases that interfere with the replication of some negative-stranded RNA viruses by perturbing the intracellular movement and functions of viral proteins (reviewed in Refs. 14Arnheiter H. Frese M. Kambadur R. Meier E. Haller O. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 206: 119-147PubMed Google Scholar and 15Pavlovic J. Schroder A. Blank A. Pitossi F. Staeheli P. CIBA Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 233-243PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are now clear evidences for the existence of alternative antiviral pathways beyond the PKR, 2-5A/RNase L, and Mx systems. These evidences were obtained by analysis of mice deficient in all three pathways. Triply deficient mice died 3–4 days earlier than wild type mice after encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection. However there was still an IFN dose-dependent increase in survival time after viral infection for both wild type and triply deficient mice (20Zhou A. Paranjape J.M. Der S.D. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1999; 258: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Moreover, cultured embryonic fibroblasts lacking RNase L, PKR, or both proteins still mounted a substantial residual IFN antiviral response against RNA viruses EMCV or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), suggesting that another presently unknown mechanism contributes to the IFN-dependent antiviral response (20Zhou A. Paranjape J.M. Der S.D. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1999; 258: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have isolated a human cDNA encoding an IFN-induced protein, which we have termed ISG20 for IFN-stimulated gene product ofM r 20,000 (21Gongora C. David G. Pintard L. Tissot C. Hua T.D. Dejean A.

Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 286-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). ISG20 is a member of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily that includes RNases (such as RNase T and D), the proofreading domains of the polymerase I family of DNA polymerases, and DNases that exist as independent proteins (23Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Homology within the superfamily is concentrated at three conserved exonuclease motifs termed ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII (23Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we have demonstrated that ISG20 is a 3′ to 5′ exonucleasein vitro with specificity for single-stranded RNA and, to a lesser extent, for DNA, suggesting that ISG20 could be involved in the antiviral function of IFN against RNA viruses (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Notably, ISG20 is the second known RNase regulated by IFN, along with RNase L (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this report, we have analyzed the ability of ISG20 to protect cells against various viral infections. We demonstrate that in the absence of IFN treatment, ISG20-overexpressing cells showed resistance to infections by VSV, influenza virus, and EMCV but not to adenovirus. A single amino acid substitution in the conserved exonuclease motif ExoII completely abolished both the exonuclease and the antiviral activities of ISG20, demonstrating that the protective effects were due to ISG20 exonuclease activity. We showed that the antiviral action of IFN against VSV was reduced in cells expressing the inactive ExoII mutant of ISG20 protein, suggesting that the antiviral activity of IFN against VSV is partly mediated by ISG20. Because ISG20 is a new RNase induced by IFN, these data support the idea that it might represent a novel antiviral pathway in the mechanism of IFN action. Human HeLa cells and mouse L929 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. HeLa cells overexpressing ISG20 (wt-ISG20) and the inactive mutant of ISG20 (mut-ISG20) were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) triply deficient in PKR, RNase L, and Mx gene expression were obtained from Dr. R. H. Silverman and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. HuIFN-α2a (intron A) was purchased from Schering-Plough. Mouse type I IFN was obtained from Dr. G. Uze. The full-lengthISG20 cDNA fragment was inserted into the pCiNeo expression vector (Promega) to generate the pCiNeo-ISG20 expression construct. The cDNA encoding the inactive ISG20 mutant protein was generated by site-specific mutation in the conserved ExoII motif (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and subsequently cloned into the pCiNeo vector to generate the pCiNeo-mut-ISG20 expression vector. For the transient transfection experiments, the cDNAs coding for wt-ISG20 and mut-ISG20 protein were subcloned into the pEGFP vector in the same open reading frame as the GFP to generate the pGFP-wt-ISG20 and pGFP-mut-ISG20 expression vector, respectively. HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure with either the pCiNeo-ISG20 or the pCiNeo-mut-ISG20 expression vector. Geneticin (G418; 1 mg/ml) was added to the culture medium 72 h later, and resistant clones were recovered after an additional 2 weeks of selection. ISG20 and mut-ISG20 protein expressions were tested by Western blot analysis with an ISG20-specific mouse polyclonal antibody. Stocks of VSV (Indiana strain) and EMCV were prepared from supernatants of virus-infected L929 cells. Influenza virus was obtained from Dr. M. Chelbi-Alix. The derivative adenovirus strain bearing a β-galactosidase-encoding reporter gene (β-gal-adenovirus) was obtained from V. Millet. Typically, 5 × 105 cells were plated on 6-well plates and infected for 24 h at 37 °C, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, with VSV, influenza virus, or EMCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 0.1. Cell cultures were then frozen and thawed three times. The supernatants were serially diluted, and the virus titers were measured alternatively by a plaque assay on L929 cells as described previously (25Blondel D. Petitjean A.M. Dezelee S. Wyers F. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by an end point method (26Millhaud P.G. Silhol M. Faure T. Milhaud X. Ann. Virol. 1983; E134: 405-416Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments were performed in 6-well plates by the LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent method (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and infected with VSV at an MOI of 0.1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Infection with adenovirus was performed in 6-well plates at 10 MOI in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS. After 2 h, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, placed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and then cultured for 24 h at 37 °C before the β-galactosidase assay using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega). Specific ISG20 antibody was developed from the ISG20-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein produced in the BL21-DE3 Escherichia coli strain and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. This material was injected into mice to raise a polyclonal antiserum. The polyclonal ISG20 antibody was used in Western blot analysis to detect endogenous ISG20 protein. Rabbit polyclonal anti-VSV antibodies were described previously (27Blondel D. Harmison G.G. Schubert M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Confocal immunofluorescence was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-VSV antibody (27Blondel D. Harmison G.G. Schubert M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were fixed for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde. VSV antigens were detected with a rabbit anti-VSV antibody (1:500 dilution) and revealed with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France). Slides were viewed using a Leika microscopic, and image files were processed with the Adobe Photoshop program. Cells (1 × 106) were resuspended in 50 μl of loading buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol) and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. The proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After a blocking step, the membrane was hybridized with the appropriate antibodies and then revealed by using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted by lysis in guanidinium isothiocyanate as described previously (28Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9653-9666Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RNA aliquots (20 μg) were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose/10% formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to 107 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA probe prepared by random priming (Invitrogen). Membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS (1× SSC = 0.15 msodium chloride and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 65 °C before autoradiography. The cDNA probes encoding the N, NS, M, and G protein of VSV were obtained from Dr. D. Blondel (25Blondel D. Petitjean A.M. Dezelee S. Wyers F. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization to a glyceraldehyde-3-phoshate dehydrogenase probe (28Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9653-9666Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used as an invariant control. We have shown previously that ISG20 is a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease that specifically degrades in vitrosingle-stranded RNA substrates (and, to a lesser extent, single-stranded DNA substrates) (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Homology within the superfamily is concentrated at three conserved exonuclease motifs termed ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII (23Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S.

In accordance with this information, a site-specific aspartate to glycine residue mutation in the ExoII conserved motif of ISG20 (mut-ISG20D94G; Fig.1 A) abolished its activity (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because IFN causes a strong induction of ISG20 expression (21Gongora C. David G. Pintard L. Tissot C. Hua T.D. Dejean A. Mechti N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,29Gongora C. Degols G. Espert L. Hua T.D. Mechti N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggested that the protein could be an active player in the antiviral action mediated by IFNs against RNA viruses. The potential antiviral activity of ISG20 against the VSV, a negative-sense RNA genomic virus (rhabdovirus), was evaluated by transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells. The cDNAs coding for both the wild type ISG20 protein (wt-ISG20) and the inactive ExoII-mutated ISG20 protein (mut-ISG20) were cloned under the transcriptional dependence of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pCiNeo vector. An empty pCiNeo vector was used as a negative control. The cells were transfected with 0.5 or 1 μg of each plasmid and then infected 24 h later with VSV at an MOI of 0.1. 24 h later, the productions of infectious viral particles were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of a typical experiment, presented in Fig. 1 B, show that the cells transfected with the wild type ISG20-expressing construct exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in virus production (54.2% for 0.5 μg of transfected DNA and 69.4% for 1 μg of transfected DNA), as compared with cells transfected with the empty pCiNeo vector. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. No protective effect was observed in HeLa cells transfected with mut-ISG20, confirming the specificity of the ISG20 antiviral activity. The virus yields were significantly higher in these cells as compared with the cells transfected with the empty vector, suggesting that mut-ISG20 protein might exhibit dominant-negative effects in vivo by inhibiting the basal activity of ISG20. These results also suggest that the antiviral action of ISG20 is mediated by its exonuclease activity. Because, in transient transfection experiments, only a part of the cell population is transfected and expresses the transgene, the antiviral effect observed is underestimated. To circumvent this problem, the anti-VSV ISG20 activity was determined cell by cell by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. To this end, the cDNAs coding for wt-ISG20 and mut-ISG20 protein were subcloned into the pEGFP vector in the same open reading frame as the GFP to generate the pGFP-wt-ISG20 and pGFP-mut-ISG20 expression vectors. The empty pEGFP vector expressing GFP protein alone was used as a negative control. HeLa cells were transfected with each plasmid and then infected 24 h later with VSV at 1 MOI. 16 h later, transfected cells were detected by green fluorescence, and VSV antigen expression was monitored by immunofluorescence using a rabbit polyclonal anti-VSV antibody described previously (27Blondel D. Harmison G.G. Schubert M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, when HeLa cells were transfected with the pGFP-wt-ISG20 plasmid, the GFP-positive cells that expressed the GFP-wt-ISG20-fused protein did not express detectable VSV antigens, whereas GFP-negative cells exhibited a high level of VSV antigens. At the opposite, all cells expressing either the GFP alone or the GFP-mut-ISG20-fused protein expressed VSV antigens. These data clearly demonstrated the VSV antiviral activity of ISG20. To further analyze the mechanism of ISG20 antiviral action, stable HeLa cells constitutively overexpressing the wt-ISG20 or the mut-ISG20 proteins were constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, mouse specific polyclonal antibodies directed against recombinant ISG20 protein were developed to characterize cells overexpressing ISG20 (see “Experimental Procedures”). According to the modulation of ISG20 mRNA after IFN treatment (21Gongora C. David G. Pintard L. Tissot C. Hua T.D. Dejean A. Mechti N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the 20-kDa protein detected by the antibodies was induced by IFN in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A). These antibodies were used to analyze ISG20 protein expression from stable clones. After Geneticin selection of HeLa cells transfected with either wt-ISG20 or mut-ISG20 constructs, clones expressing wild type ISG20 protein (wt-ISG20) or the inactive ISG20-mutated protein (mut-ISG20) were selected. The data for a representative clone of each population are presented in Fig. 2 A. ISG20 appears to be expressed at a 3.5 times higher level in wt-ISG20 than in HeLa cells transfected with the empty pCiNeo vector, as determined by densitometry analysis using National Institutes of Health Image software for signal quantification. A higher level of expression was obtained with mut-ISG20 protein, suggesting that the overexpression of wild type ISG20 protein could be critical for cell survival. Because cell proliferation could influence viral infection, we wished to exclude the possibility that variations in virus yields were the result of differences in the growth rate of selected clones. The growth curves established for each clone were similar, excluding this possibility (data not shown). The selected clones were then infected with 0.1 MOI of VSV. A stable population of HeLa cells transfected with the empty pCiNeo vector (HeLa/pCiNeo) was used to determine viral infection efficiencies. 24 h later, the viral productions were determined as described previously. The mean value of three independent experiments presented in Fig. 2 B shows a reproducible protective effect, ranging from a 2- to 3-log reduction of viral production in the wt-ISG20 HeLa cells, as compared with the HeLa/pCiNeo cells. A low ISG20 protein expression was sufficient to promote efficient protection against VSV. To determine whether the viral resistance observed was dependent on the amount of viral particles used for infections, an additional experiment was performed with 1 MOI of VSV. As expected, the amplitude of ISG20 viral protection was decreased when the cells were infected at high MOI (Fig. 2 C). Clearly, these data strengthen our findings in transient transfection experiments and demonstrate the role of ISG20 in the antiviral actions of IFNs against VSV. Because VSV particle production was significantly higher in mut-ISG20 HeLa cells, these data confirmed the dominant-negative activity of the ExoII inactive mutant of ISG20 protein. To determine whether ISG20 overexpression interfered with viral RNA expression, empty pCiNeo, wt-ISG20, and mut-ISG20 HeLa cells were infected with VSV at 1 MOI. 6 h after infection, the cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot for the presence of the four major VSV mRNAs encoding the viral proteins N, NS, M, and G (25Blondel D. Petitjean A.M. Dezelee S. Wyers F. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Blondel D. Harmison G.G. Schubert M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression of all the viral mRNAs tested was strongly reduced in the wt-ISG20 clone, compared with HeLa/pCiNeo cells or with the mut-ISG20-expressing cells. Hybridization with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (30Fort P. Rech J. Vie A. Piechaczyk M. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5657-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was used as an invariant control to normalize the Northern blot (Fig. 3 A). The effect of wt-ISG20 was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antibody able to detect the major structural proteins of VSV, the nucleoproteins N and NS (M r40,000), the matrix protein M (M r 25,000), and the glycoprotein G (M r 69,000) (27Blondel D. Harmison G.G. Schubert M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with the inhibition of VSV mRNA expression, a strong reduction in VSV antigen expression was observed in the wt-ISG20 clone as compared with mut-ISG20 and HeLa/pCiNeo cells (Fig. 3 B). The VSV antigens remained undetectable in HeLa-pCiNeo cells treated with 500 units/ml HuIFN-α2a used as positive control. We have previously shown that ≥90% of ISG20 RNase activity was inhibited when RNase assays were performed, in vitro, in the presence of the inactive ExoII-mutated ISG20 protein (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fact that the amounts of VSV produced by transiently or stably transfected HeLa cells with the mut-ISG20 construct were significantly higher than that produced by cells transfected with the empty pCiNeo vector strongly suggests that mut-ISG20 could exhibit dominant-negative effectsin vivo (24Nguyen L.H. Espert L. Mechti N. Wilson III., D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this inhibitory effect to test the contribution of ISG20 to the IFN-mediated antiviral activity. To this end, the antiviral action of IFN on mut-ISG20 HeLa cells was compared with that observed on HeLa/pCiNeo cells. The cells were treated for 16 h with 500 units/ml HuIFN-α2a and then infected with 0.1 MOI of VSV. 24 h later, the virus titers were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented in Fig. 4 show that overexpression of mut-ISG20 protein reduced the ability of IFN to interfere with VSV infection. These data confirm that the antiviral activity of IFN against VSV infection is partly mediated by ISG20. Because the different IFN-induced antiviral pathways described thus far present some virus specificities, we analyzed the potential ISG20 antiviral activity against two other RNA genomic viruses, the influenza virus (an orthomyxovirus) and EMCV (a picornavirus). The wt-ISG20, mut-ISG20, and HeLa/pCiNeo cells were infected with these viruses at 0.1 MOI. The viral productions were determined as described for VSV. As shown in Fig. 5 A, a strong reduction in influenza virus production was observed with the wt-ISG20 clone but not with mut-ISG20. However, this decrease in viral multiplication was lower than the one observed with VSV. On the other hand, only a weak protective effect was observed for EMCV (Fig. 5 B). These data show that ISG20 presents antiviral specificities among the viruses tested and suggest that this protein acts preferentially against VSV in the IFN-mediated antiviral barrier. Interestingly, the expression of mut-ISG20 did not affect the action of IFN against influenza virus and EMCV (data not shown), suggesting that the contribution of ISG20 against these viruses is probably minor in comparison with the other IFN-induced pathways. We also addressed the question of the ability of ISG20 to interfere with the replication of a DNA genomic virus. To this end, the HeLa/pCiNeo cells and the wt-ISG20 and mut-ISG20 clones were infected with a derivative adenovirus strain beari"

The nonionic detergent Brij 98 was used to isolate lipid rafts from microvillar membrane vesicles of intestinal brush borders at physiological temperature to compare with rafts, obtained by “conventional” extraction using Triton X-100 at low temperature. Microvillar rafts prepared by the two protocols were morphologically different but had essentially similar profiles of protein- and lipid components, showing that raft microdomains do exist at 37 °C and are not “low temperature artifacts.” We also employed a novel method of sequential detergent extraction at increasing temperature to define a fraction of highly detergent-resistant “superrafts.” These were enriched in galectin-4, a β-galactoside-recognizing lectin residing on the extracellular side of the membrane. Superrafts also harbored the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked alkaline phosphatase and the transmembrane aminopeptidase N, whereas the peripheral lipid raft protein annexin 2 was essentially absent. In conclusion, in the microvillar membrane, galectin-4, functions as a core raft stabilizer/organizer for other, more loosely raft-associated proteins. The superraft analysis might be applicable to other membrane microdomain systems.

The superraft analysis might be applicable to other membrane microdomain systems. Lipid rafts are ordered (lo phase) membrane microdomains consisting mainly of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the bilayer that serve as lateral platforms for many types of proteins in the cell membrane (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8188) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

The lipid raft hypothesis was originally proposed to explain how lipids and proteins are sorted to the apical surface of polarized cells (4Simons K. Van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), but in recent years the raft concept has expanded into other areas of biology, including signal transduction (5Simons K.

However, despite their popularity, fundamental questions concerning the functional relevance of lipid rafts in vivo persist (15Jacobson K. Dietrich C.

Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/67/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar). To complicate matters further, recent work has made it increasingly clear that the most commonly used experimental criterion for lipid rafts, detergent insolubility at low temperature combined with flotation in a density gradient (17Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar), may define different subsets of rafts, depending on the type of detergent used (18Roper K. Corbeil D.

A common current view considers lipid rafts as small, dynamic assemblies of lipids and proteins with the ability to cluster into larger ordered platforms that may serve in specialized, cell type-dependent functions, such as nutrient absorption, cell-cell communication, or endocytosis (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 14Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 492-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These developments have turned the raft concept increasingly complex, and underline the fact that much is still unknown about lipid rafts concerning their molecular organization, dynamics of assembly/disassembly, and mechanism of function. The brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes is a highly specialized cell surface involved in a multitude of digestive and absorptive functions (24Trier J.S. Code C. F. Handbook of Physiology: Alimentary Canal. 6. American Physiological Society, Washington, D. C.1968: 1125-1176Google Scholar). The microvilli of this membrane are particularly rich in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol (25Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and several proteins, including some of the major digestive enzymes, such as aminopeptidase N and sucrase-isomaltase (26Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Mirre C. Monlauzeur L. Garcia M. Delgrossi M.H. Le Bivic A. Am. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have been shown to reside in Triton X-100-insoluble lipid rafts. Microvillar rafts may well be unique in their molecular organization, because unlike most other types of lipid raft membranes, such as caveolae (30Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar), those prepared from microvilli are cholesterol-independent, and caveolin-1, a commonly used lipid raft marker in other cell types, is essentially excluded from microvillar rafts (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the present work, we aimed first to answer the fundamental question whether microvillar rafts are purely a “low temperature” phenomenon, created by the conditions normally used for detergent extraction. To tackle this problem, microvillar rafts were prepared by using Brij 98, a detergent recently described for isolation of the T cell receptor signaling machinery at a physiological temperature (20Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J.P. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Second, we studied in closer detail the molecular organization of lipid rafts prepared from microvillar membrane vesicles by sequential extraction with Triton X-100 at increasing temperature. Here, a fraction of “superrafts” was isolated and characterized with galectin-4 as the predominant protein. Altogether, our data show that microvillar rafts do exist also at a physiological temperature. In addition, the results underline the importance of galectin-4 functioning as a central organizer/stabilizer of lipid rafts in the microvillar membrane with other classes of membrane proteins depending, at least partially, on this lectin for their association with these microdomains. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to galectin-4, lactase, and aminopeptidase N were those described previously (29Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Hansen G.H. Sjostrom H. Noren O. Dabelsteen E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 253-259PubMed Google Scholar,33Skovbjerg H. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Danielsen E.M. Enevoldsen B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A rabbit antibody to alkaline phosphatase was from Biogenesis (Poole, UK), and a mouse monoclonal antibody to annexin 2 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled swine anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was from Amersham Biosciences. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin, Brij 98 (polyoxyethylene 20 oleyl ether), and lipid standards were purchased from Sigma, and DynabeadsTM M-500 Subcellular was from Dynal (Oslo, Norway). Pig small intestines were kindly given by Letty Klarskov and Mette Olesen (Department of Experimental Medicine, The Panum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark). Right-side-out microvillar vesicles were prepared from small intestinal mucosa by the divalent cation precipitation technique (34Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, mucosal scrapings were homogenized in 2 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm mannitol, pH 7.1, containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, using a manually operated Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 500 × gfor 10 min, and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After incubation at 15 min on ice, the preparation was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to pellet intracellular and basolateral membranes. Finally, the supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a pellet of microvillar membrane vesicles. One common preparation was used in all subsequent comparative lipid raft experiments with the two nonionic detergents Brij 98 and Triton X-100 as well as in preparation of superrafts. A lipid raft analysis by detergent extraction followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (17Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar) was performed essentially as previously described (26Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), with the modification that the extract was placed in a cushion of 60% sucrose with a gradient of 50–25% sucrose on top. Extraction with Triton X-100 and with Brij 98 was carried out on ice and at 37 °C, respectively. Solutions of each detergent (10% (w/v) dissolved in distilled water) were added to the microvillar membrane vesicles to a final detergent concentration of 1% (w/v). After centrifugation overnight, the gradients were collected in 12 1-ml fractions for subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Alternatively, the floating fractions were carefully collected by a pipette, diluted five times with 25 mm HEPES-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.1, and centrifuged at 48,000 × g, 1 h, to obtain a pellet of lipid rafts for further biochemical and electron microscopic analyses. Lipid rafts were prepared by extraction with Triton X-100 followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described above. Rafts contained in the upper six fractions of the gradient were harvested; resuspended in 25 mm HEPES-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.1; and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and re-extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the resulting pellet, termed “superrafts,” was collected. For lipid analysis of membranes, microvillar vesicles and lipid rafts were extracted with chloroform/methanol (25Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,35Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) as previously described (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the lipid extracts (120–130 mg of lipid) were subjected to thin layer chromatography analysis together with appropriate lipid standards on 0.25-mm silica gel 60 plates (Merck). Cholesterol was separated from other neutral lipids in petroleumsether/diethylether/acetic acid (50:50:1). Glycolipids and phospholipids were separated in chloroform/methanol/water (64:24:4). After chromatography, cholesterol was detected with a CuSO4/H3PO4reagent and glycolipids with a α-naphtol spray reagent. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis and transfer of proteins onto ImmobilonTM, Western blotting was performed with antibodies to galectin-4 (29Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), lactase (33Skovbjerg H. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Danielsen E.M. Enevoldsen B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), aminopeptidase N, alkaline phosphatase, and annexin 2. Blots were developed by an electrochemoluminescence detection reagent kit according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Superrafts and lipid rafts, prepared by extraction either with Triton X-100 on ice or Brij 98 at 37 °C, were isolated on magnetic beads, coated with antibodies to galectin-4 and aminopeptidase N, by a previously described procedure (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts, isolated from microvillar membrane vesicles using either Triton X-100 or Brij 98, were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 4 °C. After a wash in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, the lipid rafts were treated with osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in graded concentrations of acetone, and finally embedded in Epon. The superrafts and lipid rafts isolated on magnetic beads were fixed in glutaraldehyde, treated with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon as described above, with the modification that the entire fixation and embedding procedure was performed in Eppendorf tubes. Ultrathin sections were cut on an LKB Ultrotome III ultramicrotome, stained in 1% uranyl acetate in water and lead citrate, and finally examined in a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope equipped with a Mega View camera system. Postembedding immunogold labeling using an antibody against aminopeptidase N was performed on ultrathin Epon sections of lipid rafts and superrafts, as previously described (37Hansen G.H. Wetterberg L.L. Sjostrom H. Noren O. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The brush border of small intestinal enterocytes is well suited for studies on the molecular organization of a specialized cell membrane. Upon tissue homogenization, microvilli spontaneously form a homogeneous population of right-side-out vesicles that are easily isolated from other cell membranes by the divalent cation precipitation technique (34Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We have previously used flotation in a density gradient after Triton X-100 extraction on ice for isolation of lipid rafts and observed that several microvillar proteins partition differently into the rafts. Thus, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored alkaline phosphatase is predominantly (about 90%) and the transmembrane aminopeptidase N and sucrase-isomaltase partially (40–50%) raft-associated, whereas lactase is essentially excluded from microvillar rafts (26Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, galectin-4, a member of the galectin family of β-galactoside-binding proteins (38Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 39Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been identified as a microvillar protein that resides exclusively in rafts and forms clusters with some of the brush border enzymes (29Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present work, these microvillar proteins were used as probes for lipid rafts, prepared using either Triton X-100 or Brij 98. Fig.1 shows a comparison of the flotation properties in a sucrose density gradient of microvillar membrane proteins extracted by Triton X-100 on ice or Brij 98 at 37 °C. For both detergents, distinct subsets of proteins floated into the upper fractions, indicative of their association with lipid rafts. An overall comparison of the profiles of lipid raft-associated proteins isolated with the two detergents showed many common prominent bands, but some minor quantitative differences in the relative intensity of several bands were observed (Fig. 1). In addition, the densities of the rafts differed. Thus, rafts extracted with Triton X-100 were relatively homogeneous and of low density, whereas those extracted with Brij 98 were more heterogeneous in density. The specific distribution in the density gradient of the four microvillar proteins described above was revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2 A, galectin-4 was exclusively present in the raft fractions of Triton X-100-extracted microvillar membranes and also predominantly raft-associated in the Brij 98 gradient. Contrary to galectin-4, essentially all lactase was seen in the heavy fractions of the gradient that contains solubilized proteins, irrespective of the detergent used for the membrane extraction (Fig. 2 B), confirming lactase being a “non-raft” marker among microvillar proteins. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored alkaline phosphatase was exclusively present in the floating lipid raft fractions with both detergents (Fig. 2 C), whereas the transmembrane aminopeptidase N was only partially raft-associated with both detergents (Fig. 2 D). The lipids of microvillar rafts, isolated after extraction with the two detergents, were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3). Previously, rafts, prepared using Triton X-100, have been shown to contain cholesterol and to be particularly enriched in glycosphingolipids (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When approximately equal amounts of raft lipids were analyzed in parallel by thin layer chromatography, the lipid profiles of those isolated by use of Brij 98 and Triton X-100 were essentially similar, indicating that the overall lipid-solubilizing properties of the two detergents were alike (Fig.3). However, rafts obtained with Brij 98 contained relatively higher amounts of phospholipids. Taken together, the above experiments with Brij 98 demonstrate that microvillar lipid raft microdomains isolated at a physiological temperature were quite similar to those prepared using Triton X-100 at low temperature. Importantly, it can therefore be concluded that microvillar rafts are not “low temperature artifacts.” As shown in Fig.4, lipid rafts, prepared as described above, had a strikingly different morphology, depending on the type of detergent used for extraction. Those isolated after treatment with Triton X-100 appeared as a homogeneous population of closed, spherical vesicle-like structures with an average diameter in the range of 200–300 nm. In addition, some more complex conglomerate structures of fused vesicles were seen. By immunogold electron microscopy, aminopeptidase N was predominantly seen lining the membranes. This localization was also observed in intact microvilli as well as microvillar membrane vesicles (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but in some of the more complex multivesicular structures, labeling was also observed along the interior membranes. Single raft structures, immunocaptured onto magnetic beads revealed a distinct bilayer composition. Lipid rafts isolated using Brij 98 as detergent were seen predominantly as nonvesiculated, pleiomorphic membrane sheets with an approximate length of 200–300 nm, but some vesicle-like structures were also present (Fig. 4). Aminopeptidase N labeling was observed both in membranes of the vesicles and the sheets. In conclusion, Triton X-100 extraction on ice generally resulted in preservation of vesicle-like structures, whereas extraction with Brij 98 at 37 °C largely broke up the microvillar vesicles into open membrane fragments. The more heterogeneous morphology of the latter parallel the heterogeneity in lipid raft density indicated by Figs. 1and 2. Taken together, the results suggest that raft morphology is quite sensitive to the rather small differences observed with regard to protein and lipid composition. We have previously reported that microvillar rafts, isolated by extraction with Triton X-100, are cholesterol-independent, because unlike, for instance, caveolae in other cell types, they are resistant to treating the membranes with methyl-β-cyclodextrin prior to the addition of detergent (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test whether this characteristic property was temperature- and/or detergent-related, microvillar membrane vesicles were cholesterol-depleted by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 40Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) before extraction with Brij 98 at 37 °C. About 70% of the microvillar cholesterol is removed by this treatment (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but as shown in Fig. 5, a profile of polypeptides in the floating fractions was obtained almost identical to that observed with Brij 98 without methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment. Only small amounts of aminopeptidase N, alkaline phosphatase, and galectin-4 were shifted to the heavy fractions containing soluble protein. Thus, it can be concluded that the cholesterol independence of microvillar rafts reflects a bona fide membrane microdomain organization that exists at physiological temperature and is not a phenomenon that can be attributed to low temperature extraction with Triton X-100. For preparation of lipid rafts using Triton X-100, it is essential to perform the extraction at low temperature to preserve the lipid-lipid and protein-lipid interactions defining these microdomains, because at higher temperatures, Triton X-100 solubilizes completely both lipids and proteins of microvillar membrane vesicles (data not shown). However, when microvillar lipid rafts, prepared by Triton X-100 extraction on ice, were subsequently re-extracted with the same detergent, first at 20 °C and then at 37 °C, a fraction of the original lipid raft membranes remained insoluble in Triton X-100 even at the latter temperature (Fig. 6). A comparison of these high temperature Triton X-100-insoluble membranes (termed “superrafts”) with the “normal” lipid raft from which they were derived showed that superrafts are relatively enriched in a small subset of proteins. A further analysis by Western blotting revealed a hierarchy of the different microvillar lipid raft proteins with regard to their partition into the superrafts (Fig. 6). First, the most prominent protein of the superrafts was galectin-4, which completely resisted extraction with Triton X-100, both at 20 and 37 °C. Second, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored alkaline phosphatase was partially solubilized at 20 and 37 °C but predominantly resisted detergent extraction. Third, the major part of the transmembrane protein aminopeptidase N was solubilized, but a significant fraction of this abundant microvillar protein remained associated with the superrafts. Finally, most of the lipid raft-associated annexin 2, a peripheral membrane protein, was largely solubilized by Triton X-100 at 20 °C, and only small amounts were present in the superraft fraction. The overall lipid composition of superrafts showed a profile qualitatively similar to native microvillar membranes and rafts, isolated by Triton X-100 or Brij 98 (Fig. 3). However, the enrichment of glycolipids and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol, relative to phospholipids, was larger than for the other two raft fractions. Native microvillar membranes from pig enterocytes are rich in glycosphingolipids (>30% of total membrane lipid), indicating that they constitute more than half the amount of lipid in the exoplasmic leaflet (25Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The relative glycolipid enrichment seen for the superrafts thus suggests that very little phospholipid remained in the outer leaflet of the membranes after the sequential extractions at increasing temperature. The phospholipids remaining in the superraft fraction most likely constitute the cytoplasmic leaflet of the core structure of these lipid rafts. By electron microscopy, superrafts had a surprisingly well preserved membrane morphology, consisting of spherical vesicle-like structures of about 150–200 nm in diameter (Fig. 7). Multilamellar structures were visible in the preparation, and immunogold labeling with an anti-aminopeptidase N antibody revealed that the enzyme lined both exterior and interior membranes. In comparison with lipid rafts isolated by extraction with Triton X-100 (Fig. 4, A–D), the immunogold labeling of superrafts was more sparse, in agreement with the observation that a substantial fraction of aminopeptidase N was released from the membranes during preparation of the superrafts (Fig. 6). Although the superrafts described above must be considered membrane artifacts created by the sequential detergent extraction at increasing temperature, the protocol used for their preparation represents a method for probing the relative strength of the molecular interactions that exist between the various lipid and protein constituents that define lipid rafts. Along this line, the protein composition of superrafts suggests that galectin-4 is the major raft stabilizer among the proteins of the microvillar membrane. To test this hypothesis, superrafts were re-extracted with Triton X-100 at 37 °C after a preincubation in the absence or presence of lactose, a soluble ligand for galectin-4. As shown in Fig. 8, the presence of lactose caused the release of some, but not all, galectin-4 from the superrafts, indicating that at least some of this lectin is raft-associated via its cognate ligand. However, in addition to galectin-4, markedly increased amounts of alkaline phosphatase and aminopeptidase N were also released by lactose, indicating that their raft association is at least partially galectin-4-dependent. Lactose also released galectin-4, alkaline phosphatase, and aminopeptidase N from lipid rafts, isolated by Brij 98-extraction and even from microvillar membranes, untreated with detergent (Fig. 8), showing that the association between these microvillar proteins is not entirely induced by detergent extraction. Taken together, the results obtained with the superrafts imply that galectin-4 can be characterized as an organizer/stabilizer within microvillar lipid rafts. If the lectin thus defines the core of a raft, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored alkaline phosphatase and the transmembrane aminopeptidase N may then represent more peripheral raft proteins with decreasing affinity for these microdomains. Despite the rapid proliferation of the lipid raft concept into many diverse fields of biology, fundamental questions concerning the functional relevance of these lipid-based microdomains in vivo persist. To a large extent, this has to do with the most frequently used biochemical criterion for raft association, detergent insolubility at low (0–4 °C) temperature. Thus, given the temperature-dependent phase behavior of membrane lipids (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), lipid rafts could well be a phenomenon entirely related to the commonly used method for their isolation. Addressing this problem, Brij 98, a member of the polyoxyethylene ether (Brij) series of nonionic detergents, was recently used for preparation of lipid rafts at 37 °C from T cells (20Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J.P. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These rafts had a lipid composition expected of normal lipid rafts and harbored the components of a functional T cell receptor machinery. In the present work, four microvillar proteins were used as markers, each of which had a characteristic lipid raft profile, using Triton X-100 and differing with regard to type of membrane attachment. Brij 98 extraction at 37 °C defined microvillar rafts having a marker protein composition essentially similar to lipid rafts, isolated by use of Triton X-100 at low temperature. The fact that Brij 98 at 37 °C generates authentic lipid rafts from two so very different membrane systems as T cell membranes and microvillar membrane vesicles lends strong credibility to the bona fide existence and functional relevance of these lipid-based microdomains. Admittedly, the Triton X-100-resistant superrafts characterized in this work are membranes artifactually created by the sequential detergent extraction at increasing temperature, but importantly, they revealed the potential of galectin-4 to act as a strong organizer/stabilizer of these membrane microdomains. Like other members of the galectin family, galectin-4 is a cytosolic protein synthesized without a signal for membrane translocation (29Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 39Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that galectin-4 is secreted by a “nonclassical” pathway. β-Galactosyl residues present on microvillar membrane lipids as well as glycoproteins are likely to serve as ligands for this bivalent lectin and enable it to form detergent-resistant cross-linked lattices. The resulting dependence of microvillar raft stability on β-galactosyl residues may explain their characteristic resistance to cholesterol depletion. Such lattices have been described in the clustering and separation of distinct glycoprotein receptors on the surface of T cells by galectin-1, leading to apoptosis (41Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the microvillar surface, galectin-4-driven clustering of digestive enzymes may help to preserve these at the cell surface by preventing them from release into the lumen of the gut and maybe also from undergoing endocytosis. This function may be physiologically important, because the intestinal lumen is a harsh working environment, and many microvillar enzymes are prone to release from the membrane by the action of pancreatic enzymes. We imagine these galectin-4-stabilized microvillar rafts as being relatively stable and large microdomains (31Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), contrary to the current view that lipid rafts are typically transient and small (23Edidin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 492-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In a recently proposed model, the molecular address for proteins targeted to rafts is a so-called lipid shell (22Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Theoretically, these shells have an estimated diameter of 7 nm and contain about 80 lipid molecules that act as a local solvent in the lipid bilayer for the single protein they harbor. Larger raft structures, such as caveolae, form in a subsequent step by fusion of numerous shells. However appealing and applicable to other, more dynamic raft-based microdomains, such as assembly of signal transduction complexes, the lipid shell hypothesis hardly describes the relatively stable molecular organization of microvillar rafts. We conclude that the lipid raft concept needs to be further developed to accommodate the great variety of membrane functions that rely on lipid-based microdomains. In this process, we believe the protocol for making superrafts should be applicable to other raft membrane systems and might be a useful approach for probing the strength of molecular interactions within these microdomains."

It has been difficult, however, to track the fates of chamber-specific cardiac lineages, since differentiation is induced within the embryoid body. We have established an in vitro culture system to track Nkx2.5(+) cell lineages during mouse ES cell differentiation by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. Nkx2.5/GFP(+) cardiomyocytes purified from embryoid bodies express sarcomeric tropomyosin and myosin heavy chain and heterogeneously express cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myosin light chain 2v (MLC2v) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). After 4-week culture, GFP(+) cells exhibited electrophysiological characteristics specific to sinoatrial (SA) node, atrial, or ventricular type. Furthermore, we found that administration of 10(-7) M retinoic acid (RA) to embryoid bodies increased the percentage of MLC2v(-)ANP(+) cells; this also increased the expression of atrial-specific genes in the Nkx2.5/GFP(+) fraction, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that Nkx2.5(+) lineage cells possess the potential to differentiate into various cardiomyocyte cell types and that RA can modify the differentiation potential of Nkx2.5(+) cardiomyocytes at an early stage."

To test this mechanism, we compared canine cardiac calsequestrin and four truncation mutants with regard to their folding properties, structures, and Ca2+-induced polymerization.

The total concentration of Ca2+ in the SR is as high as 50 mm (2Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. Shamoo A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but a large portion of this Ca2+ is bound to a specific protein, calsequestrin. Calsequestrin binds and releases large quantities of Ca2+rapidly through its high capacity and relatively low affinity interactions with Ca2+ (3Mitchell R. Simmerman H. Jones L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to this lumenal buffering system, the concentration of free Ca2+ in the SR can be maintained below the inhibitory level of the Ca2+ pump (1 mm), and simultaneously the SR can maintain the ability to rapidly deliver the Ca2+ signal to the cytoplasm. Even though the lumenal space is minuscule compared with the extracellular space, the high concentrations of calsequestrin (100 mg/ml) make the SR an efficient storage compartment for Ca2+ (4MacLennan D. Wong P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1231-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin is associated physically with the ryanodine receptor (RyR) by a nucleation event that involves calsequestrin binding to the basic lumenal domains of triadin (5Guo W. Campbell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or junctin (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y. Jones L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). These two proteins interact with RyR in the junctional face region of the SR, and this network of interacting proteins assures that high concentrations of Ca2+ are stored very near to the site of Ca2+release (1Wang S. Trumble W. Liao H. Wesson C. Dunker A. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Glover L. Culligan K. Cala S. Mulvey C. Ohlendieck K. Biochim. Biophys.

Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 897-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of rabbit skeletal calsequestrin shows that this protein is made up of three domains, each with a thioredoxin fold, which is a five β-strand sandwiched by four α-helices (1Wang S. Trumble W. Liao H. Wesson C. Dunker A. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Each domain of calsequestrin has a hydrophobic core with acidic residues on the exterior, generating electronegative potential surfaces. Individual domains are connected by short sequences located interior to the domains themselves. These connecting loops and the secondary structural elements that fill the interdomain space contain mostly acidic residues, making the overall center of the protein hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic. Therefore, cations are required to stabilize the acidic center of calsequestrin. Divalent cations, which can provide cross-bridging, would be expected to be more effective in this regard than monovalent cations. This cationic stabilization of the acidic core likely provides at least part of the explanation for observations indicating that calsequestrin is more extended and more susceptible to protease digestion at low salt concentrations and then collapses as the ionic strength is raised (1Wang S. Trumble W. Liao H. Wesson C. Dunker A. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Mitchell R. Simmerman H. Jones L. J. Biol.

So far two isoforms of calsequestrin have been identified in mammalian tissues, cardiac and skeletal. Among the ∼360 residues in either isoform of calsequestrins from various species, more than 110 residues are either Asp or Glu, making calsequestrin one of the most acidic self-folding proteins in existence. Despite the very similar net negative charge for the two isoforms, cardiac calsequestrin appears to bind only about half as much Ca2+ as does the skeletal protein (12Slupsky J. Ohnishi M. Carpenter M. Reithmeier R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6539-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previous studies (13Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Maurer A. Cortese J. Fleischer S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that high capacity Ca2+binding by calsequestrin is established by the formation of Ca2+/protein complexes at relatively high calsequestrin and Ca2+ concentrations. Under such conditions, two-thirds of the total bound Ca2+ was associated with Ca2+/calsequestrin aggregates, while one-third was associated with the soluble form of calsequestrin. Even though weak cooperativity of Ca2+ binding has been observed with the soluble form of calsequestrin (14Krause K. Milos M. Luan-Rilliet Y. Lew D. Cox J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9453-9459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), strong Ca2+ binding cooperativity accompanies the polymerization of calsequestrin into the insoluble forms (13Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Maurer A. Cortese J. Fleischer S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-induced precipitation leads to fibrils if induced rapidly or to needle-shaped crystals if induced slowly (15Maurer A. Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Likewise, electron microscopy reveals the presence of electron-dense fibrous arrays in SR microsomes at the junctional membranes, and these arrays are believed to be calsequestrin in its calcium-bound form (15Maurer A.

Cross-linking SR lumenal proteins strongly suggest that most of the calsequestrin in the SR microsomes is involved in direct intermolecular calsequestrin/calsequestrin contacts (19Franzini-Armstrong C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13419-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Rodriguez P. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2130-2137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic dependencies among Ca2+, K+, H+, and calsequestrin are poorly understood, and the role of ion-induced structural changes in calsequestrin remains to be elucidated. The association of calsequestrin monomers to form macromolecular precipitates has a character similar to condensation or crystallization, which provides an avenue for us to determine whether the calsequestrin contacts in the crystal lattice are the same as the contacts in SR membrane preparations. In the crystal, two different dimerization contacts are observed: front-to-front and back-to-back. These form the basis of a continuous, linear polymer that contains the major stabilizing forces in the crystal lattice. Not only does the polymer in the crystal lattice have the linear morphology inferred for the physiologically relevant aggregation, but also the two contacts that stabilize this polymer have structural details that lend themselves to control Ca2+ binding. That is, both of the dimerization interfaces sequester large numbers of acidic residues and, in addition, the back-to-back interface has a nearby polyanionic, disordered tail. Furthermore, these dimerization interfaces do not look like typical crystal contacts because large surface areas are buried in the formation of intricate interactions. Given the intricacy, the sequestration of so many negative charges, and the nearby polyanionic tail, we proposed that these interfaces provide the basis for the physiological mechanism of coupling Ca2+ binding with polymerization and Ca2+ release with depolymerization (1Wang S. Trumble W. Liao H. Wesson C. Dunker A. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,8Kang C. Trumble W. Dunker A. Methods Mol.

Although the front-to-front and back-to-back contacts in our calsequestrin crystals would appear to be favored by Ca2+binding, attempts to directly visualize Ca2+ bound within these interfaces have failed for technical reasons. Addition of Ca2+ during crystallization leads to instant formation of numerous needles (15Maurer A. Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4036-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Williams R. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hayakawa K. Swenson L. Baksh S. Wei Y. Michalak M. Derewenda Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) that have so far not been adequate for structure determination. Therefore, we turned to alternative approaches to test our hypothesis. If the residues involved in the front-to-front and back-to-back interfaces are indeed involved in coupling Ca2+ binding with calsequestrin polymerization, then mutants lacking the key residues should show altered tendencies for calcium-induced aggregation. Thus, we made a series of truncation mutants of dog cardiac calsequestrin and compared their properties when subjected to different Ca2+ levels. Expression plasmids, pET24b-cCSQ and pTYB1-cCSQ were constructed using PCR strategy. Specific regions of canine cardiac calsequestrin were amplified by PCR using the cDNA clone as a template. A sense primer CAL5 (5′-CTGTCAACATATGGAAGAGGGGCTCAACTTCCCCA-3′) that contains anNdeI site and a start codon, and an antisense primer CAL3 (5′-CTGATGTCGACTATTACTCATCATCATCATCACTGTCGTC-3′) that contains aSalI site followed by two stop codons were used for wild-type calsequestrin construct. A sense primer CAL5–2 (5-′CTGTCAACATATGGGGCTCAACTTCCCCACGT-3′) and an antisense primer CAL3Im (5′-CTAATGGCTCTTCCGCAACCCTCATCATCATCATCACTGTC-3′), and a sense primer CAL5–13 (5′-ACTGTCAACATATGCGTGTGGTCAGTCTCACTGAGA-3′) and CAL3Im were used for ΔC27 (amino acids 3–391) and ΔN13 (amino acids 14–391), respectively. CAL5 and an antisense primer CAL3–27Im (5′-CTAATGGCTCTTCCGCACCCGTCATCCCCCTCTT-3′), and CAL5 and an antisense primer CAL3–38Im (5′-ACGAAGGCTCTTCCGCAACCAGTGTTTATCTTTCCAG-3′) were used for ΔC27 (amino acids 1–364) and ΔC38 (amino acids 1–353), respectively (Figs. 1 and2 A). NdeI site for all sense primers and SapI site for all antisense primers were introduced to make truncation mutants. PCR-amplified products were digested with NdeI/SalI orNdeI/SapI and ligated into the expression vector pET24b (Novagen) for the wild-type calsequestrin and pTYB1 (New England Biolabs) for the truncation mutants. The sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Figure 2Calsequestrin sequence and structure. In A, the indicated structural features in the three-dimensional structure are mapped onto the rabbit skeletal calsequestrin amino acid sequence, and this sequence is aligned with the canine cardiac calsequestrin amino acid sequence. In B, ribbon diagram representations of the three-dimensional structures of four rabbit skeletal calsequestrins are shown, with indications made to identify the disordered tails at the C termini (dotted) and the two distinct dimerization contacts, front-to-front and back-to-back.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the wild-type calsequestrin, the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET24b-cCSQ was grown at 37 °C in LB containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an A 600 nm of 0.6 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The expressed wild-type calsequestrin was purified as previously described (11He Z. Dunker A. Wesson C. Trumble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24635-24641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the truncation mutants, the E. coli strain ER2566 transformed with pTYB1-cCSQs were grown at 37 °C in LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin to an A 600 nm of 0.6 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at room temperature. The truncation mutants were purified through a chitin affinity column (New England Biolabs) followed by an anion exchange column. Briefly, cells were pelleted and suspended in sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X100), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Supernatant was applied to a chitin column and washed with a 10-column volume of sonication buffer without Triton-X100. On-column cleavage was performed by incubating the chitin resin with cleavage buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 90 mm DTT. After overnight incubation, the cleaved calsequestrin proteins were eluted with elution buffer (cleavage buffer without DTT). The elution was loaded onto an Uno-Q12 (BioRad) column after concentrating and substituting the buffer to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 20 mm NaCl with an ultrafiltration unit (Amicon). The column was then washed with a linear gradient from 100 mm to 1 m NaCl. The mutant calsequestrins eluted at ∼400–600 mm NaCl were concentrated with Centriplus-10 (Amicon). Purified wild-type and mutant calsequestrins were dialyzed against 300 mm KCl with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The salt and buffer concentration was gradually reduced in a stepwise manner. The final stage of dialysis was performed against distilled water. The intrinsic fluorescence of wild-type and mutant calsequestrins was measured using 90 μl of sample containing 2 μm of protein buffered in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). KCl ranging from 0 to 600 mm were used to assess the K+ dependence of fluorescence. Measurement was performed with a MOS-250 spectrometer (Bio-Logic) at 22 °C. Each protein was excited at 282 nm using 5-nm slit width, and emission was measured at 331 nm using 20-nm slit width. CD spectra were measured with an Aviv 202SF spectropolarimeter (Protein Solutions, Inc.) in a 2-mm path length cell at 22 °C. 5 μm of protein was buffered in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 300 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT. Spectra were recorded from 200 to 260 nm and corrected for buffer contributions. Prior to the experiment, a TSK G3000SW column (TosoHaas) was equilibrated with running buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT with varying concentrations of KCl and CaCl2. 100 μl of each protein at 1 mg/ml, which was preincubated with the running buffer, was injected onto a TSK G3000SW column (TosoHaas). The chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Acuflow series IV pump (Analytical Scientific Inst.). The eluate was passed in tandem through an UV detector (GILSON), a refractometer (Optilab DSP, Wyatt Tech.), and a multiangle laser light-scattering detector (Dawn EOS, Wyatt Tech.). The chromatographic experiments were performed at 22 °C. Scattering data were collected and analyzed using the software ASTRA (Wyatt Tech.) supplied with the instrument. Relative weight-averaged molecular masses were determined from the scattering data collected for a given condition using the Zimm fitting method, in which K*c/R(Q) is plotted againstsin2 (Q/2), whereQ is the scattering angle, R(Q) is the excess intensity (I) of scattered light at the angleQ, c is the concentration of the sample, andK* is a constant equal to4π2n2(dn/dc) 2 /λ04NA (where n = solvent refractive index, dn/dc = refractive index increment of scattering sample, λ 0 = wavelength of scattered light and NA = Avogadro's number). Extrapolation of a Zimm plot to zero angle gives an estimate of the weight-averaged molecular mass (Mw). Mw is defined in Equation 1 as: Mw=∑(ciMi)∑ciEquation 1 for c moles of i different species with an individual molecular weight Mi. 20 μm of purified proteins were preincubated for 10 min on ice with KCl and/or CaCl2 in the presence of 150 mm KCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The samples were then further incubated with 400 μm 3,3′-dithiobis sulfosuccinimidyl-propionate (DTSSP) (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. The reactions were then rapidly quenched through the addition of concentrated Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 mm, followed by incubation for another 10 min. Reactions were mixed 1:1 ratio with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of any reducing agent and subjected to electrophoresis in 8% SDS-PAGE gels. We previously showed that our rabbit skeletal calsequestrin crystal contains a ribbon-like linear polymer joined by two distinct dimerization contacts. A short, four-molecule segment of this polymer is reproduced here (Fig. 2 B), with annotation of several key features, including the following: (i) the front-to-front and back-to-back interfaces; (ii) the arm exchange, which is part of the front-to-front interface; (iii) the cavities in the two interfaces; (iv) the short (two-residue) disordered N-terminal residues, and (v) the long (15-residue) disordered C-terminal tail. Both the N-terminal two residues and the C-terminal tail are called disordered because of the lack of sufficient electron density to trace the chain. Such lack of electron density arises from structural inhomogeneity, which could have static contributions, dynamic contributions or both. Because a clone of rabbit skeletal calsequestrin was not available when this research was initiated, we used a clone of canine cardiac calsequestrin instead. A sequence alignment of these two proteins is shown in Fig. 2 A. The regions associated with the arm, domains I, II, and III, and the disordered tail are denoted. The overall sequence identity between these two proteins is 70% (similarity 86%), suggesting with a near certainty that the two proteins have the same overall three-dimensional structure. Also, indicated are the negatively charged residues involved in front-to-front (f or F) and back-to-back dimerization (b or B) interfaces, with cavity residues (f or b) distinguished from non-cavity interfacial residues (F or B). Both the front-to-front and back-to-back interfaces contain cavities that are fairly large, irregularly shaped, and open to the exterior. The openings make it difficult to define the cavity volumes, but approximate estimates indicate that the cavity within the front-to-front interface is about 1600 Å3 (large enough for about 50 water molecules), while that within back-to-back interface is about 2400 Å3 (large enough for about 80 water molecules). The back-to-back cavity contains the two negatively charged residues at the tip of the arm as well as uncertain portions of the two disordered tails. The acidic and basic residues within the dimerization contacts were determined by visual inspection of the three-dimensional structure for the rabbit skeletal calsequestrin and by homology for the canine cardiac calsequestrin (Fig. 2, Tables Iand II). The excess of 29 negative charges in the front-to-front interface and the excess of 21 negative charges in the back-to-back interface for rabbit skeletal calsequestrin support the likely sensitivity of these interfaces to the presence of divalent cations. Interestingly, the interfaces of canine cardiac calsequestrin are also significantly negative, but greatly reduced in net negative charge, −16 for the front-to-front interface and just −11 for the back-to-back interface. Of the 50 (29 + 21) negative charges in the two interfaces of rabbit skeletal calsequestrin, 18 are changed in the canine cardiac calsequestrin. Of these changes, two conserve the negative charge (one Asp to Gly and one Gly to Asp, seven are negative to polar or non-polar (Asp or Glu to Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, or Gly), and nine are negative to positive (Asp or Glu to Arg, Lys, or His).Table ITotal numbers of charged amino acids appear on the sequence of rabbit skeletal calsequestrin and canine cardiac calsequestrinAmino AcidRabbit sCSQCanine cCSQAsp5158Glu5951Lys2431Arg69His55Total net charge−75−64 Open table in a new tab Table IITotal numbers of amino acids involved in the specific dimerization interactionsAmino acidRabbit sCSQCanine cCSQInterfaceCavityInterfaceCavityFront-to-front Glu + Asp22131511 Lys + Arg6082 Net charge−16−13−7−9Back-to-back Glu + Asp519413 Lys + Arg3042 Net charge−2−190−11Total net charge involved in polymerization−18−32−7−20Tail−14−28 Open table in a new tab The alignment of the two sequences coupled with the three-dimensional structure for rabbit skeletal calsequestrin provided the rationale for the construction of four truncation mutants. The regions deleted for each of these are indicated in Fig. 1. The deletion of the first two residues (ΔN2) removes two residues negatively charged residues (EE) that are both disordered and located within the back-to-back cavity. Deletion of the first 13 residues (ΔN13) leads to removal of the arm and therefore would be expected to disrupt the major interaction for the front-to-front contact. Deletion of the last 27 residues (ΔC27) would remove a large portion of the disordered tail, which is mostly negatively charged. Finally, deletion of the last 38 residues (ΔC38) would remove almost all of the disordered tail. These two C-terminal truncation mutants would be expected to make the back-to-back contact less sensitive to divalent cations. Monovalent or divalent cations induce skeletal calsequestrin to undergo a conformational change from an extended, random coil-like molecule to a compactly folded form. This conformational change has been monitored both by circular dichroism and by intrinsic fluorescence (3Mitchell R. Simmerman H. Jones L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformation Analysis of Biomolecule. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, NY1996: 109-157Google Scholar). Here we compare the wild-type calsequestrin and three of the truncation mutants by these two spectroscopic methods. Increasing the salt concentration using KCl caused a similar increase in intrinsic fluorescence for the wild-type and the three truncation mutants. Approximately 100 mm KCl was required for the half-maximal increase in fluorescence, and the maximal signal was achieved at about 300 mm KCl (see Supplementary Data at http://www.jbc.org). These data suggest that wild-type and all three truncation mutants are fully folded at the latter concentration. It is unclear whether the slight differences observed at low salt concentrations are indicating slight differences in the early folding steps or are simply due to experimental variations. The far UV-CD spectra of the wild-type calsequestrin and the three truncation mutants were compared in the same condition of 300 mm KCl, a concentration at which all should be fully folded (see Supplementary Data). The similar shapes and intensities for the far UV CD spectra indicate that the wild-type calsequestrin and three truncation mutants do indeed fold into a similar thee-dimensional structure. Wild-type calsequestrin and the four truncation mutants were studied by light scattering to determine their tendencies to form oligomers. These light scattering experiments were performed in 300 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), so all the proteins are in fully folded state. Variable concentrations of CaCl2 were included to assess the effect of Ca2+ on polymerization. In 300 mm KCl without Ca2+, most of the wild-type calsequestrin was monomeric with less than 1% of total population in the form of dimers or higher oligomers (Fig.3 A). In 300 mm KCl and 1 mm CaCl2, most of the population was in the dimeric form (Fig. 3 B). When the Ca2+concentration was increased to 3 mm, most of the calsequestrin population was in dimeric form, with small amounts of tetramer starting to appear (Fig. 3 C). The overall dimer/tetramer pattern in 300 mm KCl, 3 mmCaCl2 was unchanged up to ∼5 mmCaCl2. Beyond this CaCl2 concentration, the calsequestrin starts to precipitate clogging the column and thus makes further experiments impossible. This suggests that wild-type calsequestrin has a transition point approximately at 5 mmCaCl2. When KCl was decreased to 70 mm with 1 mmCa2+, however, various oligomeric species up to hexamer became evident (Fig. 3 D). As a control experiment, the condition of 500 mm KCl but without Ca2+ was also used. All populations in this condition were monomers (Fig.3 E). The solution containing 700 mm KCl also showed the same result (data not shown). The ΔC38 mutant showed a consistent pattern of monomeric and dimeric populations throughout the conditions that were tested. The monomer peaks from 300 mm (or 500 mm) KCl solution without Ca2+ ions were broad and delayed when they were compared with those with 300 mm KCl with Ca2+ (Fig.4 A). The ΔC27 mutant showed Ca2+-dependent dimerization in both 1 and 3 mm CaCl2 with 300 mm KCl, but it did not polymerize further as the wild-type protein did (Fig.4 B). Consistent dimer peaks indicate that dimerization is not dependent on the concentration of Ca2+. The dimers seen on these mutants seem to be a front-to-front type of dimer because both C-terminal truncation mutants have intact N termini. But we could not rule out the possibility of back-to-back dimers. Since C-terminal truncation greatly reduces the charge repulsion on back-to-back interaction, its dimerization could be very well independent of Ca2+ as shown and might be due to intermolecular helix-helix interaction as seen in the crystal structure of rabbit skeletal calsequestrin. Despite the small size of the deletion, ΔN2 mutant exhibited only a slight tendency to undergo Ca2+-induced dimerization (Fig.4 C). Furthermore, unlike wild-type protein, the monomer and dimer peaks were not distinct following the addition of Ca2+, suggesting that the removal of these two residues leads to destabilization of the Ca2+-induced dimer and a resulting rapid equilibrium between the monomer and dimer forms. The ΔN13 mutant formed high molecular weight polymers (∼16–20 mer), which elute from the column after only ∼11 min. This profile was consistent throughout the various conditions that we have tested (Fig. 4 D). To confirm the results of the light-scattering experiments, we performed cross-linking experiments of ΔN13 mutant, ΔC38 mutant, and wild-type calsequestrin. The wild-type protein clearly showed Ca2+-dependent polymerization. 2 mm CaCl2 without KCl produced an increased amount of very large molecular weight polymers compared with other conditions. Addition of 150 mm KCl inhibits this polymerization (Fig. 5). Cross-linking buffer alone produced very weak dimer and tetramer bands. Both C- and N-terminal truncation mutants do not show any Ca2+-dependent polymerization, which is inferred from the same band patterns in all conditions. However, compared with the band patterns of the ΔC38 mutant, those of the ΔN13 mutant indicate the existence of very high molecular polymers together with a reduced intensity of the monomer band. These results are consistent with the results of the light-scattering experiments where very high molecular weight aggregates are apparent in ΔN13 mutant and no polymerization further than dimers are apparent in ΔC38 mutant. Mechanisms of Ca2+ binding by calsequestrin have no reason to mimic the Ca2+ binding mechanism of either the Ca2+ pump or TnC (9MacLennan D. Abu-Abed M. Kang C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 897-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding sites of calsequestrin need to be made and broken, but not over the low cytosolic Ca2+ concentration range or with the same stoichiometry and precision as those formed and subsequently disrupted in the Ca2+ pump or those that are intrinsic to the EF hand structure of TnC. Ca2+ binding by calsequestrin is very likely nonspecific. It is, therefore, unlikely that there are specific Ca2+ sites, although the first few ions that bind at low Ca2+ concentrations may have some specificity. We are proposing that Ca2+ regulation by calsequestrin involves an interplay among protein folding, Ca2+ binding, and calsequestrin polymerization. This interplay is shown schematically in Fig. 6. In summary, the polymerization of calsequestrin is promoted by Ca2+ and inhibited by K+. Both the N-terminal arm and the acidic, C-terminal tail are necessary for the Ca2+-dependent linear polymerization. N-terminal arm exchange inhibits random aggregation of the protein. Deletion of the N-terminal arm may disrupt specific orientation of the front-to-front interaction, resulting in random interactions among calsequestrin monomers. Deletion of the acidic, C-terminal tail reduces the negative charge in the back-to-back interface, resulting in low concentrations of counter ion for establishing the back-to-back interactions. From Table I, we notice that rabbit skeletal calsequestrin has a net charge of −75, while canine cardiac calsequestrin has a net charge of −64. Despite this small overall difference in net charge, skeletal calsequestrin binds about twice the amount of Ca2+ compared with the cardiac calsequestrin (12Slupsky J. Ohnishi M. Carpenter M. Reithmeier R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6539-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). If our coupled binding and polymerization mechanism were correct, then one would expect to observe 2-fold more negative charge within the skeletal as compared with the cardiac calsequestrin interfaces. Table II shows this expectation to be true: skeletal calsequestrin has a net charge of −18 and −32 for a total of −50 within the front-to-front and back-to-back interfaces (including the cavity-lining residues), while cardiac calsequestrin has just −7 and −20 for a total net charge of −27 within the two interfaces. Since about 40 calcium ions are bound by skeletal calsequestrin compared with about 20 calcium ions by the cardiac calsequestrin, the interfacial charges of −50 and −27 would be insufficient to balance the positive charges arising from the bound calcium ions. Charge balance could result to a significant degree from the polyanionic C-terminal tails. In addition, the large cavities observed within the front-to-front and back-to-back interfaces could play a crucial role by providing the space needed for negative counter ions to help balance the positive charge. If charge balance by negative counter ions were indeed significant, then the amount of bound Ca2+ would be reduced if a large counter ion such as gluconate were used in place of a smaller ion such as chloride. This conjecture could be tested by measuring the number of (radioactive) Ca2+ ions bound per calsequestrin molecule with either gluconate or chloride as the sole anion. The biological significance of this dynamic polymerization of calsequestrin can be explained in several ways. The front-to-front and back-to-back contacts between the calsequestrin monomers permit formation of a ribbon-like linear polymer. Ca2+ largely fills the electronegative pockets formed in these two contacts cross-bridging the monomers. In this paper, we report Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. Considering the high concentration of calsequestrin (100 mg/ml) and physiologically varying concentrations (opposite direction) of K+ and Ca2+ in SR, the dynamic formation and destruction of calsequestrin oligomer in SR can be well explained from our experimental data. Growing calsequestrin polymers provides a highly charged surface onto which calcium can be adsorbed. The attractive forces exerted by such an extended surface would have a longer range than those from an isolated molecule. A sparingly soluble ion such as Ca2+ would tend to spread over the surface of the calsequestrin ribbon forming a readily exchangeable film. The propensity of Ca2+-bound calsequestrin to form linear structures makes Ca2+ dissociation and diffusion a more rapid event than would be the case if crystallization were to occur in three dimensions at lumenal Ca2+ concentrations. The use of Ca2+ as a cross-linker rather than as a tightly bound form free of H2O also speeds dissociation. Although the acidic residues are highly concentrated in pockets, the surfaces of the calsequestrin polymers are also highly acidic. Thus Ca2+diffusion from calsequestrin to the Ca2+ release channel is likely to involve surface diffusion, a more rapid process than diffusion through liquid (28Williams R. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1978; 505: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin, probably in a Ca2+ bound form, forms regular arrays that appear crystalline in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (18Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J.

To understand the mechanisms(s) by which these ubiquitous kinases affect specific cellular changes, it is necessary to identify their diverse and numerous substrates in different cell contexts and compartments. As a first step in achieving this goal, we engineered a mutant ERK2 in which a bulky amino acid residue in the ATP binding site (glutamine 103) is changed to glycine, allowing this mutant to utilize an analog of ATP (cyclopentyl ATP) that cannot be used by wild-type ERK2 or other cellular kinases. The mutation did not inhibit ERK2 kinase activity or substrate specificity in vitro or in vivo. This method allowed us to detect only ERK2-specific phosphorylations within a mixture of proteins. Using this ERK2 mutant/analog pair to phosphorylate ERK2-associated proteins in COS-1 cells, we identified the ubiquitin ligase EDD (E3 identified bydifferential display) and the nucleoporin Tpr (translocated promoter region) as two novel substrates of ERK2, in addition to the known ERK2 substrate Rsk1. To further validate the method, we present data that confirm that ERK2 phosphorylates EDD in vitro and in vivo.

When in the inactive state, ERKs are anchored in the cytoplasm due to a basal association with the MEKs. Following activation, the ERKs migrate to various cellular locations, including the nucleus, microtubules, focal contacts, and others (6Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M.

These diverse phosphorylations allow the ERKs to orchestrate a complex but coordinated response to extracellular signals. The pattern and timing of substrate selections determines the specific biological outcome.The identification and characterization of the direct targets of a particular signaling pathway is paramount to understanding the function of that pathway within the cell. The Ras to ERK pathway is a key regulator of many cellular processes. Although there are many substrates of the ERKs that have been identified (10Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lewis T.S. Hunt J.B. Aveline L.D. Jonscher K.R. Louie D.F. Yeh J.M. Nahreini T.S. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the diverse roles of the ERKs within the cell suggest that many unknown substrates remain to be identified. Identification of the kinase that directly phosphorylates a particular substrate can be difficult due to the overlap of consensus phosphorylation sequences, redundancy of kinases that can phosphorylate a particular site, differences between in vivo and in vitro specificity, and the diversity of kinases that can be present in a reaction, even in “pure” protein preparations. Several different approaches to determine novel MAPK substrates have been used (12Manning B.D. Cantley L.C.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).To identify additional novel substrates of ERK2, we employed a method developed by Shokat and coworkers (17Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) to specifically label direct substrates of a particular protein kinase in a mixture of cellular proteins. Protein kinases contain similar ATP binding domains, including conserved residues that come into close contact with theN-6 position of ATP. Mutation of the ATP binding site at one or both of these conserved positions to a smaller amino acid residue can allow the mutant protein kinase, but not other cellular protein kinases, to utilize analogs of ATP that contain a bulky substituent on the N-6 position. When radiolabeled ATP analog is used in a kinase reaction with the mutant kinase and a mixture of cellular proteins, only direct substrates of the mutant kinase become radiolabeled. This method has been successfully used to identify direct substrates for the Src tyrosine kinase (19Shah K. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and for the MAPK JNK (20Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18090-18095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).We used an engineered mutant of ERK2 to search for new ERK substrates that physically associate with the MAPK. As validation of our method, our assay resulted in the labeling and identification of Rsk1, a known ERK2 substrate (7Chen R.H. Abate C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We also identified two novel ERK2 substrates, the ubiquitin ligase EDD (E3 identified bydifferential display) and the nucleoporin Tpr (translocated promoter region). EDD is the human homolog of the Drosophila genehyperplastic discs and was originally identified as a gene up-regulated in response to progestin (21Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). EDD is believed to serve as an E3 ubiquitin ligase due to the presence of a HECT domain (homology to E6-AP carboxylterminus) in its carboxyl terminus that binds ubiquitin through a single cysteine residue (21Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Honda et al. (22Honda Y. Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Anan T.

Tpr is a nucleoporin that is a component of the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex (23Byrd D.A. Sweet D.J. Pante N. Konstantinov K.N. Guan T.L. Saphire A.C.S. Mitchell P.J. Cooper C.S.

Guan T. Subauste C. Hahn K. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).In this report we describe the engineering of ERK2 to allow it to utilize an analog of ATP. Based on sequence alignment of ERK2 with other protein kinases and the crystal structure of ERK2, we generated alanine and glycine mutations of ERK2 at isoleucine 82 and glutamine 103, singly or in combination, to generate an ERK2 with a larger ATP binding pocket. Mutation of these residues did not significantly inhibit ERK2 kinase activity in vitro or signaling in vivo. ERK2 mutants with a glutamine to glycine mutation at position 103 were able to efficiently utilize several ATP analogs to phosphorylate the ERK substrate Elk1 (26Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) in vitro. Using ERK2 Q103G and [γ-32P]cyclopentyl-ATP, we were able to radiolabel EDD, Tpr, and Rsk1 as ERK2-associated substrates in COS-1 cells. We further validated these results by demonstrating that EDD was phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro and in an MEK-dependent manner in cells in response to EGF. This work describes the generation of a molecular tool for the identification of many more targets of this important signaling cascade.RESULTSBased on the crystal structure of ERK2 bound to ATP (31Zhang J.D. Zhang F.M. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and sequence alignment of the ATP binding site of several protein kinases (18Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we observed that both isoleucine 82 and glutamine 103 are at conserved positions that come into close contact with theN-6 position of adenine in ATP. We hypothesized that mutation of one or both of these residues to either alanine or glycine would generate a larger ATP binding pocket enabling the mutant kinase to accept and utilize ATP analogs with bulky side groups at theN-6 position. We therefore generated five ERK2 mutants that contained either single or double mutations of these residues to either alanine or glycine. The five mutants generated were: ERK2 I82A; ERK2 Q103A; ERK2 Q103G; ERK2 I82A/Q103A; and ERK2 I82A/Q103G (Fig.1A). All ERK2 constructs encoded an amino-terminal FLAG tag.We first examined whether mutation of these residues affected the ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate its substrates in vitro andin vivo. ERK2 or an ERK2 mutant was transfected into COS-1 cells, and the cells were stimulated with EGF. In vitrokinase assays were performed with immunoprecipitated ERK2 and the ERK2 mutants using myelin basic protein (MBP) and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. ERK2 and the mutants had roughly equivalent levels of kinase activity (Fig. 1B), although alanine mutations at isoleucine 82 somewhat inhibited ERK2 kinase activity toward MBP. Similar experiments using serum stimulation or co-transfected mutationally activated MEK1 (MEK1 S218D/S222D), demonstrated that these mutants could be phosphorylated and activated by activated MEK1 (data not shown).To determine if the ERK2 mutants could signal to a physiological ERK2 substrate in vivo, GAL4-Elk1 luciferase assays were performed. This system utilizes a plasmid containing a luciferase gene with five GAL4 binding sites in the promoter and a plasmid encoding a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and the ERK-responsive transactivation domain of Elk1 (28Roberson M.S. Misrapress A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J.S. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEK1 S218D/S222D was co-transfected to activate both endogenous and transfected ERK. Co-transfection of ERK2 or an ERK2 mutant stimulated luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that mutation of one or both residues in the ATP binding site of ERK2 did not substantially affect the localization, substrate recognition, or kinase activity of ERK2.We next needed to identify the optimal pairing between an ATP binding site mutant and an ATP analog. To do this, we screened each of our ERK mutants with a panel of seven ATP analogs. We first determined the ability of each analog to inhibit the capacity of ERK2 or an ERK2 mutant to phosphorylate MBP with [γ-32P]ATP. If an ATP analog was able to compete with [γ-32P]ATP for an ERK2 mutant, incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into MBP would be inhibited. ERK2 or an ERK2 mutant was immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-1 cells stimulated for 10 min with EGF. The FLAG immunoprecipitates were aliquoted equally and used in a kinase reaction containing MBP, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, with or without 100 μm ATP analog. The reactions were resolved on a gel and transferred, and incorporation of 32P into MBP was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Comparison of reactions containing an ATP analog (Fig.2, lanes 2–8 in each panel) to control reactions without analog (Fig. 2, lane 1 in each panel) demonstrated that none of the analogs inhibited the ability of wild-type ERK2 to utilize ATP. By contrast, many of the ATP analogs had varied abilities to compete with [γ-32P]ATP for phosphate incorporation into MBP, suggesting that some of the ERK2 mutants were able to utilize or at least bind to the ATP analogs. Mutation of isoleucine 82 alone had little effect on the susceptibility of ERK2 to inhibition by an analog. Mutation of glutamine 103 to alanine increased the susceptibility of ERK2 to inhibition by an analog, whereas mutation of this residue to glycine had the greatest effect on the ability of an analog to inhibit 32P incorporation into MBP. The Q103G mutation (either by itself or in conjunction with the I82A mutation) demonstrated a significant reduction of 32P incorporation into MBP when kinase reactions were performed in the presence of analog. These results suggested that residue 103 of ERK2 was the critical residue in controlling the capacity of ERK2 to accept an ATP analog with a bulkyN-6 substituent. In particular, a substantial inhibition of32P incorporation into MBP by ERK2 Q103G was observed with addition of either N-6-benzyl-ATP (98.8% inhibition,lane 2, middle panel, right side),N-6-cyclopentyl-ATP (95.2% inhibition, lane 3,middle panel, right side),N-6-(3,3-dimethyl)butyl-ATP (98.4% inhibition, lane 6, middle panel, right side),N-6-(2-phenethyl)-ATP (97.8% inhibition, lane 7,middle panel, right side), andN-6-(1-methyl)butyl-ATP (94.1% inhibition, lane 8, middle panel, right side).Figure 2Analog inhibition assay. FLAG-ERK2 plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells. The cells were serum-starved and stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. FLAG-ERKs were immunoprecipitated, and each was aliquoted into eight sets of duplicate kinase reactions. Kinase reactions were performed with MBP, 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi/reaction [γ-32P]ATP, without (lane 1) or with (lanes 2–8) 100 μm ATP analog. ATP analogs were: N-6-benzyl ATP (lane 2), N-6-cyclopentyl-ATP (lane 3), N-6-(p-methyl)benzyl-ATP (lane 4), N-6-(1,3-dimethyl)butyl-ATP (lane 5),N-6-(3,3-dimethyl)butyl-ATP (lane 6),N-6-(2-phenethyl)-ATP (lane 7), andN-6-(1-methyl)butyl-ATP (lane 8). The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 10 min, run on a gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. MBP bands were excised and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. The values were normalized to a reaction without ATP analog (lane 1), which was set at 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are two likely explanations for the inhibition of 32P incorporation into MBP by the addition of excess unlabeled ATP analog. First, the ATP analog could be utilized as an ATP source by the mutant ERK2 kinase to phosphorylate MBP, thus effectively competing with the [γ-32P]ATP for usage by the mutant ERK2. Alternatively, the kinase could bind the analog but not be able to utilize it, thus effectively blocking [γ-32P]ATP from the ATP binding site of the kinase. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we screened ERK2, ERK2-Q103G, and ERK2-I82A/Q103G for their ability to phosphorylate GST-Elk1 with either ATP or an ATP analog. The reactions were resolved on a gel and immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-S383 Elk1, the major site of phosphorylation by ERK2. Incubation of GST-Elk1 in the absence of ERK2 did not result in S383 phosphorylation (lane 1). All three ERK2 proteins were able to phosphorylate GST-Elk1 with normal ATP (Fig.3, lane 2 in all p-Elk1 panels). However, wild-type ERK2 could not use any of the ATP analogs to phosphorylate GST-Elk1 (Fig. 3, top panel,lanes 3–9). These data support the previous result that none of the analogs could inhibit wild-type ERK2 from using [γ-32P]ATP to phosphorylate MBP.Figure 3ERK2 phosphorylation of Elk1 with ATP analogs. FLAG-ERK2 plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells, and the cells were serum-starved before stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. FLAG-ERKs were immunoprecipitated, aliquoted, and used in kinase reactions with GST-Elk1 and either 100 mm unlabeled ATP (lane 2) or 100 mm unlabeled ATP analog (lanes 3–9). The reaction in lane 1 contained GST-Elk1 and ATP but no ERK. ATP analogs were:N-6-benzyl-ATP (lane 3),N-6-cyclopentyl-ATP (lane 4),N-6-(p-methyl)benzyl-ATP (lane 5),N-6-(1,3-dimethyl)butyl-ATP (lane 6),N-6-(3,3-dimethyl)butyl-ATP (lane 7),N-6-(2-phenethyl)-ATP (lane 8), andN-6-(1-methyl)butyl-ATP (lane 9). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, resolved on a gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were then immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-S383 Elk1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Conversely, both ERK2-Q103G and ERK2-I82A/Q103G were able to effectively use several ATP analogs to phosphorylate GST-Elk1. Overall, ERK2-Q103G appeared to use the analogs more effectively than ERK2-I82A/Q103G, correlating with the inhibition assay in Fig. 2. ERK2-Q103G effectively used all of the ATP analogs tested with the exception of N-6-(p-methyl)benzyl-ATP. Although this analog appeared somewhat effective in the inhibition assay, it was the least efficient of the seven and was most likely an example of an analog that simply blocks the ERK2 ATP binding site. Based on the inhibition assay and the Elk1 phosphorylation assay, we decided to use ERK2-Q103G (henceforth designated ERK2-QG) along with cyclopentyl ATP (henceforth designated cpATP) (Fig. 3, middle panel, lane 4) in our attempts to identify novel ERK2 substrates.Detection of Direct Substrates of ERK2 with [γ-32P]cpATPTo identify relevant substrates of ERK2, one would like to introduce labeled ATP analog into the live cells. However, cells are impermeable to ATP, and addition of labeled ATP analog to digitonin-permeabilized cells results in hydrolysis of the analog ATP within 1 min (32Chaudhary A. Brugge J.S. Cooper J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular concentration of ATP is 3 mm (33Weber M.J. Edlin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1828-1833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making it difficult to achieve analog concentrations sufficient to compete with ATP for kinases. Therefore, it was necessary to apply this technique to cell lysates or fractions. We chose to express the ERK2 and ERK2-QG (mutant ERK2) in COS-1 cells and then immunoprecipitate ERKs under non-stringent conditions where we would expect many ERK-binding proteins to remain associated. The immunoprecipitates were then used in a kinase reaction with either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP. In addition to ERK2 and ERK2-QG, other co-immunoprecipitated kinases would be capable of utilizing [γ-32P]ATP to phosphorylate co-immunoprecipitated substrates. However, reactions with ERK2-QG and [γ-32P]cpATP should result in the phosphorylation of only those proteins that are direct ERK substrates. Therefore, we should detect fewer radiolabeled substrates in the reactions with [γ-32P]cpATP as compared with reactions with [γ-32P]ATP.ERK2 or ERK2-QG from unstimulated or EGF-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated, and associated proteins were labeled in an in vitro kinase reaction using either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP. The reactions were resolved on SDS-PAGE, silver-stained, and subjected to autoradiography (Fig.4A). ERK2 and ERK2-QG proteins were expressed at similar levels and were activated efficiently after EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A, silver stain). Both ERK2 and ERK2-QG used [γ-32P]ATP very efficiently, generating similar patterns of phosphorylated substrates on SDS-PAGE (Fig.4A, autoradiogram). Phosphorylation of substrates in the absence of EGF stimulation was most likely due to the basal activity of ERK2. There were noticeable differences in the substrates recognized by ERK2 prior to and after EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A, autoradiogram; compare lane 1 with 2, lane 3 with 4, and lane 7 with 8). These differences are probably due to (i) differences in the association of substrates with ERK2 depending on the phosphorylation status of ERK2; (ii) dissociation of phosphorylated substrates from ERK2 after EGF stimulation in vivo; or (iii) prior phosphorylation of the substrate in vivo during the 10-min EGF stimulation.Figure 4Detection of ERK2 substrates. FLAG-ERK2 or FLAG-ERK2-QG plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells. Cells were serum-starved for 4–5 h followed by stimulation with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. ERK2 and ERK2-QG were immunoprecipitated, and kinase reactions were performed with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP. A, kinase reactions were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and autoradiography. ATP or cpATP labels on the top indicate kinase reactions carried out with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP, respectively. ERK2 and dually phosphorylated ERK2 (pERK2) are marked by arrows. B, ERK2 in vitro kinase reactions with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP analyzed on pH 4–7 linear (L) two-dimensional gels. C, ERK2-QG kinase reactions with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP analyzed on pH 4–7 L two-dimensional gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the kinase reactions were performed with [γ-32P]cpATP, there was a marked difference in the pattern of labeled substrates between reactions with ERK2 and ERK2-QG. Neither wild-type ERK2 nor its associated proteins could efficiently utilize [γ-32P]cpATP. The background phosphorylation with wild-type ERK2 that was detected with [γ-32P]cpATP was most likely due to trace contamination with [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.1%, data not shown) that occurred when generating [γ-32P]cpATP. At this level of electrophoretic resolution, few differences were detected in the substrates recognized by ERK2-QG in reactions with [γ-32P]ATP versus[γ-32P]cpATP (Fig. 4A, autoradiogram; compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and8). However, when the resolution of the gel systems was increased by using two-dimensional gels (Fig. 4, B andC), the advantages of the analog approach became evident.ERK2 in vitro kinase reactions with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]cpATP resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis are shown in Fig. 4B. These results further demonstrated that ERK2 and its associated proteins could not utilize [γ-32P]cpATP. In vitro kinase reactions using ERK2-QG were also analyzed on two-dimensional gels (Fig. 4C). Although the phosphorylation patterns between the [γ-32P]ATP and the [γ-32P]cpATP reactions were somewhat similar, we detected fewer substrates with [γ-32P]cpATP. The use of [γ-32P]cpATP decreased the overall level of phospho-proteins while enhancing ERK2-QG-specific phosphorylations. These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using [γ-32P]cpATP for specific detection of the direct substrates of ERK2.Identification of Novel ERK2 SubstratesAfter optimizing the conditions for the specific detection of direct substrates of ERK2-QG with [γ-32P]cpATP, we scaled up the procedure to detect co-immunoprecipitating substrates by mass spectrometry. Proteins co-immunoprecipitating with ERK2-QG were eluted along with ERK2 from M2 beads with FLAG peptide. Kinase reactions were then performed with [γ-32P]cpATP, and the reactions were resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Two radiolabeled silver-stained bands, one at ∼80 kDa and the other at ∼250 kDa, were excised from the lane with a non-EGF-stimulated (serum-free) sample (Fig. 5A, lane 2) and were sequenced by mass spectrometry. Eleven peptides (16.3% coverage) corresponding to the ERK2 substrate Rsk1 (34Moller D.E. Xia C.H. Tang W. Zhu A.X. Jakubowski M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C351-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were detected in the 80-kDa band. The isolation of a known ERK2 substrate validated our methodology for detecting ERK2 substrates. Mass spectrometry analysis of the 250-kDa band revealed 14 peptides (7% total coverage) corresponding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD (E3 identified by differential display). EDD is the human homolog of the Drosophila gene hyperplastic discsand was originally identified as a gene up-regulated in response to progestin (21Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). EDD is a 300-kDa protein and contains a region that has extensive homology to HECT domain ubiquitin ligases (21Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Figure 5Identification of Rsk1, EDD, and Tpr. pCDNA3.1 or ERK2-QG plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells (four 150-mm dishes/lane, 5–6 × 106 cells/dish at the time of transfection). Cells were serum-starved, stimulated with EGF, and lysed with hypotonic lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose beads. Proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide and kinase reactions carried out with [γ-32P]cpATP. A, proteins were resolved on a 8% SDS-PAGE visualized by silver staining and subjected to autoradiography.

https://openalex.org/W1977675750,"Growing evidence indicates that viral replication is regulated by the redox state of the host cell. We demonstrate that cells of different origins display differential permissivity for influenza A virus replication, depending on their intracellular redox power as reflected by Bcl-2 expression and glutathione (GSH) content. Bcl-2 expressing cells were found to have higher intracellular levels of GSH and to produce lower amounts of virus than Bcl-2 negative cells. Two different steps in the virus life-cycle were involved in Bcl-2/GSH mediated viral inhibition: 1) expression of late viral proteins (in particular hemagglutinin and matrix); and 2) nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Buthionine-sulfoximine-induced inhibition of GSH synthesis in Bcl-2 expressing cells caused an increase in the expression of late viral proteins but did not restore vRNP export to the cytoplasm. Collectively, our findings show that both Bcl-2 expression and GSH content contribute to the host cell's ability to down-regulate influenza virus replication, although their effects are exerted at different stages of the viral life-cycle. In certain cell populations, this form of down-regulation might conceivably favor the establishment of persistent viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2021399303,"It is well known that melatonin plays a fundamental role in human neuro-immunomodulation. Thus, melatonin regulates the production of a large number of cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the human system. Both membrane and nuclear receptors for melatonin are present in lymphoid cells. However, most of these effects have been shown to be mediated by the putative nuclear receptor for the neurohormone. In this paper, we show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent inflammatory mediator, inhibits IL-2 production in human lymphocytes by a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism. In this model, melatonin counteracts the effects of PGE2 on IL-2 and cAMP production. We propose that the effect of melatonin is mediated by a membrane receptor, since similar results were obtained when cells were cultured in the presence of S 20098, a specific melatonin membrane receptor agonist. No effect was observed by using CGP 52608, a nuclear receptor agonist. Moreover, when cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which has been shown to inhibit mt1 melatonin membrane receptor expression, the neurohormone failed to counteract the effect of PGE2. Therefore, we postulate, for the first time, a physiological role of the mt1 melatonin membrane receptor in the human immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2081070994,"Small molecule inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases such as STI571 represent a major new class of therapeutics for target-selective treatment of human cancer. Clinical resistance formation to the BCR-ABL inhibitor STI571 has been observed in patients with advanced chronic myeloid leukemia and was frequently caused by a C to T single nucleotide change in the Abl kinase domain, which substituted Thr-315 with isoleucine and rendered BCR-ABL resistant to STI571 inhibition. The corresponding mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase replaced Thr-766 of the EGFR by methionine and dramatically reduced the sensitivity of EGFR to inhibition by selective 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors such as PD153035. Inhibitor-resistant EGFR exhibited the same signaling capacity as wild-type receptor in vivo and provides a useful tool for analyzing EGFR-mediated signal transduction.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 2Neet K. Hunter T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Deregulation of protein tyrosine kinase-mediated cellular signaling is critically involved in various human malignancies and has therefore fueled the development of target-selective drugs for anticancer therapy. Small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity represent one major new class of therapeutics, and several target-specific compounds are currently undergoing clinical evaluation (3Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4Saywers C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (GleevecTM) is the most advanced of these novel cancer drugs and has received approval for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)1 (5Druker B.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S14-S18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In CML, the defined Philadelphia chromosomal translocation generates the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which exhibits constitutive Abl tyrosine kinase activity and is causative for disease development. STI571 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in early, chronic-phase CML patients, whereas patients suffering from the advanced form of CML, also known as blast crisis, initially responded to STI571 but then became resistant to drug treatment (6McCormick F. Nature. 2001; 412: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a subset of these cases, resistance formation has been attributed to a single C to T nucleotide mutation that replaced Thr-315 of Abl by isoleucine and thereby rendered BCR-ABL insensitive to STI571 treatment (7Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). Thr-315 is located at a hydrophobic cavity near the nucleotide binding site of c-Abl and is critical for binding of the ATP-competitive inhibitor STI571 but not essential for positioning of ATP itself, explaining why the activity is preserved in the mutant kinase (8Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). These findings establish that even targeted intervention strategies can be prone to resistance formation and further raise the important question of whether similar mechanisms might generally apply to tyrosine kinase inhibitors for cancer therapy. Apart from STI571, the most advanced small molecule drugs for treatment of malignancies belong to the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of compounds and selectively target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which has been implicated in the progression of various tumors (3Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4Saywers C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Specific EGFR inhibitors such as the quinazolines derivatives ZD1839 (Iressa®) and OSI-774 (Tarceva®) are already in late stages of clinical development, but the structural determinants of the EGFR kinase domain required for quinazoline binding and potentially involved in resistance formation have not been analyzed yet. In this report, we demonstrate that mutations equivalent to those found in BCR-ABL from relapsed CML patients dramatically desensitize EGFR to inhibition by 4-anilinoquinazolines without affecting its kinase activity and signal characteristics in vivo. CHO-K1 cells were from ATCC. Immortalized embryonic EF1.1 −/− fibroblasts derived from EGFR knockout mice were a generous gift from Maria Sibilia and Erwin Wagner (Vienna, Austria). Cell culture media and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Invitrogen. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Biosciences. PD153035, AG1478, and human recombinant EGF were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies purchased were mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-SHC antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-Gab1 antibody (Upstate), mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SHC and mAb108.1 mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies have been described previously (10Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Human EGFR cDNA was either cloned in the expression vector pRK5 or in the retroviral expression vector pLXSN, which allows moderate protein expression upon transient plasmid transfection (11Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Kubota Y. Angelotti T. Niederfellner D. Herbst R. Ullrich A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 247-256PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HA-ERK2 has been described previously (10Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Mutants of EGFR were generated using a mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). COS-7 and EF1.1 −/− cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in nutrient-mixture Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Retroviral infections of EF 1.1 −/− cells were performed as described (13Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Polyclonal cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR were established by selection in G418-containing medium. For plasmid transfection experiments in 6-well dishes, COS-7 (CHO-K1) cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105 (3.0 × 105) per well 20 h before transfection. Cells were incubated for 4 h in 1.0 ml of serum-free medium containing 9 μl (6 μl) of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg (2 μg) plasmid of DNA per well. The transfection mixtures were then either supplemented with 1 ml of medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (COS-7) or replaced by fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CHO-K1); 20 h later, cells were either lysed or serum-starved for a further 20 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation and lysis. Serum-starved cells were treated with inhibitors and growth factors as indicated prior to cell lysis in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate plus additives (10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation and then immunoprecipitated with the respective antibodies and protein G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. After three washes with lysis buffer without additives, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and then resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. For analysis of c-Fos induction, SDS-containing lysis buffer to solubilize nuclear proteins was used (14Daub H. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1677-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected in 10-cm dishes with 12 μg of either pRK5-EGFR or pRK5-EGFR-T766M expression plasmid and 36 μl of LipofectAMINE. On the following day, dishes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and then lysed with 950 μl of lysis buffer. After preclearing by centrifugation, aliquots of 140 μl of lysate were immunoprecipitated with mAb108.1 antibody. Beads were washed twice with 300 μl of lysis buffer without additives and twice with 200 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 100 μm orthovanadate, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Precipitated EGFRs were then preincubated on ice for 15 min in kinase buffer supplemented with EGFR inhibitor as indicated. Kinase reactions were then started by the addition of 10 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 3 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (Sigma) and performed for 5 min at room temperature (15Napier M.A. Lipari M.T. Courter R.G. Cheng C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer. After gel electrophoresis, phosphorylated G6PDH was detected by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging. No detectable kinase activity was found in anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates from control-transfected cells expressing no EGFR. EF1.1 −/− cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR were seeded in 12-well dishes and serum-starved at 50% confluency. After 24 h, cells were treated with PD153035 and EGF as indicated and then cultivated for 18 h. For the last 4 h, 0.5 μCi of methyl-[3H]thymidine were added per well. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 1 h of precipitation with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice. Precipitates were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 0.2 N NaOH/1% SDS and then neutralized with 0.5 ml of 0.2 N HCl. Incorporated radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Mutation of Thr-315 in Abl to isoleucine by a C to T single nucleotide change (ACC to ATC) rendered BCR-ABL kinase activity resistant to STI571 in advanced CML patients (7Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these results was provided by the Abl tyrosine kinase crystal structure, which identified Thr-315 in Abl as a key determinant for STI571 binding (8Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid residues surrounding Thr-315 in Abl with the EGFR sequence reveals a conserved threonine residue in the equivalent position 766 of the EGFR (Fig. 1A). We reasoned that Thr-766 in EGFR might also be implicated in drug resistance formation and therefore introduced the corresponding C to T single nucleotide change into the EGFR sequence. In the case of EGFR, this clinically relevant mutation replaces Thr-766 by methionine (ACG to ATG). The resulting EGFR-T766M mutant and wild-type EGFR were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells and isolated by immunoprecipitation. Both wild-type and mutant receptors were then assayed for kinase activity in vitro utilizing G6PDH as a substrate (15Napier M.A. Lipari M.T. Courter R.G. Cheng C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Wild-type EGFR was potently inhibited by the quinazoline derivative PD153035 with an IC50 value of about 1 nm (Fig. 1B). PD153035 is highly related in structure to the therapeutic agents ZD1839 and OSI-774 and was used as a representative 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor of the EGFR in this study (16Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr-766 to methionine resulted in 100-fold less potent EGFR kinase inhibition by PD153035 (Fig. 1B). With 10 μm ATP present in the kinase reactions, the catalytic activity of the mutant kinase was about 50% when compared with wild-type EGFR (data not shown). For further analysis of inhibitor sensitivity, we studied EGFR mutants in intact CHO-K1 cells that lack endogenous EGFR expression. In addition to the EGFR-T766M mutant, we also replaced Thr-766 of the EGFR by isoleucine to analyze the amino acid substitution equivalent to that found in STI571-insensitive BCR-ABL. Transiently expressed wild-type and mutant EGFR tyrosine kinases were stimulated in intact cells by the addition of EGF to the culture medium. After immunoprecipitation, wild-type and mutant EGFRs were analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine-specific antibody to measure autophosphorylation of the EGFR on intracellular tyrosine residues resulting from the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor (17Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). EGF-induced stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR and both mutants was similar, indicating that the replacement of Thr-766 by isoleucine or methionine had no significant effect on EGFR kinase activity in the context of cellular ATP concentrations (Fig. 1C). As further seen in Fig. 1C, pretreatment of cells with 10 nm PD153035 already strongly suppressed EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR. In stark contrast, 1000-fold higher concentrations of PD153035 only partially reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-T766I and had no inhibitory effect on the T766M mutant. Thus, even the modest threonine to isoleucine conversion at position 766 dramatically reduced the sensitivity of EGFR to PD153035 in intact cells. The longer side chain of methionine in position 766 conferred full resistance to mutant EGFR at all PD153035 concentrations tested. As evident for the T766M mutant, desensitization to PD153035 was even more pronounced under the physiologically relevant cellular conditions than observed in our in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when the quinazoline AG1478 was used for EGFR inhibition (data not shown) (18Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that substitution of methionine or isoleucine for Thr-766 desensitizes EGFR to specific 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors of its kinase activity in general. These bulkier hydrophobic side chains in position 766 might sterically interfere with the projection of the inhibitors' 4-anilino substituents into a hydrophobic pocket located at the nucleotide binding site of the EGFR, consistent with recent co-crystal data of the EGFR kinase domain in complex with OSI-774 (19Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hydroxyl group of Thr-766 could establish hydrogen bonds contributing to high affinity inhibitor binding. To analyze this issue, we replaced Thr-766 by a valine residue of similar size and compared EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR and the T766V mutant in transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the EGFR-T766V mutant exhibited an ∼10-fold reduced sensitivity to PD153035 inhibition compared with wild-type receptor, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Thr-766 is important for inhibitor binding but that its absence can only partially account for the dramatic EGFR resistance formation observed for the T766I and T766M mutants. Upon ligand-induced autophosphorylation, phosphotyrosine-dependent binding of the adaptor proteins SHC and Grb2 couples EGFR to Sos-mediated activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (20Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 21English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In addition, docking proteins such as Gab1 are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGFR activation and recruit additional signal transducers into receptor-proximal multiprotein complexes (22Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To test whether these mitogenic signals can be mediated through the EGFR-T766M mutant generated by the equivalent C to T single nucleotide mutation as previously found in STI571-resistant BCR-ABL from advanced CML patients (7Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar), we utilized retroviral gene transfer to stably express either wild-type EGFR or the T766M mutant in immortalized EF1.1 −/− fibroblasts derived from EGFR knockout mice (23Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). By analyzing ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in the presence of different PD153035 concentrations, we first confirmed that mutation of Thr-766 to methionine rendered EGFR resistant to PD153035 inhibition in murine fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The IC50 value was shifted from below 10 nm to more than 10 μm in agreement with our data from CHO-K1 cells presented above. Importantly, cellular tyrosine phosphorylation of both wild-type EGFR and the drug-resistant mutant was similar in response to low, non-saturating doses of EGF (Fig. 2B). Time course experiments further revealed comparable kinetics of EGFR down-regulation upon prolonged EGF treatment (Fig. 2C). Thus, wild-type EGFR and the PD153035-insensitive mutant showed the same activation and desensitization characteristics under physiologically relevant conditions in intact cells. To characterize EGFR-proximal signaling in wild-type and mutant receptor-expressing cells, we examined EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins SHC and Gab1. These cellular tyrosine kinase substrates play essential roles in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transmission. As shown in Fig.3, A and B, EGF-induced SHC and Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated when cells expressing wild-type EGFR were preincubated with 1 μm PD153035, whereas neither signaling event was affected in fibroblasts expressing the EGFR-T766M mutant upon inhibitor pretreatment. Moreover, similar sets of proteins, including the adaptor protein Grb2, were found to co-precipitate with SHC or Gab1 in both cell lines, demonstrating that the Thr-766 to methionine mutation did not alter EGFR-proximal signaling steps in intact cells (Fig. 3,A and B). We next examined whether the EGFR-T766M could also trigger MAPK signal transduction and gene expression in a PD153035-insensitive manner. To assay for activation of ERK MAP kinases, lysates from EGF-treated cells were subjected to immunoblotting with antibody specific for dually phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2. As shown in Fig. 3C, micromolar concentrations of PD153035 abrogated ERK phosphorylation in wild-type EGFR but not in EGFR-T766M-expressing fibroblasts. Moreover, although pretreatment with 100 nm PD153035 strongly suppressed autophosphorylation of wild-type EGFR (Fig. 2A), this inhibitor concentration was not yet sufficient to block EGF-induced ERK activation, indicating that the remaining residual EGFR activation is still sufficient to trigger the ERK pathway. Finally, EGF-induced expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos, was investigated; we again found that the threonine to methionine mutation had conferred PD153035-resistance to this EGFR-mediated signaling event (Fig. 3D). Thus, our results show that the equivalent C to T nucleotide change as found in STI571-resistant BCR-ABL fully restores EGFR-mediated signaling in the presence of a selective 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor. These findings further demonstrate that none of the kinases downstream of EGFR were affected by the quinazoline compound PD153035, confirming the high specificity of this EGFR inhibitor. Targeted cancer therapy employing selective EGFR inhibitors primarily aims at suppressing tumor cell proliferation. To quantify how the anti-proliferative effect of a specific quinazoline inhibitor is diminished if EGFR had acquired drug resistance, we performed thymidine incorporation assays to measure the EGF-mediated proliferative responses in both wild-type and T766M mutant EGFR-expressing cell lines. PD153035 pretreatment inhibited EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis mediated through wild-type EGFR with an IC50 value of about 50 nm (Fig.4), whereas half-maximal inhibition of EGF-triggered thymidine incorporation through the EGFR-T766M mutant occurred at about 50-fold higher PD153035 concentrations of around 2.5 μm. Because even up to 10 μm of the inhibitor were without effect on EGFR-T766M tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells, this finding reveals that cellular targets of PD153035 distinct from EGFR are involved in EGF-triggered cell cycle progression. These unknown secondary targets are inhibited at much higher concentrations of PD153035, again demonstrating the high selectivity of this specific EGFR blocker and further implying that analogous EGFR mutations might render cancer patients resistant to treatment with selective EGFR blockers. We reasoned that co-expression of inhibitor-resistant EGFR should complement for endogenous, inhibitor-sensitive EGFR upon PD153035 treatment and thereby provide a novel tool for chemical-genetic validation of EGFR function. To test this, we used the EGFR-dependent ERK MAPK activation upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors as a model system (10Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

Upon transient expression of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ERK2, COS-7 cells were stimulated with either 10 μm LPA to activate its cognate G protein-coupled receptor or 1 ng/ml EGF. HA-ERK2 was then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with activation-specific antibody recognizing dually phosphorylated ERK2. In agreement with published data (10Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), pretreatment of cells with 1 μm PD153035 strongly suppressed LPA-induced and blocked EGF-triggered HA-ERK2 activation (Fig. 5,upper two panels). Similar inhibition of LPA- and EGF-induced ERK2 activity by PD153035 was observed when wild-type EGFR was co-expressed (Fig. 5, middle two panels). But, in striking contrast, co-transfection of the PD153035-resistant EGFR-T766M mutant fully restored both LPA- and EGF-triggered HA-ERK2 activation in the presence of 1 μm PD153035 (Fig. 5, lower two panels). Thus, this result confirms that specific inhibition of EGFR by PD153035 suppresses LPA-stimulated ERK activation and establishes inhibitor-resistant EGFR as a useful tool for target validation in signal transduction analysis. Our results identify Thr-766 as a critical structural determinant controlling inhibitor sensitivity of the EGFR. Importantly, introduction of bulkier hydrophobic side chains at this position fully preserved the cellular kinase activity of the EGFR in the presence of selective kinase inhibitors, indicating potential mechanisms of molecular resistance formation as previously found for BCR-ABL from STI571-treated CML patients. In addition to the Thr-315 to isoleucine substitution in the Abl kinase domain described by Gorre et al. (7Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar), previous work has established that the corresponding threonine residues in the cytoplasmatic protein kinases p38 and Src are critical for their sensitivities to the pyridinylimidazole inhibitor SB203580 and the pyrazolopyrimidine derivative PP1, respectively (24Eyers P.A.

Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 8: 257-266Google Scholar). Thus, a shared structural feature emerges from our work and published data that define an active-site threonine residue conserved in a subset of protein kinases as critical for kinase inhibition by small molecular weight inhibitors belonging to different compound classes. Remarkably, although the majority of protein kinases have a larger, hydrophobic residue in the equivalent position, most of the selective and highly potent inhibitors have been identified for the comparably small subgroup of protein kinases possessing a threonine at this site. Published co-crystal structures of protein kinases from the latter group reveal that inhibitor moieties always extend into a hydrophobic cavity at the ATP-binding site, which cannot be occupied by ATP itself (8Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 19Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These additional inhibitor-kinase interactions allow high affinity binding, which is abrogated when the conserved threonine residue located in the hydrophobic pocket is replaced by a more space-filling amino acid. It further appears that this particular structure-activity relationship has influenced the development of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors for cancer therapy, because most of these therapeutics in clinical testing selectively target receptor tyrosine kinases possessing a threonine in the conserved position (or a valine of comparable size as is present in fibroblast growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) (3Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar,4Saywers C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this context, our results raise the issue whether all of these receptor tyrosine kinase targets might be susceptible to resistance formation when required for the proliferation of genetically unstable tumor cells, because even minimal genetic alterations could abrogate small molecule inhibitor binding, as demonstrated for the EGFR in this study. In addition to substitutions equivalent to the Thr-315 to isoleucine exchange initially detected in STI571-resistant BCR-ABL, other kinase domain mutations could also confer inhibitor resistance to receptor tyrosine kinases as recently reported for the Abl kinase domain from relapsed CML patients (27von Bubnoff N.

To examine the effect of membrane association on the interaction between the normal protease-sensitive PrP isoform (PrP-sen) and the protease-resistant isoform (PrP-res), a model system was employed using PrP-sen reconstituted into sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich raft-like liposomes (SCRLs).

Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Like other GPI-anchored proteins, PrP is enriched in sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains known as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), or rafts (2Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H.

Several lines of evidence from biochemical and molecular biological approaches suggest raft association is required for conversion of the normal protease-sensitive isoform (PrP-sen) to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy-associated protease-resistant isoform (PrP-res) in a cell culture model of infection (2Vey M.

Although cell-free studies using purified PrP molecules have provided new insights into binding and conversion of PrP-sen by PrP-res (reviewed in Ref. 8Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Callahan M.A. Wong C. Baron G.S. Xiong L.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 57: 139-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), few studies have considered the membrane-associated nature of PrP (9DeArmond S.J. Qiu Y.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Given the complex composition of cellular raft membranes, which contain molecules other than PrP-sen that might influence interactions with PrP-res, investigations into the effect of PrP-sen association with rafts on these interactions would benefit from the use of a defined system that replicated raft membranes in the absence of other raft-associated molecules. One candidate system involves the use of sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich raft-like liposomes (SCRLs) containing phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, brain cerebrosides, and cholesterol. SCRLs have been shown to resemble rafts in several respects, including major lipid composition and low buoyant density, which permits their isolation by floatation through density gradients (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins reconstituted into SCRLs or related sphingolipid-rich liposomes acquire properties of their cell-associated counterparts, most notably insolubility in cold Triton X-100 (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 16Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Hence, SCRLs serve as a reasonable approximation of the natural membrane environment of PrP in the absence of other raft-associated molecules. Our previous work examined the effect of PrP-sen association with rafts on interactions with PrP-res using raft membranes prepared from neuroblastoma cells (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that raft-bound PrP-sen resisted conversion to PrP-res until PrP-sen was released from rafts by phospholipase digestion or the PrP-res was inserted into contiguous membranes. To examine the effect of PrP-sen membrane association on its interactions with PrP-res under more defined conditions and to determine if membrane association itself inhibits conversion of PrP-sen by exogenous PrP-res, we have employed a model system using PrP-sen reconstituted into SCRLs. While developing this system, two groups recently reported a novel property of recombinant PrP-sen expressed in Escherichia coli: binding to model membranes of various compositions (10Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Sanghera N. Pinheiro T.J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1241-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We had also observed this phenomenon in our system using GPI anchor-deficient PrP-sen expressed in mammalian cell lines and have further characterized the nature of this binding activity using various forms of PrP-sen that may more closely represent the native state of the molecule, particularly with respect to the addition of N-linked glycans. Furthermore, we have directly tested the effect of the two methods of PrP-sen association with membranes (i.e. GPI anchor-dependent and -independent) on its interactions with exogenous PrP-res molecules as assayed by its ability to serve as a substrate for conversion to the protease-resistant state under cell-free conditions. Our results indicate that the method of PrP-sen association with model membranes has strikingly different effects on its ability to interact with PrP-res. Hamster PrP-sen was derived from mouse fibroblast cell lines expressing either full-length (GPI+ PrP-sen) or GPI anchor-deficient (GPI− PrP-sen) wild-type (wt) PrP-sen (17Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The corresponding N-terminal hamster PrP-sen deletion mutants were derived from cell lines created by Lawson and co-workers (19Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Wild-type GPI+ mouse PrP-sen was isolated from a mouse neuroblastoma cell line described elsewhere (20Wong C. Xiong L.-W. Horiuchi M. Raymond L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PrP-sen molecules were immunoprecipitated from cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (21Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mouse PrP-sen was immunoprecipitated using rabbit antiserum (R30) against a PrP synthetic peptide (amino acids 89–103) (22Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hamster PrP-sen was immunoprecipitated with 3F4 monoclonal antibody (23Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal antiserum (R20) raised against a C-terminal (amino acids 218–232) PrP synthetic peptide (22Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R20 antiserum was used specifically to isolate PrP-sen molecules (both wt and mutants) for experiments involving the N-terminal deletion mutants, because one mutant (Δ124) lacks the 3F4 epitope. Cell culture supernatants containing phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)-released proteins from metabolically labeled cells expressing GPI+ PrP-sen were prepared as described previously (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Where indicated, PI-PLC-released hamster PrP-sen (referred to as GPIPI-PLC PrP-sen) was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants as described elsewhere with 3F4 or R20 (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For some experiments, PI-PLC culture supernatant proteins were deglycosylated with PNGase F (New England BioLabs) as per the manufacturer's instructions prior to PrP-sen immunoprecipitation. Sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich liposomes (SCRLs) were prepared essentially as described previously (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) with exceptions as noted below. All lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. SCRLs contained bovine liver phosphatidylcholine (PC)/brain sphingomyelin (SM)/brain cerebrosides (CB)/cholesterol (Chol) in a 2:1:1:2 molar ratio. For some experiments, modified SCRLs were prepared consisting of PC/CB/Chol (1:1:1), PC/SM/Chol (1:1:1), PC/SM/CB (2:1:1), SM/CB/Chol (1:1:2), or PC/Chol (1:1). For each type of modified SCRL, the total moles of lipid used in the preparation as well as the molar ratio of phospholipid:sphingolipid:cholesterol was matched to that contained in SCRLs where possible. SCRLs were usually prepared in citrate-buffered saline (CBS, 10 mm citrate, 137 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) except for the experiments with modified SCRLs (Tricine-buffered saline, pH 7.8) and the reconstitution experiments to evaluate the effect of pH where saline buffered with acetate (pH 5.0), phosphate (pH 7.0), or Tricine (pH 7.8) was also used. After dialysis, SCRLs were either used for reconstitution or binding studies as outlined below. PrP-sen was reconstituted into SCRLs using a protocol adapted from Schroeder et al. (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). [35S]PrP-sen was adjusted to contain 137 mmNaCl and 0.8% Sarkosyl just before addition to SCRLs that had been freeze-thawed three times. The samples were rapidly mixed and dialyzed immediately in Slide-a-lyzer cassettes (Pierce) against the buffer in which the SCRLs were prepared (usually CBS). The cassettes were manually agitated approximately hourly for the first few hours of dialysis to keep the liposomes well dispersed. The final concentration of Sarkosyl in the initial PrP-sen/SCRL mixture was ≤0.08%. Large scale preparations usually contained about 200 ng of [35S]PrP-sen (∼1–2 × 106 cpm) and 2 mg (3.2 × 10−6 mol) of lipids. After overnight dialysis, the PrP/liposome mixture was adjusted to 10% Optiprep (Invitrogen) in the appropriate buffered saline. The sample was then overlaid with a linear step gradient of Optiprep in buffered saline consisting of either five steps (1%, 2.5%, 4%, 5.5%, and 7%) or three steps (1%, 4%, and 7%). Large scale gradients contained 300 μl (for five steps) or 500 μl (for three steps) per step for the overlaid fraction and were centrifuged in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 21,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in polycarbonate tubes. To prepare Triton X-100-treated SCRLs containing GPI+ PrP-sen, the dialyzed PrP-sen/SCRL mixture was first diluted with 1 ml of CBS and centrifuged in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C to pellet the liposomes. The pellet was then resuspended in 300 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in CBS and incubated for 20 min on ice prior to adjustment to 10% Optiprep and centrifugation as above. After centrifugation, the SCRL lipid band was collected and stored on ice until use. Relative to the input cpm, typically ∼40–60% of the GPI− or GPI+ PrP-sen was associated with the SCRLs (without Triton X-100 treatment) and ∼20–30% (of GPI+ PrP-sen) was recovered in the SCRL fractions after Triton X-100 extraction. Small scale preparations (scaled down 1/10 for amount of PrP-sen and lipids) were used to evaluate the effect of lipid composition and pH on incorporation efficiency. Small scale gradients for analytical purposes contained 30 μl (for five steps) or 50 μl (for three steps) per step for the overlaid fraction and were centrifuged in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in polycarbonate tubes. Six fractions were collected from these gradients starting from the top: five gradient fractions of 30 μl each and one fraction corresponding to the bottom (i.e. the volume of sample loaded in 10% Optiprep). For five-step gradients, the lipid band formed at the 1%/2.5% Optiprep interface and the majority of the lipid was collected in fractions 1 and 2. For three-step gradients, the lipid band formed at the 1%/4% interface and the majority of the lipid was collected in fraction 2. The fractions were mixed with 20 μg of thyroglobulin, and proteins were precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol. After centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 20 min, methanol pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on Novex pre-cast acrylamide gels. Radioactive proteins were visualized and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager instrument (Amersham Biosciences). SCRLs were first washed in CBS and concentrated by centrifugation as described above. For experiments for testing the pH dependence of the binding, SCRLs were washed and resuspended in buffered saline of the appropriate pH (i.e. acetate (pH 5.0), citrate (pH 6.0), HEPES (pH 7.0), or Tricine (pH 7.8) each at 10 mm). To bind PrP-sen to SCRLs in the absence of detergent, [35S]PrP-sen (10,000–15,000 cpm or ∼1–2 ng) was added to SCRLs (∼67 μg of lipid) in binding buffer consisting of a final concentration of 50 mm buffer of appropriate pH (usually citrate), 137 mm NaCl. To bind35S-labeled PI-PLC-released/secreted proteins to SCRLs in the absence of detergent, PI-PLC culture supernatant (1/25 to 1/50 equivalents released from a T-25 flask of cells) was mixed with SCRLs (∼67 μg of lipid) in 50 mm CBS (final concentration). Binding reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h unless indicated otherwise and were mixed at ∼15-min intervals to keep the liposomes well dispersed. The reactions were then chilled on ice, adjusted to 10% Optiprep, and processed on small scale analytical gradients as described above. In some cases, binding was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of the gradient fractions and included boiling the empty centrifuge tube in a volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30 μl) equal to the volume of the “bottom” fraction to ensure recovery of any residual protein. These results are expressed as the mean percentage of counts recovered in the low density fractions (1Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B.

Where indicated, gradient fractions were deglycosylated with PNGase F prior to methanol precipitation or immunoprecipitation with 3F4 antibody and SDS-PAGE as above. Binding reactions were scaled up to contain ∼200 ng of [35S]GPI− PrP-sen and 2 mg of lipid and fractionated on a 600-μl gradient (200 μl each of 1%, 4%, and 7% Optiprep) in a TLS-55 rotor as above to prepare sufficient PrP-containing SCRLs for use in cell-free conversion reactions. Protein-containing SCRLs were harvested from Optiprep gradients, washed in buffered saline, and centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge as described above to recover the SCRLs. Liposome pellets were usually resuspended directly in extraction buffer consisting of either 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5), 1 or 3 m NaCl in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0), or 1% Triton X-100 in CBS. In some cases, an SCRL pellet was resuspended in CBS and mixed with one volume of 2% Triton X-100 in CBS or 2m NaCl in citrate buffer. Extractions with NaCl or sodium carbonate were incubated on ice for 30–60 min. Extractions with Triton X-100 were either incubated on ice or at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were then adjusted to contain 10% Optiprep and processed on small scale analytical gradients as above. Cell-free conversion reactions were performed essentially as described previously in 50 mm citrate (pH 6.0), 137 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (conversion buffer) supplemented with 100 μg/ml heparan sulfate and protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) with exceptions noted below (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Crude brain microsomes were prepared either from mice infected with 87V mouse-adapted scrapie or hamsters infected with 263K hamster-adapted scrapie and used as a source of PrP-res (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Microsomes from normal uninfected animals were used as a control. [35S]PrP-sen-containing SCRLs were washed and resuspended in CBS prior to addition to conversion reactions (∼10,000–15,000 cpm/reaction). Reactions containing the different forms of GPI− PrP-sen were adjusted to contain equivalent amounts of input radioactivity and simply involved mixing the PrP-sen-containing SCRLs or purified PrP-sen with microsomes in conversion buffer with heparan sulfate and protease inhibitors. Also, the [35S]GPI− PrP-sen used in all these reactions was derived from a single preparation of protein divided into three parts: one part was added directly to the reactions (free PrP-sen), a second part was used to prepare PrP-sen bound to SCRLs in the presence of Sarkosyl, and the remaining portion was used to prepare PrP-sen bound to SCRLs in the absence of Sarkosyl. Reactions using GPI+ PrP-sen-containing SCRLs were set up as described for [35S]DRMs in our previous study, although we modified our protocol to include a dilution step (addition of 50 μl of conversion buffer) after the 5-min incubation at room temperature with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or conversion buffer to allow efficient recovery of membranes from PEG-treated reactions in the subsequent pelleting step (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Conversion reactions were incubated at 37 °C for either 2 days or 1 day (in the case of some of the GPI− PrP-sen reactions) and processed as described previously with incubation at 37 °C for 20 min in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 137 mm NaCl (1× extraction buffer) followed by proteinase K (PK) digestion for 1 h with 33 μg/ml PK (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In some cases, the samples were deglycosylated after PK digestion but before methanol precipitation by treatment with PNGase F (New England BioLabs) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot detection of PrP was performed as described by Horiuchi et al. (24Horiuchi M. Chabry J. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) using a mouse/human recombinant monoclonal antibody Fab (R1, 0.36 μg/ml) that binds hamster PrP between residues 220 and 231 (25Williamson R.A.

Anthony Williamson and Dennis Burton (The Scripps Research Institute). Bound R1 antibody was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Sigma (A8542)) at a 1:10000 dilution. We adapted a previously described technique (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) to allow reconstitution of PrP-sen into SCRLs. Hamster PrP-sen was expressed in fibroblasts as either full-length GPI-anchored protein (GPI+) or a GPI anchor-deficient (GPI−) form lacking the GPI anchor addition sequence. Purified PrP-sen was mixed with SCRLs in the presence of a low concentration (≤0.08%) of Sarkosyl and immediately dialyzed against buffered saline. SCRLs and SCRL-bound proteins were then isolated by floatation through a density gradient. GPI+ PrP-sen stably associated with SCRLs in the low density fractions (1Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K.

Surprisingly, control experiments with GPI− PrP-sen revealed that this derivative also avidly associated with SCRLs (Fig.1B). When fractionated on gradients in the absence of SCRLs, all of the PrP-sen (both GPI+ and GPI−) was found in the bottom fraction (fraction 6) indicating that floatation of PrP-sen in the gradient is dependent upon SCRLs (data not shown). To verify the SCRL association was not due to trapping of PrP-sen inside the liposomes, we incubated the PrP-containing SCRLs with proteinase K (PK). As shown in Fig. 2, the vast majority (∼90%) of SCRL-bound PrP-sen was susceptible to PK digestion without detergent-mediated disruption of the liposomes, indicating that the bulk of the protein was surface-accessible. These data show that PrP-sen exhibits an alternative, GPI anchor-independent method of associating with model membranes, a conclusion consistent with other recent studies (10Morillas M. Swietnicki W.

SCRLs containing reconstituted [35S]PrP-sen as described in Fig. 1 were digested with PK (10 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of detergent (1% Triton X-100) at 37 °C for 50 min. Results are representative of two independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nature of the binding interactions of the PrP-sen molecules with SCRLs was characterized by subjecting the PrP-bound SCRLs to various extraction conditions. Treatments with either high salt (1 m NaCl (Fig.3A) or 3 m NaCl (data not shown)) or 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) (Fig.3B), which extract peripheral membrane proteins, failed to remove either type of PrP-sen molecule from SCRLs. A significant fraction (∼40–50%) of GPI+ PrP-sen resisted extraction with Triton X-100 at 4 °C (Fig. 3C, lanes 1and 2 versus lane 6) but not 37 °C (Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 2 versus lane 6), resembling the behavior of GPI-anchored proteins in rafts (14Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cold-Triton X-100-extracted SCRLs with PI-PLC to cleave the GPI anchors caused the release of a majority (∼60%) of the formerly GPI-anchored PrP-sen molecules from the SCRLs upon re-extraction with cold Triton (data not shown). However, GPI− PrP-sen was readily extracted with cold Triton X-100 without PI-PLC treatment (Fig. 3C,lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 12), suggesting that this GPI anchor-independent method of attachment was mediated by hydrophobic protein-lipid interactions. A very small proportion of GPI− PrP-sen apparently resisted extraction by cold Triton X-100, possibly due to use of an insufficient amount of detergent or inversion"
https://openalex.org/W2125014313,"Vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF) has been implicated in blood/tissue barrier dysfunctions associated with pathological angiogenesis, but the mechanisms of VEGF-induced permeability increase are poorly understood. Here, the role of VEGF-induced extracellular proteolytic activities on the endothelial cell permeability increase is evaluated. Confluent monolayers of bovine retinal microvascular endothelial (BRE) cells grown on porous membrane were treated with VEGF or urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and permeability changes were analyzed. uPA-induced permeability was rapid and sustained, but VEGF-induced permeability showed a biphasic pattern: a rapid and transient phase (1-2 h) followed by delayed and sustained phase (6-24 h). The delayed, but not the early phase of VEGF-induced permeability, was blocked by anti-uPA or anti-uPAR (uPA receptor) antibodies and was accompanied by reduced transendothelial electrical resistance, indicating the paracellular route of permeability. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting showed that VEGF treatment increased free cytosolic beta-catenin, which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation, upregulation of uPAR, and downregulation of occludin. Membrane-bound occludin was released immediately after uPA treatment, but with a long delay after VEGF treatment, suggesting a requirement for uPAR gene expression. In conclusion, VEGF induces a sustained paracellular permeability in capillary endothelial cells that is mediated by activation of the uPA/uPAR system."
https://openalex.org/W2096863176,"The heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Protein stability and transactivation function of the α subunit are controlled by iron- and oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline and asparagine residues. The anti-mycotic ciclopirox olamine (CPX) is a lipophilic bidentate iron chelator that stabilizes HIF-1α under normoxic conditions at lower concentrations than other iron chelators, probably by inhibiting HIF-1α hydroxylation. As shown by the inhibition of iron-dependent quenching of FITC-labeled deferoxamine (DFX) fluorescence, CPX appears to have an even higher affinity for iron than DFX. Initial observations that treatment with 1% CPX, but not with placebo, occasionally caused reddening of wound margins in a mouse skin wound model prompted us to investigate the capability of CPX to induce angiogenesis. CPX-induced HIF-1-mediated reporter gene activity and endogenous HIF-1 target gene expression, including elevation of transcription, mRNA, and protein levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, inert polymer disks containing CPX but not the solvent alone induced angiogenesis. In summary, these results suggest that CPX induces angiogenesis in vivo via HIF-1 and VEGF induction. Therefore, CPX might serve as an alternative to recombinant VEGF treatment or to VEGF gene therapy for therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2112235102,"Secretory granules of chromaffin cells contain catecholamines and several antimicrobial peptides derived from chromogranins and proenkephalin-A. These peptides are secreted in the extracellular medium following exocytosis. Here, we show that ubiquitin is stored in secretory chromaffin granules and released into the circulation upon stimulation of chromaffin cells. We also show that the C-terminal fragment (residues 65-76) of ubiquitin displays, at the micromolar range, a lytic antifungal activity. Using confocal laser scan microscopy and rhodamine-labeled synthetic peptides, we could demonstrate that the C-terminal peptide (residues 65-76) is able to cross the cell wall and the plasma membrane of fungi and to accumulate in fungi, whereas the N-terminal peptide (residues 1-34) is stopped at the fungal wall level. Furthermore, these two peptides act synergistically to kill filamentous fungi. Because of the interaction of the C-terminal sequence of ubiquitin with calmodulin, the synthetic peptide (residues 65-76) was tested in vitro against calmodulin-dependent calcineurin, an enzyme crucial for fungal growth. This peptide was found to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. Our data show a new property of ubiquitin C-terminal-derived peptide (65-76) that could be used with N-terminal peptide (1-34) as a new potent antifungal agent."
https://openalex.org/W2121097260,"The catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) is a reverse transcriptase (RT) that adds a six-base DNA repeat onto chromosome ends and prevents their shortening during successive cell divisions. Telomerase is associated with cell immortality and cancer, which may by related to the ability of TERT to prevent apoptosis by stabilizing telomeres. However, fundamental information concerning the antiapoptotic function of TERT is lacking, including whether RT activity and/or nuclear localization are required and where telomerase acts to suppress the cell death process. Here, we show that overexpression of wild-type human TERT in HeLa cells, and in a cells lacking TERT but containing the telomerase RNA template, increases their resistance to apoptosis induced by the DNA damaging agent etoposide or the bacterial alkaloid staurosporine. In contrast, TERT mutants with disruptions of either the RT domain or a 14-3-3 binding domain fail to protect cells against apoptosis, and overexpression of TERT in cells lacking the telomerase RNA template is also ineffective in preventing apoptosis. Additional findings show that TERT suppresses apoptosis at an early step before release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria. We conclude that both RT activity and 14-3-3 protein binding ability are required for the antiapoptotic function of TERT in tumor cells and that TERT can suppress a nuclear signal(s) that is an essential component of apoptotic cascades triggered by diverse stimuli."

Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mRNA and protein levels of SCOP in the rat SCN increase during subjective night with a peak at midnight under constant dark conditions (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to circadian expression in the SCN, SCOP is expressed at a constant level in neurons throughout the rat brain (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but its function in neurons including the SCN is yet to be elucidated. SCOP is a large polypeptide (1,696 amino acids) containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C)-like domain and glutamine (Q)-rich region (see Fig. 2), suggesting its unique role in intracellular signaling. The LRRs are characterized by multiple repeats of a sequence harboring leucine residues at invariable positions (2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), and LRR-containing proteins are thought to contribute to diverse biological functions through the LRR-mediated protein-protein interactions (2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The LRR in SCOP is composed of 18-fold repeats of a short stretch unit with a relatively conserved but variable sequence, LXXLXLXXNXLXXLPXXAXXL, where L, N, P, A, and X denote leucine, asparagine, proline, aliphatic, and any amino acid, respectively (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). YeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae adenylate cyclase contains 26-fold repeats of a similar unit (3Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), to which Ras binds for Ras-dependent enzymatic activation (4Field J. Xu H.-P. Michaeli T. Ballester R. Sass P. Wigler M. Colicelli J. Science. 1990; 247: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki N. Choe H.-R. Nishida Y. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Ohnishi S. Tamaoki T. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8711-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The homologous LRR is also found in human and Caenorhabditis elegans SUR-8 (6Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which interacts directly with Ras to regulate its signaling (6Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,7Li W. Han M. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus predicted that SCOP may also interact with Ras to regulate Ras-mediated signaling pathway.As a molecular switch, Ras cycles between a GTP-bound active state and a GDP-bound inactive state via GTP hydrolysis and GDP/GTP exchange steps. Two major types of Ras-interacting molecules have been described that modulate the Ras GTP-GDP cycle through regulation of either the activation or inactivation step. The former is mediated by a class of proteins, guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), that interact with the GDP-bound form of Ras to reduce its affinity for GDP. This facilitates formation of the guanine nucleotide-free form of Ras, to which GTP binds for its activation. The latter is accelerated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and thereby promote the inactivation of Ras. Although the regulatory elements of Ras proteins may not be fully understood yet, these steps should provide a mechanism that manipulates the timing and strength of Ras signaling to ensure appropriate signaling output (8Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). In addition to these regulatory steps, the presence of Ras isoforms may contribute to a well ordered framework of Ras-mediated signaling. Despite a high degree of sequence similarity among Ras isoforms, accumulating evidence points to a preferential activation of specific effectors by each Ras isoform (9Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 10Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This issue seems to be associated with protein clustering in membrane microdomains such as rafts (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Membrane rafts are small platforms composed of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and a given set of proteins and are important for regulation of cellular signaling (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Selective localization of the Ras isoforms at different membrane microdomains reinforces the idea of distinct functionality and regulation of these proteins (13Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Appolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Knockout mouse for each of the Ras isoforms showed that K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, is essential for development (14Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and these results further support the idea that Ras isoforms play distinct roles.The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is one of the best-characterized effector systems downstream of Ras (17Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Ras-MAPK-mediated signaling plays critical roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in response to extracellular signals. Recent studies have demonstrated an important contribution of Ras-MAPK cascade to the circadian clock system in the rodent SCN (19Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and the chick pineal gland (20Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J.

Here we show that SCOP functions as a negative regulator of the Ras-MAPK pathway by interacting with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras in the membrane rafts to down-regulate the nucleotide binding for its activation. The results presented in this study illustrate a novel type of regulatory mechanism for Ras signaling and suggest a contribution of SCOP to a variety of cellular functions.DISCUSSIONLRRs have been found in a variety of proteins with diverse functions and cellular locations (2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). We first predicted the interaction of SCOP LRR (18 repeats) with Ras because of its similarity in sequence to the LRR of yeast adenylate cyclase (26 repeats) (3Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and of SUR-8 (18 repeats) (6Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), both of which are known to bind with Ras for functional regulation. The present study provides evidence for the direct interaction of Ras with SCOP LRR, but the LRR domain of SCOP was functionally different from those of yeast adenylate cyclase and SUR-8 in terms of Ras regulation. Yeast adenylate cyclase interacts with the GTP-bound form of Ras and is thereby activated (4Field J. Xu H.-P. Michaeli T. Ballester R. Sass P. Wigler M. Colicelli J. Science. 1990; 247: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction of SUR-8 with the GTP-bound form of Ras results in activation of MAPK pathway (7Li W. Han M. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SCOP associates with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras in the membrane rafts to down-regulate the Ras-MAPK pathway. This is a novel mechanism for negative regulation of Ras protein function through interaction with LRRs.Despite the high sequence similarity among Ras isoforms, SCOP selectively associates with K-Ras, a unique isoform that is abundant in the raft fraction of the rat brain homogenate (Fig. 1). It has been recognized that activation of different Ras isoforms results in distinct signaling outputs (9Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol.

It should be noted that in some cell lines established from non-neural tissues H-Ras operates in membrane rafts, whereas K-Ras seems to be located outside rafts (13Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A.

Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), in contrast with the selective enrichment of K-Ras in the rafts of the rat brain membranes (Fig. 1). This may be ascribed to cell type-specific compositions of rafts (for example, the existence of neuron-specific proteins such as SCOP), and hence neural membrane rafts might be unique because they lack caveolin (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar).Although SCOP and K-Ras were also present in the Triton X-100-soluble (non-raft) fraction, we observed no significant binding of SCOP LRR to K-Ras present in non-raft fractions. This observation supports the idea that SCOP and K-Ras may become associated only in the membrane rafts or alternatively that their interaction may induce the rafts formation. However, direct involvement of a third (raft-specific) component is inconsistent with the results of our pull-down experiments in which recombinant SCOP and K-Ras proteins were both expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3D). Instead, SCOP LRR seems to associate selectively with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras present in the membrane rafts but not with the GTPγS- nor GDP-bound forms that were produced by adding the guanine nucleotides after solubilization of the rafts. These data indicate that in the membrane rafts, just as in theE. coli lysate, at least a part of K-Ras is kept in the nucleotide-free form or in a form with an extremely low affinity for the guanine nucleotides. The postincubation experiment with GTPγS or GDP (Fig. 3B) strongly suggests that SCOP LRR “traps” the nucleotide-free state (or a low affinity state) of K-Ras that is generated by GDP release after receiving signals. This binding probably down-regulates the K-Ras function (Fig. 5) by inhibiting the GTP binding reaction (Fig. 4B). In this regard, the action of SCOP provides a striking contrast with that of CDC25p, which is also supposed to bind and stabilize the nucleotide-free state of Ras but promotes its activation (39Haney S.A. Broach J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16541-16548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In PC12 cells, SCOP suppressed activation of ERK1 and -2 (Fig. 5), which are well characterized effectors downstream of Ras. In both cortical neurons and PC12 cells, calcium triggers ERK activation via activation of Ras (30Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E.

This suggests that SCOP acts on Ras itself or on a step downstream of Ras in the signaling pathway. The finding that SCOP binds directly to K-Ras (Fig. 2B) supports K-Ras as the target site of SCOP.In rodent SCN, SCOP-mediated regulation of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway may be important for the maintenance of circadian rhythm (19Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 20Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37078-37085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both the protein level of SCOP (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation (and activation) of ERK1/2 (19Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) display a circadian variation in rodent SCN. MAPK activity has its peak late in the subjective day when the protein level of SCOP is low, whereas MAPK activity is minimum at mid-late subjective night when SCOP expression is highest. Therefore, we hypothesize that SCOP inhibition of ERK1/2 contributes to the circadian oscillation of ERK1/2. In addition to the circadian expression in the SCN, a wide distribution of SCOP in the rat brain (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggests that SCOP may play a general role in regulation of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway and contribute to a variety of physiological functions such as neural plasticity and neuronal survival. SCOP expression is not circadian-regulated in non-SCN areas of the rat brain (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and there must be an as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism for SCOP function. A possible regulatory step is the translocation of SCOP between the membrane rafts and cytosol, which could be modulated by the PH domain and/or affected by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. In preliminary experiments, we detected phosphorylated SCOP in the brain homogenate and 3T3 cell lysate. Future studies on each domain function of SCOP would help to understand a new aspect of regulatory processes of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway not only in the SCN but also in other brain areas. SCOP1 (suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian oscillatory protein) was originally identified in differential display screening of genes whose expression is regulated in a circadian manner within the rat hypothalamic SCN (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mRNA and protein levels of SCOP in the rat SCN increase during subjective night with a peak at midnight under constant dark conditions (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to circadian expression in the SCN, SCOP is expressed at a constant level in neurons throughout the rat brain (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but its function in neurons including the SCN is yet to be elucidated. SCOP is a large polypeptide (1,696 amino acids) containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C)-like domain and glutamine (Q)-rich region (see Fig. 2), suggesting its unique role in intracellular signaling. The LRRs are characterized by multiple repeats of a sequence harboring leucine residues at invariable positions (2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), and LRR-containing proteins are thought to contribute to diverse biological functions through the LRR-mediated protein-protein interactions (2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The LRR in SCOP is composed of 18-fold repeats of a short stretch unit with a relatively conserved but variable sequence, LXXLXLXXNXLXXLPXXAXXL, where L, N, P, A, and X denote leucine, asparagine, proline, aliphatic, and any amino acid, respectively (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). YeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae adenylate cyclase contains 26-fold repeats of a similar unit (3Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), to which Ras binds for Ras-dependent enzymatic activation (4Field J. Xu H.-P. Michaeli T. Ballester R. Sass P. Wigler M. Colicelli J. Science. 1990; 247: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki N. Choe H.-R. Nishida Y. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Ohnishi S. Tamaoki T. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8711-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The homologous LRR is also found in human and Caenorhabditis elegans SUR-8 (6Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which interacts directly with Ras to regulate its signaling (6Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,7Li W. Han M. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus predicted that SCOP may also interact with Ras to regulate Ras-mediated signaling pathway. As a molecular switch, Ras cycles between a GTP-bound active state and a GDP-bound inactive state via GTP hydrolysis and GDP/GTP exchange steps. Two major types of Ras-interacting molecules have been described that modulate the Ras GTP-GDP cycle through regulation of either the activation or inactivation step. The former is mediated by a class of proteins, guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), that interact with the GDP-bound form of Ras to reduce its affinity for GDP. This facilitates formation of the guanine nucleotide-free form of Ras, to which GTP binds for its activation. The latter is accelerated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and thereby promote the inactivation of Ras. Although the regulatory elements of Ras proteins may not be fully understood yet, these steps should provide a mechanism that manipulates the timing and strength of Ras signaling to ensure appropriate signaling output (8Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). In addition to these regulatory steps, the presence of Ras isoforms may contribute to a well ordered framework of Ras-mediated signaling. Despite a high degree of sequence similarity among Ras isoforms, accumulating evidence points to a preferential activation of specific effectors by each Ras isoform (9Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 10Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This issue seems to be associated with protein clustering in membrane microdomains such as rafts (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Membrane rafts are small platforms composed of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and a given set of proteins and are important for regulation of cellular signaling (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Selective localization of the Ras isoforms at different membrane microdomains reinforces the idea of distinct functionality and regulation of these proteins (13Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Appolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Knockout mouse for each of the Ras isoforms showed that K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, is essential for development (14Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 15Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Pellicer A. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and these results further support the idea that Ras isoforms play distinct roles. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is one of the best-characterized effector systems downstream of Ras (17Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Ras-MAPK-mediated signaling plays critical roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in response to extracellular signals. Recent studies have demonstrated an important contribution of Ras-MAPK cascade to the circadian clock system in the rodent SCN (19Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and the chick pineal gland (20Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hayashi Y. Sanada K. Fukada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we show that SCOP functions as a negative regulator of the Ras-MAPK pathway by interacting with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras in the membrane rafts to down-regulate the nucleotide binding for its activation. The results presented in this study illustrate a novel type of regulatory mechanism for Ras signaling and suggest a contribution of SCOP to a variety of cellular functions. DISCUSSIONLRRs have been found in a variety of proteins with diverse functions and cellular locations (2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). We first predicted the interaction of SCOP LRR (18 repeats) with Ras because of its similarity in sequence to the LRR of yeast adenylate cyclase (26 repeats) (3Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and of SUR-8 (18 repeats) (6Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), both of which are known to bind with Ras for functional regulation. The present study provides evidence for the direct interaction of Ras with SCOP LRR, but the LRR domain of SCOP was functionally different from those of yeast adenylate cyclase and SUR-8 in terms of Ras regulation. Yeast adenylate cyclase interacts with the GTP-bound form of Ras and is thereby activated (4Field J. Xu H.-P. Michaeli T. Ballester R. Sass P. Wigler M. Colicelli J. Science. 1990; 247: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction of SUR-8 with the GTP-bound form of Ras results in activation of MAPK pathway (7Li W. Han M. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SCOP associates with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras in the membrane rafts to down-regulate the Ras-MAPK pathway. This is a novel mechanism for negative regulation of Ras protein function through interaction with LRRs.Despite the high sequence similarity among Ras isoforms, SCOP selectively associates with K-Ras, a unique isoform that is abundant in the raft fraction of the rat brain homogenate (Fig. 1). It has been recognized that activation of different Ras isoforms results in distinct signaling outputs (9Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 14Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H.

Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), both of which are known to bind with Ras for functional regulation. The present study provides evidence for the direct interaction of Ras with SCOP LRR, but the LRR domain of SCOP was functionally different from those of yeast adenylate cyclase and SUR-8 in terms of Ras regulation. Yeast adenylate cyclase interacts with the GTP-bound form of Ras and is thereby activated (4Field J. Xu H.-P. Michaeli T. Ballester R. Sass P. Wigler M. Colicelli J. Science. 1990; 247: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction of SUR-8 with the GTP-bound form of Ras results in activation of MAPK pathway (7Li W. Han M. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SCOP associates with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras in the membrane rafts to down-regulate the Ras-MAPK pathway. This is a novel mechanism for negative regulation of Ras protein function through interaction with LRRs. Despite the high sequence similarity among Ras isoforms, SCOP selectively associates with K-Ras, a unique isoform that is abundant in the raft fraction of the rat brain homogenate (Fig. 1). It has been recognized that activation of different Ras isoforms results in distinct signaling outputs (9Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the membrane microdomains such as rafts and caveolae most likely contribute to the segregated signaling (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in some cell lines established from non-neural tissues H-Ras operates in membrane rafts, whereas K-Ras seems to be located outside rafts (13Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Appolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), in contrast with the selective enrichment of K-Ras in the rafts of the rat brain membranes (Fig. 1). This may be ascribed to cell type-specific compositions of rafts (for example, the existence of neuron-specific proteins such as SCOP), and hence neural membrane rafts might be unique because they lack caveolin (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Although SCOP and K-Ras were also present in the Triton X-100-soluble (non-raft) fraction, we observed no significant binding of SCOP LRR to K-Ras present in non-raft fractions. This observation supports the idea that SCOP and K-Ras may become associated only in the membrane rafts or alternatively that their interaction may induce the rafts formation. However, direct involvement of a third (raft-specific) component is inconsistent with the results of our pull-down experiments in which recombinant SCOP and K-Ras proteins were both expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3D). Instead, SCOP LRR seems to associate selectively with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras present in the membrane rafts but not with the GTPγS- nor GDP-bound forms that were produced by adding the guanine nucleotides after solubilization of the rafts. These data indicate that in the membrane rafts, just as in theE. coli lysate, at least a part of K-Ras is kept in the nucleotide-free form or in a form with an extremely low affinity for the guanine nucleotides. The postincubation experiment with GTPγS or GDP (Fig. 3B) strongly suggests that SCOP LRR “traps” the nucleotide-free state (or a low affinity state) of K-Ras that is generated by GDP release after receiving signals. This binding probably down-regulates the K-Ras function (Fig. 5) by inhibiting the GTP binding reaction (Fig. 4B). In this regard, the action of SCOP provides a striking contrast with that of CDC25p, which is also supposed to bind and stabilize the nucleotide-free state of Ras but promotes its activation (39Haney S.A. Broach J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16541-16548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, SCOP suppressed activation of ERK1 and -2 (Fig. 5), which are well characterized effectors downstream of Ras. In both cortical neurons and PC12 cells, calcium triggers ERK activation via activation of Ras (30Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 40Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although KCl and TPA treatment activate Ras through different pathways (30Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 31Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30599-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) the effects of SCOP overexpression on the stimulus-dependent change in ERK1/2 phosphorylation were similar to each other (Fig. 5). This suggests that SCOP acts on Ras itself or on a step downstream of Ras in the signaling pathway. The finding that SCOP binds directly to K-Ras (Fig. 2B) supports K-Ras as the target site of SCOP. In rodent SCN, SCOP-mediated regulation of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway may be important for the maintenance of circadian rhythm (19Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 20Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hayashi Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37078-37085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both the protein level of SCOP (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation (and activation) of ERK1/2 (19Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) display a circadian variation in rodent SCN. MAPK activity has its peak late in the subjective day when the protein level of SCOP is low, whereas MAPK activity is minimum at mid-late subjective night when SCOP expression is highest. Therefore, we hypothesize that SCOP inhibition of ERK1/2 contributes to the circadian oscillation of ERK1/2. In addition to the circadian expression in the SCN, a wide distribution of SCOP in the rat brain (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggests that SCOP may play a general role in regulation of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway and contribute to a variety of physiological functions such as neural plasticity and neuronal survival. SCOP expression is not circadian-regulated in non-SCN areas of the rat brain (1Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and there must be an as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism for SCOP function. A possible regulatory step is the translocation of SCOP between the membrane rafts and cytosol, which could be modulated by the PH domain and/or affected by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. In preliminary experiments, we detected phosphorylated SCOP in the brain homogenate and 3T3 cell lysate. Future studies on each domain function of SCOP would help to understand a new aspect of regulatory processes of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway not only in the SCN but also in other brain areas.

Recent studies have begun to delineate the mRNAs that mammalian FMRPs interact with in vivo. These studies have taken one of two forms. On the one hand, potential FMRP target mRNAs have been identified solely on the basis of their ability to bind to purified recombinant FMRP (15Li Z. Zhang Y. Ku L. Wilkinson K.D. Warren S.T. Feng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Laggerbauer B. Ostareck D. Keidel E.-M. Ostareck-Lederer A. Fischer U. Hum. Mol.

Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, it has not been determined whether any of these mRNAs bind to FMRP in vivo. On the other hand, mRNAs, including FMR1 mRNA, which associate with FMRP-containing mRNPs have also been isolated from cultured cells (10Ceman S. Brown V. Warren S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7925-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,18Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W. Tenenbaum S. Jin X. Feng X. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J. Darnell R.B. Warren S.T. Cell. 2001; 107: 477-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). However, although these messages require FMRP in the mRNP for their association, it has not been demonstrated that they bind solely to it. Using the former methodology, we isolated a subset of mRNAs derived from normal adult brain that bind human FMRP (hFMRP) in vitro (3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). During the course of this investigation we also tested a number of other mRNAs for their ability to interact with hFMRP. One of these mRNAs was Xenopus elongation factor 1A (xEF-1A). In the present paper we demonstrate that xEF-1A mRNA binds to recombinant and cell-free produced hFMRP in vitro. Furthermore, we show that hFMRP inhibits EF-1A mRNA translation in cultured PC12 and COS-7 cells and that the loss of hFMRP in fragile X lymphoblastoid cells derepresses human EF-1A (hEF-1A) mRNA translation.

Full-length and truncated 35S-hFMRPs were prepared by coupled in vitro transcription translation (3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 2002; 292: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformed E. coli BL21 were grown at 37 °C to 1.0A 560 in LB-Amp100 medium. 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the cells were grown at 30 °C overnight. Proteins were extracted from cell pellets using B-Per™ supplemented with 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 × Complete™ protease inhibitors and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, preequilibrated with buffer 3. Bound protein was eluted with buffer 3 plus 230 mmimidazole. hFMRP production (68–70 kDa) was confirmed by Western blotting, and its purity was determined by Coomassie Blue staining. The micro-BCA assay was used to determine protein concentration (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar). RNAs were produced from linearized plasmids by in vitro transcription. The transcripts were purified on QuickSpin™ columns and quantified by UV-visible spectrophotometry at 260 and 280 nm (3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant hFMRP was bound to RNA at room temperature. Briefly, the recombinant protein was preincubated for 10 min in buffer 1 supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml tRNA and 0.25 mg/ml ultrapure bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, RNA was added and incubated for an additional 20 min. hFMRP·RNA complexes were then resolved on 1% TAE agarose gels (50–60 V, 50 mA for 1–2 h) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Kd values were determined from titrations of recombinant proteins with fixed amounts of in vitro transcribed target RNAs. The percent complex formation was measured from scanned images of the AGESAs using IPLab Gel software (Signal Analytics Corp.) and plotted versus the amount of recombinant protein input into the reaction. A molecular mass of 69,000 Da was used to calculate the molar amount of hFMRP (12Ashley Jr., C.T. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T. Science. 1993; 262: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The data were fit using a nonlinear curve-fitting program Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software) (21Setzer D. Hynes S. RNA-Protein Interaction Protocols. 118. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 115-128Google Scholar). To verify specific complex formation, bands from different regions of a gel shift experiment were excised and boiled for 5 min in SDS buffer (22Tanaka, K. J., and Nishikata, T. (1998) in Technical Tips Online, BioMedNet (bmn.com).Google Scholar). The resulting extracts were blotted and probed with FMRP mAb 2160. 35S-Labeled hFMRP, hFMRPΔRGG, hFMRPΔKH2, and hFMRPΔRNB binding to biotinylated xEF-1A RNA was measured by affinity capture using SoftLink™ resin in buffer 2 (3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding, determined by comparison with reactions without in vitro transcribed RNA or nonbiotinylated xEF-1A RNA, was negligible. RNA binding was quantified using IPLab Gel software. The percent binding was calculated as shown in Equation 1. %binding=boundintensity/(boundintensity +(4×unboundintensity))×100Equation 1 This corrects for load differences between the bound and unbound fractions. For the studies presented in Fig. 2, B andC, in which both full-length and incomplete proteins were produced, only the full-length protein was quantified. The -fold decrease in biotinylated xEF-1A RNA binding between full-length wild-type and full-length truncated hFMRPs was calculated as shown in Equation 2. fold decrease=%bindingfull­length hFMRP/%bindingtruncated hFMRPEquation 2 xEF-1 RNA competition with homoribopolymer resins (poly(rG), and poly(rU)) was carried out with a 10-fold molar excess of xEF-1A RNA over poly(rN), a 2-fold molar excess of soluble poly(rG), or a 2-fold molar excess of soluble poly(rU). Briefly, 35S-hFMRP was incubated in buffer 2 containing 3 μg of poly(rN) resin and either xEF-1A RNA or soluble poly(rN) (1 h, 4 °C). Unbound35S-hFMRP was removed; the resins were then washed with 40 column volumes of buffer 2. Bound 35S-hFMRP was eluted by boiling in SDS buffer. Biotinylated xEF-1A RNA competition with nonbiotinylated target mRNAs was carried out using the SoftLink™ affinity capture protocol described above. A 5-fold molar excess of nonbiotinylated target mRNA over biotinylated xEF-1A mRNA was added to the reaction before adding 35S-hFMRP. Competition was expressed as the ratio of the percentage of biotinylated xEF-1A mRNA bound to hFMRP in the presence of competitor mRNA to the percentage of biotinylated xEF-1A mRNA bound to hFMRP in the absence of competitor mRNA. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells (3 × 105/35-mm dish) were transfected with 1 μg of pSF2-hFMRP or with 1 μg of control DNAs (pET21A-hFMRP, pHA-hFXR1P). 24, 48, 72, or 96 h later the cells were harvested and used to prepare total RNA or total proteins (3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Dolzhanskaya N. Conti J. Schwenk V. Merz G. Denman R.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency for each experiment varied between 20 and 60%, but within a particular experiment the efficiency was uniform. Fragile X and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Northern blotting was carried out as described previously (23Dolzhanskaya N. Conti J. Schwenk V. Merz G. Denman R.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared by amplifying the first 871 bases of human FMR1 cDNA from pSF2-hFMRP DNA and the entire xEF-1A coding sequence from pTRI-XEF DNA (86.7% identity to rat EF-1A mRNA). cDNAs were random prime labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and desalted on G-50 QuickSpin™ columns before hybridization. Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Denman R. Potempska A. Wolfe G. Ramakrishna N. Miller D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). FMRP mAb 2160 was used at a 1:10,000 dilution; under these conditions the antibody preferentially detects hFMRP, therefore it is not possible to ascertain whether transient transfection results in FMRP overexpression. HSP-820, EF-1A, and dynamin mAbs were used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3% non-fat dry milk and probed overnight in fresh buffer with the corresponding primary antibody at 4 °C. Blots were developed using LumiGlo. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. FXR1 (Y-19) antibody and FXR2 (S-16) antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution. Blots were blocked and probed as above and then developed using the manufacturer's washing procedure (www.scbt.com; Research Applications). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated bovine anti-goat secondary antibody was used at a 1:2,000 dilution. Blots were probed simultaneously with two different antibodies, an internal control antibody such as dynamin or HSP-820 and an antibody directed to the protein of interest. Blots were quantified from scanned images; the ratio of protein to Hsp70cP was used to normalize all data. PC12 cells were transfected with pSF2-hFMRP or pET21A-hFMRP. 48 h post-transfection the cells were scraped in 1.0 ml of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was washed twice with ice-cold diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Pellets were lysed with 100 μl of buffer 1 supplemented with 1% IGEPAL CA630. The lysates (50 μl) were precleared for 3.5 h with 30 μl of protein A/G that was pretreated with 30 μl of normal mouse serum, 10 μl of RNAsin, 20 μl of 50 × Complete protease inhibitors, and 500 μl of buffer 1. The precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with 30 μl of FMRP mAb 2160-coupled protein A/G beads. After a 10-min 3,000 × g spin, proteins or RNA was extracted from the supernatants and pellets. Supernatant proteins were prepared by adding 3 × SDS sample buffer to the supernatant (250:750 μl ratio). Immunoprecipitated proteins were prepared by adding 300 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer to each pellet. Total RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitant using 1 ml of TRI-Reagent™. The final RNA pellet was dissolved in 25 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O and used to prepared first strand cDNA. cDNAs were amplified using rat-specific EF-1A-specific primers (5′-ATATTATCCCTAACACCTGCC, 5′-GGTCTCAAAATTCTGTGACAG) that amplify a 259-bp fragment from bases 1464 to 1723 of rat EF-1A mRNA, accession no. X61043. FMR1-specific primers (set A: 5′-GGCTAGAAGCTTTCTGGA, 5′-GTGAATGGAGTACCCTAA) were used to amplify a 1,023-bp fragment from bases 945 to 1968 of mouse fmr1 mRNA, accession no. L23971; whereas set B (5′-GGCTAGAAGCTTTCTGGA, 5′-ACGTGGAGGAGGCTTCAAAGGAAA) amplifies a hFMR1-specific 833-bp fragment from bases 831 to 1,644 of human FMR1 mRNA, accession no. NM_002024. Polyribosomes were prepared by pelleting PC12 lysates through 50% sucrose pads (25Denman R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells (5 × 107) were transfected with pSF2-hFMRP or pET21A-hFMRP. 24 h later the cells were scraped from the dishes in ice-cold TMK buffer and pelleted. The pellets were lysed in 200 μl of TMK buffer supplemented with 1% IGEPAL CA630. 50-μl aliquots were loaded on 50% sucrose pads containing 500 μl of TMK buffer and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 20 h. The resulting polyribosome pellets were washed with 200 μl of TMK buffer and then extracted with 50 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer. In some cases, the lysates were treated for 5 min at 37 °C with 25 mm EDTA to disrupt the polyribosomes (8Corbin F. Bouillon M. Fortin A. Morin S. Rousseau F. Khandjian E.W. Hum. Mol.

Denman R. Recent Res. Dev. Biophys. Biochem. 2001; 1: 109-123Google Scholar, 3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Candidates containing such sequences were then folded into secondary structure models using Mfold (//bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/) or RNABOB to determine whether a requisite hairpin stem-loop S6NWGGN1–4 WGGN1–4 WGGN1–4WGGN0–6NS6 formed (6Darnell J.C. Jensen K. Jin P. Brown V. Warren S. Darnell R.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Several studies using FMR1 mRNA have been undertaken to define the RNA motif that FMRP recognizes (3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,7Schaeffer C. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Moine H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The results suggest that FMRP may bind to multiple regions of a mRNA (19Denman R. Sung Y.-J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); thus, in assessing FMRP target mRNA binding, an assay that measures interactions of large mRNAs with FMRP is necessary. To do this, we modified a nondenaturing AGESA (30Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) so that unlabeled in vitro transcribed mRNAs and mRNA·protein complexes could be visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Fig. 1 A illustrates results obtained by incubating the 1.9-kb 3′-untranslated region of human FMR1 mRNA (FMR1 3′-UTR) or a 1.4-kb lambda RNA fragment (λ-control RNA) in the presence or absence of purified recombinant human FMRP (hFMRP). As shown in lane 1, FMR1 3′-UTR mRNA migrated as two bands in the absence of hFMRP, indicating that the RNA resides in two conformational states (31Denman R.B. Smedman M. Kung L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These two conformers coalesced into a uniquely migrating single band in the presence of hFMRP (lane 2). Although the shift was small, the bands were completely resolved. In contrast, the shift did not occur when the recombinant protein was added to λ-control RNA (lanes 3and 4). This was expected because FMR1 3′-UTR mRNA binds specifically to FMRP (1Sung Y.-J. Denman R. Recent Res. Dev. Biophys. Biochem. 2001; 1: 109-123Google Scholar, 3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas the λ-control RNA does not (1Sung Y.-J. Denman R. Recent Res. Dev. Biophys. Biochem. 2001; 1: 109-123Google Scholar, 3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although these data are consistent with the formation of an hFMRP·FMR1 3′-UTR complex, several control experiments were performed to confirm this observation. To our surprise, another RNA, EF-1A fromXenopus (xEF-1A mRNA, 1.6 kb), displayed the same feature as FMR1 3′-UTR mRNA in AGESA. As shown in Fig.1 B, the two xEF-1A mRNA conformers (lane 1) coalesced into a uniquely migrating single band in the presence of hFMRP (lane 3). This result was recapitulated when we used hFMRP-I304N, containing the KH2 RNA binding domain mutation I304N (lane 4). This mutant was of particular interest because it is associated with exceptionally severe mental retardation (32De Boulle K. Verkerk A.J. Reyniers E. Vits L. Hendrickx J. Van Roy B. Van den Bos F. de Graaff E. Oostra B.A. Willems P.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Because NaCl concentrations above 0.25 m decrease the FMRP affinity for RNA we also examined the effect 0.5 mNaCl had on xEF-1A mRNA binding to hFMRP and hFMRP-I304N. Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6, shows that the band shift seen in lanes 3 and 4 was completely abrogated; lesser decreases were observed at lower salt concentrations (lanes 11–15). The RNA mobility shift was also lost when the recombinant proteins were heat denatured at 65 °C for 5 min before adding xEF-1A mRNA (lanes 7 and 8). These data indicate that more than the mere presence of the recombinant hFMRPs is required for the shift. In addition, the fact that 2.5 μg of recombinant bovine serum albumin failed to produce a shift (comparelanes 1 and 2) indicates that the response was not due simply to added native protein. Finally, lanes 9 and10 demonstrate that neither recombinant protein preparation contained large molecular mass nucleic acid, indicating that the shifted bands contained xEF-1A mRNA. We then used AGESA to define further the binding properties of hFMRP and xEF-1A mRNA. Fig. 1 C shows that xEF-1A mRNA binding was saturable with increasing concentrations of hFMRP or hFMRP-I304N. The apparent Kd values for these complexes were 3.0 and 6.1 nm, respectively. These data corroborate the data in Fig. 1 B, suggesting that hFMRP and hFMRP-I304N binding to xEF-1A mRNA is specific. To demonstrate further that the shifted band was an xEF-1A mRNA·hFMRP complex, hFMRP was specifically and uniquely recovered from the putative complex. Here, xEF-1A mRNA was incubated alone or with subsaturating amounts of purified recombinant hFMRP and subsequently resolved by AGESA. Fig. 1 D shows that adding hFMRP resulted in either the loss or decrease in the upper xEF-1A conformers and a concurrent broadening of the lower conformer (comparelanes 1 and 2). Five regions of this gel were then excised and probed for the presence of hFMRP. The right panel of Fig. 1 D shows that only the xEF-1A mRNA-shifted band contained hFMRP (lane 2). Thus, these data demonstrate that recombinant hFMRP and xEF-1A mRNA associatein vitro. FMRP has three RNA binding domains, and there is no a priori basis for knowing whether one or any combination of them interacts with a particular RNA. We have previously used 35S-FMRP truncation mutants in affinity capture assays to show that hFMR1 mRNA binding requires determinants in its KH2 domain (1Sung Y.-J. Denman R. Recent Res. Dev. Biophys. Biochem. 2001; 1: 109-123Google Scholar, 3Sung Y.-J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we employed this strategy to determine the domains required for binding xEF-1A mRNA. Four different hFMRP forms were assessed: 1) full-length hFMRP, 2) hFMRPΔRGG in which the last 334 amino acids including the arginine-glycine-rich region are deleted, 3) hFMRPΔKH2 in which the arginine-glycine-rich region and the KH2 domain are deleted, and 4) hFMRPΔRNBin which all three RNA binding domains are deleted (Fig.2 A). Fig. 2 B shows that xEF-1A mRNA bound 35S-hFMRP, recapitulating the results of Fig. 1. 35S-hFMRPΔRGG also bound to xEF-1A mRNA, albeit with a 6.5-fold decrease in affinity compared with full-length hFMRP. Removing the KH2 domain (35S-hFMRPΔKH2) reduced the binding further, whereas 35S-hFMRPΔRNB binding was not detectable under the conditions of the assay. Therefore, the C-terminal 334 amino acids of hFMRP play a major role (either"

A transgenic model is established carrying a floxed gene-switch construct that directs GFP marker gene expression in the absence of DNA recombination between two loxP sites. A tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase was introduced in the transgenic heart by breeding with previously established Mer-Cre-Mer transgenic mice. Upon tamoxifen administration in double transgenic adult animals, cre-loxP-mediated DNA recombination efficiently switches ""off"" the loxP-flanked GFP expression unit in cardiomyocytes and switches ""on"" the expression of the target gene, MKK7D, a constitutively activated upstream activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Expression of MKK7D in adult hearts resulted in significant activation of JNK activities and causes progressive cardiomyopathy in transgenic animals. This unique animal model of cardiac-specific and temporally regulated JNK activation will provide a powerful tool to investigate the functional role of the JNK pathway in the development of heart failure. Our data also demonstrated that the inducible gene-switch approach reported here may also be applicable in other studies to achieve efficient, tissue-specific, and temporally regulated genetic manipulation in intact animals."
https://openalex.org/W2114549483,"Mitochondrial complex I dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Identification of factors involved in maintenance and restoration of complex I function could potentially help to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for treatment of this class of disorders. Down-regulation of glutaredoxin (thioltransferase, a thiol disulfide oxido-reductase) using antisense oligonucleotides results in the loss of mitochondrial complex I activity in mouse brain. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6,tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP), the neurotoxin that causes Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in primates and dopaminergic cell loss in mice, acts through the inhibition of complex I. Regeneration of complex I activity in the striatum occurs concurrently with increase in glutaredoxin activity, 4 h after the neurotoxic insult, and is mediated through activation of activating protein-1. Down-regulation of glutaredoxin using anti-sense oligonucleotides prevents recovery of complex I in the striatum after MPTP treatment, providing support for the critical role for glutaredoxin in recovery of mitochondrial function in brain. Maintenance and restoration of protein thiol homeostasis by glutaredoxin may be important factors in preventing complex I dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2131129074,"We have isolated Spike, a novel and evolutionary conserved BH3-only protein. BH3-only proteins constitute a family of apoptosis inducers that mediate proapoptotic signals. In contrast to most proteins of this family, Spike was not found to be associated with mitochondria. Furthermore, unlike the known BH3-only proteins, Spike could not interact with all tested Bcl-2 family members, despite its BH3 domain being necessary for cell killing. Our findings indicate that Spike is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that has only recently been implicated in regulation of apoptosis. At this locale, Spike interacts with Bap31, an adaptor protein for pro-caspase-8 and Bcl-XL. In doing so, Spike is able to inhibit the formation of a complex between Bap31 and the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL protein. Furthermore, Spike transmits the signal of specific death receptors. Its down-regulation in certain tumors suggests that Spike may also play a role in tumorigenesis. Our findings add new insight for how BH3-only and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2044415003,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into CD4+ cells requires the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 as co-fusion receptors. We have previously demonstrated that chemokine receptors are capable of cross-regulating the functions of each other and, thus, affecting cellular responsiveness at the site of infection. To investigate the effects of chemokine receptor cross-regulation in HIV-1 infection, monocytes and MAGIC5 and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell lines co-expressing the interleukin-8 (IL-8 or CXCL8) receptor CXCR1 and either CCR5 (ACCR5) or CXCR4 (ACXCR4) were generated. IL-8 activation of CXCR1, but not the IL-8 receptor CXCR2, cross-phosphorylated CCR5 and CXCR4 and cross-desensitized their responsiveness to RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) (CCL5) and stromal derived factor (SDF-1 or CXCL12), respectively. CXCR1 activation internalized CCR5 but not CXCR4 despite cross-phosphorylation of both. IL-8 pretreatment also inhibited CCR5- but not CXCR4-mediated virus entry into MAGIC5 cells. A tail-deleted mutant of CXCR1, ΔCXCR1, produced greater signals upon activation (Ca2+ mobilization and phosphoinositide hydrolysis) and cross-internalized CXCR4, inhibiting HIV-1 entry. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine prevented phosphorylation and internalization of the receptors by CXCR1 activation. Taken together, these results indicate that chemokine receptor-mediated HIV-1 cell infection is blocked by receptor internalization but not desensitization alone. Thus, activation of chemokine receptors unrelated to CCR5 and CXCR4 may play a cross-regulatory role in the infection and propagation of HIV-1. Since ΔCXCR1, but not CXCR1, cross-internalized and cross-inhibited HIV-1 infection to CXCR4, the data indicate the importance of the signal strength of a receptor and, as a consequence, protein kinase C activation in the suppression of HIV-1 infection by cross-receptor-mediated internalization.

The formyl peptide chemoattractant receptor also cross-desensitized CCR5-mediated cellular responses to RANTES in monocytes and diminished the ability of RANTES to mediate HIV-1 entry and infection (15Deng X.

In the present study we sought to determine the role of cross-regulation by IL-8 receptors in CCR5- and CXCR4-mediated cellular activation and HIV-1 infection. For this purpose, monocytes and MAGIC5 and RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing different combination of receptors were used to study the mechanisms of cross-regulation among IL-8, CCR5, and CXCR4. The results demonstrate that IL-8 led to the cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of both CCR5 and CXCR4. However, IL-8 down-regulated and inhibited HIV-1 infection to CCR5 but not CXCR4. Since CCR5 is a target for the entry of primary viruses in monocytes these results suggest a selective role for IL-8 in limiting HIV-1 infection through this receptor.

The resulting PCR products were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, and the receptors were sequenced to confirm the intended mutations and lack of secondary mutations.

For calcium mobilization, RBL cells (5 × 106) or monocytes (107) were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and loaded with 1 μm Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer. Intracellular calcium increase in the presence or absence of ligands was measured as described previously (27Richardson R.M.

Then labeled cells were stimulated with the indicated ligands for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and solubilized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against the epitope tags, analyzed by SDS electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography.

HIV-1 virus stocks and HIV-1-based lentivirus vectors were prepared in 293T cells as described previously (30Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The culture medium was replaced 16 h later, and the culture supernatants were harvested 40 h after transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-size filters, and virus yield was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Virus stocks were stored at −80 °C until needed. MAGI (HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-Gal) and MAGIC5 (MAGI stably expressing CCR5) (31Mochizuki N. Otsuka N. Matsuo K. Shiino T. Kojima A. Kurata T. Sakai K.

Cells (5 × 105) were transduced overnight with 10 ng of p24 antigen of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vector virus encoding either CXCR1, ΔCXCR1, or a control vector, pNL-con. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium for an additional 24 h. CXCR1 and ΔCXCR1 expression was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Then the transduced cells were treated with 100 nm IL-8 for 30 min and incubated with 20 ng of p24 antigen of a luciferase reporter virus, NL-Luc-HXB or NL-Luc-ADA, for an additional 60 min. The cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer, and luciferase activities were determined with a MicroLumatPlus LB96V microplate luminometer. To study the cross-desensitization of CCR5 and CXCR4, intracellular Ca2+mobilization in monocytes was elicited by RANTES and SDF-1 and used as a measure of CCR5 and CXCR4 activation, respectively. As shown in Fig.1 A, IL-8, which activates both CXCR1 and CXCR2, cross-desensitized Ca2+ responses to RANTES and SDF-1. MGSA, which only activates CXCR2, had no effect on RANTES or SDF-1. RANTES and SDF-1 pretreatment attenuated responses to both MGSA and IL-8 (Fig. 1 A). RANTES, SDF-1, IL-8, and MGSA homologously desensitized (∼90%) responses to a second dose of the same ligand (Fig. 1 B). We determined whether IL-8 inhibited HIV-1 entry to CCR5 and CXCR4. MAGIC5 cells were infected with a lentiviral CXCR1 expression vector virus. Cells were pretreated with or without IL-8 (100 nm) and infected with NL-Luc-ADA (R5-tropic) or NL-Luc-HXB (X4-tropic), and luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig.2, IL-8 pretreatment inhibited by ∼50% CCR5-mediated R5-tropic virus infection but had no effect in X4-tropic infection to CXCR4. To study the mechanism of cross-regulation among CXCR1, CCR5, and CXCR4, single transfectant RBL cells expressing FLAG-tagged CCR5 (CCR5-RBL) or CXCR4 (CXCR4-RBL) were first generated and characterized. TheK d values for RANTES binding to the CCR5 (4.3 ± 0.5 nm) and for SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 (5.7 ± 1 nm) were similar to those previously reported (9Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S.

CCR5 induced a comparable peak of intracellular Ca2+mobilization in response to both RANTES (Fig.3 A) and MIP-1β (data not shown) but not IL-8, MGSA, or SDF-1 (Fig. 3 A). CXCR4 was also specific for SDF-1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization (Fig.3 B). Cells expressing CXCR1 were specific for IL-8 (data not shown). In cells co-expressing CXCR1 and CCR5 (ACCR5-RBL) IL-8 pretreatment cross-desensitized intracellular Ca2+ mobilization to both RANTES (58%) and MIP-1β (56%) (TableI). IL-8 also inhibited SDF-1 (35%)-mediated Ca2+ response in cells co-expressing CXCR1 and CXCR4 (ACXCR4-RBL). Inhibition of responses to CCR5 was greater than that of CXCR4 (56–58 versus 35%, respectively). IL-8-mediated Ca2+ mobilization was also attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with RANTES, MIP-1β, or SDF-1 (Table I). IL-8, RANTES, MIP-1β, and SDF-1 also homologously desensitized (∼90%) the response to a second dose of the same ligand (Table I). Pretreatment of ACCR5 (Fig.4 A) or ACXCR4 (Fig.4 B) cells with IL-8 (100 nm) also cross-desensitized RANTES (∼55%)- and SDF-1 (∼40%)-induced GTPase activity in membranes (Fig. 4). Both RANTES and SDF-1 cross-inhibited IL-8-mediated GTPase activity by ∼35 and ∼45%, respectively. PMA (100 nm) heterologously desensitized the GTPase response to IL-8 (∼35%), RANTES (∼60%), and SDF-1 (∼50%).Table ICross-desensitization among CCR5, CXCR4, and CXCR1 in transfected RBL cellsCells/treatmentPeak Ca2+ mobilizationPercent desensitizationnmACCR5-RBL RANTES → RANTES622 ± 27 → 43 ± 793 MIP-1β → MIP-1β571 ± 51 → 57 ± 1094 IL-8 → IL-8593 ± 34 → 76 ± 1387 RANTES → IL-8631 ± 43 → 301 ± 1148 IL-8 → RANTES576 ± 22 → 266 ± 1758 MIP-1β → IL-8601 ± 14 → 348 ± 2341 IL-8 → MIP-1β589 ± 39 → 265 ± 1956ACXCR4-RBL SDF-1 → SDF-1492 ± 18 → 44 ± 1891 IL-8 → IL-8477 ± 45 → 69 ± 986 SDF-1 → IL-8455 ± 29 → 246 ± 2052 IL-8 → SDF-1513 ± 22 → 297 ± 3435RBL cells stably co-expressing CXCR1 and CCR5 (ACCR5) or CXCR4 (ACXCR4) were Indo-1-loaded, and RANTES, MIP-1β, SDF-1, or IL-8 (10 nm)-mediated Ca2+ mobilization was measured. Cells were rechallenged 3 min later with a second dose (10 nm) of the indicated ligand, and peak intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was determined. Data are the means ± S.E. of three different experiments. Open table in a new tab RBL cells stably co-expressing CXCR1 and CCR5 (ACCR5) or CXCR4 (ACXCR4) were Indo-1-loaded, and RANTES, MIP-1β, SDF-1, or IL-8 (10 nm)-mediated Ca2+ mobilization was measured. Cells were rechallenged 3 min later with a second dose (10 nm) of the indicated ligand, and peak intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was determined. Data are the means ± S.E. of three different experiments. ACCR5 and ACXCR4 were treated with IL-8, RANTES, SDF-1, or PMA (100 nm), and receptor clearance from the cell surface was assessed by specific ligand binding. CXCR1 (Fig. 5,A and C), CCR5 (Fig. 5 B), and CXCR4 (Fig. 5 D) were homologously internalized by exposure of the cells to IL-8, RANTES, and SDF-1, respectively. IL-8 pretreatment cross-internalized CCR5 (Fig. 5 B) but not CXCR4 (Fig.5 D). PMA pretreatment caused internalization of both CCR5 and CXCR4 (Fig. 5, B and D). RANTES, SDF-1, and PMA had no effect in CXCR1 internalization (Fig. 5, A andC). To assess the role of receptor phosphorylation in cross-internalization ACCR5 and ACXCR4 cells were labeled with 32P and treated with IL-8 (100 nm), RANTES (100 nm), SDF-1 (100 nm), or PMA (100 nm). Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with the M2-FLAG (CCR5 and CXCR4)- or HA (CXCR1)-specific antibodies, and analyzed by SDS electrophoresis and autoradiography. The identities of the phosphorylated bands for the respective receptors (CXCR1, ∼70 kDa; CCR5, ∼40 kDa; and CXCR4, ∼45 kDa) have been previously demonstrated (9Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I.

As shown in Fig. 6, CCR5 (A, lane 2) and CXCR4 (B, lane 2) were homologously phosphorylated by RANTES and SDF-1, respectively. CCR5 (A,lane 4) and CXCR4 (B, lane 4) were also cross-phosphorylated by IL-8. CXCR1 was homologously phosphorylated by IL-8 (A and B, lanes 7) and cross-phosphorylated by both RANTES and SDF-1 (Aand B, lanes 6). PMA induced phosphorylation of CCR5 (A, lane 3), CXCR4 (B, lane 3), and CXCR1 (A and B, lanes 8). Pretreatment of ACCR5 with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) partially inhibited RANTES-mediated CCR5 internalization (Fig.7 A) and phosphorylation (Fig.7 B). Cross-internalization and cross-phosphorylation by IL-8 as well as heterologous internalization and phosphorylation by PMA were totally inhibited by staurosporine (Fig. 7, A andB). The role of IL-8 in CXCR4 cross-internalization was further assessed by co-expressing a carboxyl terminus-deficient mutant of CXCR1, ΔCXCR1, along with CXCR4 (ΔACXCR4). TheK d and B max of ΔCXCR1 (2.1 ± 1.10 nm and 6898 ± 523 receptors/cell, respectively) were similar to those of CXCR1 (1.7 ± 0.33 nm and 7013 ± 311 receptors/cell, respectively). ΔCXCR1 mediated greater phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig.8 A), G-protein activation, secretion of β-hexosaminidase, and sustained Ca2+response relative CXCR1.2 IL-8 pretreatment of ΔACXCR4 but not ACXCR1 cells resulted in cross-internalization of CXCR4 (Fig.8 B). In contrast to CXCR1, ΔCXCR1 activation also cross-inhibited CXCR4-mediated virus entry into MAGI cells (Fig.8 C). Chemokines and chemokine receptors are redundant in that many chemokines activate more than one chemokine receptor and many chemokine receptors are activated by multiple chemokines (8Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. Haribabu B. O'Brien T. Chemokine Receptors and AIDS. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2001: 31-50Google Scholar, 34Montovani A. Immunol.

Initial studies in our laboratory, however, provided evidence that chemokine receptors are capable of cross-regulating the functions of each other, thus limiting cellular responsiveness to chemokines. The IL-8 receptor CXCR1 was shown to cross-desensitize responses to the CC receptor CCR1 at two levels: receptor/G-protein uncoupling via receptor cross-phosphorylation and inhibition of phospholipase Cβ activity via phosphorylation of the enzyme, which diminishes its activation by G-protein (14Richardson R.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The data herein describe another level of cross-regulation among chemokines that may have important consequences in their action: chemokine-mediated receptor cross-internalization. Chemokine-mediated receptor cross-internalization appears to be selective and distinct from receptor desensitization. This contention is based on the following observations. First, IL-8 activation of CXCR1, but not CXCR2, cross-internalized CCR5 (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Second, while CXCR1 cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized Ca2+mobilization and GTPase activity to both CCR5 and CXCR4, receptor internalization occurred only with CCR5. HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells requires the presence of chemokine receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-fusion proteins. Several studies have indicated that signaling by these receptors is not required for virus fusion and infection (28Tokunaga K. Greenberg M.L. Morse M.A. Cumming R.I. Lyerly H.K. Cullen B.R. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6854-6857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Activation of CXCR1, however, diminished the ability of CCR5 to mediate virus entry (Fig. 2). This suggests that while chemokine-mediated activation of CCR5 and CXCR4 may not be required, activation of signaling through other chemokine receptors may, through cross-internalization, prevent the target receptors to serve as co-factors for HIV-1 infection. Despite receptor cross-desensitization, CXCR4-mediated virus entry was resistant to cross-inhibition by CXCR1. This may be due to its relative resistance to cross-internalization since the stronger signaling ΔCXCR1 or PMA, which induced cross-internalization as well as cross-desensitization of CXCR4, also inhibited HIV-1 infection through CXCR4. Activation of the formyl peptide receptor also cross-phosphorylated and cross-inhibited HIV-1 infection to CCR5 (16Shen W. Proost P. Li B. Gong W. Le Y. Sargeant R. Murphy P. Damme J.V. Wang J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but these chemoattractants are less commonly present at sites of inflammation than the chemokines. Chemokine production can be induced by many stimuli including cytokines, lipopolysaccharides, and viral products (39Wuyts A. Proost P. Van Damme J. Thompson A.W. 3rd Ed. The Cytokine Handbook. Academic Press, London1998: 271-311Google Scholar). Modulation of chemokine receptor internalization may therefore be a useful target for therapeutic intervention against HIV-1 infection. An interesting finding in these studies is the importance of signal strength in cross-desensitization, cross-internalization, and inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. Upon activation by IL-8, CXCR2 internalizes rapidly (∼90% after 2–5 min) and, as a consequence, does not mediate cross-regulatory signals (14Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9201-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

CXCR1, which is more resistant to internalization (∼50% after 20–40 min), mediated cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of both CXCR4 and CCR5 but cross-internalized and inhibited HIV-1 entry to CCR5 but not CXCR4 (Figs. 2, 4, and 5 and Table I) (14Richardson R.M.

ΔCXCR1, however, which is far more resistant to internalization (∼10% after 60 min) and mediated greater cellular responses (i.e.phosphoinositide hydrolysis, exocytosis, and Ca2+mobilization), cross-internalized CXCR4 and inhibited T4-tropic virus entry (Fig. 8).2 This indicates a hierarchy in receptor-mediated cross-regulation that is directly correlated with the receptor resistance to desensitization, internalization, and, as a consequence, signaling time. Supporting that contention is that in monocytes isolated from mice deficient in β-arrestin-2 in which CXCR2 internalization is delayed (∼25% after 5 min) MGSA cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization to RANTES by ∼50% relative to control or wild type mice (∼90% after 5 min). 3R. M. Richardson and R. Marjoram, manuscript in preparation. CXCR1-mediated cross-desensitization and cross-internalization of CCR5 and CXCR4 as well as desensitization and internalization by PMA were inhibited by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 7 and data not shown). These results indicate that PKC may play a key regulatory role in the modulation of HIV-1 infection. The resistance of CXCR4 to cross-internalization by CXCR1 may be explained in two ways. First, it could be that cross-regulation of CXCR4 is mediated via a PKC isoform different from that of CCR5, which requires greater second messenger production for its activation. Indeed ΔCXCR1, which mediated greater phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization, cross-internalized CXCR4. Second, previous studies in our laboratory have shown that PMA-induced CXCR4 internalization occurs via a mechanism distinct from receptor phosphorylation (9Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I.

It is likely that phosphorylation of (an)other component(s) distal from the receptor/G-protein coupling is necessary for the PKC-mediated internalization and may require a higher level of second messenger production. Orsini et al. (11Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have shown that a dileucine motif of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor that binds the adaptor protein-2 was necessary for the phosphorylation-independent internalization of the receptor. Whether or not adaptor protein-2 plays a role in the immunomodulation of HIV-1 infection by CXCR4 remains to be explored. Thus far our preliminary studies have shown that, upon activation, both CXCR4 and CCR5 bind adaptor protein-2 (data not shown). In summary, these data demonstrate that the IL-8 chemokine can inhibit HIV-1 infection via CCR5 through activation of CXCR1 but not CXCR2. Inhibition of HIV-1 infection is not blocked by receptor desensitization alone but requires receptor internalization. CXCR4 is susceptible to CXCR1-mediated cross-desensitization but is resistant to cross-internalization. ΔCXCR1 and PMA, which mediated greater cellular responses, cross-internalized and cross-inhibited CXCR4-mediated virus entry. This suggests that signaling through other chemokine receptors with stronger signal strengths may regulate the ability of CXCR4 as well as CCR5 to function as co-fusion proteins with CD4+. This observation presents new targets for therapeutic intervention against the infection and propagation of HIV-1."

https://openalex.org/W2008659442,"Mortality and sepsis after a traumatic injury is greater in the elderly than in young individuals. The altered lymphocyte response observed to occur in healthy aged individuals is proposed to be a contributing factor to increased mortality. The immune response associated with the increased mortality was explored using a murine scald injury model. In the absence of injury, aged mice had depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and splenocyte proliferative responses relative to young mice. There was also an increase with age in the production of the TH2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 by splenocytes. There was no change in the TH1 cytokines IFNgamma or IL-12 with age. However, IL-2 production was significantly lower. Following injury, there was a further decrease in the DTH response of aged injured mice, compared with aged sham mice. In addition, there was a decrease in all of the cytokines examined, regardless of age. In contrast, IFNgamma and IL-2 were significantly lower in the aged injured animals compared with the young injured animals. These results suggest that the lack of an adequate amount of TH1 cytokines shortly after injury in the aged mice may parallel the increased incidence of sepsis and death that occurs in aged burn patients."
https://openalex.org/W2031018219,"Fibrinogen-like protein 2/fibroleukin (Fgl2) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both experimental and human fulminant hepatic failure. We have reported recently that the nucleocapsid (N) protein from strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-3, MHV-A59), which cause massive hepatocellular necrosis but not from strains (MHV-JHM, MHV-2) which do not produce serious liver disease, induces transcription of fgl2. The purpose of the present study was to characterize both viral and host factor(s) necessary for viral induced transcription offgl2. Mutation of residues Gly-12, Pro-38, Asn-40, Gln-41, and Asn-42 within domain 1 of the N protein of MHV-A59 to their corresponding residues found in MHV-2 abrogated fgl2transcription, whereas mutation of other N protein domains, including a protein expressed from an internal reading frame (I protein), did not affect fgl2 gene transcription. We then examined the −372 to −306 sequence within the 1.3-kb fgl2 promoter region upstream from the transcription start site that was previously identified as necessary for N protein-induced gene transcription. We demonstrated that the −331/−325 HNF4 cis-element and its cognate transcription factor, HNF4α, are necessary for virus-inducedfgl2 gene transcription. In uninfected macrophages and macrophages infected with MHV-2, an unidentified protein occupies the HNF4 cis-element. Following stimulation with MHV-A59, it was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that HNF4α binds the HNF4 cis-element in the fgl2 promoter. We further report the unprecedented presence of HNF4α in peritoneal macrophages. Collectively, the results of this study define both viral and host factors necessary for induction of fgl2 prothrombinase gene transcription in MHV infection and may provide an explanation for the hepatotrophic nature of MHV-induced fulminant hepatic failure."
https://openalex.org/W2019993507,"To visualize the intracellular transport of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, a novel fluorescent cholesterol analog, 6-dansyl cholestanol (DChol), has been synthesized. We present several lines of evidence that DChol mimics cholesterol. The cholesterol probe could be efficiently incorporated into the plasma membrane via cyclodextrin-donor complexes. The itinerary of DChol from the plasma membrane to the cell was studied to determine its dependence on the function of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC) protein. In all cells, DChol moved from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum. Its further transport to the Golgi complex was observed but with marked differences among various cell lines. DChol was finally transported to small (approximately 0.5 microm diameter) lipid droplets, a process that required functional acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. In human NPC fibroblasts, NPC-like cells, or in cells mimicking the NPC phenotype, DChol was found in enlarged (>1 microm diameter) droplets. When the NPC-phenotype was corrected by transfection with NPC1, DChol was again found in small-sized droplets. Our data show that NPC1 has an essential role in the distribution of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol by maintaining the small size of cholesterol-containing lipid droplets in the cell."

For example, thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to induce stress fiber formation via Gα12 and Gα13, respectively.

In contrast, a variety of GPCRs appear to selectively couple to Gα12 or Gα13 (13Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol.

However, this receptor-G protein coupling is not directly evaluated. Recently, we demonstrated that Gα12 and Gα13 interact with Ser/Thr phosphatase type 5 (PP5) through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and stimulate its phosphatase activity (14Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1353-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we developed a novel assay to evaluate the activities of Gα12 and Gα13 by using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused TPR domain of PP5 (GST-TPR), taking advantage of the property that GST-TPR strongly interacts with active forms of Gα12 and Gα13. By using this assay, we showed selective activations of Gα12 by thrombin and Gα13 by LPA, and found that N-terminal short sequences of Gα12and Gα13 determine these selective activations. Agents obtained and commercial sources were as follows: thrombin and LPA, Sigma; rabbit polyclonal anti-Gα12 and anti-Gα13 antibodies and mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody, DAKO; and Chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting system, Amersham Biosciences. GST-fused proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (8Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J.

The TPR domain used for GST-TPR is a splicing variant of rat PP5 that contains residues 9–122 following a new short coding region (12 amino acids; SRALGMGQLPAP) (14Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1353-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of this TPR variant is available from GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ under accession number AB101661. cDNAs of wild-type Gα12 and Gα13 (Gα12WT and Gα13WT), and their constitutively active mutants of Gα12 (Gα12Q229L, Gα12QL) and Gα13 (Gα13Q226L, Gα13QL) were obtained as described previously (4Katoh H.

To generate chimeric cDNA of Gα13 substituted with the N-terminal short sequence of Gα12 (Gα12N/13C), cDNAs encoding the N-terminal part of Gα12 (amino acids 1–37) and the C-terminal part of Gα13 (amino acids 31–377) were combined by using a BglII site generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and then it was subcloned intoBamHI/NotI sites of pcDNA3 vector. Chimeric cDNA of Gα12 substituted with the N-terminal short sequence of Gα13 (Gα13N/12C) was generated by combining cDNAs encoding the N-terminal part of Gα13 (amino acids 1–30) and the C-terminal part of Gα12 (amino acids 38–379), using a XbaI site generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and it was subcloned intoHindIII/NotI sites of pcDNA3 vector. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 1 × 106 cells were seeded in a 60-mm dish and transfected with 2 μg of cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, medium was replaced to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 12–15 h. To examine the activities of α subunits, cells transfected with Gα12WT, Gα12QL, Gα13WT, Gα13QL, Gα12N/13C, or Gα13N/12C were stimulated with either thrombin (1.5 units/ml) or LPA (1 μm) for the indicated times, rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 500 μl of the ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 3 μg of GST-TPR. In the case of AlF4− treatment, cells treated with AlF4− (50 μmAlCl3, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm NaF) for 3 h were lysed with cell lysis buffer containing AlF4−. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Gα12 and anti-Gα13 antibodies (1:200 dilution, both). To examine the endogenous RhoA activity, cells transfected with Gα12WT, Gα13WT, Gα12N/13C, or Gα13N/12C were stimulated with either thrombin (1.5 units/ml) or LPA (1 μm) for 1 min, and cell lysates were incubated with GST-fused Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin as described previously (8Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-RhoA antibody (1:100 dilution). The primary antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection kit. Densitometric analyses were performed by using NIH Image software, and the amounts of active forms of α subunits and RhoA were normalized to the total amounts of α subunits and RhoA in cell lysates, respectively. We reported previously that active forms of Gα12 and Gα13, but not Gαq and Gαi2, interact with PP5 through its TPR domain (14Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1353-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To develop a method to measure the activities of Gα12 and Gα13, we examined the ability of GST-TPR to pull-down active forms of Gα12 and Gα13. As shown in Fig.1, GST-TPR strongly precipitated Gα12WT and Gα13WT in the presence of AlF4−, an activator of the Gα subunits (15Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and their constitutively active forms, Gα12QL and Gα13QL, but precipitation of Gα12WT and Gα13WT in the absence of AlF4− was almost negligible. These results demonstrate that active forms of Gα12 and Gα13 can be detected by the GST-TPR pull-down assay. Thrombin and LPA have been shown to induce stress fiber formation via Gα12 and Gα13, respectively, by using dominant negative mutants of Gα12 and Gα13(13Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G.

Therefore, we measured the thrombin and LPA-induced Gα12 and Gα13 activations by using this GST-TPR pull-down assay. Because the expression levels of endogenous Gα12 and Gα13 were extremely low in a variety of cell lines including 293T, COS-7, and Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig.1 and data not shown), it was unable to detect the endogenous activities of Gα12 and Gα13 by using GST-TPR pull-down assay. Then we transfected 293T cells with Gα12WT or Gα13WT and treated the cells with either thrombin or LPA. Thrombin rapidly activated Gα12WT, the activation level reaching a maximum at 1 min and gradually decreasing to the basal level within 10 min. However, LPA had no effect on Gα12WT activity (Fig.2A). On the other hand, LPA rapidly activated Gα13WT, whereas thrombin had no effect on Gα13WT activity (Fig. 2B). Thus, thrombin and LPA receptors selectively couple to and activate Gα12and Gα13, respectively. Gα12 and Gα13 show a high amino acid sequence homology (67%) except for their N-terminal short sequences in which the amino acid identity is only 16% (2Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This limited homology prompted us to speculate that the N-terminal short sequences determine the specificities of Gα12 and Gα13 for thrombin and LPA, respectively, and then we generated chimeric α subunits Gα12N/13C and Gα13N/12C, in which the N-terminal sequence is replaced each other (Fig.3A). Because anti-Gα12 and anti-Gα13 antibodies used here are raised against their N-terminal amino acids, Gα12N/13C and Gα13N/12C can be recognized with respective antibodies. 293T cells expressing Gα12N/13C or Gα13N/12C were treated with either thrombin or LPA, and activities of chimeric proteins were measured by GST-TPR pull-down assay. Similar to Gα12, Gα12N/13C was strongly activated by thrombin but not by LPA (Fig. 3, B and D), though it is mostly composed of Gα13. On the other hand, Gα13N/12C, which is mostly composed of Gα12, was strongly activated by LPA but not by thrombin (Fig. 3, C and E). These results indicate that N-terminal short sequences of Gα12 and Gα13determine their specificities for thrombin and LPA, respectively. Activation of Gα12 or Gα13 increases RhoA activity (8Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To next evaluate whether selective couplings of thrombin and LPA receptors to Gα12 and Gα13are functional, we examined the effects of thrombin and LPA on RhoA activity in the cells expressing Gα12, Gα13, or chimeric α subunits. Thrombin and LPA activated RhoA strongly via Gα12WT and Gα13WT, respectively (Fig.4A), the specificities corresponding with the results shown in Fig. 2. With respect to chimeric α subunits, thrombin and LPA activated RhoA strongly via Gα12N/13C and Gα13N/12C, respectively (Fig.4, B and C). Thus, thrombin and LPA receptors functionally couple to Gα12 and Gα13, respectively, and these functional couplings are determined by the N-terminal short sequences of Gα12 and Gα13. Gohla et al. (3Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) showed that LPA stimulated [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide-labeling of both Gα12 and Gα13 in the isolated membranes, and Ponimaskin et al.

Offermanns S. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that thrombin also stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS to both Gα12 and Gα13 in the membranes, indicating that thrombin and LPA receptors have the ability to stimulate both Gα12 and Gα13in vitro. However, thrombin- and LPA-induced stress fiber formations via RhoA are mediated specifically by Gα12 and Gα13, respectively (3Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting that both receptors selectively use G proteins in intact cells. In this study, we developed a novel assay to evaluate the activities of Gα12 and Gα13. By using this assay, we directly demonstrated that thrombin and LPA selectively activate Gα12 and Gα13, respectively, in intact cells. These results taken together indicate that thrombin and LPA receptors can potently couple to both Gα12 and Gα13in vitro, but they show selective usage of G proteins in vivo. We further demonstrated that N-terminal short sequences of Gα12 and Gα13 determine the selective couplings of thrombin and LPA receptors to Gα12 and Gα13, respectively. C-terminal domains of α subunits are well known to play an important part in specifying receptor interactions of G proteins (1Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). However, Gα12 and Gα13 share very high amino acid sequence identity in the C-terminal region (2Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that C-terminal domains of Gα12 and Gα13 do not contribute to the coupling selectivity of thrombin and LPA receptors. Recently, Waheed et al. (19Waheed A.A. Jones T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32409-32412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that Gα12resides in lipid raft fraction, whereas Gα13 is not associated with lipid rafts in COS-7 cells and NIH 3T3 cells, and that the N-terminal sequence of Gα12 including a palmitoylation site is important for the lipid raft localization of Gα12. Moreover, they showed that the targeting of Gα12 to lipid raft is mediated by Hsp90, a chaperone that specifically associates with Gα12 but not Gα13 (20Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although intracellular localizations of thrombin and LPA receptors are not yet known, selective targeting of G proteins and receptors to either lipid raft fraction or other fraction may determine the selective coupling. Gα12 and Gα13 mostly display mutual downstream signal transductions, such as RhoA activation and serum response factor activation (2Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, a variety of downstream effectors or interacting proteins of the Gα12 family have been identified, including Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors, cadherin, and PP5, and they interact with both Gα12 and Gα13 (10Kozasa T.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1353-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that downstream signal transduction pathways of Gα12 and Gα13 are highly overlapped. On the other hand, stress fiber formations induced by a variety of GPCRs are selectively mediated by either Gα12 or Gα13 (13Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting that receptor-G protein coupling is selective. Gα12 and Gα13 are highly expressed in brain, and it has been shown that Gα12 is mainly expressed in somata of the neurons, but Gα13 is predominantly localized in the neuropil of central neurons, indicating that Gα12 and Gα13 exert their effects at the different area in the cell (21Kuner R. Swiercz J.M. Zywietz A. Tappe A. Offermanns S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the light of this knowledge, different localizations of receptors and G proteins in the cells may be important for their selective coupling. In conclusion, we have developed a novel assay to evaluate the activities of Gα12 and Gα13, and we directly demonstrated selective couplings of thrombin and LPA receptors to Gα12 and Gα13, respectively, dependent on the N-terminal short sequences of G proteins. This study will contribute not only to the understanding of the activation mechanism of the Gα12 family, but will also help to elucidate the signaling mechanism of heterotrimeric G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2104802563,"Dendritic cells (DC) are initiators of T cell-mediated immunity. However, less is known about the relationship between DC and natural killer (NK) cells, and direct evidence of their interaction in vivo is scarce. Interleukin (IL)-12 is an activator of both DC and NK cells. We postulated that secretion of IL-12 by DC would enable them to activate NK cells. Bone marrow-derived DC propagated only in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not activate NK cells. In contrast, DC engineered to express IL-12 markedly stimulated NK cells as determined by coculture experiments in vitro, assays of NK cells isolated from treated animals, and survival experiments in a systemic tumor model. Activation depended on both DC-NK cellular interaction and secretion of IL-12. Adoptive transfer of DC expressing IL-12 to mice markedly increased NK cell interferon-gamma production and lytic activity in vivo. Treated mice were also protected against B16 melanoma hepatic metastases. The in vivo effects on NK cells were DC-specific. Administration of IL-12 protein alone or melanoma cells or fibroblasts engineered to secrete IL-12 were only weakly activating. Our findings demonstrate that IL-12 expression by DC enables them to activate NK cells and provide evidence for a substantial DC-NK relationship in vivo."

Following cisplatin treatment, induction of p73 and its downstream effector p21Cip1 was essentially blocked in SHP-2 mutant cells.

Additionally, we found that in embryonic fibroblast cells 30–40% of SHP-2 was localized in the nuclei, and that a fraction of nuclear SHP-2 was constitutively associated with c-Abl via its SH3 domain.

More importantly, it has been demonstrated that mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) kinase, the product of the gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia and an important component of the DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint, interacts and phosphorylates (activates) c-Abl at serine 465 (19Baskaran R.

In addition to regulating apoptosis, c-Abl also has an important effect on cell cycle progression; overexpression of c-Abl blocks G1/S transition, and cells with compromised c-Abl function, or cells lacking c-Abl have dysregulated cell cycles (14Sawyers C.L.

However, even though a critical role for c-Abl kinase in DNA damage-induced cellular responses has been well established, the precise knowledge of the molecular components involved and their working relationship in the c-Abl-mediated pathways remain unclear.SHP-2, an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, and has been demonstrated to be involved in diverse signaling pathways, including those initiated by growth factors, cytokines, and insulin (25Tonks N.K.

The N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2) plays a critical role in mediating SHP-2 function. A targeted N-terminal deletion of SHP-2 (amino acids 46–110 including the N-SH2) results in a loss-of-function mutation for SHP-2. As a result of this mutation, homozygous mutant (SHP-2Δ/Δ) embryos die at midgestation with multiple developmental defects (31Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F.

In the present studies, we examined cellular responses of SHP-2Δ/Δmutant cells to DNA damage, and showed that SHP-2 played an important role in the genotoxic stress-induced cell death signaling.RESULTSTo define new potential functions of SHP-2 phosphatase, we recently tested for its role in DNA damage-induced signaling by examining cell death sensitivity to DNA damage in WT and mutant embryonic fibroblast cells carrying an amino acid 46–110 deletion mutation of SHP-2 (SHP-2Δ/Δ). Cell survival assays demonstrated that mutant cells lacking functional SHP-2 were much more resistant to the DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin than their WT counterparts (Fig.1A). This appears to be attributed to their differential apoptotic responses to DNA damage, as chromatin DAPI staining showed that the percentage of cells with typical morphological changes associated with apoptosis, including nuclear blebbing and heterochromatin aggregation, was significantly decreased in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells following DNA damage (Fig. 1B). The DNA fragmentation assay, a characteristic analysis for apoptotic cells, also showed that significantly reduced DNA fragmentation was observed in SHP-2 mutant cells treated with cisplatin (data not shown). Moreover, the percentage of hypodiploid cells with sub-G1 DNA content, known to be apoptotic, was significantly decreased in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells following either cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1C) or γ-irradiation (Fig. 1D). Notably, re-introduction of functional WT SHP-2 into mutant cells (rescued cell line) partially restored their sensitivity to DNA damage (Fig. 1), suggesting that the decrease in apoptosis in mutant cells resulted from loss-of-function of SHP-2 rather than gain-of-function of the truncated SHP-2 expressed in the mutant cells.Previous studies have demonstrated that p53 tumor suppressor and its homologue p73 are major mediators in cellular death responses to DNA damage (45Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 46White E. Prives C. Nature. 1999; 399: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The observation that DNA damage gave rise to different cell death sensitivities between WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells prompted us to examine p53 and p73 induction in these cells following DNA damage. p53 induction in both WT and mutant cells was not evident (see Fig. 8A), presumably because of immortalization of the cell lines with SV40 large T antigen that blocks p53 function (47Marin M.C.

However, as shown in Fig. 2, p73 expression was dramatically up-regulated in WT cells exposed to cisplatin treatment, consistent with previous reports (8Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, p73 induction in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells was completely blocked. Prolonged incubation and increased dosages of cisplatin did not increase the expression of p73 in these mutant cells (data not shown). As p73 can transactivate the downstream effector p21Cip1, the induction of p21Cip1 was next analyzed. Consistent with the expression of p73, p21Cip1 induction was also diminished in SHP-2 mutant cells (Fig. 2). Notably, p73 and p21Cip1 induction was partially restored in the rescued cell line, further confirming a role for SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase in DNA damage-induced intracellular responses.Figure 8ATM/ATR kinases are equally activated in WTand SHP-2Δ/Δmutant cells in response to DNA damage. Whole cell lysates (50 μg) prepared from cisplatin-treated (25 μm) WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p53Ser-15 (A) and anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-Gln motif (B) antibodies.

Shown are representatives of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine potential involvement of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase in DNA damage-triggered signal transduction, tyrosyl phosphorylation and catalytic activity of SHP-2 following cisplatin treatment was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3A, in WT fibroblast cells, tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 was significantly increased shortly after cisplatin treatment. However, phosphorylation of the truncated form of SHP-2 (SHP-2Δ) expressed in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells was unchanged at all time points examined (Fig. 3A). Subsequent in vitrophosphatase assays demonstrated that catalytic activity of SHP-2 was doubled in the WT cells following cisplatin treatment (Fig.3B). By contrast, although SHP-2Δ in the untreated mutant cells had 2 times higher basal activity as we previously reported (32Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), its phosphatase activity remained unchanged after DNA damage (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase is involved in DNA damage-induced signaling and that the truncated form of SHP-2 expressed in the mutant cells might not be functioning in response to DNA damage.Figure 3Phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is increased in response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage. A, whole cell lysates (500 μg) prepared from cisplatin-treated (25 μm) WT and SHP-2 mutant fibroblast cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-SHP-2 antibody followed by anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) immunoblotting (IB). B, anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitates from whole cell lysates (250 μg) prepared from cisplatin-treated (25 μm for 2 h) WT, SHP-2Δ/Δ, and rescued cells were subjected to the tyrosine phosphatase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three independent experiments were performed, producing similar results. Results shown are the mean ± S.E. of triplicates from one experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that induction and stabilization of p73 but not p53 in response to DNA damage is completely dependent on nuclear c-Abl kinase activity (8Gong J.G.

Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The blockade of p73 induction in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells indicated that c-Abl activation following cisplatin treatment in these cells might be impaired. To test this hypothesis, tyrosyl phosphorylation response of c-Abl kinase was first examined to determine its activation status. As shown in Fig.4A, c-Abl became phosphorylated in WT cells 2–3 h after DNA damage. In contrast, phosphorylation of c-Abl in SHP-2 mutant cells was significantly reduced. Several c-Abl antibodies from various manufacturers were used for this experiment, producing similar results. We also checked longer time points following genotoxic insult (4, 8, and 24 h) in which no obvious phosphorylation of c-Abl was observed in mutant cells (data not shown). Subsequent examination of the tyrosyl phosphorylation response of baseline p73 through anti-p73 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed that its phosphorylation in WT cells was rapidly induced after DNA damage as previously reported (9Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 10Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this response in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells was undetectable (Fig.4B). As tyrosyl phosphorylation of p73 in response to DNA damage is fully attributed to c-Abl kinase activity (9Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 10Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), these results further suggested that c-Abl activation in mutant cells was compromised. Subsequently, this notion was supported by in vitro c-Abl kinase assays. Using GST-Crk as the substrate, we showed that in response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage, activation of c-Abl kinase was barely detectable in the SHP-2 mutant cells, but was partially restored in the rescued cell line following reintroduction of WT SHP-2 (Fig. 4C), confirming a requirement of SHP-2 for c-Abl activation.Figure 4DNA damage-induced activation of the c-Abl kinase is compromised in SHP-2Δ/Δmutant cells. WT and mutant cells were treated with 25 μm cisplatin for various time periods. Whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to anti-c-Abl (A) and anti-p73 (B) immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. Cell lysates (500 μg) were also used for the in vitro c-Abl kinase assay (C) and the JNK kinase assay (D) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are representatives of two to three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, activation of JNK kinase, known to be implicated in mediating stress-induced apoptosis (50Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar), was dramatically enhanced in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that decreased sensitivity of SHP-2Δ/Δ cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis was not related to JNK activity. This result additionally indicates that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase negatively regulates DNA damage-induced JNK kinase activation.c-Abl kinase has been previously demonstrated to negatively regulate cellular growth. Overexpression of WT c-Abl leads to cell growth arrest and sensitizes cellular apoptotic responses to DNA damage, whereas interference of endogenous c-Abl function by overexpression of kinase inactive c-Abl (c-Abl K/R) reduces DNA damage-induced cell death (14Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havlik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Cong F. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To further confirm the functional requirement of SHP-2 for c-Abl activation in response to DNA damage, we transfected WT and c-Abl K/R into WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells and assessed the effects of WT c-Abl and c-Abl K/R in these cells. As shown in Fig.5, the sensitivity of WT cells to cisplatin was enhanced by transfection of the WT c-Abl as compared to the pSR vector control, whereas expression of the c-Abl K/R mutant in WT cells significantly reduced cell death. Interestingly, although the transfected WT c-Abl was equally overexpressed in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells, the effect of overexpression of c-Abl in these mutant cells was abrogated, suggesting that the c-Abl kinase did not function in mutant cells without WT SHP-2. Because endogenous c-Abl in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells was disabled as described above (Fig. 4), the dominant negative effect of catalytically inactive c-Abl K/R in mutant cells was not observed. Together, these results further confirm a requirement of SHP-2 for c-Abl activation and thereby cell death responses to DNA damage.Figure 5The effect of overexpression of c-Abl kinase on DNA damage-induced apoptosis is abolished in SHP-2Δ/Δmutant cells.

https://openalex.org/W2116497451,"Since 1925, epidemiological and histological evidence for an association between endometriosis and ovarian neoplasia has accumulated. Recently, publications assaying the clonality of a given cell population have implied endometriosis has premalignant properties. However, the human androgen receptor used as a marker in these studies is of highly questionable reliability due to the instability of its methylation pattern in nonmalignant cells and during the course of malignancy. Therefore, we decided to readdress the question of clonality of endometriotic foci by using an alternative assay based on a polymorphism of the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 gene. We overcame the limitation to using ovarian cysts (a problem encountered in other studies) by laser-microdissecting defined tissue fractions of interest. From the 13/29 informative patients, a total of 32 endometriotic samples from various sites was assayed. Only 2/32 samples from different patients bore monoclonal tissue. With one of those cases, we present the first direct evidence of the two morphological endometric compartments comprising a single biphasic developmental unit. Neither monoclonal patient was characterized by any outstanding clinical parameters, including neoplasia. Individual endometriotic foci from the only patient in this study with neoplasia was assayed as being polyclonal. Therefore, former studies stating endometriosis as premalignant have to be cautiously reinterpreted."
https://openalex.org/W2041595417,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and its homologues, p107 and p130, prevent cell cycle progression from G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> to S phase by forming complexes with E2F transcription factors. Upon phosphorylation by G<sub>1</sub>cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes such as cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2, they lose the ability to bind E2F, and cells are thereby allowed to progress into S phase. Functional loss of one or more of the pRB family members, as a result of genetic mutation or deregulated phosphorylation, is considered to be an essential prerequisite for cellular transformation. In this study, we found that pRB family proteins have the ability to stimulate cyclin D1 transcription by activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. The cyclin D1-inducing activity of pRB is abolished by adenovirus E1A oncoprotein but not by the deletion of the A-box, the B-box, or the C-terminal region of the pocket, indicating that multiple pocket sequences are independently involved in cyclin D1 activation. Intriguingly, tumor-derived pRB pocket mutants retain the cyclin D1-inducing activity. Our results reveal a novel role of pRB family proteins as potential activators of NF-κB and inducers of G<sub>1</sub> cyclin. Certain pRB pocket mutants may give rise to a cellular situation in which deregulated E2F and cyclin D1 cooperatively promote abnormal cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2154110558,"Cholesterol esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are key events in vascular proliferative diseases. Here we performed experiments to ascertain the role of cholesterol ester pathway in the control of human aortic VSMC cycle progression. Results showed that serum-induced VSMC proliferation was preceded by an increased ability of the cells to esterify cholesterol as well as by an increased expression of ACAT and multidrug resistance (MDR1) mRNAs and extracellular related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), whereas caveolin-1 levels were markedly decreased. Cell cycle analyses performed in the presence of two inhibitors of cholesterol esterification, directly inhibiting ACAT (Sandoz 58-035) or the transport of cholesterol substrate from plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum (progesterone), indicate that each inhibitor suppressed the serum-induced DNA synthesis by accumulation of VSMCs in the G1 phase. The effect was associated with a rapid inhibition of ERK1/2 mitogenic signaling pathway; a down-regulation of cyclin D1, ACAT, and MDR1 mRNA; and an up-regulation of caveolin-1. These data provide a plausible link between cholesterol esterification and control of cell cycle G1/S transition, supporting the hypothesis that cholesterol esterification may accelerate the progression of human vascular proliferative diseases by modulating the rate of the VSMC proliferation."

The Fourier transform infrared spectra of theba3-CO complex demonstrate that in the presence of 60–80 μm O2, the ν(C-O) of CuB1+-C-O at 2053 cm−1 (complex A) shifts to 2045 cm−1 and remains unchanged in H2O/D2O exchanges and in the pH 6.5–9.0 range. The frequencies but not the intensities of the C-O stretching modes of heme a3-CO (complex B), however, remain unchanged. The change in the ν(C-O) of complex A results in an increase of k−2, and thus in a higher affinity of CuB for exogenous ligands. The time-resolved step-scan Fourier transform infrared difference spectra indicate that the rate of decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex at pH 6.5 is 30.4 s−1 and 28.3 s−1 in the presence of O2.

In the presence of three O2 channels inaa3-type oxidases, it is not known yet whether a facilitated oxygen channel is necessary, because the O2concentrations normally far exceed the O2 affinity of the enzyme; thus, excess O2 would not be rate-limiting.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we identified the C-O stretching mode of the equilibrium CuB1+-CO species (complex A) at 2053 cm−1 and concluded that the environment in the binuclear center does not alter the protonation state of the CuB histidine ligands. Understanding the conformational transitions that are associated with protonation/deprotonation of labile residues is essential because ionizable groups whose pKa values are near physiological pH are involved in proton uptake or release. A hydrogen-bonded connectivity between the propionates of hemea3, Asp-372, and H2O was also reported. Accordingly, plausible mechanisms of proton pathway(s) directly associated with the propionates of the hemea3 redox center and the proton-labile side chain of Asp-372 were suggested. The nature of heme-copper oxidases is to bring in O2through ligand-entry channels to the binuclear center and then remove protons and H2O from the active site. Because it has been proposed that 1) CuB is a way-stop for ligand entry to hemea3 (8Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and 2) the O2 channel is located at the CuB site, we sought to determine the properties of the binuclear center by applying our FTIR approach (7Koutsoupakis K.

In cytochrome ba3, the exceptionally high affinity for CO binding to CuB(K1 > 104) has allowed us to perform such experiments. We have also used time-resolved step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)1 to investigate the ligand dynamics subsequent to CO photolysis at room temperature in the presence of ∼70 μm O2 and compare the results with those obtained in the absence of O2, which is essential for elucidating the unique chemical mechanisms of the redox processes catalyzed by the enzyme and the dynamics of the binuclear center. Cytochrome ba3 was isolated from T. thermophilus HB8 cells according to previously published procedures (3Giuffrè A. Stubauer G. Sart P. Brunori M. Zumft W.G. Buse G. Soulimane T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14718-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The samples used for the FTIR measurements had an enzyme concentration of ∼1 mm and were placed in a desired buffer (pD 5.5–6.5, MES; pD 7.5, HEPES; pD 8.5–9.5 CHES). The pD solutions prepared in D2O buffers were measured by using a pH meter and assuming pD = pH (observed) + 0.4. Dithionite reduced samples were exposed to 1 atmosphere CO (1 mm) in an anaerobic cell to prepare the CO adduct and transferred to a tightly sealed FTIR cell under anaerobic conditions (pathlength l = 15 and 25 μm for the experiments in H2O and D2O, respectively). CO gas was obtained from Messer (Frankfurt, Germany) and isotopic CO (13CO) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). The ba3 carbonmonoxy/O2 adduct was prepared by addition of aliquots of 5 μl of an oxygen-saturated buffer solution (1.2 mm O2) to make the final O2 concentration of 60–80 μm. The 532 nm pulse from a Continuum neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser (7-ns width, 3 Hz) was used as a pump light (10 mJ/pulse) to photolyze the ba3-CO complex. The time-resolved step-scan FTIR spectra were obtained with spectral resolution of 8 cm−1 and 100-μs time resolution for the 0–75-ms measurements. A total of 10 co-additions per retardation data point was collected. Changes in intensity were recorded with a mercury cadmium telluride detector, amplified (dc-coupled), and digitized with a 200-kHz, 16-bit, analog-to-digital converter. Blackman-Harris three-term apodization function with 32 cm−1 phase resolution and the Mertz phase correction algorithm were used. Difference spectra were calculated as ΔA = −log(intensity of sample/intensity of reference). The detailed experimental set-up for the time-resolved step-scan FTIR has been described previously (7Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Stavrakis S. Koutsoupakis K. Pinakoulaki E. Urbani A. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Am. Chem.

The rate constants for each phase of the decay of the CuB1+-CO complex and for CO rebinding to heme a3 were calculated, assuming first-order kinetics, with three-parameter exponential fits to the experimental data. Optical absorbance spectra were recorded before and after FTIR measurements to assess sample stability with a PerkinElmer Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer. The FTIR spectrum of the CO-bound cytochromeba3 complex at neutral pH exhibits peaks at 1967, 1973, 1982, and 2053 cm−1 (Fig.1, trace A). In the13C16O derivative, these peaks shift to 1923, 1928, 1937, and 2007 cm−1, respectively (Fig.1, trace B). The peaks at 1967, 1973, and 1982 cm−1 have been assigned to the C-O stretching modes of heme a3-CO (complexB), and the peak at 2053 cm−1 to the C-O stretching mode of CuB1+-CO (complexA). As shown in Fig. 1, trace C, addition of 70 μm buffered O2 to theba3-CO complex leads to a shift of the CO mode of CuB1+ to 2045 cm−1. Addition of oxygen-saturated buffer (>300 μm) causes the spontaneous replacement of CO by O2, as evidenced by the full disappearance of both the heme a3-CO modes at 1967, 1973, and 1982 cm−1 and the CuB-CO mode at 2053 cm−1. Confirmation that the newly developed 2045 cm−1 mode is CO-sensitive is shown in the 13CO spectrum (Fig. 1, trace D), where it shifts to 1999 cm−1. These data also demonstrate a significant growth of the 2045 cm−1 conformation on the expense of intensity loss of the CO modes of heme a3 (complexB), indicating an increase of k−2. The optical absorption spectrum of the ba3-CO complex, shown in the inset (trace a), displays Soret maxima at 427 and visible maxima at 529, 559, and 592 nm. Addition of 70 μm O2 over theba3-CO enzyme results in trace b with a reduced intensity at 427 and a shoulder at 444 nm, indicating an increase of k−2. No evidence for any oxidized contribution from hemes b/a3 is observed. The conversion of the 2053 cm−1 conformer to that of 2045 cm−1 is stable over a wide pH range. Fig. 2,trace A, shows the spectrum of theba3-CO complex at pH 6.5 in the absence of O2. Addition of 70 μmO2-equilibrated buffer yields trace B, where both 2053 and 2045 cm−1 conformers are present. The O2-induced conformational change undergoes a very slow (t12 ∼ 65 min) conformational change (trace C). The absence of any additional changes in trace Cindicates that equilibrium has been reached. Trace D is that of ba3-CO at pH 7.0 in the absence of O2. and traces E and F are in the presence of 70 μm of O2 until no additional changes were observed (trace G). Trace H is obtained in the presence of 70 μm of O2 at pD 7.0. Traces I (ba3-CO)–K(ba3-CO in the presence of O2) are the analogous spectra at pH 9. The absence of pH/pD-induced spectral changes in the 2045 cm−1 conformer indicates that is not coupled to proton-dependent conformational changes.Figure 2FTIR spectra of the cytochromeba3-CO complex at pH 6.5 (A–C), pH 7.0 (D–G), pD 7.0 (H), and pH 9.0 (I–K) in the absence (A, D,I) and in the presence of O2 (B–C,E–H, J–K) at 293 K. The experimental conditions were the same as those in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The insensitivity of the 2045 cm−1 mode to pH/pD and to the pH 6.5–9.0 range indicates that the degree of back-donation of electron density from the d orbitals of CuB to the antibonding π* orbitals of CO is not altered under these conditions. The same conclusions have been reached for the 2053 cm−1 mode. As we have demonstrated previously for complexA (2053 cm−1 mode), a change in the protonation state of one of the CuB-His ligands would have significant changes in the back donation and thus on the frequency of ν(C-O) (7Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because we see no change in the frequency of the 2045 cm−1mode, we conclude that the CuB-His environment is very rigid and not subject to conformational transitions that are associated with protonation/deprotonation events of the CuB-His ligands. We suggest that low concentrations of O2 (60–80 μm) in the putative O2 channel play a role in modulating the structure of the CuB-CO complex that facilitates the transition from 2053 to 2045 cm−1. We attribute the transition to an increased electron density in the CO antibonding orbitals that results in weakening the C-O bond strength (lower νC-O). It remains to be determined whether the O2 is hydrogen-bonded to one of the CuB-His ligands, causing the weakening of the C-O bond, or the newly developed conformer is the result of a dynamic effect in the delivery channel generating a conformational change in the CuB environment. It becomes intriguing to speculate that the properties of the O2 channel are not limited to facilitate ligand diffusion to the active site but are extended in controlling the dynamics and reactivity of the reactions of ba3 with O2 and nitric oxide and other ligands, including cyanide. The increased value of k−2indicates that CuB undergoes structural changes to behave as an efficient trap for CO. We suggest that this behavior is extended to the physiological function of the enzyme. This way, conformational changes associated with CuB occur, facilitating the entry and the later coordination of O2 to the binuclear center. Fig. 3A shows the time-resolved step-scan FTIR difference spectra (td = 0–75 ms, 8 cm−1 spectral resolution) of fully reduced ba3-CO subsequent to CO photolysis by a nanosecond laser pulse (532 nm). Upon photolysis, CO is transferred from heme a3 to CuB. It should be noted that the CuB-CO complex (complex A) is not photolabile and thus remains a spectator in the photodynamic events occurring to complex B. Under our 8 cm−1 spectral resolution, the hemea3 Fe-CO peaks at 1967, 1973, and 1982 cm−1 are not resolved; thus, a single negative peak at 1976 cm−1 indicates the photolyzed hemea32+-C-O complex. The positive peak that appears at 2053 cm−1 is attributed to the C-O stretch (νC-O) of the transient CuB1+-CO complex, and its frequency is the same as that obtained at pD 8.5 (7Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that of the equilibrium CuB1+-CO complex. At early times (0–3000 μs), the intensity of the 1976 and 2053 cm−1 modes in the transient difference spectra remains unchanged, suggesting that dissociation of CO from CuB does not occur on this time scale. At later times (3–75 ms), there is a decrease in intensity of the 2053 cm−1 mode that is accompanied by an increased intensity of the 1976 cm−1mode. At 75 ms after CO photolysis, the intensities of both the 1976 and 2053 cm−1 modes are almost diminished. The intensity ratio (∼2) of the Fe-CO/CuB-CO remains constant for all data points, indicating that no significant fraction of CO escapes the binuclear center. This is also consistent with both the low-temperature experiments (21 K) and those obtained at pD 8.5 at room temperature (7Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J.

Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The high signal-to-noise ratio in the time-resolved FTIR difference spectra has allowed us to monitor the decay and reappearance of the 2053 and 1976 cm−1 modes, respectively. Fig.3A, inset, compares the decay of the CuB1+-CO complex, as measured by ΔA of the 2053 cm−1 mode shown in Fig.3A, with the formation of the hemea32+-CO complex by measuring ΔA of the 1976 cm−1 modes. The rate of decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex is 30.4 s−1, and the observed rate of rebinding to hemea3 is 26.3 s−1. Both rates are 10% lower than those observed at pD 8.5 (7Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pH/pD dependence of the rates of decay of the CuB complex and the rebinding to hemea3 will be presented elsewhere. 2K. Koutsoupakis, T. Soulimane, and C. Varotsis, unpublished observations. Fig. 3B shows the time-resolved step-scan FTIR difference spectra (td = 0–75 ms, 8 cm−1spectral resolution) of fully reduced ba3-CO in the presence of 70 μm O2 after CO photolysis by a nanosecond laser pulse (532 nm). The results are very similar to those obtained in the absence of O2, including the intensity ratio (∼2) of the Fe-CO/CuB-CO modes. This observation indicates that O2 is not coordinated to CuB in complex B, before photolysis. Importantly, the observed rates for the decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex (28.3 s−1) and the heme a32+ recombination (k2 = 24.6 s−1) that we have determined, shown in Fig. 3B, inset, indicate that the presence of O2 in the delivery channel has no direct control in the CO ligation/dissociation dynamics. The observation of the C-O stretch (νC-O) of the transient CuB1+-CO complex at 2053 cm−1 and not at 2045 cm−1, as observed in the equilibrium CuB1+-CO complex in the presence of O2, indicates the absence of an equilibrium between the transient CuB1+-CO complex and O2at the time-scale of our observations (0–75 ms). This work presents a very peculiar and unexpected observation. However, the ba3 oxidase is expressed under limited amounts of oxygen; thus, an O2-concentration-dependent behavior, such that presented in this work, is feasible. Several control experiments with Mb-CO (data not shown) indicate that under the same experimental conditions (O2 concentration, pH-range, temperature), O2 spontaneously replaces CO. The experiments reported here have been repeated with different enzyme preparations to avoid some sort of artifact and clearly demonstrate O2 migration in the delivery channel that is located at the CuB site. The presence, but not coordination, of O2 at the CuB site results in a structural reorientation of the CuB environment and concomitantly to an increase ofk−2. This effect can be either steric or electrostatic involving either one of the CuB-His ligands (polar) or the CuB atom directly (electrostatic), producing an increased electron density in the CO antibonding orbitals that results in weakening the C-O bond strength (lower νC-O). Our data also support the developing consensus that CuB is a way stop for O2 en route to its hemea3 binding site (8Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whether the presence of Glu-278 in other heme-copper oxidases (5Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

Moreover, it is important to establish whether the conformational changes induced to CuB environment by O2, which is present in low concentrations at physiological conditions because of the reduced gas solubility at higher temperatures, in the putative channel ofba3, are extended to the superfamily of cytochrome oxidases. Experiments toward this goal are in progress in our laboratory. We thank E. Pinakoulaki for helpful discussions."

A second mutation (S413N) of the NysA KSS domain was discovered that completely abolished the ability of the hybrids to restore nystatin biosynthesis, presumably by affecting the ability of the resulting proteins to catalyze the required substrate decarboxylation. In contrast, NysA and its Ser-170 mutants bearing the same S413N mutation were able to restore nystatin production to significant levels, probably by using acetyl-CoA as a starter unit.

PKSs catalyze decarboxylative condensations of simple carboxylic acids into the growing polyketide chain by a mechanism similar to the fatty-acid synthases. PKSs, however, are more diverse in their catalytic reactions, including the use of different primer and extender molecules. Each PKS module is a collection of domains with distinct catalytic functions during PKS catalysis, one module being responsible for one condensation step in the biosynthetic pathway. The minimal domains necessary for condensation are ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP). In addition, the domains ketoreductase, dehydratase (DH), and enoyl reductase responsible for different degrees of the reduction state of every β-carbon in the polyketide chain may be present in various combinations. It follows that the chemical structure of the final product is largely reflected in the modular organization of the PKS proteins (1Donadio S. Staver M. McAlpine J.B. Swanson S.J. Katz L. Science. 1991; 252: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of modular PKS is the presence of a loading module for chain initiation, which is usually fused to the first extender module. The loading module of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase catalyzing the biosynthesis of the erythromycin macrolactone ring in Saccharopolyspora erythraea is composed of the AT and ACP domains. Although several models for chain initiation have been proposed for this system (2Pereda A. Summers R.G. Stassi D.L. Ruan X. Katz L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Long P.F. Wilkinson C.J. Bisang C.P. Cortés J. Dunstaer N. Oliynyk M. McCormick E. McArthur H. Mendez C. Salas J.A. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), evidence accumulated so far indicates that monocarboxylic acyl-CoA species are utilized as substrates. However, recent characterization of the new modular PKS proteins has shown that multidomain loading modules are more common. Such loading modules typically possess, in addition to AT and ACP, a domain designated KSQ, which is similar to the chain length factor (CLF) of type II PKSs (4Bisang C. Long P.F. Cortés J. Westcott J. Crosby J. Matharu A.L. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Both CLF and KSQ are similar to the KS domains, while having a glutamine residue substituting cysteine in the active site. In the actinorhodin type II PKS CLF forms a heterodimer with KS, and by mutational studies it has been demonstrated that both domains are competent to catalyze substrate decarboxylation, as long as at least one of the domains has a glutamine residue positioned in its active site (4Bisang C.

A similar property has been suggested for the KSQ domains of some modular PKS, such as monensin PKS loading module, where a Q177A substitution in the KSQ domain resulted in a 10-fold reduction of the decarboxylase activity in vitro (4Bisang C. Long P.F. Cortés J. Westcott J. Crosby J. Matharu A.L. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, KSQ is typically accompanied by a distinct AT domain, with proposed high specificity for dicarboxylic substrates compared with monocarboxylic substrates (3Long P.F. Wilkinson C.J.

Nature. 1999; 401: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), AT loads a dicarboxylic acid onto the ACP, whereas the KSQ domain governs decarboxylation in a way resembling the catalysis performed by extender modules. However, the residue in an “active site” position of the KS might be not the only one crucial for decarboxylation. Mutational analysis of the actinorhodin PKS, for example, demonstrated that additional KS residues might be critical, indicating that the precise mechanism for the KS-dependent decarboxylation still remains unclear (6Dreier J.

NysA is a single module polypeptide composed of four catalytic domains (see Fig. 1) and thus resembles a typical extender module devoid of ketoreductase domain. It contains a KS-like domain with a serine residue (KSS) instead of a cysteine in the proposed active site position 170. The DH domain does not seem to have any function in NysA, except probably for maintenance of a protein structural integrity, and most likely represents an evolutionary remnant. The primary sequence of the AT domain (AT0) displays an acetate-specific signature (8Haydock S.F. Aparicio J.F. Molnar I. Schwecke T. Khaw L.E. Konig A. Marsden A.F. Galloway I.S. Staunton J.

However, in view of unclear significance of the KSS domain for the NysA function, it remained unknown whether malonyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA is used as primer for nystatin synthesis (Fig. 1, A andB). In the present study we have analyzed the in vivo role of NysA for the initiation of nystatin synthesis in S. noursei. In particular, the significance of the KSS and the AT0 domains was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and construction of the hybrid loading modules. Our data indicate that the KSS domain is important, but not essential, for the initiation of nystatin biosynthesis. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and recombinant phages used in this study are listed in Table I.S. noursei strains were maintained on ISP2 agar medium (Difco), and E. coli strains were grown in L broth or L agar (11Sambrook J.

General DNA manipulations were performed as described previously (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments from agarose gels were purified using the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen, Germany). Southern blot analysis was performed with the digoxigenin-11-dUTP High Prime labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and the Genetic Analyzer 3100 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The PCRs were performed with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the Eppendorf Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Germany), as described previously (15Brautaset T.

The 11.0-kb BamHI fragment from phage N76 was cloned into pGEM3Zf(−), and from this construct (pL76B11) the 5.83-kb PstI-SacI DNA fragment encompassing the coding region of the nysA gene and surrounding sequences was ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pGEM3Zf(−). From the resulting plasmid (pL76PS5.8) the 1.68-kbMscI-PstI and the 2.79-kbSacI-SmaI DNA fragments were excised and ligated into the PstI/SacI-digested pGEM3Zf(−). From this construct, designated pNAD1, the 4.49-kbEcoRI-HindIII insert was ligated together with the 3.0-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pSOK201, resulting in the nysA replacement vector pNAD2. The 4.63-kbEcoRI-SpeI fragment from plasmid pL76B11 (including the coding region of nysA and 157-bp upstream sequences) was ligated into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pGEM3Zf(−), as well as into the EcoRI-SpeI sites of pLITMUS28, resulting in plasmids pL76ES4.6 and pLIT76ES4.6, respectively. From pL76ES4.6 the 4.63-kbEcoRI-HindIII insert was excised and ligated into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of vector pSOK804, resulting in the nysA integration vector pKSSAT0. Plasmid pSOK804 is a mobilizable vector capable of site-specific integration into the S. noursei chromosome recently constructed in or laboratory. 2O. Sekurova, personal communication. To prepare a suitable template for site-directed mutagenesis, the 2.95-kb ApaI fragment from plasmid pL76PS5.8 was ligated into the corresponding site of plasmid pGEM11Zf(−). From this construct, pL76A2.95, the 2.81-kb SpeI-SacI fragment including the nysA KSS coding region was ligated into the XbaI/SacI sites of pLITMUS28, resulting in plasmid pLIT76SS2.8. This plasmid was used as a template for mutagenesis using the QuickChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The putative active site serine residue in position 170 (Ser-170) of the nysA gene product was substituted with cysteine (S170C), glutamine (S170Q), and glycine (S170G) by using the following mutagenic primer pairs, respectively: S170C-F, 5′-CGTCACCGTCGACACCACGTGCAGCTCGTCGCTGGTCGCGCTGC-3′ (sense), and S170C-R, 5′-GCAGCGCGACCAGCGACGAGCTGCACGTGGTGTCGACGGTGACG-3′ (antisense); S170Q-F, 5′-CGTCACCGTCGACACCACGCAGAGCTCGTCGCTGGTCGCGCTGC-3′, (sense), and S170Q-R, 5′-GCAGCGCGACCAGCGACGAGCTCTGCGTGGTGTCGACGGTGACG-3′ (antisense); S170G-F, 5′-CTCACCGTCGACACCACGGGATCCTCGTCGCTGG-TCGCGC-3′ (sense), and S170G-R, 5′-GCGCGACCAGCGACGAGGATCCCGTGGTGTCGACGGTGAC-3′ (antisense). Mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface, and all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Underlined in all primers are new restrictions sites (AluI for mutations S170C and S170Q and BamHI for mutation S170G) introduced for simplified identification of positive clones. After mutagenesis, the 1.02-kb MluI-SpeI fragments including the newly introduced mutations were excised and ligated together with the 3.60-kbEcoRI-MluI fragment from pLIT76ES4.6 into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of vector pGEM3Zf(−). From the resulting constructs, the 4.63-kb EcoRI-HindIII inserts were ligated into the corresponding sites of vector pSOK804, resulting in plasmids pKSCAT0, pKSQAT0, and pKSGAT0, respectively. All three plasmids are analogous to the integration vector pKSSAT0, except for the desired point mutations affecting Ser-170 in the NysA KSSdomain. The nys-PKS regions encoding individual domains were PCR-amplified and subcloned. Primers for the introduction of unique restriction sites were typically used to facilitate further assembly of the resulting fragments into hybrid genes. The new restriction sites introduced and used for the assembly procedure were in all cases positioned in the inter-domain linker regions to avoid any unwarranted structural effects for the resulting hybrid proteins. All the resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The 1.75-kb DNA fragments covering the coding region of the variant NysA KSQ, KSC, and KSS domains, including the nysA promoter region, were PCR-amplified from the plasmid pLIT76SS2.8 and its mutated derivatives (see above) DNA using the following primer pair: NAKS-F, 5′-TACGACTCACTAGTCTTCGGCGCGCG-3′ (sense), and NAKS-R, 5′-GGAGGATCCTGGTGGGCCGCACCGC-3′ (antisense). The latter primer contains a BamHI recognition site (underlined) used for the hybrid assembly procedure (see below). The resulting PCR fragments were blunt-ligated into theSmaI site of pUC18, and from the resulting constructs the 1.75-kb EcoRI-BamHI inserts were excised and ligated into the corresponding sites of vector pGEM3Zf(−), resulting in the constructs pGEM-KSQ, pGEM-KSC, and pGEM-KSS, respectively (see Table I). In addition, a derivative of pGEM-KSC harboring a second point mutation (S413N) of the KS coding region was identified and denoted pGEM-KSCN. This mutation most probably resulted from an erroneous PCR amplification. The 1.0-kb MluI-SpeI fragment from plasmid pGEM-KSCN (including the S413N but not the S170C mutation) was used to substitute the corresponding fragments in plasmids pGEM-KSQ and pGEM-KSS, resulting in plasmids pGEM-KSQN and pGEM-KSSN, respectively (see Table I). The 1.63-kb DNA fragment encompassing the continuous coding region of the NysA DH + ACP domains was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pL76B11 DNA, using the following primer pair: NADH-F, 5′-GGAGCATGCCTTCTACGCCGGCAC-3′ (sense), and NADH-R, 5′-GCGAAGCTTGGTCAGTCCTCGTCATC-3′ (antisense). Underlined in the primers are the restriction sites (HindIII andSphI, respectively) used for end digestion and cloning of the PCR fragment into the corresponding sites of pGEM3Zf(−), resulting in plasmid pGEM-DHACP. The 0.99-kb DNA fragment including the coding region of the Nys-PKS module 1 AT domain (AT1) was PCR-amplified from the pL76B11 DNA using the following primer pair: NBAT1-F, 5′-GGAGGATCCGACGGTGTTCGTGTTCC-3′ (sense), and NBAT1-R, 5′-GCAGCATGCCAGTCCACGTCCACAC-3′ (antisense). Similarly, the 0.99-kb DNA fragment covering the coding region of the Nys-PKS module 3 AT domain (AT3) was PCR-amplified from the phage N14 DNA using the following primer pair: NCAT3-F, 5′-GCAGGATCCCTGCGCCGTCCTCTTC-3′ (sense), and NCAT3-R, 5′-GCAGCATGCCAGCGGACCGTGACGC-3′ (antisense). Both the resulting PCR products were end-digested with BamHI andSphI (recognition sites underlined in each primer) and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGEM3Zf(−), resulting in the constructs pGEM-AT1 and pGEM-AT3, respectively. One of the variant 1.75-kb EcoRI-BamHI KS-encoding fragments from the construct pGEM-KSC, pGEM-KSQ, pGEM-KSS, pGEM-KSCN, and pGEM-KSQN, or pGEM-KSSN, the 1.6-kbSphI-HindIII DH + ACP insert from pGEM-DHACP, and one of the variant 0.99-kb BamHI-SphI AT inserts from pGEM-AT1 or pGEM-AT3 were ligated into theEcoRI/HindIII sites of the vector pSOK804. By using this strategy the following nine different integration plasmids were obtained: pKSSAT1, pKSCAT1, pKSQAT1, pKSSAT3, pKSCAT3, pKSQAT3, pKSSNAT3, pKSCNAT3, and pKSQNAT3 (see Tables I andII).Table IIComplementation of S. noursei NDA59 with NysA mutants and hybrid-loading modulesVector for complementation2-aDescription of the integration vectors used is given in Table I.KS mutations2-bKS domains harboring between zero and two amino acid substitutions were used, and the particular mutations are indicated.AT domain2-cThe variant AT domains used are as follows: AT0, NysA; AT1, NysB module 1; AT3, NysC module 3.Nystatin level, %2-dNystatin production was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean values with the corresponding S.E. are given for all cases, 100% represents the production levels obtained in NDA59 (pKSSAT0), and 0 nystatin is below 0.05%.pKSSAT0NoneAT0100 ± 3pKSCAT0S170CAT0101 ± 8pKSQAT0S170QAT090 ± 1pKSGAT0S170GAT098 ± 5pKSSAT1NoneAT1 0pKSCAT1S170CAT1 0pKSQAT1S170QAT1 0pKSSAT3NoneAT311 ± 2pKSCAT3S170CAT317 ± 1pKSQAT3S170QAT312 ± 1pKSSNAT3S413NAT3 0pKSCNAT3S170C + S413NAT3 0pKSQNAT3S170Q + S413NAT3 0pKSSNAT0S413NAT034 ± 1pKSCNAT0S170C + S413NAT036 ± 2pKSQNAT0S170Q + S413NAT019 ± 2The complementation experiments were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 2C.2-a Description of the integration vectors used is given in Table I.2-b KS domains harboring between zero and two amino acid substitutions were used, and the particular mutations are indicated.2-c The variant AT domains used are as follows: AT0, NysA; AT1, NysB module 1; AT3, NysC module 3.2-d Nystatin production was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean values with the corresponding S.E. are given for all cases, 100% represents the production levels obtained in NDA59 (pKSSAT0), and 0 nystatin is below 0.05%.

The 1.58-kb SpeI-AarI fragments from plasmids pGEM-KSSN and pGEM-KSCN, or pGEM-KSQN (encompassing the nysA codons for the residues in positions 170 and 413), and the 3.05-kbAarI-EcoRI fragment from plasmid pLIT76ES4.6 were ligated into the XbaI/EcoRI sites of pGEM3Zf(−). From the resulting constructs the 4.65-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of pSOK804, resulting in the integration vectors pKSSNAT0, pKSCNAT0, and pKSQNAT0, respectively. These vectors are similar to the nysA expression vector pKSSAT0 (see above), except for the point mutations affecting Ser-170 and Ser-413 in the NysA KSS domain. Alignment of the amino acid sequences was done using the ClustalW 1.82 software provided on-line by the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). The alignment was visualized using the BoxShade 3.21 on-line software from the Swiss node of EMBnet (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The phylogenetic tree was drawn by the TreeView 1.6.6 software developed by R. D. M. Page at the University of Glasgow (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html) using the distances calculated after the ClustalW alignment at the EBI server (see above). In a previous report (7Brautaset T. Sekurova O.N. Sletta H. Ellingsen T.E. Strøm A.R. Valla S. Zotchev S.B. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 395-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) we described the nysA gene disruption abolishing all nystatin synthesis in S. noursei. However, to rule out the possibility of any polar effects that might have been imposed by this mutation, we constructed a nysA in-frame deletion mutant NDA59 by double homologous recombination, using the gene replacement vector pNAD2. The 1.36-kb in-frame deletion affecting thenysA gene within this plasmid eliminated the coding sequence for the C-terminal part of KSS and most of the AT0 domain (see Fig. 2). Analysis of NDA59 showed that it produces no nystatin (Fig. 2B), thus confirming that the NysA loading module is essential for initiation of nystatin synthesis in S. noursei. In an attempt to complement this mutant, plasmid pKSSAT0 was chromosomally integrated in the NDA59 strain. This plasmid harbors a DNA fragment encompassing thenysA gene and a 157-bp sequence upstream of its coding region, presumably containing the nysA promoter. Nystatin synthesis was restored to wild-type levels (Fig. 2C) in the NDA59 (pKSSAT0) strain, demonstrating that thenysA gene expressed in trans from its endogenous promoter can efficiently compleme"

In mouse, KLC1, a largely neuronal form of KLC, and the ubiquitous KLC2 have been identified (12Rahman A. Friedman D.S. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15395-15403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). KLCs share an N-terminal heptad repeat (HR), reminiscent of a leucine zipper motif, that is involved in binding to KHCs (10Gauger A.K. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13657-13666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Diefenbach R.J. Mackay J.P. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16663-16670Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The KLC middle region is highly conserved and consists of tandem tetratricopeptide repeats that, in other proteins, mediate protein interactions (18Gindhart Jr., J.G. Goldstein L.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 52-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their role in KLC function may be similar. The highly variable C-terminal region of KLCs has been proposed to bind cargo such as organelles and macromolecules; this is supported by direct binding studies in which rat KLC1b was shown to bind to mitochondria (13Khodjakov A. Lizunova E.M. Minin A.A. Koonce M.P. Gyoeva F.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and by the use of specific antibodies that bind to KLC and block its interaction with organelles (14Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As mentioned, KLCs may also regulate KHC and keep it in an inactive state by preventing the active conformation of KHC (11Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This was supported by the recent analysis of KLC1 knockout mice; mutant mice were small and exhibited motor disabilities (19Rahman A. Kamal A. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1277-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also, in these mice, a pool of KHC KIF5A was mislocalized to the peripheralcis-Golgi. We recently reported the isolation of a novel KLC gene,klc3, which contains a conserved HR motif that mediates binding to KHCs as well as five tetratricopeptide repeats (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In association with KHC, KLC3 binds to microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner. KLC3 is expressed in several tissues, including testis and brain; analysis of different male germ cells demonstrated that spermatids are the major site of KLC3 expression. Interestingly, male haploid germ cells do not detectably synthesize KLC1 and KLC2, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, suggesting that KLC3 probably carries out its function in transport and other motor-based processes and/or that other spermatid KLCs remain to be identified. This is in agreement with the observation that male KLC1 knockout mice are fertile (19Rahman A. Kamal A. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1277-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Kinesin-related proteins (KRPs), which do not contain light chains, have also been described in rat testis (21Zou Y. Millette C.F. Sperry A.O. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Sperry A.O. Zhao L.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and two KRPs have sequence similarity to the previously described BimC subfamily of KRPs involved in mitosis (23Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The other KRPs expressed in testis had no homology to known kinesins and likely represent novel family members. The KIF3 KRPs were also detected in testis (24Nakajima T. Miura I. Kashiwagi A. Nakamura M. Zool. Sci. 1997; 14: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); KIF3A and KIF3B form heterodimers that function as microtubule-based (+)-end transporters of membranous organelles (25Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A KIF3C knockout mouse is viable and apparently normal (26Yang Z. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5306-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, kinesin II, a member of the KIF3 family, is expressed in developing rat, sea urchin, and sand dollar sperm tails (27Miller M.G. Mulholland D.J. Vogl A.W. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Henson J.H. Cole D.G. Roesener C.D. Capuano S. Mendola R.J. Scholey J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because kinesins and KRPs transport cargo on microtubule tracks, it is interesting that rat testicular KRP2 and KRP6 are associated with spindle microtubules (22Sperry A.O. Zhao L.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that conventional kinesins as well as KRPs play a role in spermatid flagellar transport. Spermatogenesis is characterized by continuous proliferation and differentiation of germ cells. Upon completion of meiosis, haploid cells called spermatids emerge and differentiate into spermatozoa through a process known as spermiogenesis. Major morphological changes occur at this stage, including nuclear condensation and formation of the sperm tail, which contains unique structures not present in cilia and flagella, viz. outer dense fibers (ODFs) and the fibrous sheath (FS). The sperm tail can be subdivided into distinct regions, including the midpiece, which contains all mitochondria surrounding the ODFs and axoneme, and the principal piece, which contains the FS, ODFs, and axoneme. Several ODF components and associated proteins were recently cloned, and we demonstrated that they interact specifically via leucine zipper motifs (29Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Schalles U. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6105-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Shao X. Xue J. van der Hoorn F.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The function of ODFs remains unknown, but might be manyfold, including strengthening of the long sperm tail, a function in elastic recoil; linking of the FS and mitochondrial sheath to the axoneme; and regulation of motility. To investigate the localization of KLC3 in developing spermatids, we raised monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against KLC3. Using the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we discovered the association of KLC3 with ODFs in elongating spermatids, a structure devoid of microtubules, and details of this association were explored. The molecular basis of the ODF association is the ability of KLC3 to bind to the major ODF protein ODF1. A fusion protein containing maltose-binding protein (MBP) linked to KLC3 (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was produced by inducing transfected TB1 bacteria with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described (29Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Schalles U. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6105-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bacteria were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the MBP-KLC3 fusion protein was purified from the bacterial extract using amylose-agarose columns and eluted using maltose. Eluted fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For mAb production, 6-week-old BALB/c mice were injected with 10 μg of MBP-KLC3 fusion protein. For hybridoma production, SP2/MIL-6 myeloma cells (grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) were fused to spleen cells. mAb production was analyzed by immunofluorescence using frozen rat testicular sections and Western blot assays using NitroPlus membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) onto which MBP-KLC3 had been transferred. Polyclonal antibodies were produced as follows. New Zealand White rabbits were injected with purified MBP-KLC3, initially with complete Freund's adjuvant and subsequent injections with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Serum was collected and tested for KLC3 recognition by Western blot analysis as described above. Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-KLC3 antibody was isolated as described (30Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by incubation of total antibodies with membrane-immobilized MBP-KLC3 protein, washing of membrane strips, and elution of bound antibodies. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized, and their testes and epididymides were fixed by retrograde perfusion through the abdominal aortas either with standard Bouin's fixative for histology or with 0.8% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm lysine (pH 7.4) for ultrastructure. After perfusion, the tissue designated for electron microscopy was razor-cut into 1-mm2 blocks, immersed in the respective fixative for 1 h, washed extensively with buffer, and processed for Lowicryl embedding. The issue designated for light microscopy was razor-cut into 3–4-cm2 blocks, immersed in Bouin's fixative overnight, washed several times over 1 day with 70% ethanol, and processed for paraffin embedding. After an extensive wash with 70% ethanol, the tissue blocks were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin by standard procedures. Five-μm sections were deparaffinized, hydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations, and immunostained as previously described (32Oko R. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Processing of tissues for Lowicryl K4M embedding followed a standard protocol used in our laboratory (33Oko R.J. Jando V. Wagner C.L. Kistler W.S. Hermo L.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Lowicryl-embedded ultrathin sections of testes and epididymides were mounted on 200-mesh Formvar-coated nickel grids, transferred, and floated tissue side down on 10–20-μl drops of the following solutions: 10% goat serum in 20 mmTris-HCl-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4), 15 min; anti-KLC3 mAb diluted 1:10 in TBS, 1 h; TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, 5 × 5 min; 10% goat serum in TBS, 15 min; colloidal gold (10 nm)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:20 in TBS, 45 min; TBS containing Tween 20, 3 × 5 min; and distilled H2O, 2 × 5 min. The sections were then counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined by electron microscopy. Controls consisted of replacing the primary antibody (anti-KLC3) step with TBS or mAbs raised against other proteins that were diluted 1:10 in TBS. The KLC3 C-terminal deletion (KLC3ΔC) was created by PCR using forward primer C1478 (5′-CGCTAAGTGGACTGGCTGCAG-3′), reverse primer C1174 (5′-GCTGAGGATCTCCTTGTATAGCTCC-3′), and pBS(ATG)KLC3 (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as a template. The deletion mutant was cloned into the pGAD424 vector for use in yeast. Wild-type KLC3- and KLC3ΔHR mutant-containing plasmids (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and all ODF1-containing plasmids (29Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Schalles U. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. J. Biol.

Reprod. 1996; 55: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have been described previously. ODFs were isolated from rat epididymal spermatozoa as described by Oko (35Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Vectors containing KHC, KLC3, and the KLC3ΔHR deletion mutant have been described previously (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To analyze binding of KLC3 protein to purified ODFs, KLC3, KLC3ΔHR, KLC3Δzip, or KHC was transcribedin vitro and translated in the presence of [35S]cysteine using the TnT reticulocyte transcription and translation system (Promega). Radiolabeled proteins were incubated with purified ODFs at 30 °C for 15 min. ODFs were pelleted at 30,000 rpm for 15 min at 22 °C. Supernatants were saved for SDS-PAGE analysis. Two subsequent washing/pelleting reactions were performed. Aliquots of both supernatants and pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and exposed to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To identify proteins present in purified ODFs or the FS that may bind KLC3, a modified Western blot binding assay was carried out. Proteins from fractionated male germ cells obtained by centrifugal elutriation (36Higgy N.A. Pastoor T. Renz C. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Higgy N.A. Zackson S.L. van der Hoorn F.A. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or from ODFs and the FS were separated on 10–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to NitroPlus membranes. Membranes were blocked and washed as described above and were then incubated in Western blot binding buffer (30Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm ATP and 1000 cpm/ml35S-labeled KLC3 protein, produced by in vitrotranslation, for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times and exposed to Biomax film. The use and construction of yeast two-hybrid plasmids, cDNA expression vectors based on pGAD (containing the GAL4 activating domain) and pGBT9 (containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain), and cell lines have been described previously (29Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Schalles U. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6105-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The interaction between KLC3 and ODF1, ODF2, and mutants was analyzed in yeast as described above. Colonies that grew on His− plates were tested for β-galactosidase expression on membranes as described previously (29Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Schalles U. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6105-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Extracts prepared from purified ODFs were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Specific proteins on blots were analyzed by incubation with antisera to ODF1, β-tubulin (Sigma), KHC (Chemicon International, Inc.), and KLC3, followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate system; Kirkegaard & Perrie Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). We recently cloned and characterized a novel gene, klc3, which has the distinguishing structural and functional features of KLC proteins (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that spermatids express only KLC3, not the other known light chains KLC1 and KLC2. This suggested that KLC3 might carry out roles specific to the process of spermiogenesis in addition to a general function in transport. To approach this possibility, we generated affinity-purified polyclonal anti-KLC3 antibodies as well as monoclonal anti-KLC3 antibodies (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), both of which specifically recognized the 58-kDa KLC3 protein, as shown in Fig.1; polyclonal and monoclonal anti-KLC3 antibodies recognized KLC3 in elutriated elongating spermatids (lanes 1 and 4, respectively) as well as in epididymal sperm (lanes 3 and 5, respectively). No protein was observed in early spermatocytes (lane 2) or liver (lane 6), which does not produce klc3mRNA (20Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These antibodies were next used in immunocytochemistry of rat testis. Surprisingly, the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies displayed overlapping but distinct KLC3 expression patterns during spermiogenesis at the light microscopic level (as shown in Figs.2 and 3). The results of these studies are summarized in Fig. 4. Note that rat spermiogenesis is divided in 19 distinguishable steps of development.Figure 2Immunocytochemistry using polyclonal anti-KLC3 antibodies. Rat testicular sections were prepared, and KLC3 was visualized using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-KLC3 antibodies. Sections were counterstained with methylene blue. The Roman numerals refer to the stage of the cycle of the rat seminiferous epithelium of individual cross-sections. Note that KLC3 localized to the cell body of round spermatids at early stages of spermiogenesis and to the forming sperm tail at later stages.Arrows indicate lightly stained tails, andarrowheads indicate prominently stained tails. In some stages, KLC3 was also expressed in Sertoli cells in a pattern of streamers.

Rat testicular sections were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1, except using anti-KLC3 mAb B11. Immunostaining was first observed in the cytoplasm of step 14 spermatids at stage XIV (A) and peaked in step 15–16 spermatids at stages I–III (B). KLC3 immunostaining could be observed in the midpieces of step 18–19 spermatids in cross-sections (C, inset) and in longitudinal sections (D, inset). Scale bars = 40 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4KLC3 expression during spermiogenesis.Shown are schematic representations of timing (upper panel) and pattern of KLC3 expression (lower panel) in spermatids during spermiogenesis. Shown are spermatids at different developmental stages ranging from steps 1 to 19 (mature); levels and localization of KLC3 as detected by mAbs are indicated in shades of gray. KLC3 is first detected in step 12 spermatids. KLC3 protein accumulates in the midpiece at later stages. The midpiece (m) and head (h) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 shows the results of immunocytochemistry using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and illustrates that KLC3 protein expression was first detectable in step 8 round spermatids (stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelium) (middle and lower panels). KLC3 immunostaining appeared to peak in the cytoplasm of elongating spermatids at stages XIV-I, thereafter gradually diminishing from this region (steps 16–19, stages II–VIII), but at the same time becoming prominent in the tails of maturing elongated spermatids. Note that, initially, KLC3 staining in the tail was light (arrows), but later became very dense (arrowheads) along the entire tail. This suggests that KLC3 associates with structures that run the length of the tail,viz. the axoneme and/or ODFs. Fig.3 shows the results of immunocytochemical analyses using mAb B11. KLC3 labeling was first detectable in step 14 spermatids (Fig. 3 A). Cytoplasmic staining became prominent from step 15 spermatids onwards and at later steps became concentrated in the midpiece area of elongated sperm tails (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 C (and inset) shows cross-sections of midpieces, and Fig. 3 D (and inset) shows longitudinal midpiece sections, both exposures revealing a strong KLC immunoreactivity in mature spermatids to be exfoliated. This result indicates that KLC3 proteins detected by the mAb are present in association with structures present in the sperm tail midpiece (e.g. the ODFs and/or mitochondrial sheath), but not the axoneme or FS. The upper panel of Fig.4 summarizes the period of spermatid development showing KLC3 staining as detected by the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies; the lower panel indicates schematically KLC3 staining in the cytoplasm and tail structures observed using the mAb. Because KLC3 immunoreactivity appeared concentrated in the midpieces of elongated spermatids, we used the mAb in a more precise ultrastructural analysis of KLC3 localization in spermatid tails. The results shown in Fig.5 reveal a novel association pattern for KLC3 in mature step 19 elongated spermatids. Fig. 5 (A andB) shows cross-sections, and Fig. 5 C shows a longitudinal section through rat sperm. The mAb detected KLC3 predominantly in association with the surface of ODFs, but not with the axoneme, confirming the light microscopic observations with this antibody. The KLC3 immunogold label was observed between adjacent ODFs and between ODFs and surrounding mitochondria (examples are shown in Fig. 5 D). Quantitation of gold label in all micrographs indicated that labeling was not significant outside of this designated region, including sites within the ODFs, FS, or axoneme. In mature sperm, microtubules have not been shown to be present between adjacent ODFs or between mitochondria and ODFs (38Hermo L. Oko R. Hecht N.B. Anat. Rec. 1991; 229: 31-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we conclude that mAb B11 detects KLC3 proteins that display a novel subcellular localization in elongating spermatids, and we proceeded to explore the possibility of a binding association of KLC3 with the macromolecular ODF structure. An in vitro ODF binding assay was developed to study the molecular basis of the novel KLC3-ODF association observed in elongating spermatids. In preparation, ODFs were isolated and purified from mature rat epididymal spermatozoa using gradient centrifugations as described (35Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Purified ODFs were examined by Western blot analysis to confirm that they were completely devoid of endogenous β-tubulin and KHC, which would have complicated the binding assay interpretations, and we tested them for the presence of KLC3. Fig. 6 shows that purified ODFs did not contain detectable β-tubulin or KHC, indicating that the ODF preparations were not contaminated with axonemal components. In addition, we did not detect KLC3 in purified ODF preparations, indicating that, as suggested by the immunoelectron microscopic data, KLC3 is an ODF-associated protein rather than an integral ODF protein and is lost in the ODF isolation procedures. Controls for all three proteins were positive. Brain expressed KHC; microtubule preparations contained β-tubulin; and testis expressed KLC3, as expected. Next, in vitro translated 35S-radiolabeled KLC3 was added to purified ODFs in the presence of 0.5% Sarkosyl. After binding, ODFs were pelleted through a sucrose cushion, washed and repelleted several times, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results show that wild-type KLC3 (58 kDa) could bind to purified ODFs in the absence of detectable KHC or microtubules (Fig.7, compare lanes 1 and5), as evidenced by its presence in ODF pellets. To analyze the specificity of this assay, we next tested binding of an unrelated protein (p21 ras ) to purified ODFs. The Ras oncoprotein failed to bind (compare lanes 4 and 8). To further address specificity, we mixed in vitro translated radiolabeled KLC3 and KHC proteins and subjected them to ODFs; in co"
https://openalex.org/W2167481913,"Podocyte injury is a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of proteinuria. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been suggested to protect podocytes from cellular injury. Here we investigated whether PGE2-induced gene expression accounts for the protective role of PGE2 in podocytes. Using a suppressive-subtractive hybridization method, we isolated a differentially expressed clone that was identified as Stra13, a recently described retinoic acid-inducible gene. PGE2, forskolin, and retinoic acid induced a time-dependent up-regulation of Stra13 mRNA and protein expression in podocytes. To test the function of Stra13 in podocytes, Stra13 was overexpressed by using retroviral gene transfer. Compared with control cells, cells overexpressing Stra13 showed markedly reduced NADPH-dependent superoxid anion generation. Furthermore, expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) was increased in podocytes overexpressing Stra13. HO-1 plays an important protective role in the defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). After stimulation with exogenous ROS, Stra13-overexpressing podocytes were more resistant to oxidative stress than were control cells. Our data indicate that Stra13 may play an important protective role against oxidative stress in podocytes. ROS are involved in the pathogenesis of glomerular inflammation in several forms of glomerulonephritis. Therefore, knowledge about protective mechanisms may provide insight into new therapeutic strategies for glomerulopathies."
https://openalex.org/W1976383166,"Internalization of the insulin receptor (IR) is a highly regulated multi-step process whose underlying molecular basis is not fully understood. Here we undertook to study the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the modulation of IR internalization. Employing Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress IR (CHO-T cells), our results indicate that IR internalization proceeds unaffected even when Tyr phosphorylation of IR substrates, such as IRS-1, is impaired (e.g. in CHO-T cells overexpressing IRS-1 whose pleckstrin-homology domain has been deleted or in CHO-T cells that overexpress the PH/PTB domain of IRS-1). In contrast, IR internalization is affected by the context of the ECM proteins to which the cells adhere. Hence, IR internalization was inhibited 40–60% in CHO-T cells adherent onto galectin-8 (an ECM protein and an integrin ligand of the galectin family) when compared with cells adherent onto fibronectin, collagen, or laminin. Cells adherent to galectin-8 manifested a unique cytoskeletal organization, which involved formation of cortical actin and generation of F-actin microspikes that contrasted with the prominent stress-fibers formed when cells adhered to fibronectin. To better establish a role for actin filament organization in IR endocytosis, this process was assayed in CHO-T cells (adherent onto fibronectin), whose actin filaments were disrupted upon treatment with latrunculin B. Latrunculin B did not affect insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IR or its ability to phosphorylate its substrates; still, a 30–50% reduction in the rate of IR internalization was observed in cells treated with latrunculin B. Treatment of cells with nocodazole, which disrupts formation of microtubules, did not affect IR internalization. These results indicate that proper actin, but not microtubular, organization is a critical requirement for IR internalization and suggest that integrin-mediated signaling pathways emitted upon cell adhesion to different extracellular matrices and the altered cytoskeletal organizations generated thereof affect the itinerary of the insulin receptor. Internalization of the insulin receptor (IR) is a highly regulated multi-step process whose underlying molecular basis is not fully understood. Here we undertook to study the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the modulation of IR internalization. Employing Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress IR (CHO-T cells), our results indicate that IR internalization proceeds unaffected even when Tyr phosphorylation of IR substrates, such as IRS-1, is impaired (e.g. in CHO-T cells overexpressing IRS-1 whose pleckstrin-homology domain has been deleted or in CHO-T cells that overexpress the PH/PTB domain of IRS-1). In contrast, IR internalization is affected by the context of the ECM proteins to which the cells adhere. Hence, IR internalization was inhibited 40–60% in CHO-T cells adherent onto galectin-8 (an ECM protein and an integrin ligand of the galectin family) when compared with cells adherent onto fibronectin, collagen, or laminin. Cells adherent to galectin-8 manifested a unique cytoskeletal organization, which involved formation of cortical actin and generation of F-actin microspikes that contrasted with the prominent stress-fibers formed when cells adhered to fibronectin. To better establish a role for actin filament organization in IR endocytosis, this process was assayed in CHO-T cells (adherent onto fibronectin), whose actin filaments were disrupted upon treatment with latrunculin B. Latrunculin B did not affect insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IR or its ability to phosphorylate its substrates; still, a 30–50% reduction in the rate of IR internalization was observed in cells treated with latrunculin B. Treatment of cells with nocodazole, which disrupts formation of microtubules, did not affect IR internalization. These results indicate that proper actin, but not microtubular, organization is a critical requirement for IR internalization and suggest that integrin-mediated signaling pathways emitted upon cell adhesion to different extracellular matrices and the altered cytoskeletal organizations generated thereof affect the itinerary of the insulin receptor. insulin receptor IR kinase IR substrate pleckstrin homology phosphotyrosine binding extracellular matrix protein tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells stably overexpressing IR CHO cells stably overexpressing IR and IRS-1ΔPH CHO cells stably expressing IR and wild-type IRS-1 sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein tyrosine phosphatase Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) rapidly internalize following ligand binding. Internalized receptors are then sorted to distinct subcellular pathways that lead either to degradation or recycling to the cell surface (1Bergeron J.J. Di-Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Authier F.

Similarly, internalization of the insulin receptor is a multi-step process (4Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 733: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).

The internalized receptor undergoes sorting, which determines whether it will be subjected to degradation in lysosomes or whether it will recycle back to the plane of the membrane (7Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Backer A. Gilbert L. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar). Stimulation of the intrinsic Tyr kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR)1following insulin binding is a prerequisite for surface redistribution of receptor-insulin complexes; accordingly, mutations of IR that abolish its kinase activity or mutations that replace amino acids that constitute putative “internalization signal” motifs inhibit IR internalization (8McClain D.A.

The need for IR kinase (IRK) activity to promote receptor internalization raises the question of whether IR substrates regulate this process. Several proteins were identified as potential IR substrates. Most studied are the Shc proteins, Gab-1, Cbl, and the family of insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 to IRS-4) (reviewed in Refs. 14Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar and 15LeRoith D. Zick Y. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). IRS proteins share a highly conserved amino terminus, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that serves to bind phosphoinositide lipids and localize the IRS proteins to cellular membranes. A phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain flanks the PH domain and binds IRS proteins to the NPEY motif within the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of the insulin receptor (15LeRoith D. Zick Y. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of IRS proteins contains several Tyr residues that, upon phosphorylation, act as docking sites for the downstream effectors that mediate the metabolic and growth-promoting functions of insulin (14Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 15LeRoith D. Zick Y. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Agents and conditions that modulate cell adhesion also regulate insulin receptor internalization. For example, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) serves as an IR substrate and up-regulates receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis (16Najjar S.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 240-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Still, the interplay between receptor endocytosis and cell adhesion is poorly understood. In the present study we undertook to address this question and investigated the effects of insulin receptor substrates and extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) on IR endocytosis. Our results indicate that, although IR internalization proceeds unaffected even when Tyr phosphorylation of IRS proteins is impaired, this process depends upon the context of ECM proteins to which the cells adhere. Hence, signaling pathways emitted upon cell adhesion to different matrices and the altered cytoskeletal organizations generated thereof affect the itinerary of the insulin receptor. Recombinant human insulin was a gift from Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, poly-l-lysine, fibronectin, laminin,l-histidinol, puromycin, and TRITC-labeled phalloidin were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal PY-20, annexin II, and polyclonal IR β-subunit antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal IR antibodies (α subunit) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. LipofectAMINE was obtained from Invitrogen. The polyclonal IRS-1 antibody was prepared as described (17Hadari Y.R.

Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and immobilized NeutrAvidin were purchased from Pierce. Recombinant galectin-8 was generated as described (18Hadari Y.R. Paz K. Dekel R. Mestrovic T. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3447-3453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CHO cells that overexpress IR (CHO-T cells) and CHO-T cells that co-express either wild-type mouse IRS-1 or IRS-1 whose PH domain has been deleted were generated as we described previously (19Voliovitch H. Schindler D. Hadari Y.R. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18083-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To generate CHO-T cells that co-express the Myc-tagged PH-PTB domain of wild-type IRS-1, the sequence encoding Myc-PH-PTB was amplified by PCR using the pcDNAIII-Myc-tagged IRS-1 (20Paz K. Yan-Fang L. Shorer H. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Quon M. Kanety H. Seger R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28816-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) as a template. The 5′ primer (5′-AAGCTTAAGATATCGATCATATG-3′) was located at nucleotide −56. The 3′ primer (5′-TTAGTTGAGTGGGGGGTGCAGCCT-3′) was located at nucleotide 1095 of the mouse IRS-1 gene. The PCR product was ligated into a pGEM-T plasmid (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Myc-tagged PH-PTB construct was excised from pGEM-T with EcoRV and NotI, gel-purified, and ligated into pcDNAIII/Amp (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNAIII-Myc-PH-PTB. CHO-T cells were co-transfected with pBabe-Puromycin and the pcDNAIII-Myc-PH-PTB plasmid (at a 1:10 ratio) using LipofectAMINE as described previously (20Paz K. Yan-Fang L. Shorer H. Hemi R.

Following transfection, cells were incubated in non-selective medium and, 48 h thereafter, puromycin (10 μg/ml) was added for selection of stable colonies. Puromycin-resistant clones that overexpressed Myc-PH-PTB were isolated and further propagated. Cells were solubilized at 4 °C in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture, 1:1000, pH 7.4). Cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Aliquots (0.5–1.0 mg) were incubated for 2 h with polyclonal IRS-1 antibodies coupled to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with buffer A and twice with PBS. Immunocomplexes were resolved by means of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Six-centimeter plates were precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml), galectin-8 (25 μg/ml), laminin (10 μg/ml), or collagen (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 25 °C. CHO-T cells, grown on tissue culture plates, were detached from the plates with 5 mm EDTA and seeded in serum-free medium on the plates coated with the different ECM proteins. Cells were allowed to adhere for 6 h at 37 °C and then subjected to further treatments as indicated. Cells were incubated with125I-insulin (10−10m) for 16 h at 4 °C in buffer B (serum-free F-12 medium, 50 mmHepes, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade), pH 7.5). The cells were washed 3× with PBS, buffer B was re-added, and the cells were transferred to 37 °C for the indicated times. Thereafter, cells were washed 2× with buffer B (titrated to pH 4.0). Following acid wash, the cells were solubilized in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS, and the amount of intracellular125I was counted in a gamma counter. CHO-T cells were allowed to adhere to plates coated with different ECM proteins as described above. Thereafter, the cells were cooled to 4 °C and labeled for 45 min with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in buffer D (0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 in PBS). The labeled cells were washed 3× with buffer E (0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm glycine in PBS, pH 7.4) and then further incubated with the indicated concentrations of insulin (in buffer B) at 15 °C for 3 h to allow for insulin binding. To initiate receptor internalization, the cells were transferred to 37 °C for 20 min and back to 4 °C to stop the internalization process. To remove any remaining cell-surface receptor, the cells were subjected to trypsinization (30 min at 4 °C) with 1 mg/ml trypsin in buffer F (serum-free F12 medium, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) followed by washing with buffer G (serum-free F-12 medium containing 10 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5). Cells extracts were prepared in buffer C (50 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor, 1:1000, pH 7.4) and biotin labeled-proteins were precipitated with immobilized NeutrAvidin for 2h at 4 °C while shaking. The beads were washed 2× with buffer C and 2× with PBS and then boiled in 60μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by means of 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with IR antibody (α subunit). CHO-T cells were allowed to adhere for 6 h at 37 °C to cover glasses precoated with the indicated ECM proteins. Cells were washed and fixed for 30 min with paraformaldehyde-Triton X-100 (3:0.5%). Following fixation, the cells were stained with TRITC-phalloidin, and actin organization was assessed under a fluorescence microscope. Internalization of the insulin receptor is a multi-step process requiring an active insulin receptor kinase. However, the involvement of IR substrates in this process remains unclear. To assess the role of IRS-1 in mediating IR internalization, we made use of IRS-1, whose PH domain has been deleted (IRS-1ΔPH). We have shown previously that such deletion impairs the ability of IRS-1 to properly juxtapose to the insulin receptor, making it a poor substrate for the IRK (19Voliovitch H. Schindler D. Hadari Y.R. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18083-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 A, insulin-induced Tyr-phosphorylation of IRS-1 was decreased ∼60% in CHO cells stably overexpressing the insulin receptor and IRS-1ΔPH (CHO-TD) when compared with CHO cells expressing the insulin receptor and wild-type IRS-1 (CHO-TS). This occurred despite the fact that the cellular content of IRS-1ΔPH was higher than that of wild-type IRS-1. Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1ΔPH was lower by about 30% even when compared with the phosphorylation of the endogenous IRS-1 protein in CHO-T cells stably overexpressing just the insulin receptor. Still, as shown in Fig. 1 B, insulin internalization, which represents IR internalization, preceded at comparable rates in CHO-TS and CHO-TD cells, indicating that insulin receptor internalization occurs independent of IRS-1 phosphorylation. IRS proteins contain at their N terminus a PH domain flanked by a PTB domain. To generate dominant negative inhibitors to IRS-1, a construct encoding the (Myc tagged) PH-PTB region was introduced into CHO-T cells. As shown in Fig.2, insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IRS was decreased by ∼45% in cells stably overexpressing the PH-PTB domains, but IR internalization (assayed by insulin internalization) was not altered upon expression of this construct. Hence, the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 support the notion that insulin receptor internalization occurs, by and large, independent of IRS-1 phosphorylation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the residual Tyr-phosphorylated IRS-1 could affect IR internalization. Agents and conditions that modulate cell adhesion were shown to affect insulin receptor signaling. For example, activation of α5β1 integrins upon adherence of CHO-T cells onto fibronectin markedly potentiates the Tyr phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 (21Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Conversely, when adherent cells are maintained in suspension, the extent of insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation is largely diminished (21Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether ECM proteins could regulate insulin receptor internalization, we made use of ECM proteins having different characteristics. In general, two kinds of ECM proteins were utilized, i.e. those that interact with integrins through protein-protein interactions, represented by fibronectin, and those that interact with integrins through protein-sugar interactions, represented by the mammalian lectin galectin-8, a β-galactoside-binding protein (22Hadari Y.R. Goren R. Levy Y. Amsterdam A. Alon R. Zakut R. Zick Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Levy Y. Arbel-Goren R. Hadari Y.R. Ronen D. Bar-Peled O. Elhanany E. Geiger B. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31285-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, cells adherent onto fibronectin, laminin, and collagen showed a similar extent of IR internalization. However, IR internalization was inhibited ∼65% in cells adherent onto galectin-8. These results indicate that extracellular matrix proteins modulate insulin receptor internalization. They further suggest that ligation of integrins via protein-protein interactions better supports IR endocytosis. To determine whether the reduced internalization of cells adherent onto galectin-8 reflects impairments in IRK activity, insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of IR and IRS proteins was assayed using CHO-T cells grown on different matrixes. As shown in Fig. 4 (top), maximal insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IR, assayed at 100 nm insulin, was decreased in cells adherent to galectin-8 when compared with cells adherent to fibronectin laminin or poly-l-lysine. The decrease in Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1 was much less severe. To determine whether the reduced autophosphorylation of IR could account for its impaired internalization, we established conditions in which insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 were comparable in cells grown on either matrix. As shown in Fig. 4 (bottom), this could be achieved when cells grown on fibronectin or galectin-8 were stimulated for 3 min with 3 and 100 nm insulin, respectively. Pretreatment of cells grown on galectin-8 but not on fibronectin with vanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, also resulted in comparable levels of Tyr phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 (not shown). IR internalization was then re-examined under conditions in which insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IR and IRS were comparable. As shown Fig. 5, IR internalization, assayed following its biotinylation, was still severely impaired in cells adherent to galectin-8 even though the insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylations of IR and IRS-1 were comparable. Defects in IR internalization were evident whether the internalization of IR itself (Fig. 5) or 125I-insulin (Fig.6) was monitored. These results indicate that inhibition of IR internalization, which occurs upon cell adhesion to galectin-8, cannot be attributed solely to differences in insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1. Cell adhesion to galectin-8 did not inhibit only the ligand-stimulated internalization of IR but also impaired its basal internalization rate. As shown in Fig. 7, the basal (ligand-independent) rate of IR internalization was inhibited ∼30% in cells adherent to galectin-8, indicating that cell adhesion to galectin-8 also affects the steady-state surface expression of insulin receptors even in the absence of a ligand.Figure 6Effect of vanadate on insulin internalization in cells adherent to galectin-8. Six-centimeter plates were precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or galectin-8 (25 μg/ml), and CHO-T cells in serum-free medium were seeded on the precoated plates. The cells were incubated with 125I-insulin (10−10m) for 16 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, as indicated. 125I-insulin internalization was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are mean ± S.D. of duplicates measurementsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Effects of cell adhesion molecules on basal- and insulin-induced IR internalization.

Prominent stress fibers that traverse the cell body are readily detected in cells adherent onto fibronectin but are less abundant in cells adherent to galectin-8 (Fig.8). Instead, the formation of cortical actin (23Levy Y. Arbel-Goren R. Hadari Y.R. Ronen D. Bar-Peled O. Elhanany E. Geiger B. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31285-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the generation of an F-actin microspike (24Levy Y. Ronen D. Bershadsky A.D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 4, 10.1074/jbc.M207380200)Google Scholar) characterize adhesion to galectin-8. Second, although vinculin and paxillin are associated with large focal contacts in cells adherent to fibronectin, the number and size of vinculin-and paxillin-containing focal contacts is reduced in cells attached to galectin-8 (23Levy Y. Arbel-Goren R. Hadari Y.R. Ronen D. Bar-Peled O. Elhanany E. Geiger B. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31285-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The differences in actin-microfilament organization are not accompanied by differences in microtubules organization, and a similar microtubular network develops when cell adhere to galectin-8 or fibronectin (24Levy Y. Ronen D. Bershadsky A.D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 4, 10.1074/jbc.M207380200)Google Scholar). To establish a role for actin filaments in IR endocytosis, insulin-induced IR internalization was assayed in CHO-T cells (adherent onto fibronectin) whose actin filaments were disrupted upon treatment with latrunculin B, a drug that sequesters actin monomers. Latrunculin B did not affect insulin-induced Tyr-phosphorylation of IR or the ability of IRK to phosphorylate its substrates IRS-1 and annexin II (Fig. 9 A). Accordingly, Latrunculin B did not impair activation of downstream effectors of IR such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (not shown). Still a 30–50% reduction in the rate of IR internalization was observed in cells treated with latrunculin B (Fig. 9 B). These results indicate that proper actin organization is a critical requirement for IR internalization. Next, we wished to determine whether disruption of microtubule filaments, which inhibit insulin-induced GLUT-4 translocation (25Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), affects IR internalization. CHO-T cells adherent onto fibronectin were treated with nocodazole, and IR internalization was measured. As shown in Fig. 9 C, there was no prominent change in IR internalization in cells treated with nocodazole when compared with control. However, we could demonstrate a ∼25% reduction in insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1 in cells treated with nocodazole (Fig. 9 D). These results indicate that microtubule integrity is not required for insulin-stimulated IR internalization despite its importance for insulin-induced GLUT-4 translocation. The present study provides evidence that the cellular environment into which the cells adhere directly affects insulin signaling and insulin responsiveness. In particular, we show that the interaction of different ECM proteins with cell surface integrins results in a different cytoskeletal organization that affects the rate of endocytosis of the insulin receptor. The effects of the ECM proteins on receptor internalization are independent of their effects on IRK activity and its ability to phosphorylate downstream effectors such as the IRS proteins. Hence, insulin signaling and insulin responsiveness are dually regulated by the adhesive properties of the cells. On one hand, ligation of ECM proteins by cell surface receptors such as integrins generates signaling cascades that modulate the activity of the insulin receptor kinase, whereas, on the other hand, the alterations in cytoskeletal organization that take place upon cell adhesion dictate the rate and extent of internalization of the insulin receptor. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, we could show that insulin receptor internalization occurs independent of its ability to phosphorylate the IRS proteins that play a central role in insulin signaling (15LeRoith D. Zick Y. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 26Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Impairment of IRS-1 signaling either by the introduction of IRS-1 whose PH domain has been deleted, making it a poor substrate for IRK, or overexpression of the isolated PH/PTB domain of IRS-1, which acts as a partial dominant negative inhibitor of endogenous IRS-1, did not affect the rate and extent of IR endocytosis. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the residual Tyr-phosphorylated IRS-1 is necessary to promote IR internalization, our findings strongly suggest that downstream effectors of IRS proteins such as PI3K have little role in mediating early steps of insulin receptor endocytosis. These results are consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated that inhibitors of PI3K do not impair insulin receptor internalization (27Biener Y. Feinstein R. Mayak M. Kaburagi Y.

PI3K has been implicated in the divergence of PDGF receptors into a degradative pathway without affecting the initial steps of PDGF receptor endocytosis (29Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2053682232,"Molecular recognition of the importin β-binding (IBB) domain of importin α by importin β is critical for the nuclear import of protein cargoes containing a classical nuclear localization signal. We have studied the function of four conserved tryptophans of importin β (Trp-342, Trp-430, Trp-472, and Trp-864) located at the binding interface with the IBB domain by systematic alanine substitution mutagenesis. We found that Trp-864 is a mutational hot spot that significantly affects IBB-binding and import activity, whereas residues Trp-342, Trp-430, and Trp-472 are mutationally silent when analyzed individually. Interestingly, the combination of the hot spot at residue Trp-864 with mutations in the other three tryptophans gives rise to a striking synergy that diminishes IBB domain binding by up to ∼1000-fold and, in turn, abolishes import activity. We propose that importin β uses the tryptophans to select and stabilize a helical conformation of the IBB domain, which, in turn, conveys specific, high affinity binding.

We found that Trp-864 is a mutational hot spot that significantly affects IBB-binding and import activity, whereas residues Trp-342, Trp-430, and Trp-472 are mutationally silent when analyzed individually. Interestingly, the combination of the hot spot at residue Trp-864 with mutations in the other three tryptophans gives rise to a striking synergy that diminishes IBB domain binding by up to ∼1000-fold and, in turn, abolishes import activity. We propose that importin β uses the tryptophans to select and stabilize a helical conformation of the IBB domain, which, in turn, conveys specific, high affinity binding. nuclear localization signal classical nuclear localization signal parathyroid hormone-related protein importin β binding nuclear pore complex glutathione S-transferase bovine serum albumin Importin β (also known as karyopherin β-1) represents the prototype of the importin β-superfamily of nuclear transport receptors (1Macara I.G.

The interaction of importin β with import cargoes involves recognition of the nuclear localization signal (NLS),1 either directly, as in the case of cargoes like parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (4Cingolani G.

Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The IBB domain represents the minimal structural region of importin α that binds to importin β with high affinity and can itself serve as a functional NLS (1Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 2Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 3Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). For example, large cargoes such as β-galactosidase fused to the IBB domain are specifically imported into the nucleus of permeabilized cells by importin β (6Nachury M.V. Weis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9622-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Lyman S.K. Guan T. Bednenko J. Wodrich H. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Translocation of the import complex through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) involves multiple rounds of interaction of importin β with nucleoporins (8Stewart M. Baker R.P. Bayliss R. Clayton L. Grant R.P. Littlewood T. Matsuura Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An essential cofactor is the small GTPase Ran, which, in its GTP-bound form, dissociates importin β from nucleoporins and from the adaptor·cargo complex (1Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 2Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 3Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of importin β complexed with the IBB domain of importin α (residues 11–54) was solved by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.3Å (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Importin β contains a modular structure built of 19 tandem HEAT repeats arranged to form a superhelix. Each HEAT repeat represents a secondary structure motif formed by two helices connected by a loop. The HEAT repeat array contains two structurally and functionally distinct surfaces. The convex outer surface has nucleoporin-binding sites (10Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and the concave internal face binds Ran (HEAT repeats 1–8) (11Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and cargoes. Whereas the IBB domain binds mostly to the C terminus of importin β (HEAT repeats 7–19) (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), PTHrP interacts with the N-terminal HEAT repeats 2–11 in a region of the protein that overlaps with the Ran-binding domain (4Cingolani G. Bednenko J. Gillespie M.T. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As seen in the crystal structure of importin β complexed with the IBB domain of importin α, residues 22–51 of the IBB domain form a straight helix, whereas the N-terminal moiety (residues 11–21) adopts a more extended conformation, interrupted between residues 13–15 by a 310 helix. The importin β·IBB domain-binding interface involves an extended network of interactions, which accounts for over 40 specific bonds including electrostatic, hydrophobic, and Van der Waals contacts (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Likewise, the binding cavity of importin β is highly enriched in acidic residues and affords an ideal environment for the folding of a basic peptide. This has led to the idea that importin β may serve both as an import receptor and a chaperone to keep small basic proteins from aggregating (12Jakel S. Mingot J.M. Schwarzmaier P. Hartmann E. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Using the three-dimensional structure of the importin β·IBB domain complex as a guide, we have analyzed the molecular basis for the recognition of the IBB domain of importin α. Through systematic alanine substitution mutagenesis, we have targeted four tryptophans of importin β located at the binding interface. We have identified a single tryptophan that is essential for efficient binding to the IBB domain and severely diminishes the binding affinity after mutation to alanine. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this hot spot can synergize with mutations in other tryptophans at the binding interface, which only marginally affect the interaction when analyzed alone. Based on these data, we propose a model for recognition of the IBB domain by importin β that involves the selection of a population of distinct helical IBB conformers by the receptor. The crystal structure of the importin β·IBB domain complex (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1QGK) was extensively analyzed using the program O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). All ribbon and sticks-and-ball models were produced using the Bobscript (14Esnouf R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 938-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (15Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar) programs. All mutants were derived from a full-length His-S-tagged importin β plasmid (16Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and recloned in pTYB4 vector (New England Biolabs). This plasmid was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), as directed by the manufacturer. Wild type and Trp → Ala importin β mutants were expressed in the Escherichia coli ER1003 strain, and purification was performed on chitin beads followed by gel filtration on a Superose-12 column (Amersham Biosciences). After purification, all Trp → Ala mutants and wild type importin β were extensively dialyzed against transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and subsequently concentrated to ∼25 mg ml−1 using a Millipore concentrator (molecular mass cutoff, 10 kDa). Recombinant importin α, RanQ69L, NTF2, RanBP1, and GST·IBB were expressed and purified as described previously (7Lyman S.K. Guan T. Bednenko J. Wodrich H. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Solid phase binding assays were carried out on microtiter plates (Maxisorp) coated with 100 ng of recombinant GST·IBB domain (residues 1–60). Assays were conducted as described (4Cingolani G. Bednenko J. Gillespie M.T. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and binding data were analyzed with Prism 3.0 software. All curves were fitted using non-linear regression, and the apparent dissociation constant was calculated using the GraphPad Prism program. The nuclear import assay was carried out in NRK cells permeabilized with digitonin and subsequently incubated with 10 μg/ml RanQ69L and 10 μg/ml RanBP1 for 15 min at 30 °C to deplete them of endogenous importin β (18Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Melchior F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 265-273PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then preincubated on ice with importin β mutants or with an equivalent volume of transport buffer, and nuclear import was carried out and quantified by flow cytometry as described (19Melchior F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 265-273PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection experiments in NRK cells were carried out as described previously (20Frosst P. Guan T. Subauste C. Hahn K. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Microinjected cells were fixed after 1, 5, 30, or 60 min in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The localization of the various injected importin β constructs was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a polyclonal goat anti-S antibody (Amersham Biosciences). One of the intriguing features of the importin β·IΒΒ-binding interface is the presence of four conserved tryptophans in importin β, Trp-342, Trp-430, Trp-472, and Trp-864 (Fig. 1 a), which are located in close proximity (3.8–4.2 Å) to four highly conserved IBB residues (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), namely Lys-18/22 (Fig. 1, b and c) and Arg-13/51 (Fig. 1, d and e). Whereas the indole rings of Trp-430, Trp-472, and Trp-864 point directly toward the ε-amino-terminal groups of IBB-Lys18/22 and the guanidinum group of IBB-Arg-51, respectively, W342 is oriented more toward the backbone of IBB-Arg-13. The extended conformation adopted by IBB-residues Lys-18/22 and Arg-13/51 exposes the polar guanidinium and ε-amino-terminal groups to engage in bidentate and monodentate interactions with at least other six residues of importin β and four residues from the IBB domain (Fig. 1, b–e). To understand the importance of the four conserved tryptophans in the recognition of the IBB domain, we generated libraries of importin β point mutants (Table I) in which each tryptophan was replaced by an alanine, a residue that is compatible with α-helical folding. A first generation library consisted of the four Trp → Ala single point mutants. Additional tryptophans in these single point mutants were then mutated to produce six double and four triple Trp → Ala mutants, representing the second and third generation mutant libraries, respectively. In total, fourteen Trp → Ala importin β mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Similar to wild type importin β, all the Trp → Ala mutants displayed high solubility under physiological salt conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) and were eluted as a monomer by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). In addition, circular dichroism analysis revealed that the Trp → Ala mutations did not alter the secondary structure content of the mutants (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the point mutations did not disrupt the overall folding of importin β.Table IBinding of wild type and Trp → Ala importin β mutant to the IBB domainImportin β mutantIBB-domain1-aK d apparent (± S.D.).

Data derived from plots of Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab We used a solid phase binding assay to study the effect of the Trp → Ala mutations on the interaction of importin β with the IBB domain of importin α. The IBB domain fused to GST was adsorbed to microtiter plates, and the binding of either wild type importin β or the Trp → Ala mutants was analyzed in a concentration range of 0.01–100 nm (Fig. 2,a–c). For wild type importin β we reproducibly measured an apparent dissociation constant (K d ) for the IBB domain of about 1 nm(Fig. 2 a and Table I). Whereas the first generation importin β (Trp → Ala) mutants in residues Trp-342, Trp-430, and Trp-472 did not show a significant decrease in their binding affinity for the IBB domain, the mutation of Trp-864 reduced the dissociation constant for the IBB domain by ∼35-fold (K d = 35.1 nm; Fig. 2 a and Table I). This suggested that Trp-864 is a mutational hot spot (21Clackson T. Well J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Second generation Trp → Ala mutants in which the Trp-864 was not mutated were still able to bind the IBB domain with nearly wild type affinity (Fig. 2 b and Table I). In contrast, all second generation Trp → Ala mutants containing a combination of a single silent mutation (Trp-342, Trp-430, and Trp-472) and the hot spot Trp-864 showed a dramatic decrease in their binding affinity (∼360–450-fold; see Table I). An even more pronounced synergy of silent and hot spot mutations was observed for the third generation Trp → Ala importin β mutants (Fig.2 c). In this case, the only triple mutant that showed sufficiently strong binding to accurately measure aK d in the 0.01–100 nm importin β concentration was the triple mutant W342A/W430A/W472A. We therefore repeated the binding assay using up to a 10-fold higher concentration of importin β (0.01–1 μm range) for both second and third generation mutants (Fig. 2 d). From these measurements the apparent dissociation constant of second and third generation mutants containing the hot spot W864A was reduced to ∼400 and 950 nm, respectively (Table I). However, because the binding isotherms did not reach saturation in these cases, these values should be viewed as approximations. To investigate whether the decreased binding affinity of the importin β mutants for the IBB domain of importin α resulted in a reduced level of nuclear import of cNLS-cargo, we assayed the Trp → Ala mutants in a nuclear import assay involving permeabilized HeLa cells reconstituted with recombinant transport factors (18Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Melchior F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 265-273PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) coupled to a cNLS peptide was used as the cargo for import. In the presence of ATP, wild type importin β stimulated import of BSA-cNLS by ∼4-fold (designated as 100% in Fig. 3) with respect to a control reaction wherein no recombinant importin β was supplied to the cells. Whereas the single point mutants targeting residues Trp-342, Trp-430, and Trp-472 supported nuclear import of BSA-cNLS cargo at nearly wild type levels, the W864A mutant yielded only ∼60% of the level of import (Fig. 3). In contrast, the second generation mutants yielded a significantly lower level of import, which was most pronounced for constructs containing the hot spot W864A mutation. For instance, the import levels with the W342A/W430A and W342A/W472A double mutants were about 50% of wild type importin β, and the levels with double mutants containing the T864A substitution were only ∼25–40% of the wild type (Fig. 3). Finally, the three third generation mutants bearing the hot spot W864A mutation were almost completely inactive in the nuclear import of NLS-BSA, whereas the triple mutant carrying the three weaker mutations (W342A/W430A/W472A) was only 50% reduced in import. We next examined whether the importin β triple mutants that were strongly deficient in supporting the import of cNLS-containing cargoes also were impaired in their ability to translocate through the NPC. Wild type importin β or the triple mutants containing the W864A mutation were microinjected in the cytoplasm of NRK cells, and at various times the cells were fixed and importin β localized by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to the S-epitope tag (Fig.4 a and b). As shown for the triple mutant W342A/W430A/W864A, the injected importin β mutant was strongly concentrated in the nucleus after 1 min (Fig. 4) as well as after longer times (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for the other two triple mutants that were highly deficient in nuclear import (W342A/W472A/W864A and W430A/W472A/W864A, data not shown). In related studies, it has been reported that the C-terminally deleted importin β mutants, which were deficient for binding to the IBB domain, also efficiently accumulated in the nucleus permeabilized HeLa cell in the absence of exogenous transport factors (22Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We conclude that the binding of importin β to the importin α·cNLS-cargo complex and the ability of the receptor to translocate through the NPC are not coupled obligatorily. It is unlikely that the efficient nuclear translocation of the importin β Trp → Ala triple mutants observed in the microinjection experiments occurs as a consequence of their binding to importin α-independent cargoes like the PTHrP (4Cingolani G. Bednenko J. Gillespie M.T. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), because the interaction between the nonclassical-NLS of the PTHrP and importin β critically involves tryptophans Trp-342, Trp-430, and Trp-472 (4Cingolani G. Bednenko J. Gillespie M.T. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis of conserved tryptophans at the importin β·IBB domain-binding interface described above has revealed a key role of the tryptophans in the molecular recognition of the IBB domain. We propose that, at least in the case of residues Trp-430, Trp-472, and Trp-864, the tryptophans engage in cation-π (23Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 24Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) interactions with residues of the IBB domain. The cation-π interaction is a type of long-range, non-covalent intermolecular force between cationic residues and aromatic side chains. The planar ring of the tryptophans provides π electrons, whereas the cationic guanidinum and ε-amino-terminal groups of arginines and lysines, respectively, provide the cationic groups. The importance of cation-π interactions in protein structure is becoming increasingly recognized (23Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 24Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). In contrast to hydrophobic interactions, cation-π contacts are electrostatic interactions between dipoles and are completely abolished by alanine mutagenesis, as alanine lacks the delocalized nucleophilic charge of an aromatic ring. To further investigate our predictions, we used the program CaPTURE (Cation-π Trends Using Realistic Electrostatics) (24Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), which predicts and quantifies cation-π interactions based on ab initiocalculations from three-dimensional structures. Interestingly, CaPTURE predicts that three of the four importin β tryptophans at the binding interface that we studied engage in energetically significant intermolecular cation-π interactions with IBB residues. The energetic contributions were estimated to be approximately −5.41 kcal/mole and −4.61 kcal/mole for the Trp-864·IBB-Arg-51 and Trp-430·IBB-Lys-18 pairs and −2.67 kcal/mole for Trp-472·IBB-Lys-22 pair, respectively (Table II). Moreover, as predicted by visual examination of the three-dimensional structure, the potential energetic contribution due to a cation-π interaction for the Trp-342·IBB-Arg-13 pair was not significant (<2 kcal/mol), as the ring of the tryptophan points more toward the main chain of the IBB-Arg-13 than to the cationic guanidinium group. These values reinforce the concept that Trp-864 is a hot spot mutation but do not explain the synergy of hot and silent point mutations observed in second and third generations (see below).Table IIEnergetic contribution of cation-π interactionsPairContributionkcal/molTrp β-864: Arg α-51∼−5.41Trp β-472: Lys α-22∼−2.67Trp β-430: Lys α-18∼−4.61Trp β-342: Arg α-13>−2.00Values predicted by CaPTURE17.

Specific interactions are assumed to have a calculated energetic contribution of <∼−2 kcal/mol. Based on our reexamination of the structure of the import adaptor importin α (25Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 26Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we note that potential cation-π interactions also are found at the binding interface between importin α and the conserved arginines/lysines of both classical monopartite (25Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and bipartite (26Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar) NLS-peptides. Because both importin α and importin β may have evolved from a common precursor (4Cingolani G. Bednenko J. Gillespie M.T. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Goldfarb D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13738-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is possible that cation-π interactions represent an evolutionary conserved feature of nucleoplasmic transport factors governing NLS recognition. The dynamics of the importin β·IBB domain binding interface cannot be understood without considering the structural plasticity of the ligand, the IBB domain. Previous studies have shown that the IBB domain adopts different conformations in different structural contexts. Whereas it is mostly α-helical when bound to importin β (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), it is essentially unstructured in solution (28Cingolani G. Lashuel H.A. Gerace L. Muller C.W.

Furthermore, a portion of the domain adopts an extended conformation when bound to the cNLS binding groove of importin α, suggesting an auto-inhibitory mechanism for binding to the NLS cargo (29Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Such conformational flexibility suggests that, in solution, the IBB domain exists in a range of conformations with low energy barriers between them. Similar structural plasticity was reported previously for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev (30Ye X. Gorin A. Frederick R. Hu W. Majumdar A. Xu W. McLendon G. Ellington A. Patel D.J. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 657-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), another small, basic importin β-binding protein (1Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Frederick R. Hu W. Majumdar A. Xu W. McLendon G. Ellington A. Patel D.J. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 657-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The view of the IBB domain as a population of dynamically interconverting conformers (31Kumar S. Ma B. Tsai C.J. Sinha N. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32Ma B. Shatsky M. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) suggests that the recognition of the IBB domain by importin β may follow a population selection model (31Kumar S. Ma B. Tsai C.J. Sinha N. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32Ma B. Shatsky M. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the receptor would select the helical conformation of the IBB domain, which complements most favorably the importin β-binding cavity (Fig. 5), because of the electrostatic complementarity of basic IBB side chains projecting along the helix peptide and acidic residues of importin β. The binding of the helical IBB-conformer would be energetically driven by the large enthalphic nature of the binding, 2G. Cingolani, C. Koerner, T. Guan, and L. Gerace, manuscript in preparation. which is accompanied by the formation of over 40 specific contacts between the protein and the peptide (9Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Mueller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Moreover, the high affinity binding of a distinct helical IBB conformer must be dependent on the degree of structural stabilization of the helix imposed by importin β. We propose that the tryptophans of importin β control this step of the binding reaction by stabilizing the helical conformation of the IBB domain primarily via cation-π interactions with IBB-Arg-51 and Lys-18/22. In this regard, the position of the tryptophans in importin β provides a rational explanation for the existence of weak and hot spots mutations. Whereas a single residue Trp-864 would stabilize the C terminus of the IBB helix, three separated residues near the N-terminal end of the helix could play overlapping roles. Residues Trp-430 and Trp-472 are located in immediate proximity to the N terminus of the IBB helix (Fig. 5), and Trp-342 is next to the 310 helix (IBB-residues 15–18) (Fig. 1 a). The hot spot can be interpreted as a destabilization of the C terminus of the IBB helix due to the loss of the single tryptophan located in that area (33DeLano W.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Conversely, it is possible that mutations W342A, W430A, and W472A do not individually play a critical role, as they can complement each other. The synergy of hot spot and silent mutants would derive from the fact that each of the three silent mutations on the N terminus of the IBB helix is enhanced by a mutation destabilizing the C terminus of the IBB helix, which leads to the inability of importin β to select the helical form of the IBB domain. This view of tryptophan as a “stabilizer” of the IBB helical folding agrees with the observation made by Burley and Petsko (34Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar, 35Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) that an aromatic residue such a tryptophan can engage in specific energetically favorable interactions stabilizing protein structure. In contrast, in the case of the Trp → Ala mutants the small methyl group of alanines is incompatible with cation-π interactions with the IBB side chains. This reduces the constraints on the helix stabilization and, in turn, prevents the high affinity binding of the helical IBB domain by importin β. Our data strongly suggest that the importin β·IBB domain binding interface is not a static structural state wherein a protein and the ligand fit together as lock and key, as originally proposed by Chothia and Janin (36Chothia C. Janin J. Nature. 1975; 256: 705-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Rather the molecular recognition of the IBB domain by importin β may be dissected into the following two distinct events: (i) the selection of a helical IBB domain sub-population inside the acidic groove of importin β, which stabilizes the IBB-helix (residues 22–51) via tryptophan residues; and (ii) the stable binding of the IBB-side chains arranged on the surface of the IBB-helix to the acidic binding cavity of importin β. The concept that the specificity of a NLS is encoded in its primary as well as secondary structure may be crucial for understanding the flexible yet highly specific recognition of a NLS by nuclear transport receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2160620046,"24-Hydroxylase (CYP24) is an enzyme distributed in the target tissues of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3]. Two functions for this enzyme have been reported: One is production of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25(OH)2D3] and the other is inactivation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. To elucidate other physiologic roles of CYP24 in vivo, we previously generated rats that constitutively express the CYP24 gene. These transgenic (Tg) rats developed unexpected phenotypes, such as low plasma levels of 24,25(OH)2D3, lipidemia, and albuminuria. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms for inducing low plasma 24,25(OH)2D3 levels and bone loss. Tg rats excreted massive amounts of vitamin D binding protein (DBP), which coincided with the loss of albumin. In Tg rats, the renal expression pattern of megalin, which serves as an endocytotic receptor responsible for the reuptake of urinary proteins such as DBP and albumin, was identical to that of the wild-type rats. Excreted albumin appeared to compete for the binding and reabsorption of the DBP-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] complex with megalin, resulting in a loss of 25(OH)D3 into the urine and subsequent reduction of plasma 24,25(OH)2D3. In this prominent rat model of nephritis, supplementation of 25(OH)D3 was effective in preventing bone loss in an early stage of renal insufficiency."

Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is composed of two copies of 14 different subunits: 7 distinct α and 7 distinct β type subunits. It is a barrel-like particle formed by the axial stacking of four rings made up of two outer α-rings and inner β-rings, being associated in the order of αββα. Three out of seven β-type subunits of each inner ring have catalytically active threonine residues at their N termini, and these active sites reside in a chamber formed by the centers of the abutting β-rings. The eukaryotic 20 S proteasome has at least three different catalytic activities against synthetic peptide substrates; i.e. a trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like (or peptidylglutamyl-hydrolyzing) activities, that contribute to the hydrolysis of multiple peptide bonds in a single polypeptide by a coordinated mechanism (1Coux O.

To date, yeast proteasomal mutants and membrane-permeable inhibitors have been used to determine in vivo functions of proteasomes, which have created diverse arrays of evidence on the biological importance of proteasomes such as the cell cycle, immune response, signaling cascades, and protein quality control in various eukaryotes (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6819) Google Scholar, 6Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Indeed, budding yeast mutants that lack some peptidase activities have contributed greatly to our understanding of the involvement of proteasomes in the degradation of many unstable key proteins (7Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 30: 405-439Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), but their application to higher organisms has not been tested. Various substrate-related peptidyl compounds such as MG-132 and Z-L3VS have been devised as potent inhibitors of proteasomes (8Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 9Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), but caution must be exercised in their use for interpreting proteasome functions, because they inhibit not only proteasomes but also other proteases. In contrast to these compounds, new microbial metabolites, such as lactacystin and eponemycin, were found to induce selective inhibition of proteasomes that do not affect other proteases examined so far (10Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.B. Myung J. Sin N. Crews C.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 3335-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although these metabolites bind to active threonine residues of proteasomes, the possibility that they inhibit other as-yet-unidentified threonine protease(s) cannot be ruled out completely. Therefore, genetic approaches capable of manipulating proteasomal activities are still required to determine the in vivo functions of proteasomes in higher organisms such as vertebrate cells. For this purpose, we disrupted proteasome subunit Z (formally designated β2) gene (cpsmb7) in chicken B cell line DT40 then established Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells that express a tetracycline-repressible HA1-tagged Z protein (Z-HA). This construct could manipulate proteasome levels in vertebrate cells by repressing the Z-HA by doxycycline (Dox) treatment. Using these cells, we found that reduction of proteasomes caused not only G2/M arrest during cell-cycle progression but also induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our results surprisingly showed that reduced proteasomes functions induced the expression of major molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40, suggesting a potential link between proteasome-mediated proteolysis and stress response for protein homeostasis in the cell. Partial chicken Z cDNA was obtained from DT40 cells-derived mRNAs by reverse transcription-PCR method. The primers (5′-GACACGAGGGCGACCGAAGGGATG-3′ and 5′-GCGGCTGCTCAGGAAGTATCCATG-3′) were synthesized based on expressed sequence tag sequence (AJ397675). The full-length cDNA and genomic DNA were obtained by screening chicken muscle cDNA and genomic DNA libraries (Stratagene). The Z targeting vectors were designed by replacing the DNA segment that encompasses exon 1 to exon 3, with drug-resistant cassettes for blasticidin (Bsd), puromycin (Puro), and phleomycin (Bleo). A hemagglutinin (HA) tag was fused to the 3′-end of chicken Z cDNA coding regions by PCR amplifications. HA-tagged chicken Z cDNA (Z-HA) was inserted into the pUHD10–3 vector at the EcoRI site and the SspI site was replaced with the HindIII site by a HindIII linker. To construct a tetracycline (tet)-regulatable Z expression vector, tTA-dependent promoter flanked with HA-tagged chicken Z cDNA were recovered from pUHD10–3-Z-HA by digestion withHindIII and inserted into the HindIII site of ptTA2-Neo vector (Clontech) that encode tet-repressible tTA (tetR-VP16). The resulting plasmid (ptTA2-Neo-tetZ-HA) expresses Z-HA protein under the control of the tetR-VP16 (12Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% (v/v) chicken serum, 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 39.5 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were electroporated at 25 microfarads and 550 V (Bio-Rad) as described previously (13Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected with each drug at the following concentrations: 2.0 mg/ml Geneticin (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), 50 μg/ml blasticidin-S (Funakoshi), and 0.3 mg/ml phleomycin (Sigma). Cell viability was assayed by measuring the metabolic activity using tetrazolium salt WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt, Cell Counting Kit-8, Wako). After incubating the cells with WST-8, the optical density was read as specified by the manufacturer. Dox was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for the indicated times. Anti-chicken Z polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits using a purified recombinant His-tagged Z protein expressed inEscherichia coli BL21. Anti-Hsp70 (MBL), anti-Hsp40 (Stress Gen), anti-actin (Chemicon), anti-Wee1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-poly-ubiquitin (MBL), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were purchased. Cells were lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% TritonX-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following a brief sonication, the extracts were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to 10–20% SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), proteins were detected by specific antibodies with the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard (15Bradford K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). Genomic DNAs were isolated by using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA (15 μg) was digested withEcoRI, separated in a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled probe (ClaI-EcoRI fragment indicated in Fig. 1A), washed at high stringency, and then autoradiographed. Total RNAs were isolated by using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Approximately 15 μg of total RNAs was separated and transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled full-length chicken Z cDNA probe, washed at high stringency, and then autoradiographed. Cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol with 2 mm ATP by sonication, and the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation with 10–40% glycerol in the above buffer. After centrifugation at 83,000 × g for 22 h using a Beckman SW28 rotor, the gradient was separated into 30 fractions of 1 ml each (16Tanahashi N. Murakami Y. Minami Y. Shimbara N. Hendil K.B.

Hydrolysis of the synthetic peptides, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methycoumarine (Suc-LLVY-AMC), t-butyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC (Boc-LRR-AMC), and carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (Z-LLE-AMC) was measured under the presence or absence of 0.05% SDS as described previously (17Tanaka K.

One unit of peptidase activity was defined as the amount that degraded 1 nmol of a given fluorogenic peptide per minute. 35S-Labeled ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was produced in vitro by translating rat ODC mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with 35S-labeled Met and Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then immunopurified. The degradation of ODC was assayed as described previously (17Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief,35S-labeled ODC (3000–4000 cpm) was incubated with antizyme, ATP, and enzyme solution in buffer containing the ATP regeneration system at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, the radioactivity of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was measured, and the activity was expressed as a percentage of total ODC radioactivity added. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 0.25 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C, and stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide at 4 °C. DNA contents were measured by a flow cytometry and cell cycle profiles were analyzed by the Expo ADC analysis program (Beckman Coulter). Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. For immunofluorescence analysis, anti-HA monoclonal antibody (BAbCO) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) were used. Nuclei were counterstained with TOTO3 (Molecular Probes). Apoptotic cells were detected by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay using an Apoptag kit (Intergen). The assay was performed according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser microscope (Zeiss and Bio-Rad). To examine the cellular roles of proteasomes in vertebrates, we generated a cell line that could genetically manipulate the level of the proteasome subunit that confers a peptidase activity. Chicken B cell line DT40 is advantageous for this purpose, because of its efficient rate of homologous recombination (13Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Full-length chicken Z cDNA was obtained by screening a chicken muscle cDNA library using the partial cDNA fragment obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. The full-length chicken Z cDNA deduced a protein of 277 amino acids (accession number AB098728), displaying 57.4% and 83.8% identities with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human, respectively, at the amino acid level. To disrupt the proteasome Z gene (cpsmb7), chicken Z genomic DNA was isolated from chicken genomic DNA library, and the targeting vectors were constructed as shown in Fig. 1 A. The vectors were designed to create a null allele by replacing the DNA segment that encompasses exon 1 to exon 3, which encodes the first 85 amino acids, including the essential catalytic site (threonine 44 in the exon 2), with drug-resistant cassettes. DT40 cells that contain three functional Z genes (cpsmb7) were successively transfected with each targeting vector, and the homologously recombined clones were identified by genomic Southern blot (Fig. 1 B). Because the null mutant was expected to be lethal, we transfected the tet-regulatable Z-HA expression vector (ptTA2-Neo-tetZ-HA vector), in which the expression of Z protein could be shut off by Dox treatment, and isolated their stable transformants after the first allele was disrupted by Bsd construct. The second and third loci were disrupted by Puro and Bleo constructs, respectively. Finally, we obtained the Z−/−/−/Z-HA clone that expressed Z-HA in a Z-nullizygous genetic background. The genomic Southern blots of representative clones are shown in Fig. 1 B. Homologous recombination was identified as appearance of new 5.2-, 12-, and 11.5-kb bands corresponding to the targeted alleles generated by the Bsd, Puro, and Bleo constructs, respectively. We then tested the effect of Dox treatment on Z-HA expression in Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells. Dox treatment of Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells reduced the mRNA and protein expression of Z-HA to undetectable levels at 24 h after Dox treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Western blot with anti-Z antibody detected both precursor and mature forms of Z-HA. The latter form migrated below the size of the former (Fig. 1 D). It is known that the catalytic subunits are synthesized as precursor forms and processed into the mature form during the assembly of the 20 S proteasome complex (18Schmidtke G. Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mature form co-sedimented with the 20 S proteasome, whereas the precursor form was detected in the lighter fraction when the cell extracts were fractionated by glycerol density gradient centrifugation (see Fig. 3, lower panels), suggesting that Z-HA is processed and incorporated into the 20 S proteasome. Based on yeast studies, Pup1p, which corresponds to Z/β2, is known to confer trypsin-like activity (19Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7156-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 20Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the next step, we tested whether loss of Z results in specific loss of trypsin-like activity. After Dox treatment, cells were serially collected at the indicated times and cell fractions were prepared. The cell fractions were first tested for their ability to degrade ODC, a proteasome-specific substrate independent of ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 2 A, ODC-degrading activities gradually decreased upon Dox treatment. These effects were not seen in Dox-untreated cells or Dox-treated wild-type DT40 cells. Testing for the specificity of peptidase activities showed that not only trypsin-like activity, but also other peptidase chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities were reduced (Fig. 2,B–D). To further confirm that these peptidase activities represent proteasome-specific activities, Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells were treated with or without Dox for 30 h, and the cell extracts were further fractionated by glycerol density gradient centrifugation and subjected to peptidase assay and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panels), in wild-type cells, active enzyme with chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities was sedimented with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼26 S, but low activity was found in slowly sedimenting fractions corresponding to the sedimentation position of the purified 20 S proteasome. Addition of 0.05% SDS, which is a potent artificial activator of the latent 20 S proteasome, caused marked enhancement of chymotrypsin-like activity in fractions sedimenting like the 20 S proteasome, as reported previously (16Tanahashi N. Murakami Y. Minami Y. Shimbara N. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14336-14345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Note that no obvious caspase-like activity was observed without SDS, but its strong activity could be measured in the presence of 0.05% SDS. ODC-degrading activity as well as these three types of peptidase activities were high and comparable in the Dox-untreated Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells at wild-type levels, whereas they were greatly decreased in the Dox-treated Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells (Fig. 3, upper panels). Western blot analysis revealed that the mature form of Z protein migrated in the fractions 11–19 with 20–26 S proteasomes (Fig. 3,lower panels). The precursor form of Z in wild-type cell extracts migrated at lighter fractions 7–11. These fractions corresponded to 16 S pre-proteasomal particles as reported previously (18Schmidtke G. Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the precursor Z-HA in Dox-untreated Z−/−/−/Z-HA cell extracts was recovered in fractions 1–11. The precursor Z-HA observed in fractions 1–5 might be the free form based on its exogenous overexpression. Nonetheless, most mature Z-HA was recovered in the fractions containing sediments of 20–26 S proteasomes, indicating that Z-HA is assembled into these proteasomes. Of note, in the Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells with Dox, the mature Z-HA was reduced, and precursor Z-HA was not observed in fractions 7–11. In addition, very low mature Z-HA was recovered near top fractions 1–5, which might be generated by disassembly of the 20 S proteasome. The peptidase activities in fractions of the mature form of Z-HA were high in untreated cells, whereas they were markedly low in Dox-treated cells fractionated in the same manner (Fig. 3, upper panels). Taken together, these results suggest that Z-HA is functionally active and that proteasome activity is dependent on the expression of Z-HA. Because not only trypsin-like activity but also other peptidase activities were affected by loss of Z-HA, we concluded that the integral functions of the proteasome are impaired probably due to its inappropriate assembly and/or maintenance of the complex. In the next experiment, we analyzed the levels of cellular poly-ubiquitinated proteins after Z depletion. After wild-type DT40 and Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells had been treated with Dox for 30 h, these cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-poly-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig.4, poly-ubiquitinated proteins considerably increased in crude extracts from the Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells by Dox treatment, whereas the pattern of poly-ubiquitinated proteins remained unchanged in wild-type cells, irrespective of Dox treatment. These results suggested that the dysfunction of proteasomes leads to accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Because most of the proteasome subunit is essential in yeast, we tested the effect of loss of proteasome function on cell viability of Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells. For this purpose, Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells were treated with Dox for the indicated times and their viability was measured (Fig.5 A). Dox-treated Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells proliferated in the first 24 h but began to decrease from 30 h of treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of these cells showed their arrest at G2/M phase (Fig. 5 B). We next examined the expression of Wee1 kinase, which plays a role in checkpoint mechanism at G2/M phase (21Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Considerable accumulation of Wee1 kinase was noted at 24 h after Dox treatment (Fig. 5 C). Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed cell death at 30 h after Dox treatment (Fig.5 B). To examine whether this was due to apoptosis, we performed TUNEL analysis (Fig. 5 D). The apoptotic cells had large nuclei and less Z-HA expression. Taken together, these results indicated that loss of Z-HA and proteasomal activities result in cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase followed by cell death. It is worth noting that residual Z-HA was present mainly in the cytoplasm as a punctate-like structure and to a lesser extent in the nuclei of Dox-treated cells, whereas it was uniformly present in the cytoplasm and rather abundantly in the nuclei of untreated cells (Fig.5 D). It is known that damaged proteins and/or misfolded proteins are rapidly eliminated from the cells by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Indeed, proteasome inhibitors induce accumulation of such abnormal proteins in the cells and trigger signals that up-regulate the expression of certain molecular chaperones in the cells (22Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Given that the expression of proteasomes can be reduced in Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells, we next examined whether Z depletion could up-regulate the expressions of major molecular chaperones, Hsp40 and Hsp70 in Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells. As shown in Fig.6 (lower panels), Hsp40 and Hsp70 were consistently up-regulated by Z depletion in Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells. In contrast, these effects were not observed in Dox-treated wild-type DT40 cells (Fig. 6, upper panels). These results suggested that these molecular chaperones are up-regulated upon loss of proteasome function. The proteasome is a multifunctional protease complex and essential for cell viability. We generated Z−/−/−/Z-HA cell line in which the expression of proteasome subunit Z could be manipulated by Dox. This cell line expressed Dox-repressible Z protein, tagged with C-terminal HA peptide. The C-terminal HA-tag did not interfere with the wild-type function of Z, because (i) Z-HA complemented the lethality of Z null-phenotype (Fig. 5 A) and (ii) Z-HA was processed in mature form and incorporated into the proteasome complex (Figs.1 D and 3). Depletion of Z-HA resulted in inhibition of three types of proteasomal peptidase activities and ODC-degrading activity (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, considerable accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated cellular proteins was observed in vivo(Fig. 4). This is consistent with the fact that cellular poly-ubiquitinated proteins accumulate in the yeast proteasomal temperature-sensitive mutants under restrictive temperature (23Kominami K. DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Shimbara N. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Hisamatsu H. Tanahashi N. Shimizu Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the Z subunit is essential for the integrity of proteasome. The proteasome is the major protease for poly-ubiquitinated proteins and known to degrade many cell-cycle regulators during the cell cycle progression. Most of the yeast proteasome subunit mutants, although not all, exhibit cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase rather than the G1/S phase (24Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Our data also indicate that the major function of the proteasome in cell-cycle regulation is required at the G2/M phase rather than the G1/S phase. The essential substrates to be degraded by the proteasome at G2/M phase were not characterized in this study; however, we observed accumulation of Wee1 kinase in Z-HA knockdown cells (Fig.5 C). The Wee1 kinase is known to phosphorylate cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and thus plays a critical role in the checkpoint mechanism by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity (21Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Whether Wee1 kinase is one of the essential substrates or simply accumulates due to cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase remains to be elucidated. The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been implicated in quality control of proteins in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), which (i) halts the translation of newly synthesized proteins, (ii) enhances the expression of molecular chaperones, and (iii) back translocates unfolded protein in the ER to the cytosol for proteasome degradation (25Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The last process is called ER-associated protein degradation among the UPR reactions (26Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In the present study, our results showed that inhibition of the proteasome enhances the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40. The latter is known to collaborate with the former for folding newly synthesized and damaged proteins (27Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). How the cells sense the level of the proteasome and induce these molecular chaperones is unknown at present. However, this process is most likely due to enhanced UPR, because failure of protein degradation results in accumulation of abnormal proteins. Furthermore, the expression of molecular chaperone might be further enhanced following failure of the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. Ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent protein degradation play essential roles in various biological events as mentioned in the introduction. In this regard, recent studies in the ubiquitin field reveal novel functions for ubiquitin in various biological events such as endocytosis, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and kinase activation (28Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Whether these events do or do not involve proteasome-dependent degradation remain to be elucidated by genetic means, because proteasome inhibitors are known to inhibit some of the above biological events, such as endocytosis (29Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 5: 843-854Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many de-ubiquitinating enzymes that counteract with ubiquitination are vital in the cells (28Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Thus, Z−/−/−/Z-HA cells could be used as a tool for examining the function of proteasomes in various cellular events that, at least, involve ubiquitination. We thank Y.
