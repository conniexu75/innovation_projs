https://openalex.org/W2129129812,"Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2023343492,"Glucocorticoids are released in response to stressful experiences and serve many beneficial homeostatic functions. However, dysregulation of glucocorticoids is associated with cognitive impairments and depressive illness. In the hippocampus, a brain region densely populated with receptors for stress hormones, stress and glucocorticoids strongly inhibit adult neurogenesis. Decreased neurogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, but direct evidence for this role is lacking. Here we show that adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for normal expression of the endocrine and behavioural components of the stress response. Using either transgenic or radiation methods to inhibit adult neurogenesis specifically, we find that glucocorticoid levels are slower to recover after moderate stress and are less suppressed by dexamethasone in neurogenesis-deficient mice than intact mice, consistent with a role for the hippocampus in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Relative to controls, neurogenesis-deficient mice also showed increased food avoidance in a novel environment after acute stress, increased behavioural despair in the forced swim test, and decreased sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia. These findings identify a small subset of neurons within the dentate gyrus that are critical for hippocampal negative control of the HPA axis and support a direct role for adult neurogenesis in depressive illness."

https://openalex.org/W2170095671,"The developing vertebrate gut tube forms a reproducible looped pattern as it grows into the body cavity. Here we use developmental experiments to eliminate alternative models and show that gut looping morphogenesis is driven by the homogeneous and isotropic forces that arise from the relative growth between the gut tube and the anchoring dorsal mesenteric sheet, tissues that grow at different rates. A simple physical mimic, using a differentially strained composite of a pliable rubber tube and a soft latex sheet is consistent with this mechanism and produces similar patterns. We devise a mathematical theory and a computational model for the number, size and shape of intestinal loops based solely on the measurable geometry, elasticity and relative growth of the tissues. The predictions of our theory are quantitatively consistent with observations of intestinal loops at different stages of development in the chick embryo. Our model also accounts for the qualitative and quantitative variation in the distinct gut looping patterns seen in a variety of species including quail, finch and mouse, illuminating how the simple macroscopic mechanics of differential growth drives the morphology of the developing gut."

https://openalex.org/W2059817275,"The vertebrate thymus provides an inductive environment for T-cell development. Within the mouse thymus, Notch signals are indispensable for imposing the T-cell fate on multipotential haematopoietic progenitors, but the downstream effectors that impart T-lineage specification and commitment are not well understood. Here we show that a transcription factor, T-cell factor 1 (TCF-1; also known as transcription factor 7, T-cell specific, TCF7), is a critical regulator in T-cell specification. TCF-1 is highly expressed in the earliest thymic progenitors, and its expression is upregulated by Notch signals. Most importantly, when TCF-1 is forcibly expressed in bone marrow (BM) progenitors, it drives the development of T-lineage cells in the absence of T-inductive Notch1 signals. Further characterization of these TCF-1-induced cells revealed expression of many T-lineage genes, including T-cell-specific transcription factors Gata3 and Bcl11b, and components of the T-cell receptor. Our data suggest a model where Notch signals induce TCF-1, and TCF-1 in turn imprints the T-cell fate by upregulating expression of T-cell essential genes."

https://openalex.org/W1983690863,"Phytopathogens deliver effector proteins inside host plant cells to promote infection. These proteins can also be sensed by the plant immune system, leading to restriction of pathogen growth. Effector genes can display signatures of positive selection and rapid evolution, presumably a consequence of their co-evolutionary arms race with plants. The molecular mechanisms underlying how effectors evolve to gain new virulence functions and/or evade the plant immune system are poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structures of the effector domains from two oomycete RXLR proteins, Phytophthora capsici AVR3a11 and Phytophthora infestans PexRD2. Despite sharing <20% sequence identity in their effector domains, they display a conserved core α-helical fold. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that the core fold occurs in ∼44% of annotated Phytophthora RXLR effectors, both as a single domain and in tandem repeats of up to 11 units. Functionally important and polymorphic residues map to the surface of the structures, and PexRD2, but not AVR3a11, oligomerizes in planta. We conclude that the core α-helical fold enables functional adaptation of these fast evolving effectors through (i) insertion/deletions in loop regions between α-helices, (ii) extensions to the N and C termini, (iii) amino acid replacements in surface residues, (iv) tandem domain duplications, and (v) oligomerization. We hypothesize that the molecular stability provided by this core fold, combined with considerable potential for plasticity, underlies the evolution of effectors that maintain their virulence activities while evading recognition by the plant immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2020822273,"Background A relationship between the increased density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and decreased survival was recently reported in thyroid cancer patients. Among these tumors, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive solid tumors in humans. TAMs (type M2) have been recognized as promoting tumor growth. The purpose of our study was to analyze with immunohistochemistry the presence of TAMs in a series of 27 ATC. Methodology/Principal Findings Several macrophages markers such as NADPH oxidase complex NOX2-p22phox, CD163 and CD 68 were used. Immunostainings showed that TAMs represent more than 50% of nucleated cells in all ATCs. Moreover, these markers allowed the identification of elongated thin ramified cytoplasmic extensions, bestowing a “microglia-like” appearance on these cells which we termed “Ramified TAMs” (RTAMs). In contrast, cancer cells were totally negative. Cellular stroma was highly simplified since apart from cancer cells and blood vessels, RTAMs were the only other cellular component. RTAMs were evenly distributed and intermingled with cancer cells, and were in direct contact with other RTAMs via their ramifications. Moreover, RTAMs displayed strong immunostaining for connexin Cx43. Long chains of interconnected RTAMs arose from perivascular clusters and were dispersed within the tumor parenchyma. When expressed, the glucose transporter Glut1 was found in RTAMs and blood vessels, but rarely in cancer cells. Conclusion ATCs display a very dense network of interconnected RTAMs in direct contact with intermingled cancer cells. To our knowledge this is the first time that such a network is described in a malignant tumor. This network was found in all our studied cases and appeared specific to ATC, since it was not found in differentiated thyroid cancers specimens. Taken together, these results suggest that RTAMs network is directly related to the aggressiveness of the disease via metabolic and trophic functions which remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2059320568,"The carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor, plays a critical role in the control of lipogenesis in the liver. To identify the direct targets of ChREBP on a genome-wide scale and provide more insight into the mechanism by which ChREBP regulates glucose-responsive gene expression, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and gene expression analysis. We identified 1153 ChREBP binding sites and 783 target genes using the chromatin from HepG2, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. A motif search revealed a refined consensus sequence (CABGTG-nnCnG-nGnSTG) to better represent critical elements of a functional ChREBP binding sequence. Gene ontology analysis shows that ChREBP target genes are particularly associated with lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism. In addition, other functional gene clusters related to transport, development and cell motility are significantly enriched. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals that ChREBP target genes are highly correlated with genes regulated by high glucose, providing a functional relevance to the genome-wide binding study. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ChREBP may function as a transcriptional repressor as well as an activator."
https://openalex.org/W2057941898,"Background Visual assessment rating scales for medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy have been used by neuroradiologists in clinical practice to aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently multivariate classification methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been suggested as alternative tools. If computerized methods are to be implemented in clinical practice they need to be as good as, or better than experienced neuroradiologists and carefully validated. The aims of this study were: (1) To compare the ability of MTL atrophy visual assessment rating scales, a multivariate MRI classification method and manually measured hippocampal volumes to distinguish between subjects with AD and healthy elderly controls (CTL). (2) To assess how well the three techniques perform when predicting future conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Methods High resolution sagittal 3D T1w MP-RAGE datasets were acquired from 75 AD patients, 101 subjects with MCI and 81 CTL from the multi-centre AddNeuroMed study. An automated analysis method was used to generate regional volume and regional cortical thickness measures, providing 57 variables for multivariate analysis (orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures using seven-fold cross-validation). Manual hippocampal measurements were also determined for each subject. Visual rating assessment of MTL atrophy was performed by an experienced neuroradiologist according to the approach of Scheltens et al. Results We found prediction accuracies for distinguishing between AD and CTL of 83% for multivariate classification, 81% for the visual rating assessments and 89% for manual measurements of total hippocampal volume. The three different techniques showed similar accuracy in predicting conversion from MCI to AD at one year follow-up. Conclusion Visual rating assessment of the MTL gave similar prediction accuracy to multivariate classification and manual hippocampal volumes. This suggests a potential future role for computerized methods as a complement to clinical assessment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W1996446827,"Trypanosoma brucei and related pathogens transcribe most genes as polycistronic arrays that are subsequently processed into monocistronic mRNAs. Expression is frequently regulated post-transcriptionally by cis-acting elements in the untranslated regions (UTRs). GPEET and EP procyclins are the major surface proteins of procyclic (insect midgut) forms of T. brucei. Three regulatory elements common to the 3′ UTRs of both mRNAs regulate mRNA turnover and translation. The glycerol-responsive element (GRE) is unique to the GPEET 3′ UTR and regulates its expression independently from EP. A synthetic RNA encompassing the GRE showed robust sequence-specific interactions with cytoplasmic proteins in electromobility shift assays. This, combined with column chromatography, led to the identification of 3 Alba-domain proteins. RNAi against Alba3 caused a growth phenotype and reduced the levels of Alba1 and Alba2 proteins, indicative of interactions between family members. Tandem-affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation verified these interactions and also identified Alba4 in sub-stoichiometric amounts. Alba proteins are cytoplasmic and are recruited to starvation granules together with poly(A) RNA. Concomitant depletion of all four Alba proteins by RNAi specifically reduced translation of a reporter transcript flanked by the GPEET 3′ UTR. Pulldown of tagged Alba proteins confirmed interactions with poly(A) binding proteins, ribosomal protein P0 and, in the case of Alba3, the cap-binding protein eIF4E4. In addition, Alba2 and Alba3 partially cosediment with polyribosomes in sucrose gradients. Alba-domain proteins seem to have exhibited great functional plasticity in the course of evolution. First identified as DNA-binding proteins in Archaea, then in association with nuclear RNase MRP/P in yeast and mammalian cells, they were recently described as components of a translationally silent complex containing stage-regulated mRNAs in Plasmodium. Our results are also consistent with stage-specific regulation of translation in trypanosomes, but most likely in the context of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2034698425,"Males and females exhibit different health responses to air pollution, but little is known about how exposure to air pollution affects juvenile respiratory health after analysis stratified by allergic predisposition. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between air pollutants and asthmatic symptoms in Chinese children selected from multiple sites in a heavily industrialized province of China, and investigate whether allergic predisposition modifies this relationship.30139 Chinese children aged 3-to-12 years were selected from 25 districts of seven cities in northeast China in 2009. Information on respiratory health was obtained using a standard questionnaire from the American Thoracic Society. Routine air-pollution monitoring data was used for particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 µm (PM(10)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxides (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)) and carbon monoxide (CO). A two-stage regression approach was applied in data analyses. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per interquartile changes for PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), O(3), and CO. The results showed that children with allergic predisposition were more susceptible to air pollutants than children without allergic predisposition. Amongst children without an allergic predisposition, air pollution effects on asthma were stronger in males compared to females; Current asthma prevalence was related to PM(10) (ORs = 1.36 per 31 µg/m(3); 95% CI, 1.08-1.72), SO(2) (ORs = 1.38 per 21 µg/m(3); 95%CI, 1.12-1.69) only among males. However, among children with allergic predisposition, more positively associations between air pollutants and respiratory symptoms and diseases were detected in females; An increased prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma was significantly associated with SO(2) (ORs = 1.48 per 21 µg/m(3); 95%CI, 1.21-1.80), NO(2) (ORs = 1.26 per 10 µg/m(3); 95%CI, 1.01-1.56), and current asthma with O(3) (ORs = 1.55 per 23 µg/m(3); 95%CI, 1.18-2.04) only among females.Ambient air pollutions were more evident in males without an allergic predisposition and more associations were detected in females with allergic predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W2092337611,"Primate neurophysiology has revealed various neural mechanisms at the single-cell level and population level. However, because recording techniques have not been updated for several decades, the types of experimental design that can be applied in the emerging field of social neuroscience are limited, in particular those involving interactions within a realistic social environment. To address these limitations and allow more freedom in experimental design to understand dynamic adaptive neural functions, multidimensional recording (MDR) was developed. MDR obtains behavioral, neural, eye position, and other biological data simultaneously by using integrated multiple recording systems. MDR gives a wide degree of freedom in experimental design because the level of behavioral restraint is adjustable depending on the experimental requirements while still maintaining the signal quality. The biggest advantage of MDR is that it can provide a stable neural signal at higher temporal resolution at the network level from multiple subjects for months, which no other method can provide. Conventional event-related analysis of MDR data shows results consistent with previous findings, whereas new methods of analysis can reveal network mechanisms that could not have been investigated previously. MDR data are now shared in the public server Neurotycho.org. These recording and sharing methods support an ecological system that is open to everyone and will be a valuable and powerful research/educational platform for understanding the dynamic mechanisms of neural networks."

Multiple origins of this compound have been identified, with cholesterol being the presumed precursor. Although routes for formation of the 7-keto compound from cholesterol have been established, we found that 7-dehydrocholesterol (the immediate precursor of cholesterol) is oxidized by P450 7A1 to 7-ketocholesterol (kcat/Km = 3 × 104 m−1 s−1). P450 7A1 converted lathosterol (Δ5-dihydro-7-dehydrocholesterol) to a mixture of the 7-keto and 7α,8α-epoxide products (∼1:2 ratio), with the epoxide not rearranging to the ketone. The oxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol occured with predominant formation of 7-ketocholesterol and with the 7α,8α-epoxide as only a minor product; the synthesized epoxide was stable in the presence of P450 7A1. The mechanism of 7-dehydrocholesterol oxidation to 7-ketocholesterol is proposed to involve a FeIII-O-C-C+ intermediate and a 7,8-hydride shift or an alternative closing to yield the epoxide (Liebler, D. C., and Guengerich, F. P. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5482–5489). Accordingly, reaction of P450 7A1 with 7-[2H1]dehydrocholesterol yielded complete migration of deuterium in the product 7-ketocholesterol. The finding that 7-dehydrocholesterol is a precursor of 7-ketocholesterol has relevance to an inborn error of metabolism known as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) caused by defective cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations within the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the last enzyme in the pathway, lead to the accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in tissues and fluids of SLOS patients. Our findings suggest that 7-ketocholesterol levels may also be elevated in SLOS tissue and fluids as a result of P450 7A1 oxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. 7-Ketocholesterol is a bioactive sterol, a potent competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P450 7A1, and toxic in liver cells.

Cholesterol is an important component of membranes and a precursor for critical signaling molecules. The balance of synthesis and degradation of cholesterol and its conversions to androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and other important steroids are regulated in part by a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes (1Keeney D.S.

A 7-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase was purified from hamster liver microsomes, although the enzyme is apparently not present in rats or (most) humans (36Song W. Chen J. Dean W.L. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16223-16228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 7-Ketocholesterol was not among the many identified oxysterols in the free radical oxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (12Xu L. Korade Z. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 2222-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, in a recent study, 7-ketocholesterol was one of the major oxysterols observed in a rat model for SLOS, in which 7-dehydrocholesterol is the dominant sterol (37Xu, L., Liu, W., Sheflin, L. G., Fliesler, S. J., Porter, N. A. (2011) J. Lipid Res., in press.Google Scholar). We demonstrate the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to 7-ketocholesterol in human liver microsomes. Of several human P450 enzymes examined, only P450 7A1, the classic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, catalyzed the reaction. Detailed studies showed what clearly appears to be a direct oxidation (of the 7,8-olefin) to 7-ketocholesterol, with only trace formation of a 7,8-epoxide but not its required intermediacy (see Fig. 1). P450-catalyzed direct oxidation of an olefin to a carbonyl has been reported before (38Liebler D.C. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5482-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 39Mansuy D. Leclaire J. Fontecave M. Momenteau M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but this appears to be the first case of a dominant conversion with only minor epoxide formation and is relevant to a physiological reaction. Cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), l-α-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, m-chloroperbenzoic acid, and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). m-Chloroperbenzoic acid (in CH2Cl2) was washed with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and dried over Na2SO4 before use. Lathosterol (Fig. 1), 7-ketocholesterol, 7-ketocholestanol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol were purchased from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). [25,26,26,26,27,27,27-d7]-7-Dehydrocholesterol was synthesized as described previously (13Xu L. Korade Z. Rosado Jr., D.A. Liu W. Lamberson C.R. Porter N.A. J.

Biophys. 2005; 440: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli and purified as described elsewhere. FinniganTM TSQ Quantum and Orbitrap (high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)) mass spectrometers (ThermoFisher Scientific, Sunnydale, CA) connected to a Waters ACQUITY UPLC® system were used for analyses of sterol products. Electron impact HRMS was done at the University of Notre Dame facility (South Bend, IN). Enzyme reaction mixtures for P450 7A1 reactions typically contained 0.2 μm P450 7A1, 3.0 μm NADPH:P450 reductase, 60 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 7-dehydrocholesterol in 3.1 mm HPβCD (0.45%, w/v), and 0.41 mm Tween 20 (0.05%, v/v) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (40Shinkyo R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4632-4643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For P450 3A4 reactions, a “5× P450 protein premix” was prepared with slight modification of a previously described method (45Shaw P.M. Hosea N.A. Thompson D.V. Lenius J.M. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5× protein premix including 2.5 μm P450 3A4, 5 μm NADPH:P450 reductase, 2.5 μm cytochrome b5, 150 μg/ml phospholipid mixture (1:1:1 (w/w/w) l-α-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine/l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), 0.50 mg/ml potassium CHAPS (0.77 mm), and 3.0 mm GSH in 50 mm potassium HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and a 5× buffer mix including 12 mm GSH and 150 mm MgCl2 in 200 mm potassium HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) were prepared. A typical 500-μl enzyme reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 100 μl of 5× P450 3A4 protein premix, an equal volume of 5× buffer mix, 5 μl of 7-dehydrocholesterol solution in 310 mm HPβCD (45%, w/v), and 220 μl of H2O. Incubations (at 37 °C) were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (46Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 5th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 and mixed with a Vortex device. Following centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min), 1.4 ml of the organic layer was transferred and taken to dryness under an N2 stream. The resulting samples were dissolved in 100 μl of the solution including 70% (v/v) CH3CN, 30% (v/v) CH3OH, 0.5 mm butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma), and 0.5 mm triphenylphosphine (Sigma) for analysis. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS using a UPLC system connected to a TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 octadecylsilane column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm). LC conditions were as follow: solvent A contained 95% (v/v) H2O and 5% (v/v) CH3CN, and solvent B contained 95% (v/v) CH3CN and 5% (v/v) CH3OH. The column was maintained at an initial condition of 80% (v/v) solvent B for 1.5 min with a flow rate of 350 μl/min, followed by a linear gradient increasing to 100% (v/v) solvent B over 2.0 min. This condition was maintained for 7.0 min and then returned to the initial condition over 0.1 min and maintained until the end of a 13-min run. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The injection volume (on the column) was 15 μl. MS analyses were performed with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in the positive ion mode. Full-scan detection mode was used, with the mass range set between m/z 200 and 500. The following parameters were used for the detection of the analytes and the internal standard: N2 sheath gas, 30 p.s.i.; N2 auxiliary gas, 5 p.s.i.; spray voltage, 5.0 kV; APCI vaporizer temperature, 400 °C; capillary temperature, 300 °C; capillary offset, 35 V; tube lens voltage, 112 V; argon collision gas, 1.5 millitorr; scan time, 100 ms; Q3 scan width, 1 m/z; and Q1/Q3 peak widths at half-maximum, 0.7 m/z. The data were collected using Finnigan Xcalibur® version 1.0 software. For the measurement of 7-ketocholesterol formation rates, a UPLC system connected to an ACQUITY UV detector (using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 octadecylsilane column, 2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) was used, and 15 nmol of 7α-hydroxycholesterol was added in the extraction step as an internal standard. LC conditions were as follow: solvent A contained 95% (v/v) H2O and 5% (v/v) CH3CN, and solvent B contained 95% (v/v) CH3CN and 5% (v/v) CH3OH. The column was maintained at an initial condition of 90% (v/v) solvent B for 1.5 min with a flow rate of 350 μl/min, followed by a linear gradient increasing to 100% (v/v) solvent B over 1.5 min. This condition was maintained for 3.5 min and then returned to the initial condition over 0.1 min and maintained until the end of a 9.2-min run. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The injection volume was 15 μl. Absorbance at 236 nm (7-ketocholesterol) and 205 nm (7α-hydroxycholesterol as an internal standard) was monitored. Data collection and quantitative analysis were conducted with Waters MassLynx version 4.1 and QuanLynx version 4.1 software, respectively. Enzyme reaction mixtures for P450 1A1 or P450 1B1 reactions contained 0.1 μm P450 1A1 or P450 1B1 (with a similar level of NADPH:P450 reductase from coexpression) (47Parikh A. Gillam E.M. Guengerich F.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and 7-dehydrocholesterol in 3.1 mm HPβCD in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a typical reaction volume of 500 μl. Assays were conducted at 37 °C for up to 60 min, with incubations initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (46Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 5th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar). Following extraction, LC-MS analyses (APCI in the positive ion mode) were conducted as described above. The amount of cholesterol in a pool of 10 human liver microsomal samples (seven males and three females) was first quantified as described (40Shinkyo R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4632-4643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the pool of the 10 human liver microsomal samples containing exactly 50 nmol of cholesterol were added to a 1.0-ml reaction mixture containing 100 nmol of [25,26,26,26,27,27,27-d7]-7-dehydrocholesterol and 3.1 mm HPβCD in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The assays were conducted at 37 °C for 60 min. Incubations were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (46Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 5th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 and mixed with a Vortex device. Following extraction, LC-MS analyses (APCI in the positive ion mode) were conducted as described above. Enzyme reaction mixtures typically contained 0.2 μm P450 7A1, 3.0 μm NADPH:P450 reductase, 60 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, lathosterol in 3.1 mm HPβCD, and 0.41 mm Tween 20 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Incubations were conducted (at 37 °C) for 3 min, initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (46Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 5th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 and mixed with a Vortex device. Following extraction of samples, LC-MS analyses (APCI in the positive ion mode) were conducted as described above. To calculate the rates of 7-ketocholestanol and cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide formation, 50 nmol of 4β-hydroxycholesterol was added in the extraction step as an internal standard. MS analyses were performed with APCI in the positive ion mode. Quantitation was based on multiple reaction monitoring (7-ketocholestanol, cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide, and 4β-hydroxycholesterol: m/z 385 → 367, collision energy of 8 V). The data were collected and quantified using Finnigan Xcalibur version 1.0 software. Enzyme reaction mixtures contained 0.2 μm P450 7A1, 3.0 μm NADPH:P450 reductase, 60 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, [7-d1]-7-dehydrocholesterol in 3.1 mm HPβCD, and 0.41 mm Tween 20 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The assays were conducted at 37 °C for 3 min. Incubations were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (46Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 5th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 and mixed with a Vortex device. Following extraction of samples, LC-MS analyses (APCI in the positive ion mode) were conducted as described above. Reaction mixtures contained 60 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with or without 1.0 μm P450 7A1 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The assays were conducted at 37 °C for 30 min (cholesterol 7α,8α-epoxide) or 60 min (cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide). Incubations were initiated by the addition of 10 μm cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide or cholesterol 7α,8α-epoxide solution in CH3OH (1% (v/v) CH3OH in reaction mixtures). Reactions were quenched with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 containing 5 nmol of cholesterol as an internal standard and mixed with a Vortex device. Following extraction, LC-MS analyses (APCI in the positive ion mode) were conducted as described above with a TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer (for cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide). The ions at m/z 367 (M + H+ − 2H2O; tR = 5.0 min for cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide) and m/z 369 (M + H+ − H2O; tR = 7.2 min for cholesterol) were used to quantify cholestanol 7α,8α-epoxide. In the case of cholesterol 7α,8α-epoxide, the Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used (with UPLC) in the positive ion electrospray mode, and HCO2H (0.1%, v/v) was added to the mobile phase. The tR of the epoxide was 3.83 min for the epoxide, and the ion at m/z 401 was monitored. 7-Ketocholesterol formation activity was measured with the substrate [25,26,26,26,27,27,27-d7]-7-dehydrocholesterol (100 μm) in a pool of 10 human liver microsomal samples in the presence of endogenous cholesterol (50 μm measured). The [d7]-7-dehydrocholesterol substrate was used because of the presence of endogenous 7-ketocholesterol in the microsomes. The product was defined by co-migration with an authentic standard and an identical fragmentation pattern, as elaborated further under studies with P450 7A1 (see below). The measured rate was 0.014 ± 0.002 pmol/min/mg of protein, which is 100-fold less than that of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes (2.5 ± 1.6 pmol/min/mg of protein) (40Shinkyo R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4632-4643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The estimated rate of 7-dehydrocholesterol oxidation in liver microsomes may be compromised by the competition of the endogenous cholesterol, in that the measured Km for (free) cholesterol for P450 7A1 is ∼1 μm (40Shinkyo R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4632-4643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and an IC50 of 1 μm (for 7-ketocholesterol) has been reported for cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation (20Breuer O.

On the other hand, P450 7A1, the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, catalyzed the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to two products (Fig. 2A). The most intense product peak at tR = 4.82 min showed m/z 401 and 383, and the tR and mass spectra (including fragmentation) were identical to those of 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 2, A–D). One minor oxidation product (m/z 401, 383, and 365 at tR = 2.74 min) was also detected. This compound was subsequently shown to be cholesterol 7α,8α-epoxide by co-chromatography with the synthetic material and HRMS (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3LC-HRMS chromatogram of products formed from 7-dehydrocholesterol by P450 7A1. The incubations and conditions are similar to those described in the legend to Fig. 2, except that the products were analyzed using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (HRMS) under slightly different UPLC conditions. The tR values for synthetic cholesterol 7α,8α-epoxide and 7-ketocholesterol were 3.83 and 5.43 min, respectively (corresponding to the peaks at tR = 2.74 and 4.78 min in Fig. 2).

Although seagrass communities have been well-studied in the field, a quantification of their food-web structure and functioning, and how these change across space and human impacts has been lacking. Motivated by extensive field surveys and literature information, we analyzed the structural features of food webs associated with Zostera marina across 16 study sites in 3 provinces in Atlantic Canada. Our goals were to (i) quantify differences in food-web structure across local and regional scales and human impacts, (ii) assess the robustness of seagrass webs to simulated species loss, and (iii) compare food-web structure in temperate Atlantic seagrass beds with those of other aquatic ecosystems. We constructed individual food webs for each study site and cumulative webs for each province and the entire region based on presence/absence of species, and calculated 16 structural properties for each web. Our results indicate that food-web structure was similar among low impact sites across regions. With increasing human impacts associated with eutrophication, however, food-web structure show evidence of degradation as indicated by fewer trophic groups, lower maximum trophic level of the highest top predator, fewer trophic links connecting top to basal species, higher fractions of herbivores and intermediate consumers, and higher number of prey per species. These structural changes translate into functional changes with impacted sites being less robust to simulated species loss. Temperate Atlantic seagrass webs are similar to a tropical seagrass web, yet differed from other aquatic webs, suggesting consistent food-web characteristics across seagrass ecosystems in different regions. Our study illustrates that food-web structure and functioning of seagrass habitats change with human impacts and that the spatial scale of food-web analysis is critical for determining results."
https://openalex.org/W2037339493,"Bats are natural reservoirs for a spectrum of infectious zoonotic diseases including the recently emerged henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses). Henipaviruses have been observed both naturally and experimentally to cause serious and often fatal disease in many different mammal species, including humans. Interestingly, infection of the flying fox with henipaviruses occurs in the absence of clinical disease. The extreme variation in the disease pattern between humans and bats has led to an investigation into the effects of henipavirus infection on the innate immune response in bat cell lines. We report that henipavirus infection does not result in the induction of interferon expression, and the viruses also inhibit interferon signaling. We also confirm that the interferon production and signaling block in bat cells is not due to differing viral protein expression levels between human and bat hosts. This information, in addition to the known lack of clinical signs in bats following henipavirus infection, suggests that bats control henipavirus infection by an as yet unidentified mechanism, not via the interferon response. This is the first report of henipavirus infection in bat cells specifically investigating aspects of the innate immune system."

Gain of function mutations in GDH that abrogate GTP inhibition cause the hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome (HHS), resulting in increased pancreatic β-cell responsiveness to leucine and susceptibility to hypoglycemia following high protein meals. We have previously shown that two of the polyphenols from green tea (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG)) inhibit GDH in vitro and that EGCG blocks GDH-mediated insulin secretion in wild type rat islets. Using structural and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we demonstrate that ECG binds to the same site as the allosteric regulator, ADP. Perifusion assays using pancreatic islets from transgenic mice expressing a human HHS form of GDH demonstrate that the hyperresponse to glutamine caused by dysregulated GDH is blocked by the addition of EGCG. As observed in HHS patients, these transgenic mice are hypersensitive to amino acid feeding, and this is abrogated by oral administration of EGCG prior to challenge. Finally, the low basal blood glucose level in the HHS mouse model is improved upon chronic administration of EGCG. These results suggest that this common natural product or some derivative thereof may prove useful in controlling this genetic disorder. Of broader clinical implication is that other groups have shown that restriction of glutamine catabolism via these GDH inhibitors can be useful in treating various tumors.

Animal GDH is composed of ∼500 residues and, unlike GDH from other kingdoms, is allosterically regulated by a wide array of metabolites. The major allosteric activators are ADP (2Frieden C. J. Biol.

GDH is composed of two trimers of subunits stacked directly on top of each other with at least three domains in each subunit (7Baker P.J. Britton K.L. Engel P.C. Farrants G.W. Lilley K.S. Rice D.W.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3446-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bottom domain makes extensive contacts with a subunit from the other trimer. On top of this domain is the “NAD binding domain” that is composed of the conserved nucleotide-binding motif. Animal GDH has a long protrusion, the “antenna,” rising above the NAD binding domain that is not found in the other kingdoms (11Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3446-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The antenna from each subunit lies immediately behind the adjacent, counter-clockwise neighbor within the trimer. GDH undergoes large, concerted conformational changes during each catalytic turnover event. The NAD binding domain rotates by ∼18° about the “pivot helix” that runs along the back of this domain. The intertwined antennae rotate about each other, and the inner core of the hexamer expands and contracts as the mouth opens and closes. Allosteric regulators control GDH activity by affecting these large conformational changes (15Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Trends Biol. Chem. 2008; 33: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GTP binds at the base of the antenna, wedged in between the NAD binding domain and the pivot helix (11Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), only when the catalytic cleft is closed. In this way, GTP slows down product release by increasing the binding affinity of substrate and coenzyme (5Iwatsubo M. Pantaloni D. Bull. Soc. Chem. Biol. 1967; 49: 1563-1572PubMed Google Scholar, 16Frieden C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 10: 410-415Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Koberstein R. Sund H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activator ADP binds behind the NAD binding domain and immediately under the pivot helix (14Banerjee S. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3446-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ADP may facilitate the rotation of the NAD binding domain, thereby decreasing the energy required to open the catalytic cleft and release the product (14Banerjee S. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3446-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the complex allosteric regulation of mammalian GDH has been studied for decades, recent studies on hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia (HHS) have clearly linked GDH regulation to insulin and ammonia homeostasis (18Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This disorder is caused by mutations that desensitize GDH to the effects of GTP inhibition. This gain of function increases the rate of mitochondrial oxidation of glutamate in the β-cells, thereby increasing the ATP4−/MgADP2− ratio. This closes the plasma membrane KATP channels, opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and leads to insulin granule exocytosis. HHS patients have increased β-cell responsiveness to leucine and susceptibility to hypoglycemia following high protein meals (19Hsu B.Y. Kelly A. Thornton P.S. Greenberg C.R. Dilling L.A. Stanley C.A. J. Pediatr. 2001; 138: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The elevation of serum ammonia levels is probably due to increased ammonia production from glutamate oxidation and possibly also impaired urea synthesis by carbamoylphosphate synthetase due to reduced formation of its activator, N-acetylglutamate, from glutamate. Studies have also suggested a high correlation between HHS and childhood onset epilepsy, learning disabilities, and seizures (20Bahi-Buisson N. Roze E. Dionisi C. Escande F. Valayannopoulos V. Feillet F. Heinrichs C. Chadefaux-Vekemans B. Dan B. de Lonlay P. Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 2008; 50: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The current treatment for HHS is to control insulin secretion with compounds such as diazoxide (21Stanley C.A. Baker L. Adv. Pediatr. 1976; 23: 315-355PubMed Google Scholar), but this does not address the serum ammonium and CNS pathologies. We previously demonstrated that two of the four major catechins from green tea were effective inhibitors of GDH (22Li C. Allen A. Kwagh J. Doliba N.M. Qin W. Najafi H. Collins H.W. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10214-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) both inhibited both wild type and the HHS form of GDH with nanomolar ED50 values in vitro. Further, we demonstrated that EGCG inhibits BCH-stimulated insulin secretion, a process that is mediated by GDH, under conditions where GDH is no longer inhibited by high energy metabolites. EGCG does not affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion under high energy conditions where GDH is probably fully inhibited. These compounds act in an allosteric manner independent of their antioxidant activity, and the β-cell stimulatory effects are directly correlated with glutamine oxidation. Presented here is the atomic structure of ECG bound to GDH and a demonstration that these compounds ameliorate the effects of HHS in transgenic mice expressing the dysregulated human enzyme. The atomic structure of the GDH-ECG complex and site-directed mutagenesis of the binding site demonstrate that these compounds target the ADP allosteric site. We also demonstrate that EGCG blocks the hyperresponse to glutamine by isolated islets from a transgenic mouse expressing the human HHS form of GDH. In addition, hexachlorophene, which binds to a different and internal allosteric site in the GDH hexamer, also blocks GDH-mediated insulin secretion. Consistent with EGCG inhibition of GDH activity, the addition of EGCG increases the pool of glutamine and glutamate in the transgenic β-islets. Finally, we demonstrate that oral administration of EGCG to HHS mice prevents hypersinsulinemic (or hypoglycemic) response to amino acids and improves the abnormally low basal blood glucose levels in the transgenic mice. Therefore, this safe compound holds promise that the dysregulated HHS form of GDH can be controlled allosterically in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis on three residues that interact with ECG was performed using the previously described pET20a-hGDH expression vector (23Fang J. Hsu B.Y. MacMullen C.M. Poncz M. Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and primers are shown in Table 1. A series of mutants, R90S, D123A, and S397I, were constructed using the overlapping PCR method and confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Primers used to construct the R90S, D123A, and S397I mutations in the human GDH heterologous expression vector (23Fang J.

Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mg/ml arabinose for inducing expression of GroES and GroEL. After the A600 of the culture reached 0.6–0.8, medium was cooled to room temperature, and 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, final concentration, was added to induce expression. After 20 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.6 m ammonium sulfate, and 1 mm EDTA). The cells were ultrasonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. GDH was precipitated with a 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, final concentration. The pellets were resuspended into buffer A, and loaded onto a butyl-S-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with the same buffer. After extensive washing, a gradient elution with buffer B containing 50% ethylene glycol and 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) was applied. Fractions containing GDH activity (from 35% B to 85% B) were combined and concentrated with a pressurized Amicon (Millipore Corp., Beverly, MA) stir cell. Concentrated samples were rapidly diluted over 20-fold with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and loaded onto an equilibrated Source Q column, and GDH was eluted with a gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl over 20 column volumes in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). The mutant, S397I, always lost its activity during the low salt buffer exchange. Therefore, only hydrophobic interaction column-purified S397I GDH was used in the steady state assays. Assays were conducted using a Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer. The reaction mixture solution contained 10 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer. The reactions were initiated by adding the appropriate amount of enzyme solution, and the steady state rate was measured by monitoring NADH oxidation at 340 nm. Co-crystallization of GDH with ECG was performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Drops were formed using a 2:1 mix of protein and reservoir solutions. The reservoir solution contained 0.9 m sodium chloride, 50 mm triethylammonium-HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mm reduced glutathione, 8–9% polyethylene glycol, 1 m 1,6-hexanediol. The protein stock solution contained 5 mg/ml GDH, 0.4 mm ECG, 3 mm NADPH, and 20 mm sodium glutamate. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after stepwise transfer with a series of cryoprotectant solutions with increasing glycerol concentrations of 4, 9, 15, and 20% (v/v). The artificial reservoir solutions were composed of 18% PEG 8000, 0.4 m 1,6-hexanediol, 0.4 m NaCl, saturated ECG, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm NADPH, 20 mm glutamate, and 50 mm buffer triethylammonium-HCl (pH 7.0). Data sets were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beam line 19ID and processed with the HKL2000 program suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The abortive complex (GDH + GTP + NADPH + glutamate) structure of 1HYZ was used as initial model for molecular replacement with the program CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar). The initial locations and positions of ECG were identified as peaks in difference maps (Fo − Fc) with maximum values of at least ∼5σ. For refinement, 12-fold non-crystallographic restraints were applied to four sections of the protein: residues 10–208, 209–392, 393–444, and 445–489. These segments correspond to the glutamate binding domain, the NAD binding domain, the antenna, and the pivot helix, respectively. These restraints greatly improved the geometry of the model and yielded superior results compared with using the entire subunit as a single segment for non-crystallographic restraints.

The mask including one of the 12 drug molecules and phase recombination was disabled in DM to help remove model bias. The averaged map was then back-transformed, and the phases were applied to the observed structure factors for subsequent averaging. Each map was averaged 10 times, and the final correlation coefficients were ∼99% for each subunit.

In brief, overnight fasted mice were administered with EGCG or water control with the same volume via oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight; 30 min later, all mice were administered a physiological amino acid mixture via oral gavage with a dose of 1.5 g/kg. Blood samples were taken from the tail at the indicated times. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured using a Freestyle flash glucose meter. GDH TG and WT mice were fasted for 18 h and then administered with two doses of EGCG (100 mg/kg) or water (same volume/kg of body weight as EGCG) at fasting time of 18 and 24 h.

The supernatants were collected for insulin assays. Islets were washed twice with cold PBS and then homogenized in PBS buffer, and 2 μl of homogenate was taken for protein determination.

Therefore, the localization of the ECG/EGCG binding site is important to validate the specificity of polyphenol binding, identifies mutation sites for probing the mechanism of inhibition, and is invaluable for drug design. Mammalian GDH crystallizes in an open or closed conformation depending upon the ligands that are added during crystallization. When coenzyme from one side of the reaction is combined with substrate from the other (e.g. NADPH + Glu), the active site is usually closed down upon this tightly bound abortive complex. These crystals typically contain one hexamer per crystallographic asymmetric unit and diffract to better than 2.5 Å resolution. In contrast, without such an abortive complex, there are usually two entire hexamers in the asymmetric unit, the 12 different subunits are often opened to differing degrees, and the crystals do not diffract to resolutions better than 3.2 Å. It was therefore unexpected that GDH + ECG crystallized in the open conformation although high concentrations of NADPH and Glu were added to the crystallization solutions (Table 2). The bound ECG was made evident by a strong (6σ) electron density peak in the difference map (Fig. 1). Although the resolution of these crystals was limited, the electron density was significantly improved by 12-fold non-crystallographic electron density averaging applied to the individual domains. The electron density envelope matches that of the ECG molecule extremely well and allowed for unique positioning of the molecule into its binding pocket. Notably, the active site clefts are partially open, electron density for Glu in the active site is not observed, and the electron density for the bound NADPH is extremely weak and not contiguous. Because the concentrations of NADPH and Glu should have been sufficient to produce crystals of GDH in the closed conformation, this suggests that the addition of ECG decreases the affinity for substrate and coenzyme. This is also consistent with our finding that ECG and EGCG could not be soaked into crystals of GDH in the closed conformation. The location of this peak is beneath the pivot helix and essentially in the same location as the major allosteric activator, ADP (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2085498526,"Amyloidoses constitute a group of diseases in which soluble proteins aggregate and deposit extracellularly in tissues. Nonhereditary apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) amyloid is characterized by deposits of nonvariant protein in atherosclerotic arteries. Despite being common, little is known about the pathogenesis and significance of apoA-I deposition. In this work we investigated by fluorescence and biochemical approaches the impact of a cellular microenvironment associated with chronic inflammation on the folding and pro-amyloidogenic processing of apoA-I. Results showed that mildly acidic pH promotes misfolding, aggregation, and increased binding of apoA-I to extracellular matrix elements, thus favoring protein deposition as amyloid like-complexes. In addition, activated neutrophils and oxidative/proteolytic cleavage of the protein give rise to pro amyloidogenic products. We conclude that, even though apoA-I is not inherently amyloidogenic, it may produce non hereditary amyloidosis as a consequence of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment associated to atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2141779177,"Unlike other synthetic or physiological inhibitors for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the β-amyloid precursor protein-derived inhibitory peptide (APP-IP) having an ISYGNDALMP sequence has a high selectivity toward MMP-2. Our previous study identified amino acid residues of MMP-2 essential for its selective inhibition by APP-IP and demonstrated that the N to C direction of the decapeptide inhibitor relative to the substrate-binding cleft of MMP-2 is opposite that of substrate. However, detailed interactions between the two molecules remained to be clarified. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 in complex with APP-IP. We found that APP-IP in the complex is indeed embedded into the substrate-binding cleft of the catalytic domain in the N to C direction opposite that of substrate. With the crystal structure, it was first clarified that the aromatic side chain of Tyr(3) of the inhibitor is accommodated into the S1' pocket of the protease, and the carboxylate group of Asp(6) of APP-IP coordinates bidentately to the catalytic zinc of the enzyme. The Ala(7) to Pro(10) and Tyr(3) to Ile(1) strands of the inhibitor extend into the nonprime and the prime sides of the cleft, respectively. Therefore, the decapeptide inhibitor has long range contact with the substrate-binding cleft of the protease. This mode of interaction is probably essential for the high MMP-2 selectivity of the inhibitor because MMPs share a common architecture in the vicinity of the catalytic center, but whole structures of their substrate-binding clefts have sufficient variety for the inhibitor to distinguish MMP-2 from other MMPs."

https://openalex.org/W1967725460,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (∼22 nucleotides) regulatory RNAs that can modulate gene expression and are aberrantly expressed in many diseases including cancer. Previous studies have shown that miRNAs inhibit the translation and facilitate the degradation of their targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs) making them attractive candidates for use in cancer therapy. However, the potential clinical utility of miRNAs in cancer therapy rests heavily upon our ability to understand and accurately predict the consequences of fluctuations in levels of miRNAs within the context of complex tumor cells. To evaluate the predictive power of current models, levels of miRNAs and their targeted mRNAs were measured in laser captured micro-dissected (LCM) ovarian cancer epithelial cells (CEPI) and compared with levels present in ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSE). We found that the predicted inverse correlation between changes in levels of miRNAs and levels of their mRNA targets held for only ∼11% of predicted target mRNAs. We demonstrate that this low inverse correlation between changes in levels of miRNAs and their target mRNAs in vivo is not merely an artifact of inaccurate miRNA target predictions but the likely consequence of indirect cellular processes that modulate the regulatory effects of miRNAs in vivo. Our findings underscore the complexities of miRNA-mediated regulation in vivo and the necessity of understanding the basis of these complexities in cancer cells before the therapeutic potential of miRNAs can be fully realized."

https://openalex.org/W2106901270,"Background The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) remains widely used in acute lung injury (ALI) despite known complications and little evidence of improved short-term mortality. Concurrent with NHLBI ARDS Clinical Trials Network Fluid and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT), we conducted a prospectively-defined comparison of healthcare costs and long-term outcomes for care with a PAC vs. central venous catheter (CVC). We explored if use of the PAC in ALI is justified by a beneficial cost-effectiveness profile. Methods We obtained detailed bills for the initial hospitalization. We interviewed survivors using the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 questionnaire at 2, 6, 9 and 12 m to determine quality of life (QOL) and post-discharge resource use. Outcomes beyond 12 m were estimated from federal databases. Incremental costs and outcomes were generated using MonteCarlo simulation. Results Of 1001 subjects enrolled in FACTT, 774 (86%) were eligible for long-term follow-up and 655 (85%) consented. Hospital costs were similar for the PAC and CVC groups ($96.8k vs. $89.2k, p = 0.38). Post-discharge to 12 m costs were higher for PAC subjects ($61.1k vs. 45.4k, p = 0.03). One-year mortality and QOL among survivors were similar in PAC and CVC groups (mortality: 35.6% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.33; QOL [scale: 0–1]: 0.61 vs. 0.66, p = 0.49). MonteCarlo simulation showed PAC use had a 75.2% probability of being more expensive and less effective (mean cost increase of $14.4k and mean loss of 0.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and a 94.2% probability of being higher than the $100k/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Conclusion PAC use increased costs with no patient benefit and thus appears unjustified for routine use in ALI. Trial Registration www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00234767"
https://openalex.org/W1964839431,"Dendritic morphology largely determines patterns of synaptic connectivity and electrochemical properties of a neuron. Neurons display a myriad diversity of dendritic geometries which serve as a basis for functional classification. Several types of molecules have recently been identified which regulate dendrite morphology by acting at the levels of transcriptional regulation, direct interactions with the cytoskeleton and organelles, and cell surface interactions. Although there has been substantial progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of dendrite morphogenesis, the specification of class-specific dendritic arbors remains largely unexplained. Furthermore, the presence of numerous regulators suggests that they must work in concert. However, presently, few genetic pathways regulating dendrite development have been defined.The Drosophila gene turtle belongs to an evolutionarily conserved class of immunoglobulin superfamily members found in the nervous systems of diverse organisms. We demonstrate that Turtle is differentially expressed in Drosophila da neurons. Moreover, MARCM analyses reveal Turtle acts cell autonomously to exert class specific effects on dendritic growth and/or branching in da neuron subclasses. Using transgenic overexpression of different Turtle isoforms, we find context-dependent, isoform-specific effects on mediating dendritic branching in class II, III and IV da neurons. Finally, we demonstrate via chromatin immunoprecipitation, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses that Turtle expression is positively regulated by the Cut homeodomain transcription factor and via genetic interaction studies that Turtle is downstream effector of Cut-mediated regulation of da neuron dendrite morphology.Our findings reveal that Turtle proteins differentially regulate the acquisition of class-specific dendrite morphologies. In addition, we have established a transcriptional regulatory interaction between Cut and Turtle, representing a novel pathway for mediating class specific dendrite development."
https://openalex.org/W2039044675,"Parasitic interactions are often part of complex networks of interspecific relationships that have evolved in biological communities. Despite many years of work on the evolution of parasitism, the likelihood that sister taxa of parasites can co-evolve with their hosts to specifically infect two related lineages, even when those hosts occur sympatrically, is still unclear. Furthermore, when these specific interactions occur, the molecular and physiological basis of this specificity is still largely unknown. The presence of these specific parasitic relationships can now be tested using molecular markers such as DNA sequence variation. Here we test for specific parasitic relationships in an emerging host-parasite model, the stickleback-Schistocephalus system. Threespine and ninespine stickleback fish are intermediate hosts for Schistocephalus cestode parasites that are phenotypically very similar and have nearly identical life cycles through plankton, stickleback, and avian hosts. We analyzed over 2000 base pairs of COX1 and NADH1 mitochondrial DNA sequences in 48 Schistocephalus individuals collected from threespine and ninespine stickleback hosts from disparate geographic regions distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Our data strongly support the presence of two distinct clades of Schistocephalus, each of which exclusively infects either threespine or ninespine stickleback. These clades most likely represent different species that diverged soon after the speciation of their stickleback hosts. In addition, genetic structuring exists among Schistocephalus taken from threespine stickleback hosts from Alaska, Oregon and Wales, although it is much less than the divergence between hosts. Our findings emphasize that biological communities may be even more complex than they first appear, and beg the question of what are the ecological, physiological, and genetic factors that maintain the specificity of the Schistocephalus parasites and their stickleback hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2040932190,"Breast carcinoma cells have a specific pattern of expression for Eph receptors and ephrin ligands. EphB6 has previously been characterized as a signature molecule for invasive breast carcinoma cells. The transcription of EphB6 is silenced in breast carcinoma cells and its re-expression leads to decreased invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells. Such differences in phenotypes of native and EphB6 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells relate to an altered profile of micro RNAs. Comparative hybridization of total RNA to slides containing all known miRNAs by using locked nucleic acid (LNA) miRCURY platform yielded a significantly altered profile of miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with EphB6. After applying a threshold of change and a p-value of <0.001, the list of significantly altered miRNAs included miR-16, miR-23a, miR-24, miR-26a, miR-29a, miR-100, miRPlus-E1172 and miRPlus-E1258. The array-based changes were validated by real-time qPCR of miR-16, miR-23a, miR-24 and miR-100. Except miRPlus-E1172 and miRPlus-E1258, the remaining six miRNAs have been observed in a variety of cancers. The biological relevance of target mRNAs was predicted by using a common-target selection approach that allowed the identification of SMARCA5, SMARCC1, eIF2C2, eIF2C4, eIF4EBP2, FKABP5, FKBP1A, TRIB1, TRIB2, TRIB3, BMPR2, BMPR1A and BMPR1B as important targets of a subset of significantly altered miRNAs. Quantitative PCR revealed that the levels of SMARCC1, eIFC4, eIF4EB2, FKBP1a, FKBP5, TRIB1, TRIB3, BMPR1a and BMPR2 transcripts were significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with EphB6. These observations confirm targeting of specific mRNAs by miR-100, miR-23a, miR-16 and miR-24, and suggest that the kinase-deficient EphB6 receptor is capable of initiating signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus resulting in the altered expression of a variety of genes involved in tumorigenesis and invasion. The alterations in miRNAs and their target mRNAs also suggest indirect involvement of EphB6 in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2058432375,"Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many physiological functions, but its role in pain signaling remains uncertain. Surprisingly, little is known about how endogenous NO affects excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission at the spinal level. Here we determined how NO affects excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to dorsal horn neurons using whole-cell recordings in rat spinal cord slices. The NO precursor L-arginine or the NO donor SNAP significantly increased the frequency of glycinergic spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of lamina II neurons. However, neither L-arginine nor SNAP had any effect on GABAergic IPSCs. L-arginine and SNAP significantly reduced the amplitude of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked from the dorsal root with an increase in paired-pulse ratio. Inhibition of the soluble guanylyl cyclase abolished the effect of L-arginine on glycinergic IPSCs but not on evoked monosynaptic EPSCs. Also, inhibition of protein kinase G blocked the increase in glycinergic sIPSCs by the cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP. The inhibitory effects of L-arginine on evoked EPSCs and high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels expressed in HEK293 cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons were abolished by blocking the S-nitrosylation reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. Intrathecal injection of L-arginine and SNAP significantly increased mechanical nociceptive thresholds. Our findings suggest that spinal endogenous NO enhances inhibitory glycinergic input to dorsal horn neurons through sGC-cGMP-protein kinase G. Furthermore, NO reduces glutamate release from primary afferent terminals through S-nitrosylation of voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels. Both of these actions probably contribute to inhibition of nociceptive transmission by NO at the spinal level."
https://openalex.org/W1978041663,"Migration of dendritic cells (DC) from the tumor environment to the T cell cortex in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) is essential for priming naïve T lymphocytes (TL) to tumor antigen (Ag). We used a mouse model of induced melanoma in which similar oncogenic events generate two phenotypically distinct melanomas to study the influence of tumor-associated inflammation on secondary lymphoid organ (SLO) organization. One tumor promotes inflammatory cytokines, leading to mobilization of immature myeloid cells (iMC) to the tumor and SLO; the other does not. We report that inflammatory tumors induced alterations of the stromal cell network of SLO, profoundly altering the distribution of TL and the capacity of skin-derived DC and TL to migrate or home to TDLN. These defects, which did not require tumor invasion, correlated with loss of fibroblastic reticular cells in T cell zones and in impaired production of CCL21. Infiltrating iMC accumulated in the TDLN medulla and the splenic red pulp. We propose that impaired function of the stromal cell network during chronic inflammation induced by some tumors renders spleens non-receptive to TL and TDLN non-receptive to TL and migratory DC, while the entry of iMC into these perturbed SLO is enhanced. This could constitute a mechanism by which inflammatory tumors escape immune control. If our results apply to inflammatory tumors in general, the demonstration that SLO are poorly receptive to CCR7-dependent migration of skin-derived DC and naïve TL may constitute an obstacle for proposed vaccination or adoptive TL therapies of their hosts."

The cagA gene product, CagA, is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via type IV secretion, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA motifs. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA binds and aberrantly activates the oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which mediates induction of elongated cell morphology (hummingbird phenotype) that reflects CagA virulence. CagA also binds and inhibits the polarity-regulating kinase partitioning-defective 1 (PAR1)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) via the CagA multimerization (CM) sequence independently of tyrosine phosphorylation.

Here we investigated the role of CagA dimerization in induction of the hummingbird phenotype with the use of a chemical dimerizer, coumermycin. We found that CagA dimerization markedly stabilizes the CagA-SHP2 complex and thereby potentiates SHP2 deregulation, causing an increase in the number of hummingbird cells. Protrusions of hummingbird cells induced by chemical dimerization of CagA are further elongated by simultaneous inhibition of PAR1.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium infecting more than half of the global human population. Since its first report in 1984, H. pylori has been shown to cause upper gastrointestinal disorders such as chronic atrophic gastritis and peptic ulcerations. Furthermore, chronic infection with H. pylori strains producing the CagA protein is the highest risk factor for the development of gastric carcinoma (1Hatakeyama M. Nat. Rev.

CagA is encoded by the cagA gene, which is located in the cag pathogenicity island, a DNA segment that also contains a set of genes encoding components of a bacterial microsyringe termed the type IV secretion system (3Tegtmeyer N.

Inside the host cells, CagA underlies tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motif, which is present in variable numbers in the C-terminal region, by Src family kinases and/or Abl kinase (4Backert S. Selbach M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 476-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of CagA from H. pylori isolated in East Asian countries is composed of EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-D segments, each of which contains a single EPIYA motif. Hence, East Asian CagA is structurally defined as ABD-type CagA. On the other hand, the C-terminal region of CagA isolated from the rest of the world (Western CagA) comprises EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and a variable number of Western-specific EPIYA-C segments, which also contain a single EPIYA motif.

SHP2 is expressed in a wide range of cell types, and gain-of-function mutations of SHP2 have been found in a variety of human malignancies, indicating that constitutively activated SHP2 acts as an oncoprotein (7Tartaglia M.

Physiologically, SHP2 functions as a positive regulator of signals generated by growth factor/cytokine stimuli that promote Erk MAP kinase signaling in both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent manners. More recently, SHP2 was found to activate the nuclear Wnt signal through tyrosine dephosphorylation of parafibromin, a component of the RNA polymerase II-associated factor complex (9Takahashi A.

SHP2 possesses two SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) at the N-terminal region, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal tail. The N-SH2 domain interacts with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain, which inhibits phosphatase activity. Binding of phosphotyrosyl peptides to the N- and/or C-SH2 domain induces a conformational change in SHP2 that relieves interaction between the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain and the SH2 domain, resulting in phosphatase activation. The bacterial CagA protein also binds to the SH2 domains of SHP2 and aberrantly activates the phosphatase activity in a manner that is dependent on CagA tyrosine phosphorylation (6Higashi H.

There are four PAR1 isoforms (PAR1a/MARK3, PAR1b/MARK2, PAR1c/MARK1, and PAR1d/MARK4) in mammalian cells, which redundantly phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and thereby regulate stability of microtubules (13Ebneth A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CagA binds to all of the PAR1 family members in a tyrosine phosphorylation-independent manner and inhibits the kinase activity (14Lu H. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23024-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PAR1-binding region of CagA has been shown to be a C-terminal 16-amino acid sequence, which was originally identified as a CagA multimerization (CM) sequence (12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C.

The CagA-SHP2 interaction requires both the N-SH2 and the C-SH2 domains of SHP2, whereas CagA proteins possessing a single EPIYA-C or -D segment can form a stable complex with SHP2 (17Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, a model in which a CagA dimer simultaneously binds to the two SH2 domains of an SHP2 molecule to make a stable CagA-SHP2 complex was reported (12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M. Nature. 2007; 447: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 18Lu H.S. Saito Y. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Zhang H.M. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 2004-2011PubMed Google Scholar). Because PAR1b, and probably other PAR1 members as well, is thought to exist as a dimer in cells, two CagA molecules may be passively dimerized through binding with a PAR1 dimer via the CM sequence (12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M. Nature. 2007; 447: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19Hatakeyama M. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 7047-7054Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The model predicts that the CagA CM sequence is essential not only for the CagA-PAR1 interaction but also for stable CagA-SHP2 complex formation. In this work, we investigated the role of CagA dimerization in the pathophysiological action of CagA using a chemical dimerization technique. We demonstrated that CagA dimerization stabilizes CagA-SHP2 interaction and thereby potentiates deregulation of the SHP2 oncoprotein by CagA. pSP65SRα mammalian expression vectors for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type CagA (ABD-type CagA) and the CagA mutant lacking the CM sequence, CagAΔCM, have been described previously (16Ren S.

A CagA mutant in which the EPIYA motif of the EPIYA-D segment was changed to EPIFA (CagA-ABd) was made by site-directed mutagenesis. The gene encoding CagA-ABd was tagged with the FLAG or HA sequence epitope and was cloned into pSP65SRα. A DNA fragment encoding B-subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase (GyrB)-fused CagAΔCM (GyrB-CagAΔCM) was made from CagAΔCM by introducing a DNA sequence encoding 1–219 amino acids of GyrB into the 5′ end of the cagA gene. The fusion DNA was cloned into pSP65SRα. The DNA fragment encoding FLAG-tagged CagA, FLAG-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM, or HA-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM was cloned into pSP65SRα. A pEF mammalian expression vector for T7-tagged human PAR1b/MARK2 has been described previously (12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 23024-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment encoding FLAG-tagged human PAR1b/MARK2 was cloned into pSP65SRα. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) was used as primary antibody for immunoblotting and immunostaining. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) was used as primary antibody for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Anti-SHP2 polyclonal antibody C-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Millipore), anti-FAK (pY576) phospho-specific polyclonal antibody (BioSource), anti-actin polyclonal antibody C-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-T7 polyclonal antibody (M-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PAR1b antibody (provided by S. Ohno, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan) were used as primary antibodies for immunoblotting. AGS human gastric epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with expression vectors or siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed with Mildform 10N (Wako) for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The fixed cells were then treated with a primary antibody and were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488- or 546-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). F-actin was stained with Alexa Fluor 546-phalloidin (Invitrogen). The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride n-hydrate (DAPI). Images were captured by using a confocal microscope system (TCS-SPE, Leica). The morphology of the AGS cells was observed at 17 h after transfection. AGS cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors. At 8 h after transfection, cells were treated with or without 700 nm coumermycin and were cultured for an additional 9 h. Cell morphology was examined by light microscopy. Cells showing the hummingbird phenotype were counted in 10 different fields in each of three dishes (the area of one field = 0.25 mm2). For detailed cell morphological analysis, the morphology of the AGS cells was captured at 17 h after transfection by using a confocal microscope system (TCS-SPE, Leica). Images of individual cell morphology were analyzed by using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, rsbweb.nih.gov). Hummingbird phenotype was defined as an elongated cell morphology, in which the ratio of the longest protrusion of cell to the shortest cell diameter was more than 2-fold. AGS cells were harvested at 17 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Brij-35, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 mm PMSF). Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins transferred to PVDF membrane filters (Millipore) were incubated in primary antibodies and then visualized by using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Intensities of chemiluminescence on the immunoblotted filters were quantitated by using a luminescence image analyzer (LAS-4000, Fuji Film). PAR1b-specific siRNA-709 has been described previously (14Lu H. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23024-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). siRNA was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. At 24 h after siRNA treatment, cells were transfected with plasmid vectors. At 17 h after plasmid transfection, cells were subjected to cell morphological analysis. Upon delivery into host gastric epithelial cells, H. pylori CagA is thought to passively homodimerize through its interaction with a PAR1 dimer via the CM sequence (12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M. Nature. 2007; 447: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19Hatakeyama M. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 7047-7054Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To formally proof the presence of a PAR1 dimer in cells, AGS human gastric epithelial cells were transiently transfected with a FLAG-tagged PAR1b vector and/or a T7-tagged PAR1b vector. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-T7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, T7-tagged PAR1b was efficiently co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged PAR1b, demonstrating homodimerization of PAR1b in cells. Next, to understand the role of CagA dimerization in its pathophysiological action, we sought to dimerize CagA without the help of PAR1. The PAR1-binding CM sequence is located immediately downstream of the EPIYA-C segment and EPIYA-D segment in the C-terminal region of Western CagA and East Asian CagA, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1) (5Hatakeyama M. Cancer Sci. 2011; 102: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32344-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal 16-amino acid stretch of the EPIYA-C segment is exactly the same as the CM sequence. Accordingly, Western CagA possesses at least two CM sequences, each of which can independently bind to PAR1 (supplemental Fig. 1) (12Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M. Nature. 2007; 447: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Given this structural difference, we chose East Asian CagA (ABD-type CagA isolated from H. pylori strain F32) containing only a single CM sequence. To generate a CagA mutant that can dimerize in the absence of PAR1, we first deleted the CM sequence from CagA and generated a CagA mutant, CagAΔCM. To conditionally dimerize CagAΔCM, we made use of coumermycin, an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces rishiriensis, which consists of two identically substituted coumarin rings joined by a methyl pyrrole (20Gilbert E.J. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Coumermycin specifically binds to the N-terminal subdomain (24 kDa) of GyrB with a stoichiometry of 1:2. Because of this unique binding property, the coumermycin-GyrB dimerization strategy has been successfully applied to the artificial homodimerization of proteins of interest (21Farrar M.A. Alberol-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31318-31324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To chemically dimerize CagA with coumermycin, we fused the GyrB sequence to the N terminus of CagAΔCM and generated GyrB-CagAΔCM (Fig. 1B). The DNA encoding C-terminal HA-tagged CagAΔCM, HA-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM, or FLAG-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM was inserted into a pSP65SRα mammalian expression vector. To characterize biological properties of the CagA mutants in cells, AGS cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for HA-tagged wild-type CagA (ABD-type), HA-tagged CagAΔCM, or HA-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM. Cell lysates were then prepared and were subjected to immunoblotting analysis using an anti-HA antibody. As expected from the primary sequences, CagAΔCM and GyrB-CagAΔCM were detected as 130-, and 154-kDa proteins, respectively, in AGS cells (Fig. 1C). H. pylori-delivered CagA has been shown to localize to the inner side of the plasma membrane (26Higashi H. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y. Ren S. Yuasa H. Saadat I. Murata-Kamiya N. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23130-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Murata-Kamiya N. Kikuchi K. Hayashi T. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 399-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated subcellular distribution of transfected CagA mutants in AGS cells. Immunostaining of cells with an anti-HA antibody showed that both CagAΔCM and GyrB-CagAΔCM were localized to the plasma membrane like wild-type CagA (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates were also prepared from the transfected AGS cells and were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results of the experiment revealed that the GyrB-CagAΔCM mutant underwent tyrosine phosphorylation to levels comparable with that of wild-type CagA in AGS cells (Fig. 2B). The results also showed that coumermycin treatment did not influence the tyrosine phosphorylation level of GyrB-CagAΔCM (Fig. 2B). Hence, both the wild-type CagA and the GyrB-CagAΔCM mutant are localized to the plasma membrane, where they are tyrosine-phosphorylated, in gastric epithelial cells. Given the above described observations, we next investigated whether the GyrB-CagAΔCM mutant expressed in AGS cells is capable of specifically dimerizing in a coumermycin-dependent manner. As a positive control experiment, we co-expressed HA-tagged wild-type CagA vector and FLAG-tagged wild-type CagA vector in AGS cells. Total cell lysates prepared from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. As reported previously (16Ren S. Higashi H. Lu H. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32344-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), HA-tagged wild-type CagA was detectable in FLAG-tagged wild-type CagA immunoprecipitates, indicating that CagA is homodimerized in AGS cells (Fig. 3). AGS cells were then co-transfected with an HA-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM vector and a FLAG-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM vector and were cultured in the presence or absence of coumermycin at a final concentration of 700 nm, which did not induce any toxicity to AGS cells (data not shown). Total cell lysates prepared were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. HA-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM was also co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM from lysates prepared from cells treated with coumermycin but not from lysates prepared from cells without coumermycin treatment (Fig. 3). From these observations, we concluded that GyrB-CagAΔCM was conditionally homodimerized by coumermycin in cells. We next investigated whether chemical dimerization of CagA influences the degree of CagA-SHP2 complex formation. Upon coumermycin treatment of AGS cells transfected with the HA-tagged and FLAG-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM vectors, the amount of SHP2 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged GyrB-CagAΔCM was markedly increased (12.8-fold) (Fig. 3, left panel, third row, second and third lanes). Also notably, the level of SHP2 that co-precipitated with chemically dimerized GyrB-CagAΔCM was comparable with that of SHP2 that co-precipitated with wild-type CagA (Fig. 3, left panel, third row, third and fourth lanes). These observations indicated that CagA dimerization plays a critical role in the formation of a stable CagA-SHP2 complex. Expression of CagA in AGS cells, either by infection with cagA-positive H. pylori or by transfection of a CagA expression vector, induces an elongated cell morphology termed the hummingbird phenotype. The morphological change, which is characterized by development of one or two long protrusions, requires aberrant activation of SHP2 by CagA that has been tyrosine-phosphorylated at the EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segment (6Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 28Segal E.D. Cha J. Lo J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Indeed, a CagA mutant, CagA-ABd, in which the tyrosine residue in the EPIYA-D segment was replaced by non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine, neither bound to SHP2 nor induced the hummingbird phenotype in AGS cells, although it retained the ability to dimerize because of the presence of the PAR1-binding CM sequence (Fig. 4). Notably, the CagA-ABd mutant was tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells because of the presence of the EPIYA-A and -B segments, although the level was less than that of wild-type CagA. We therefore wished to know the contribution of CagA dimerization to induction of the hummingbird phenotype by CagA-activated SHP2. To this end, we examined the hummingbird-inducing potential of a monomeric CagA by transiently transfecting a CagAΔCM vector into AGS cells. In this morphological study, we defined cells showing the hummingbird phenotype (hummingbird cells) as those having cell protrusion, the length of which is more than 2-fold of the length of the shortest diameter of the cell. Although the efficiency was much lower than that induced by wild-type CagA, expression of CagAΔCM was also capable of inducing an elongated cell shape characteristic of the hummingbird phenotype (Fig. 5A). Likewise, expression of GyrB-CagAΔCM in the absence of coumermycin caused the hummingbird phenotype in a very small fraction of transected AGS cells (Fig. 5B). These observations are consistent with the finding that monomeric GyrB-CagAΔCM can still bind to SHP2 in the absence of coumermycin, although the amount of SHP2 bound was much less than that of SHP2 that formed complexes with wild-type CagA (Fig. 3, left panel, third row, compare second and fourth lanes). Because the CagAΔCM mutant has only a single SHP2-binding site (EPIYA-D), the observations also indicate that a monomeric CagA can interact with either the N-SH2 domain or the C-SH2 domain of SHP2 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner to form an unstable CagA-SHP2 complex, which could only weakly induce the hummingbird phenotype because of its transient nature.FIGURE 5Induction of hummingbird phenotype by monomeric and dimeric CagA proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2049907735,"The mechanism of TNF-α-induced insulin resistance has remained unresolved with evidence for down-regulation of insulin effector targets effects or blockade of proximal as well as distal insulin signaling events depending upon the dose, time, and cell type examined. To address this issue we examined the acute actions of TNF-α in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. Acute (5-15 min) treatment with 20 ng/ml (~0.8 nm) TNF-α had no significant effect on IRS1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In contrast, TNF-α increased insulin-stimulated cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 15 through an Erk-dependent pathway and up-regulated the expression of the CDK5 regulator protein p35. In parallel, TNF-α stimulation also resulted in the phosphorylation and GTP loading of the Rho family GTP-binding protein, TC10α. TNF-α enhanced the depolymerization of cortical F-actin and inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, blocked the TNF-α-induced increase in CDK5 phosphorylation and the depolymerization of cortical F-actin. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK5 or treatment with the MEK inhibitor restored the impaired insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation induced by TNF-α. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p44/42 Erk also rescued the TNF-α inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Together, these data demonstrate that TNF-α-mediated insulin resistance of glucose uptake can occur through a MEK/Erk-dependent activation of CDK5."
https://openalex.org/W2081027634,"Conjugation of Nedd8 to a cullin protein, termed neddylation, is an evolutionarily conserved process that functions to activate the cullin-RING family E3 ubiquitin ligases, leading to increased proteasomal degradation of a wide range of substrate proteins. Recent emerging evidence demonstrates that cellular neddylation requires the action of Dcn1, which, in humans, consists of five homologues designated as hDCNL1–5. Here we revealed a previously unknown mechanism that regulates hDCNL1. In cultured mammalian cells ectopically expressed hDCNL1 was mono-ubiquitinated predominantly at K143, K149, and K171. Using a classical chromatographic purification strategy, we identified Nedd4-1 as an E3 ligase that can catalyze mono-ubiquitination of hDCNL1 in a reconstituted ubiquitination system. In addition, the hDCNL1 N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain is necessary and sufficient to mediate mono-ubiquitination. Finally, fluorescence microscopic and subcellular fractionation analyses revealed a role for mono-ubiquitination in driving nuclear export of hDCNL1. Taken together, these results suggest a mono-ubiquitination-mediated mechanism that governs nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of hDCNL1, thereby regulating hDCNL1-dependent activation of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases in selected cellular compartments.

Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Cullins are molecular scaffolds that build multisubunit cullin-RING E3 Ub ligase (CRL) complexes (2Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

CRLs are generally organized in two distinct modules, capable of binding and positioning a substrate, as well as recruiting an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, respectively. Among the best-understood CRLs, SCF (Skp1-Cullin 1-F box protein; CRL1) is composed of four subunits, including cullin 1 (CUL1), Skp1, an F-box protein of substrate targeting function, and the ROC1/Rbx1 RING finger protein capable of recruiting an E2, such as Cdc34 or UbcH5 (4Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 784-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Within SCF, the N terminus of CUL1 anchors the Skp1-F box protein heterodimer, whereas the cullin C terminus docks ROC1/Rbx1. Hence a substrate, once bound to the F-box protein, is positioned within close proximity of a RING domain-tethered E2-S∼Ub. Consequently, the attack of E2-S∼Ub by a substrate lysine results in the transfer of Ub to the target protein. However, in the unmodified state, SCF appears restrained due to the auto-inhibitory interactions between ROC1/Rbx1 and the CUL1 C-terminal tail (5Yamoah K. Oashi T. Sarikas A. Gazdoiu S. Osman R.

Recent studies have provided cell-based evidence that neddylation-induced conformational changes stimulate CRL activities (8Boh B.K. Smith P.G. Hagen T. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ubiquitin leptomycin cullin-RING E3 Ub ligase cullin. Early biochemical experiments have led to reconstitution of the Nedd8 conjugation reaction, termed neddylation, thereby elucidating a mechanistic framework that is similar to ubiquitination (9Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Neddylation commences with the ATP hydrolysis-driven formation of a thiol ester complex, linking the carboxyl end of Nedd8 Gly-76 to an active Cys residue in Nedd8 E1, which is formed by the APP-BP1/Uba3 heterodimer. A trans-thiolation reaction then follows to produce the Ubc12 (E2)-S∼Nedd8 thiol ester (11Huang D.T. Walden H. Duda D. Schulman B.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1958-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, the attack by a conserved cullin lysine, such as CUL1 K720, to Ubc12-S∼Nedd8 yields the cullin-Nedd8 isopeptide bond linkage. In these reconstitution studies, the cullin substrates are in complexes with ROC1/Rbx1 and importantly, the integrity of the RING finger is indispensable for neddylation (9Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was observed that ROC1/Rbx1 binds to Ubc12 directly (12Dharmasiri S. Dharmasiri N. Hellmann H. Estelle M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Morimoto M. Nishida T. Nagayama Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given these findings, it was proposed that the ROC1/Rbx1 RING finger acts as an E3 for cullin neddylation (12Dharmasiri S. Dharmasiri N. Hellmann H. Estelle M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Morimoto M. Nishida T. Nagayama Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies have suggested that cullin neddylation is subject to regulation through the action of Dcn1. Compelling genetic evidence pointed to a requirement for Dcn1 in neddylation in both Caenorhabditis elegans and budding yeast (14Kurz T. Ozlü N. Rudolf F. O'Rourke S.M. Luke B. Hofmann K. Hyman A.A. Bowerman B. Peter M. Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, Dcn1 is necessary for post-meiotic degradation of MEI-1, a process mediated by the CRL3 E3 in a Nedd8-dependent fashion (14Kurz T. Ozlü N. Rudolf F. O'Rourke S.M. Luke B. Hofmann K. Hyman A.A. Bowerman B. Peter M. Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of yeast Dcn1 revealed a conserved, C-terminally located PONY domain (15Yang X. Zhou J. Sun L. Wei Z. Gao J. Gong W. Xu R.M. Rao Z. Liu Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 2008; 29: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was shown that in yeast, the acidic DAD patch of the Dcn1 PONY domain interacts with cullins and that this interaction appears critical for stimulating cullin neddylation in vitro (16Kurz T. Chou Y.C. Willems A.R. Meyer-Schaller N. Hecht M.L. Tyers M. Peter M. Sicheri F. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). More recently, an elegant biochemical and structural study by Schulman and co-workers (17Scott D.C. Monda J.K. Grace C.R. Duda D.M. Kriwacki R.W. Kurz T. Schulman B.A. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 784-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that yeast Dcn1 acts as a co-E3 that facilitates ROC1/Rbx1 for neddylation. In humans, five Dcn1 homologues were identified and they are designated as hDCNL1-5 (14Kurz T. Ozlü N. Rudolf F. O'Rourke S.M. Luke B. Hofmann K. Hyman A.A. Bowerman B. Peter M. Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Meyer-Schaller N. Chou Y.C. Sumara I. Martin D.D. Kurz T. Katheder N. Hofmann K. Berthiaume L.G. Sicheri F. Peter M. Proc.

Of hDCNL1–5, hDCNL1, and hDCNL2 closely resemble yeast Dcn1, containing both the N-terminal UBA (ubiquitin-binding domain) and C-terminal PONY domains. On the other hand, hDCNL3–5 only share the conserved PONY domain but containing distinct N termini. The complexity of the DCNL family proteins points to a possibility that mammals may employ diversified mechanisms to regulate Dcn1-dependent cullin neddylation, thereby altering CRL activities in response to developmental or environmental cues. Indeed, hDCNL1 (also named SCCRO) is highly amplified in tumors including squamous cell carcinomas (19Sarkaria I. O-charoenrat P. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G. Ngai I. Maghami E. Patel K.N. Lee B.

Marcone A. Benussi L. Gallone S. Scalabrini D. Cortini F. Serpente M. Martinelli Boneschi F. Cappa S. Binetti G. Mariani C. Rainero I. Giordana M.T. Bresolin N. Scarpini E. Galimberti D. Eur. J. Neurol. 2009; 16: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hDCNL3 level drops in liver, bladder, and renal tumors (21Ma T. Shi T. Huang J. Wu L. Hu F. He P. Deng W. Gao P. Zhang Y. Song Q. Ma D. Qiu X. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 2128-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that hDCNL3 localizes to the plasma membrane through a conserved N-terminal membrane motif (18Meyer-Schaller N. Chou Y.C. Sumara I. Martin D.D. Kurz T. Katheder N. Hofmann K. Berthiaume L.G. Sicheri F. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hDCNL1 appears critical for CUL1 neddylation in the nucleus (22Huang G. Kaufman A.J. Ramanathan Y. Singh B. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10297-10304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we discovered that ectopically expressed hDCNL1 is mono-ubiquitinated. Biochemical chromatographic and reconstitution experiments suggest Nedd4-1 as a likely E3 that catalyzes the mono-ubiquitination of hDCNL1. Finally, results from fluorescence microscopic and subcellular fractionation experiments point to a role for mono-ubiquitination in driving nuclear export of hDCNL1. The human hDCNL1 coding sequence was purchased from Invitrogen (UltimateTM ORF clone ID IOH12273). Using the Gateway® recombination system (Invitrogen), four expression vectors were created: pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1 and pDEST27-GST-hDCNL1 for expression in mammalian cell culture, as well as pDEST15-GST-hDCNL1 and pDEST17-His-hDCNL1 for expression in bacteria. To express individual domains, we constructed pDEST15-GST-hDCNL1 (1–57) and pDEST15-GST-hDCNL1 (58–259). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange®, Stratagene) was employed using pDEST15-GST-hDCNL1 as template and the truncations were recombined into Gateway® destination vectors. The primers for hDCNL1 (1–57) are: (5′)-GTACAAAAAAGCAGGCACCATGGGATCATTGGACAGGAAGAAG-3′) and (5′-CTTCTTCCTGTCCAATGATCCCATGGTGCCTGCTTTTTTGTAC-3′). The primers for hDCNL1 (58–259) are: (5′-CGAGA GAGTGTAAAATGATCATTGGACAGGAAGAAG-3′) and (5′-CTTCTTCCTGTCCAATGATCATTTTACACTCTCTCG-3′). QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis was also used to create the triple lysine mutant plasmid, pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1 3KR in two steps. In step 1, pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1 was used as template to generate pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1 K143R/K149R using a pair of mutagenic primers: (5′-GCCCAGATACCCAGGATGGAACAAGAATTGAGAGAACCAGGAGG-3′) and (5′-CCTCCTGGTTCTCTCAATTCTTGTTCCATCCTGGGTATCTGGGC-3′). In step 2, pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1 K143R/K149R was used as template using the K171R-mutagenic primers: (5′-GCAAAGAATCCAGGACAAAGAGGATTAGATCTAGAAATG-3′) and (5′-CATTTCTAGATCTAATCCTCTTTGTCCTGGATTCTTTGC-3′). To carry out subcellular localization studies, we constructed pcDNA-DEST53-GFP-hDCNL1 using the Gateway® recombination system. We created pcDNA-DEST53-GFP-hDCNL1-UbΔG75G76 using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and PCR (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche). The primers for site-directed mutagenesis are: (5′-GCTGGGACAAAAAGTACAACAGTGGGTACCCAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGG-3′) and (5′-CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTACCCACTGTTGTACTTTTTGTCCCAGC-3′). The primers for PCR amplification of UbΔG75G76 are: (5′-CCCGGTACCATGCAGATCTTCGTGAAGACTCTG-3′) and (5′-CCCGGTACCTCATCTGAGACGGAGTACCAGGTGCAAG-3′). The engineered KpnI sites used for cloning are underlined. To construct pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1-UbΔG75G76, pcDNA-DEST53-GFP-hDCNL1-UbΔG75G76 was used as template to retrieve the sequence that encodes for hDCNL1-UbΔG75G76 through a PCR reaction using the primers: (5′-CACCATGAACAAGTTGAAATCATCGCAG-3′) and (5′-TCATCTGAGACGGAGTACCAGGTGCAAG-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was then subcloned into pENTR/d-TOPO, which was subsequently recombined with pcDNA3.1-nV5-DEST. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For reactions shown in Fig. 1B, reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, Nedd8 (1.5 μm), APP-BP1/Uba3 (7.5 nm), ROC1-CUL1 (324–776) (0.25 μm), and Ubc12 (in amounts as specified). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reaction products were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, followed by anti-Flag immunoblot analysis to visualize Flag-CUL1 (324–776). The levels of reaction products were quantified by Odyssey® infrared imager (LI-COR). For reactions shown in Fig. 1, C and D, 32P-Nedd8 was used for neddylation. For this purpose, Nedd8 was initially phosphorylated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) that contained PK-Nedd8 (35 μg), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 25 μm ATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5 units of cAMP kinase (Sigma). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To conjugate 32P-Nedd8 to CUL1, 32P-Nedd8 (1 μl) was incubated in a reaction (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, APP-BP1/Uba3 (3.3 nm), Ubc12 (3 nm), and ROC1-CUL1324–776 (0.25 μm), in the presence or absence of GST-hDCNL1 (1.2 μm or as indicated). The incubation was at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction products were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, quantified by phosphoimager analysis, and presented graphically. To map the hDCNL1 ubiquitination sites, we developed a procedure for affinity-purification of hDCNL1 in a stable HEK293 cell line (GD11) that was engineered to constitutively express GST-hDCNL1. The GD11 cell line was generated using a protocol as described previously (23Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16601-16606Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells, maintained in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 100 μg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)), were plated at an approximate density of 1 × 106 cells per plate (10 cm). At 20–24 h after plating, pDEST27TM-GST-hDCNL1 (8 μg) was co-transfected with a plasmid containing the puromycin selection marker (2 μg) using Fugene® 6 transfection reagent (Roche). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, diluted at a ratio of 1:5, 1:50, or 1:500 and subsequently plated onto 15 cm plates with growth medium containing puromycin (2.5 μg/ml). The selection medium was changed daily to remove dead cells in the subsequent 3 days and then every third day for another 2 weeks. Well-isolated colonies, becoming visible 10–15 days after the initial puromycin treatment, were picked by suction using a sterile 1 ml pipette tip and were placed into individual wells of 24-well plates containing the selection medium. The positive clones were identified by screening for expression of GST-hDCNL1 via immunoblot analysis. 50 150-cm plates of GD11 cells were grown in the presence of selection medium until confluent. After harvest, cell extracts (100 mg of protein, 2 mg/ml) were adsorbed to glutathione beads (2 ml) by rocking overnight at 4 °C. The beads were than washed with 40 ml of Buffer A (15 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.35% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml of antipain, and 2 μg/ml of leupeptin), and 20 ml of Buffer B (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml of antipain, and 2 μg/ml of leupeptin) plus 50 mm NaCl). The bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of Buffer B plus 20 mm glutathione then concentrated ∼40-fold using an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore). A sample of the eluate was subject to 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue. The slow-migrating species of GST-hDCNL1 was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry using methods as described (24Jones J. Wu K. Yang Y. Guerrero C. Nillegoda N. Pan Z.Q. Huang L. J.

Reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 40 mm CrPO4, pH7.7, 1 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 1 μg of purified GST-hDCNL1 (or GST), 0.5 μg of UbcH5c, E1 (15 ng), and 50 μg of HeLa extract proteins, prepared as described previously (26Wu K.

Following extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted by SDS, separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-GST antibody. The hDCNL1 E3 was isolated from HeLa extracts based on its ability to catalyze the mono-ubiquitination of hDCNL1, as monitored by immunoblot assays. HeLa cell extracts (11 mg of protein/ml, 120 ml) were prepared as described previously (26Wu K. Yamoah K. Dolios G. Gan-Erdene T. Tan P. Chen A. Lee C.G. Wei N. Wilkinson K.D. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. J.

The extracts were chromatographed through a Mono Q HR 10/10 (Amersham Biosciences) in 4 batches. Bound protein was eluted by 160 ml-gradient of 0.025–0.7 m NaCl. Active fractions, eluted at around 200 mm NaCl, were pooled (90 mg of protein), and concentrated ∼20-fold using an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore). The resulting protein (51 mg) was then chromatographed by FPLC using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 13 batches. Active fractions were tracked, pooled (32 mg), and re-chromatographed through Mono Q HR 10/10 (Amersham Biosciences) in 2 batches. Bound protein was eluted by a 160-ml gradient of 0.025–0.5 m NaCl. Active fractions, eluted again at around 200 mm NaCl, were pooled (10 mg of protein), and concentrated ∼30-fold using an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore). All the eluted materials were subject to glycerol gradient sedimentation with buffer B containing 15–35% of glycerol plus 25 mm NaCl in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman) with a SW50.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 20 h. To identify hDCNL1 E3, the active fractions from the glycerol gradient were pooled and concentrated (5.4 mg of total protein). Samples were then loaded onto 4–20% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Each band was then excised and analyzed via mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as described previously (24Jones J. Wu K. Yang Y.

Reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, GST-hDCNL1, or His-hDCNL1 (35 pmol), Ub (1.5 μg), E1 (15 ng), UbcH5c (0.5 μg), and Nedd4-1 (50 ng or as indicated). Production of mono-ubiquitinated products, resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, was quantified by Odyssey® infrared imager (LI-COR) and is presented graphically. U2OS cells (1 × 105) were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes overnight and transfected with pcDNATM-DEST53-GFP-hDCNL1 or pcDNATM-DEST53-GFP-hDCNL1-UbΔG75G76. At 48-h post-transfection, the cells attached to the coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, then mounted on slides using Prolong® antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Where indicated, at 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with Leptomycin B (LMB, Calbiochem) with a concentration of 1, 5, or 25 ng/ml and cultured for another 24 h before fixing. Fluorescent microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan2 IE epi-fluorescence microscope. In each set, >150 cells were examined and the percentage of cells with GFP-hDCNL1 or GFP-hDCNL1-UbDG75G76 enriched in nucleus or cytoplasm was calculated and shown graphically. For nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation experiments 10-cm dishes of HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1 or pCDNA3.1-nV5-hDCNL1-UbΔG75G76 plasmid using FuGENE® HD (Roche) for 48 h as per manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then harvested and extracted using NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. The extracts were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Purified Nedd4-1 was prepared as described previously (27Wang X. Shi Y. Wang J. Huang G. Jiang X. Biochem.

The commercial sources for antibodies are: anti-Nedd4-1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-laminA/C (Millipore), and anti-tubulin (Sigma). We sought to determine whether hDCNL1 activates cullin neddylation. For this purpose, we expressed and purified recombinant hDCNL1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). To assess the effects of purified hDCNL1 in neddylation, we employed the reconstituted neddylation assay that consists of purified Nedd8, APP-BP1/Uba3 (as E1), Ubc12 (as E2), and ROC1-CUL1324–776 (as the RING-tethered substrate complex). Previous studies have established ROC1-CUL1324–776 as an efficient substrate for in vitro neddylation (10Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Wu K. Yamoah K. Dolios G. Gan-Erdene T. Tan P. Chen A. Lee C.G. Wei N. Wilkinson K.D. Wang R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and moreover, recent work has revealed a direct interaction between this complex and hDCNL1 (16Kurz T. Chou Y.C. Willems A.R. Meyer-Schaller N. Hecht M.L. Tyers M. Peter M. Sicheri F. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As shown, more than 40% of CUL1 substrate was converted to the neddylated form when 100 nm of Ubc12 was used (Fig. 1B, lane 6; graph). Decreasing the concentration of Ubc12 by a factor of 10 diminished neddylation (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Under this condition, addition of GST-hDCNL1 at concentrations 4 or 12 times greater than CUL1 markedly stimulated neddylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5; graph). The stimulatory effect was also observed at high concentrations of Ubc12, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–8; graph). To more quantitatively evaluate the hDCNL1-mediated activation of CUL1 neddylation in vitro, we employed the reconstituted neddylation assay with radioactive Nedd8, as it was established previously (26Wu K. Yamoah K. Dolios G. Gan-Erdene T. Tan P. Chen A. Lee C.G. Wei N. Wilkinson K.D. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28882-28891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The results revealed that GST-hDCNL1 stimulated neddylation by a factor of five in the presence of low concentration of Ubc12 (Fig. 1C). In addition, the hDCNL1-mediated activation of CUL1 neddylation was inhibited by addition of salt (Fig. 1D). This finding is in keeping with the previous observations that electrostatic interactions between yeast Dcn1 and cullin play critical roles in establishing contacts between these components (16Kurz T. Chou Y.C. Willems A.R. Meyer-Schaller N. Hecht M.L. Tyers M. Peter M. Sicheri F. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Of note, His-hDCNL1 activated CUL1 neddylation as well (data not shown). In all, these results demonstrate that hDCNL1 activates CUL1 neddylation directly, with the most pronounced effect seen in the presence of low concentration of Ubc12. However, the extent of the hDCNL1-mediated stimulation was significantly lower than that observed with yeast Dcn1 (17Scott D.C. Monda J.K. Grace C.R. Duda D.M. Kriwacki R.W. Kurz T.

To evaluate the effects of hDCNL1 in cellular neddylation, we first co-transfected HEK293 cells with vectors expressing V5-Nedd8 and GST-hDCNL1 or GST-Gus (as a control). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis revealed that expression of GST-hDCNL1, but not GST-Gus, led to increased accumulation of high molecular weight V5-Nedd8 conjugates (Fig. 1E, lane 1). This finding suggested that hDCNL1 activates conjugation of Nedd8 to cellular proteins. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, GST-hDCNL1, but not GST-Gus, increased the yield of neddylated Flag-CUL1 (Fig. 1E, lane 4). Similarly, co-expression of V5-hDCNL1 stimulated the neddylation of Myc-CUL3 (Fig. 1F). Under these conditions, overexpression of V5-hDCNL1 did not affect the cellular neddylation of CUL2 or CUL4A (data not shown). Future work is required to determine whether hDCNL1 selectively stimulate the neddylation of a subset of cullins. Of note, significant cross-reactivity of commercially available anti-cullin antibodies has precluded a reliable assessment of the effect of hDCNL1 in the neddylation of endogenous cullins. Taken together, these observations suggest a direct role for hDCNL1 in activating in vitro neddylation of CUL1 and in vivo neddylation of CUL1 and CUL3. When expressed in HEK293T cells, GST-hDCNL1 exhibited two forms: one corresponding to unmodified species and the other migrating significantly slower (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with this finding, two forms of V5-hDCNL1 were also detected in transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). To determine if this modified hDCNL1 species resulted from mono-ubiquitination, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with vectors expressing GST-hDCNL1 and HA-Ub. The results of glutathione pull-down and immunoblot experiments showed that the co-expression of HA-Ub led to the formation of a GST-hDCNL1 species that corresponded to GST-hDCNL1-HA-Ub (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 3). This species disappeared in the absence of HA-Ub (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 4). Of note, the modified form of GST-hDCNL1 that migrated slightly faster than GST-hDCNL1-HA-Ub (Fig. 2C,"

In a previous study we have shown that the cholinergic axonal segments which were in the microproximity with dopaminergic fibers possessed a greater density of en passant varicosities compared to more distant segments, suggesting an activity-dependent level of en passant varicosities in the axonal zone of interaction. To further evaluate this plastic relationship, the density of cholinergic varicosities was quantified on fiber segments within the microproximity of activated or non-activated pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Repetitive 14 days patterned visual stimulation paired with an electrical stimulation of the cholinergic fibers projecting to the mPFC from the HDB was performed to induce persistent axonal plastic changes. The c-Fos early gene immunoreactivity was used as a neuronal activity marker of layer V pyramidal cells, labelled with anti-glutamate transporter EAAC1. Cholinergic fibers were labeled with anti-ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) immunostaining. The density of ChAT+ varicosities on and the length of fiber segments within the 3 µm microproximity of c-Fos positive/negative pyramidal cells were evaluated on confocal images. More than 50% of the pyramidal cells in the mPFC were c-Fos immunoreactive. Density of ChAT+ varicosities was significantly increased within 3 µm vicinity of activated pyramidal cells (0.50±0.01 per µm of ChAT+ fiber length) compared to non-activated cells in this group (0.34±0.001; p≤0.05) or control rats (0.32±0.02; p≤0.05). Different types of stimulation (visual, HDB or visual/HDB) induced similar increase of the density of ChAT+ varicosities within microproximity of activated pyramidal cells. This study demonstrated at the subcellular level an activity-dependent enrichment of ChAT+ varicosities in the axonal zone of interaction with other neuronal elements."
https://openalex.org/W2015708881,"In order to further understand the mechanisms involved in planning an aggressive act, we conducted an event-related potential (ERP) study of young men with and without a history of violence. Participants completed a competitive reaction time task (based on the Taylor aggression paradigm) against a virtual opponent. In ""passive"" blocks, participants were punished by the opponent when losing the trial but could not punish, when winning, whereas in ""active"" blocks, participants were able to punish the opponent when winning, but were not punished when losing. Participants selected punishment strength in a decision phase prior to each reaction time task and were informed whether they had won or lost in the outcome phase. Additionally, a flanker task was conducted to assess basic performance monitoring. Violent participants selected stronger punishments, especially in ""active"" blocks. During the decision phase, a frontal P200 was more pronounced for violent participants, whereas non-violent participants showed an enhanced frontal negativity around 300 ms. The P200 might reflect the decision to approach the opponent at a very early state, the latter negativity could reflect inhibition processes, leading to a more considerate reaction in non-violent participants. During the outcome phase, a Feedback-Related Negativity was seen in both groups. This effect was most pronounced when losing entailed a subsequent inability to retaliate. The groups did not differ in the flanker task, indicating intact basic performance monitoring. Our data suggest that the planning of an aggressive act is associated with distinct brain activity and that such activity is differentially represented in violent and non-violent individuals."

The consequences of its inactivation in adult mice, and of the ensuing activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), have been explored mainly in a tissue-specific manner. This mid-gestation lethality can be also circumvented by using a floxed Vhl allele in combination with an ubiquitous tamoxifen-inducible recombinase Cre-ER(T2). Here, we characterize a widespread reduction in Vhl gene expression in Vhl(floxed)-UBC-Cre-ER(T2) adult mice after dietary tamoxifen administration, a convenient route of administration that has yet to be fully characterized for global gene inactivation. Vhl gene inactivation rapidly resulted in a marked splenomegaly and skin erythema, accompanied by renal and hepatic induction of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, indicative of the in vivo activation of the oxygen sensing HIF pathway. We show that acute Vhl gene inactivation also induced Epo gene expression in the heart, revealing cardiac tissue to be an extra-renal source of EPO. Indeed, primary cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cardiac cells both induce Epo gene expression when exposed to low O(2) tension in a HIF-dependent manner. Thus, as well as demonstrating the potential of dietary tamoxifen administration for gene inactivation studies in UBC-Cre-ER(T2) mouse lines, this data provides evidence of a cardiac oxygen-sensing VHL/HIF/EPO pathway in adult mice."

We identified Schizosaccharomyces pombe mcb1(+) (Mcm-binding protein 1), an apparent orthologue of the human MCM-binding protein that associates with a subset of MCM complex proteins. mcb1(+) is an essential gene. Deletion of mcb1(+) caused cell cycle arrest after several generations with a cdc phenotype and disrupted nuclear structure. Mcb1 is an abundant protein, constitutively present across the cell cycle. It is widely distributed in cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and bound to chromatin. Co-immunoprecipitation suggested that Mcb1 interacts robustly with Mcm3-7 but not Mcm2. Overproduction of Mcb1 disrupted the association of Mcm2 with other MCM proteins, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication, DNA damage, and activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1. Thus, Mcb1 appears to antagonize the function of MCM helicase."
https://openalex.org/W1998499190,"The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, compartmentalizes some metabolic enzymes within peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. The amounts, activities, and types of glycosomal enzymes are modulated coincident with developmental and environmental changes. Pexophagy (fusion of glycosomes with acidic lysosomes) has been proposed to facilitate this glycosome remodeling. Here, we report that, although glycosome-resident enzyme T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) protein levels are maintained during pexophagy, acidification inactivates the activity. Glycerol 3-phosphate, which is produced in vivo by a glycosome-resident glycerol kinase, mitigated acid inactivation of lysate-derived TbHK activity. Using recombinant TbHK1, we found that glycerol 3-P influenced enzyme activity at pH 6.5 by preventing substrate and product inhibition by ATP and ADP, respectively. Additionally, TbHK1 inhibition by the flavonol quercetin (QCN) was partially reversed by glycerol 3-P at pH 7.4, whereas at pH 6.5, enzyme activity in the presence of QCN was completely maintained by glycerol 3-P. However, glycerol 3-P did not alter the interaction of QCN with TbHK1, as the lone Trp residue (Trp-177) was quenched under all conditions tested. These findings suggest potential novel mechanisms for the regulation of TbHK1, particularly given the acidification of glycosomes that can be induced under a variety of parasite growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1992782759,"The sequencing of the human genome holds out the hope for personalized medicine, but it is clear that analysis of DNA or RNA content alone is not sufficient to understand most disease processes. Proteomic strategies that allow unbiased identification of proteins and their post-transcriptional and -translation modifications are an essential complement to genomic strategies. However, the enormity of the proteome and limitations in proteomic methods make it difficult to determine the targets that are particularly relevant to human disease. Methods are therefore needed that allow rational identification of targets based on function and relevance to disease. Screening methodologies such as phage display, SELEX, and small-molecule combinatorial chemistry have been widely used to discover specific ligands for cells or tissues of interest, such as tumors. Those ligands can be used in turn as affinity probes to identify their cognate molecular targets when they are not known in advance. Here we report an easy, robust and generally applicable approach in which phage particles bearing cell- or tissue-specific peptides serve directly as the affinity probes for their molecular targets. For proof of principle, the method successfully identified molecular binding partners, three of them novel, for 15 peptides specific for pancreatic cancer."

These fatty acids have often been investigated individually. We explored associations between global patterns in adipose tissue fatty acids and changes in anthropometry. Methods 34 fatty acid species from adipose tissue biopsies were determined in a random sample of 1100 men and women from a Danish cohort study. We used sex-specific principal component analysis and multiple linear regression to investigate the associations of adipose tissue fatty acid patterns with changes in weight, waist circumference (WC), and WC controlled for changes in body mass index (WCBMI), adjusting for confounders. Results 7 principal components were extracted for each sex, explaining 77.6% and 78.3% of fatty acid variation in men and women, respectively. Fatty acid patterns with high levels of TFA tended to be positively associated with changes in weight and WC for both sexes. Patterns with high levels of n-6 LC-PUFA tended to be negatively associated with changes in weight and WC in men, and positively associated in women. Associations with patterns with high levels of n-3 LC-PUFA were dependent on the context of the rest of the fatty acid pattern. Conclusions Adipose tissue fatty acid patterns with high levels of TFA may be linked to weight gain, but patterns with high n-3 LC-PUFA did not appear to be linked to weight loss. Associations depended on characteristics of the rest of the pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2031049963,"Introduction The hypothesis that paracetamol might increase the risk of asthma and other allergic diseases have gained support from a range of independent studies. However, in studies based in developed countries, the possibility that paracetamol and asthma are associated through aspirin avoidance is difficult to exclude. Objectives To explore this hypothesis among women in a developing country, where we have previously reported aspirin avoidance to be rare. Methods In 2005/6 a population based cohort of 1065 pregnant women was established in Butajira, Ethiopia and baseline demographic data collected. At 3 years post birth, an interview-based questionnaire administered to 945 (94%) of these women collected data on asthma, eczema, and hay fever in the past 12 month, frequency of paracetamol use and potential confounders. Allergen skin tests to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and cockroach were also performed. The independent effects of paracetamol use on allergic outcomes were determined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Findings The prevalence of asthma, eczema and hay fever was 1.7%, 0.9% and 3.8% respectively; of any one of these conditions 5.5%, and of allergen sensitization 7.8%. Paracetamol use in the past month was reported by 29%, and associations of borderline significance were seen for eczema (adjusted OR (95% CI) = 8.51 (1.68 to 43.19) for 1–3 tablets and 2.19 (0.36 to 13.38) for ≥4 tablets, compared to no tablets in the past month; overall p = 0.055) and for ‘any allergic condition’ (adjusted OR (95% CI) = 2.73 (1.22 to 6.11) for 1–3 tablets and 1.35 (0.67 to 2.70) for ≥4 tablets compared to 0 in the past month; overall p = 0.071). Conclusions This study provides further cross-sectional evidence that paracetamol use increases the risk of allergic disease."

One key mechanism in leukemogenesis is increased self renewal of leukemic stem cells via aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Either X-RAR, PML/RARα and PLZF/RARα or AML-1/ETO activate Wnt signaling by upregulating γ-catenin and β-catenin. In a prospective study, a lower risk of leukemia was observed with aspirin use, which is consistent with numerous studies reporting an inverse association of aspirin with other cancers. Furthermore, a reduction in leukemia risk was associated with use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), where the effects on AML risk was FAB subtype-specific. To better investigate whether NSAID treatment is effective, we used Sulindac Sulfide in X-RARα-positive progenitor cell models. Sulindac Sulfide (SSi) is a derivative of Sulindac, a NSAID known to inactivate Wnt signaling. We found that SSi downregulated both β-catenin and γ-catenin in X-RARα-expressing cells and reversed the leukemic phenotype by reducing stem cell capacity and increasing differentiation potential in X-RARα-positive HSCs. The data presented herein show that SSi inhibits the leukemic cell growth as well as hematopoietic progenitors cells (HPCs) expressing PML/RARα, and it indicates that Sulindac is a valid molecular therapeutic approach that should be further validated using in vivo leukemia models and in clinical settings."

In addition, the polo-box domain of Plk1 can function as a dominant negative mutant and is essential for cytokinesis (17Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In several studies, Plk1 phosphorylation was found to induce polo-box targeting through a conformational change; however, catalytic activation did not appear to be a critical factor in the function of Plk1 (19Jang Y.J.

These findings suggested that the polo-box of Plk1 plays an essential role in the function of Plk1, particularly in spatial distribution and physical interaction with substrates. In addition to posttranslational modification and structural function of Plk1 in mitotic cells, Plk1 has also been reported to be an important regulator of various target molecules involved in cell cycle-related events in many organisms. Ran is one of the Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins. Unlike Ras, Ran has no lipid modification site at the C-terminal end. Ran plays a role in various cellular processes, including nuclear transport, mitotic spindle assembly, nuclear envelope formation, and postmitotic nuclear assembly (21Clarke P.R. Zhang C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Gradients of Ran-GTP are established through localization of its regulators, and the intrinsic rates of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis of Ran are activated by RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and RanGAP1, a GTPase-activating protein-1 (22Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 23Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). During interphase, RCC1 is localized on chromatin, whereas RanGAP1 is present in cytoplasm. Thus, RCC1 and RanGAP1 regulate the state of the guanine nucleotide, which binds to Ran. Conversely, during mitosis, RCC1 is phosphorylated by CDK1-cyclin B protein kinase, and its phosphorylation allows dynamic interaction with chromosomes (24Li H.Y. Zheng Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 512-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similar to RCC1, phosphorylation of RanGAP1 is required at the onset of mitosis and remains associated with RanBP2 in the GTP-GDP state of the Ran cycle during progression through mitosis (25Swaminathan S. Kiendl F. Körner R. Lupetti R. Hengst L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ran-binding protein-1 (RanBP1) is a cell cycle-dependent regulator of the Ran network in mammalian cells (26Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C. Tripodi M. Jansen-Durr P. Lavia P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1213-1224PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of RanBP1 occurs during mitosis, and its overexpression prolongs mitosis (27Guarguaglini G. Renzi L. D'Ottavio F. Di Fiore B. Casenghi M. Cundari E. Lavia P. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 455-465PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of bipolar spindle formation in Xenopus egg extracts was found to occur by the addition of RanBP1 (28Kalab P. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 481-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, RanBP1 is an inhibitor of RCC1 GEF activity, which suggests that an elevated concentration of RCC1 induces a reversal of the inhibitory effect of RanBP1 (29Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Regulation of centrosome cohesion, chromosome segregation, and microtubule regulation during mitosis by mammalian RanBP1 through overexpression of RanBP1, antibody microinjection, and RNA interference experiments has been recently reported (30Di Fiore B.

Roscioli E. Rensen W.M. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3748-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ran-binding protein-3 (RanBP3), a member of the Ran-binding protein family, is phosphorylated by the Ras/ERK or PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of RanBP3 contributes to establishment of a Ran gradient and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport (32Yoon S.O. Shin S. Liu Y. Ballif B.A. Woo M.S. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 362-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite the dynamic functions of RanGTPase and its regulators, the clear mechanism of RanBP1 regulation in mammalian cells has not yet been elucidated. It will be of interest to determine whether RanBP1 is phosphorylated during mitosis and whether it is one of the targets of Plk1. In this study, we suggested that phosphorylation of RanBP1 by Plk1 plays a crucial role in the Ran network system, which is related to microtubule nucleation and function during mitosis. The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (F1804, Sigma-Aldrich), α-tubulin (T5168, Sigma-Aldrich), γ-tubulin (T6557, Sigma-Aldrich), Plk1 (33-1700, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and Ran (610340, Pharmingen); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Plk1 (Thr-210) (KAP-CC107, Stressgene), RanBP1 (sc-28576, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), RanBP1 (ab97659, Abcam), cyclin B1 (sc-752, Santa Cruz), and FLAG (F7425, Sigma-Aldrich); and goat polyclonal antibodies against Ran (sc-1156, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (BioWhittaker) at 37 °C. To obtain cells arrested in the late G1 phase and early mitotic cells, cells were treated with mimosine (300 μm) for 16 h and nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 10 h, respectively. The standard calcium chloride technique for transfection was conducted as previously described with modification (17Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Briefly, Plk1 protein was expressed in insect cells and purified using appropriate affinity column chromatography. The purified Plk1 protein was used in the kinase assays as a kinase source. Plk1, Ran, and RanBP1 was amplified from human cDNA constructs, and point mutations at the indicated residues in the Plk or RanBP1 were generated by recombinant PCR. All PCR products were cloned into pGEX vector (Promega) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by the induction of isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside and confirmed by Western blot analysis using appropriate anti-RanBP1 antibody. To generate recombinant virus of Plk1, the pGEX constructs were transferred into pAcGHLT vector (Pharmingen), and the expressed proteins were purified for further experiments (17Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y.

To express proteins in mammalian cells, all constructs were cloned into pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene), which contains FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope in the N terminus of the gene, or pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) for detection of subcellular localization. To purify the GST-tagged proteins, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α, after which they were purified to homogeneity from cell extracts using glutathione-agarose 4B (Peptron). GST-conjugated proteins were incubated with mitotic HeLa extracts. After pulling down the beads, proteins bound to the tagged protein were detected using appropriate antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs. After 16 h of nocodazole treatment, mitotic cells collected by shake-off were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The total cell extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG/protein G-PLUS beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and then finally, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 16 h at 4 °C. They were incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase A for 2 h at room temperature and treated with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide for detection of DNA amounts. The bivariate levels of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and PI-DNA content (red) fluorescence were determined using a FACSCaliburTM system (BD Biosciences). A gate was set to select GFP-positive cells with a GFP signal that was at least 40 times stronger than that of the negative cells. 30,000 events were evaluated and analyzed using the BD CellQuest ProTM software (BD Biosciences) and Modfit LTTM 3.0 version (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips and were transfected as previously described. After 40 h of post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS solution and then treated with ice-cold methanol. Cells were incubated with blocking buffer containing 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min and treated with specific antibodies in 5% FBS in PBS. Cells were then rinsed and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to appropriate fluorochrome (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and DAPI (10 μg/ml) for detection of chromosomes. Finally, cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy with an LSM700 imaging system (Carl Zeiss). Ran is a small GTPase required for nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, spindle and nuclear assembly, and regulation of cell division (35Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Dasso M. Curr.

In its role as a nucleocytoplasmic transporter, Ran was found in the nuclear region, whereas GTPase-activating protein, RanGAP1, and its accessory protein, RanBP1, were localized in the cytoplasm during interphase. At the beginning of mitosis, when the nuclear envelope is broken down, nuclear Ran and cytoplasmic RanBP1 and RanGAP1 are recruited predominantly to the chromosomal region and kinetochore and regulate centrosome cohesion and mitotic spindle organization (27Guarguaglini G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We previously reported on screening of Ran as a Plk1 target molecule in mitosis as well as the importance of the interaction between Ran and Plk1 in recruitment of Ran-binding protein (38Jang Y.J. Ji J.H. Ahn J.H. Hoe K.L. Won M. Im D.S. Chae S.K. Song S. Yoo H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on these reports, we speculated that Plk1, Ran, and RanBP1 proteins might be co-localized into the chromosomal or microtubule nucleation region through breakdown of the nuclear envelope during early mitosis, and we evaluated subcellular localization of endogenous proteins by microscopic analysis of HeLa cells. Cells were arrested during early mitosis by treatment with nocodazole and were co-stained with anti-RanBP1 and anti-Plk1 or anti-Ran antibodies. As expected, during interphase, Ran and RanBP1 were localized in the nuclear region and in cytoplasm, respectively (Fig. 1A, a). However, in the early mitotic phase, both Ran and RanBP1 were concentrated in the vicinity of the chromosomes, particularly in the area of spindle formation (Fig. 1A, b). Plk1 and RanBP1 were co-localized at the spindle appearance site (Fig. 1B, b) but not in the centrosomal region during early mitosis (Fig. 1, B and C, panels b). Co-localization of Plk1 and RanBP1 was not clearly detected during the late mitotic stage (data not shown). Depletion of endogenous Plk1 using shRNA transfection resulted in a decrease of the interaction between Ran and RanBP1 (Fig. 2, top, lanes 2). Although the endogenous protein level of Plk1 was decreased in mitosis, cells were not defective and arrested in mitotic phase, which was confirmed by Western blots using anti-cyclin B1 (Fig. 2, bottom, α-cycB1).FIGURE 2Interaction between Ran and RanBP1 was decreased in depletion of Plk1. In vivo interaction between Ran and RanBP1 was performed by coimmunoprecipitation. Cells were transfected with vector (lane 1, ctrl) or Plk1 shRNA (lane 2, shPlk1). After a 30-h incubation in fresh media, cells were treated with nocodazole for an additional 10 h to arrest in early mitosis. Endogenous Ran and RanBP1 were immunoprecipitated (IP), and bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using appropriate antibodies (top panels, α-Ran or α-BP1). Protein amounts used in this experiment were estimated by actin expression (α-actin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) According to the Plk1-dependent manner in the interaction between RanBP1 and Ran, we attempted to determine whether or not RanBP1 can be phosphorylated by Plk1. For assessment of RanBP1 phosphorylation sites, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using His-tagged Plk1, which was purified from insect cells (19Jang Y.J. Ma S. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44115-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence analysis, there are two possible consensus sequences for phosphorylation by Plk1 in the N-terminal region of RanBP1, 38EIKTLEE and 58FASEND (Fig. 3A). GST-tagged RanBP1 was used as substrate in the kinase assay. Upon incubation with His-Plk1, GST-RanBP1 was strongly phosphorylated by Plk1 (Fig. 3B, lane 1). In addition, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that threonine and serine residues of RanBP1 could be phosphorylated by Plk1 and that the intensity of phosphorylation on the serine residue was stronger than that on the threonine residue (Fig. 3C). In order to determine whether these residues of RanBP1 are phosphorylation sites or not, we constructed a deletion mutant (ΔN, deletion of residues 1–60) and point mutants, where threonine 40 and serine 60 were substituted with valine and alanine, respectively. In an in vitro kinase assay, phosphorylation signals of T40V and S60A mutants were decreased (Fig. 3D, top, lanes 2 and 3) in comparison with that of wild type RanBP1 (Fig. 3D, top, lane 1). The deletion constructs, ΔN and GST protein, were not phosphorylated (Fig. 3D, top, lanes 4 and 5). Taken together, these data demonstrated that RanBP1 can be phosphorylated by Plk1 on both threonine 40 and serine 60 and that these sites might be important for RanBP1 function in early mitosis. GTP hydrolysis requires the interaction between RanGTP and RanGTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1) and is stimulated by Ran-binding protein 1 or Ran-binding protein 2. RanGAP1 is phosphorylated by mitotic kinase cyclin B1-Cdk1, and this modification is important for interaction with Ran (25Swaminathan S. Kiendl F. Körner R. Lupetti R. Hengst L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the regulatory mechanism of RanGAP, in order to determine whether RanBP1 phosphorylation by Plk1 was required for the occurrence of an interaction with Ran, we conducted a protein binding assay by immunoprecipitation. For detection of in vivo interaction in early mitotic cells, wild type and other mutant constructs of RanBP1 tagged with FLAG were expressed transiently in cells. Immunoprecipitation of RanBP1 proteins with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of mitotic Ran protein with wild type and S60A point mutants of RanBP1 (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 2 and 4), whereas neither T40V, T40V/S60A, nor ΔN mutant construct interacted with endogenous Ran (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 5, and 6). An in vitro protein pull-down assay with the GST-RanBP1 construct also showed a result similar to that observed with immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B). These data indicated that the interaction between Ran and RanBP1 is dependent on Plk1 in mitotic cells and that RanBP1 phosphorylation by Plk1 might play a pivotal role in its interaction with Ran. Taken together, these data suggested that RanBP1 phosphorylation on Thr-40 is necessary for stable interaction between Ran and RanBP1. Although the Ser-60 residue was also phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro, we had no interest with regard to its function in further study, because this phosphorylation had no effect on the interaction with Ran. To investigate the question of whether or not Thr-40 phosphorylation of RanBP1 occurs in a mitosis-specific manner in vivo, we constructed a Thr-40 phospho-specific antibody (α-pT40). Endogenous RanBP1 from late G1 cell extracts was weakly detected by the pT40 antibody (Fig. 5A, c, lane 1), whereas mitotic RanBP1 was strongly detected by the phosphoantibody (Fig. 5A, c, lane 2). Depletion of Plk1 in mitotic cells resulted in decreased Thr-40 phosphorylation of RanBP1 (Fig. 5A, c, lane 4) in comparison with that in control cells (Fig. 5A, c, lane 3). To determine whether RanBP1 phosphorylation on Thr-40 was regulated through mitotic progression, cells were synchronized in prometaphase by treatment with nocodazole and were then allowed to exit mitosis. Cell lysates were prepared at each time point, as indicated, and proteins were analyzed by Western blots. According to mitotic progression, the signal of phospho-RanBP1 decreased in a pattern similar to that observed with phospho-Plk1 (Fig. 5B, b and e). These data demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr-40 occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner, like Plk1 activity, and that RanBP1 can be a target of Plk1 during mitotic progression. Furthermore, Plk1 might regulate the interaction between Ran and RanBP1 through RanBP1 phosphorylation on the Thr-40 residue. In previous studies, RanBP1 or RCC1 regulated either dynamic features of the centrosome or appropriate chromosome segregation in human cells (30Di Fiore B. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Palena A. Tassin A.M. Cundari E. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3399-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Tedeschi A. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Roscioli E. Rensen W.M. Lavia P. J.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1442-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RCC1 allows for dynamic interaction of RCC1 with chromosomes during mitosis (43Hutchins J.R. Moore W.J. Hood F.E. Wilson J.S. Andrews P.D. Swedlow J.R. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1099-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similar to RCC1, RanGAP1 is phosphorylated by Cdk1, and phosphorylated RanGAP1 localizes into kinetochores and spindle microtubules during mitosis (44Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These reports indicated that phosphorylation in these proteins might be important for mitotic progression related to Ran. In order to determine whether RanBP1 phosphorylation by Plk1 affects its appropriate localization during cell cycle progression, FLAG-RanBP1 constructs (FLAG-WT and -T40V) were expressed in mitotic HeLa cells. Formation of aster microtubules was observed in prophase in both control cells and RanBP1-expressing cells, (Fig. 6A, top and middle, α-tubulin); however, it was not formed in cells expressing T40V (Fig. 6A, bottom, α-tubulin). Moreover, overexpression of RanBP1-WT resulted in formation and attachment of microtubules to condensed chromosomes in metaphase in the same phenotype as control (Fig. 6B, top and middle, α-tubulin). However, overexpression of the T40V mutant resulted in disruption of bipolar spindle formation under chromosome condensation in metaphase (Fig. 6B, bottom, α-tubulin), indicating that T40V overexpression did not result in formation of microtubule asters or proper assembly of the spindle during early mitosis. As well as abnormal spindle formation, overexpression of the T40V construct resulted in an increase of undivided and multiple nuclei and hypertropic nucleus in comparison with those in RanBP1-WT-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6D, graph). To investigate the importance of phosphorylation on Thr-40 of RanBP1 on microtubule nucleation in early mitosis, we performed the functional complementation experiment. For this, RanBP1 phosphorylation-defective mutant (T40V) was overexpressed in cells depleted of RanBP1 by using an shRNA construct (Fig. 7A). In a previous study (31Tedeschi A. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Roscioli E. Rensen W.M. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3748-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), cyclin B1 failed to associate with spindle microtubules in RanBP1-depleted mitosis, resulting in disruption of proper localization on spindle microtubule asters. As expected, when the RanBP1 was depleted, cyclin B1 did not associate with microtubule asters in early mitosis (31Tedeschi A. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Roscioli E. Rensen W.M. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3748-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B, b, cyclinB1). When the wild type construct of RanBP1 was overexpressed in cells depleted of RanBP1, localization of cyclin B1 was recovered (Fig. 7B, c, cyclinB1). However, when phosphorylation-defective mutant (T40V) of RanBP1 was expressed, cyclin B1 did not localize on spindle microtubules (Fig. 7B, d). These data suggested that the phosphorylation-defective mutant (T40V) of RanBP1 does not overcome the defect induced by RanBP1 depletion and that Thr-40 phosphorylation might be important for appropriate microtubule nucleation during early mitosis; even the endogenous level of RanBP1 is important for progression of mitosis.FIGURE 7Phosphorylation on Thr-40 of RanBP1 is involved in the association with microtubules and cyclin B1. A, cells were transfected with RanBP1-specific shRNA for depletion of RanBP1. Cells on a coverslip were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/methanol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, localization of endogenous cyclin B1 (cyclinB1) was detected by using anti-cyclin B1 antibody (red). RanBP1-specific shRNA transfected in cells was confirmed by intensity of GFP (green). a, early mitotic cell for control; b, cells transfected with RanBP1-specific shRNA construct; c, overexpression of RanBP1-WT in cells depleted of RanBP1; d, overexpression of RanBP1-T40V in cells depleted of RanBP1.

In addition to playing a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport during interphase, Ran and its effectors play key roles in centrosome duplication, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and kinetochore microtubule localization during mitosis (21Clarke P.R.

Moreover, recent studies have reported on the importance of phosphorylation of these proteins by mitotic kinases in regulation of Ran function during mitosis. For example, RCC1 is a specific target of cyclin B1-Cdk1 during mitosis (24Li H.Y. Zheng Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 512-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Hutchins J.R. Moore W.J.

Iglesias P.A. Zheng Y. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1886-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated RCC1 plays a role in maintaining the balance between RanGTP and RanGDP. In addition to RCC1, RanGAP1 associated with RanBP2 is also phosphorylated by Cdks during mitotic progression (25Swaminathan S. Kiendl F. Körner R. Lupetti R. Hengst L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, Ras/Akt signaling pathways modulate phosphorylation and function of RanBP3, which regulates the Ran gradient through control of RCC1 activity (32Yoon S.O. Shin S. Liu Y. Ballif B.A. Woo M.S. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 362-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RanBP1 is also regulated in order to ensure appropriate localization of mitotic regulatory factors on spindle microtubules and to perform chromosome segregation through modulation of RanGTP gradients during mitosis (31Tedeschi A. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Roscioli E. Rensen W.M. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3748-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Li H.Y. Ng W.P. Wong C.H. Iglesias P.A. Zheng Y. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1886-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how RanBP1 activity is regulated in mammalian cells, especially during mitosis. In this report, we attempted to suggest that mitotic Plk1 and RanBP1 might be recruited to microtubule regions through interaction with Ran during early mitosis, following RanBP1 phosphorylation by Plk1. The increasing level of mitotic RanBP1 induced unusual spindles and delayed progression into late mitotic stage in mammalian cells (30Di Fiore B. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Palena A. Tassin A.M. Cundari E. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3399-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and overexpression of T40V mutant resulted in an increase of abnormal aspects, compared with those of cells containing RanBP1-WT (Fig. 6C). In addition to ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of RanBP1, functional complementation of RanBP1 depletion and Plk1 depletion experiments indicated that RanBP1 phosphorylation was dependent on Plk1 activity and that phosphorylation might be essential for appropriate microtubule aster formation (Figs. 5A and 7). Finally, we suggested that Plk1 might be one of the regulators of RanBP1 and that a direct interaction between RanBP1 and Ran might be regulated by phosphorylation of RanBP1. Because mitosis-specific phosphorylation of RanBP1 and its strong interaction with Ran could be important to the understanding of Ran-RanBP1 functions in mitosis, we speculated on the mechanism of their interactions. General models describing the mechanism of how the polo-box domain of Plk1 interacts with its specific substrates have been suggested by Lowery et al. (46Lowery D.M. Lim D. Yaffe M.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The “distributive phosphorylation” is one of the working mechanisms of Plk1. According to this model, a substrate or a target protein binds to the polo-box domain of Plk1, and the third protein can be recruited to this target protein as a docking protein and finally phosphorylated by Plk1. Both Thr-40 and Ser-60 of RanBP1 are consensus sites for Plk1 phosphorylation (47Nakajima H. Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25277-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These residues are located within the Ran-binding domain, which includes a nuclear localization signal, and are evolutionarily conserved among various species (Fig. 3A). Although Thr-40 phosphorylation was found to be weaker than that on the Ser-60 residue in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3D), this site might be important for the interaction with Ran during mitosis (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, Ran and RanBP1 did not interact in Plk1-depleted cells (Fig. 2), indicating that RanBP1 phosphorylation by Plk1 is essential for stronger interaction between RanBP1 and Ran, although these two proteins can interact temporally in cells. Several reports have shown that the timing and spatial coordination of the Ran network system during mitotic progression might be associated with RanGTP/GDP gradients and activation of mitotic kinases. Remarkably, RanBP1 activity is required for appropriate localization/function of Ran in regions of aster microtubules and chromosomes (31Tedeschi A. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Roscioli E. Rensen W.M. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3748-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Li H.Y. Ng W.P. Wong C.H. Iglesias P.A. Zheng Y. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1886-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thr-40 phosphorylation of RanBP1 through mitotic progression was a unique feature of mitotic RanBP1 and was discriminated from interphasic RanBP1 (Fig. 5A). Guarguaglini et al. (27Guarguaglini G. Renzi L. D'Ottavio F. Di Fiore B. Casenghi M. Cundari E. Lavia P. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 455-465PubMed Google Scholar) reported low levels of RanBP1 during the G1 phase, which increased during progression from the S phase to mitosis in NIH/3T3 cells. However, RanBP1 was constitutively expressed in many tumor cells in an E2F-dependent manner (26Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C. Tripodi M. Jansen-Durr P. Lavia P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1213-1224PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the levels of RanBP1 expression in several tumor and primary cell lines. Constitutive and relatively high levels of RanBP1 were observed throughout the cell cycle in various tumor cells (HeLa, cervical carcinomas; KB, mouse epithelial carcinomas; MCF, human mammary tumor cells; SK-Hep1, hepatomas), whereas endogenous levels of RanBP1 in primary cultured cells were low and were found to be cell cycle-dependent (MC3T3, murine fibroblasts; PDL, periodontal ligaments; HGF, human gingival fibroblasts) (data not shown). In summary, we suggested that Plk1 phosphorylates RanBP1 during early mitosis just after disruption of the nuclear membrane and that Ran is then recruited to the mitotic microtubule region around chromosomes for establishment of normal microtubule aster formation, spindle formation, and chromosome segregation during mitosis. However, if phosphorylation on Thr-40 of RanBP1 by Plk1 did not occur, strong interaction between Ran and RanBP1 was disrupted or became unstable, followed by induction of mitotic defects in further mitotic progression (Fig. 8). Future studies will be conducted in order to determine whether RanBP1 is correlated with other mitotic kinases as well as Plk1 during mitotic progression and how they are involved in mitotic Ran function, taken together with other effectors, including RanGAP and other Ran-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1972487920,"We demonstrate here a rapid alternative method for the production of functional bi-specific antibodies using the mild reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (MESNA). Following reduction of a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies with MESNA to break inter heavy chain bonds, this solution is dialysed under oxidising conditions and antibodies are allowed to reform. During this reaction a mixture of antibodies is formed, including parental antibodies and bi-specific antibody. Bi-specific antibodies are purified over two sequential affinity columns. Following purification, bi-specificity of antibodies is determined in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and by flow cytometry. Using this redox method we have been successful in producing hybrid and same-species bi-specific antibodies in a time frame of 6-10 working days, making this production method a time saving alternative to the time-consuming traditional heterohybridoma technology for the production of bi-specific antibodies for use in early pilot studies. The use of both rat and mouse IgG antibodies forming a rat/mouse bi-specific antibody as well as producing a pure mouse bi-specific antibody and a pure rat bi-specific antibody demonstrates the flexibility of this production method."

The components of respiratory metabolism are localized in the membrane fractions which include the outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane. Many of the biological components that interact with the various iron forms are proposed to be localized in these membrane fractions. To identify the iron-binding proteins acting either as an iron transporter or as a terminal iron reductase, we used metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions. This system catalyzed the oxidation of amino acids in close proximity to the iron binding site. The carbonyl groups formed from this oxidation can then be labeled with fluoresceinamine (FLNH2). The peptide harboring the FLNH2 can then be proteolytically digested, purified by HPLC and then identified by MALDI-TOF tandem MS. A predominant peptide was identified to be part of SO2907 that encodes a putative TonB-dependent receptor. Compared with wild type (wt), the so2907 gene deletion (ΔSO2907) mutant has impaired ability to reduce soluble Fe(III), but retains the same ability to respire oxygen or fumarate as the wt. The ΔSO2907 mutant was also impacted in reduction of insoluble iron. Iron binding assays using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence tryptophan quenching demonstrated that a truncated form of heterologous-expressed SO2907 that contains the Fe(III) binding site, is capable of binding soluble Fe(III) forms with Kd of approximate 50 μm.

To identify the iron-binding proteins acting either as an iron transporter or as a terminal iron reductase, we used metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions. This system catalyzed the oxidation of amino acids in close proximity to the iron binding site. The carbonyl groups formed from this oxidation can then be labeled with fluoresceinamine (FLNH2). The peptide harboring the FLNH2 can then be proteolytically digested, purified by HPLC and then identified by MALDI-TOF tandem MS. A predominant peptide was identified to be part of SO2907 that encodes a putative TonB-dependent receptor. Compared with wild type (wt), the so2907 gene deletion (ΔSO2907) mutant has impaired ability to reduce soluble Fe(III), but retains the same ability to respire oxygen or fumarate as the wt. The ΔSO2907 mutant was also impacted in reduction of insoluble iron. Iron binding assays using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence tryptophan quenching demonstrated that a truncated form of heterologous-expressed SO2907 that contains the Fe(III) binding site, is capable of binding soluble Fe(III) forms with Kd of approximate 50 μm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the physiological role of SO2907 in Fe(III) reduction by MR-1. IntroductionIron is the fourth most-abundant element in the Earth's crust. The redox transition between the Fe2+ and Fe3+ is an important biogeochemical process and is believed to play an important role in environmental biogeochemistry (1Nealson, K. H., Banfield, J. F. (1997) in Geomicrobiology: Interactions Between Microbes and Minerals in Rev. Miner. (America, M. S. ed.) Washington, D.C..Google Scholar). Microorganisms from the Archaea and Bacteria domains which persist in water, soils and sediments are capable of metabolically exploiting the redox potential between Fe2+/Fe3+, either using Fe2+ as an electron donor or utilizing Fe3+ as a terminal electron acceptor (TEA) 2The abbreviations used are: TEAterminal electron acceptorFLNH2fluoresceinamineDNPH2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazineNTAnitrilotriacetic acidMCOmetal-catalyzed oxidationTMtotal membranesCMcytoplasmic membraneTCAtrichloroacetic acidDIRdissimilatory iron reductionITCisothermal titration calorimetry.

The use of iron as the TEA is referred to as dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR). It has been suggested that microbial DIR predates the aerobic respiration (3Perry A.J. Rowcliff D.J. J. Mater. Sci. 1973; 8: 904-907Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interest in DIR has intensified upon discovery of the ability of DIR microbes in bioremediation of contaminated environments polluted with heavy and radioactive metals such as U6+ and Tc7+ (4Fredrickson J.K. Zachara J.M. Kennedy D.W. Duff M.C. Gorby Y.A. Li S.M.W. Krupka K.M. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta. 2000; 64: 3085-3098Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Fredrickson J.K. Zachara J.M. Kennedy D.W.

Nealson K.H. Science. 1988; 240: 1319-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Shewanella is capable of respiring a multitude of organic, inorganic, soluble, and insoluble TEAs (7Nealson K.H. Saffarini D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 8Tiedje J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1093-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For the insoluble TEAs, Shewanella has evolved mechanisms for the cytoplasmic membrane (CM)-localized electrons of respiration to traverse the periplasm and the outer membrane (OM) (9Gralnick J.A. Newman D.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Two studies (10Marsili E. Baron D.B. Shikhare I.D. Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Bond D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc.i U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 11von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) have proposed that flavins serve as electron shuttling agents between Shewanella whole cells and the distal metal oxides. Flavins, however, do not seem to play as important of a role in the reduction of soluble metallic TEAs (11von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar).Whereas data suggest that most environmental metallic TEAs are insoluble, there are studies that suggest that Shewanella has also evolved a system for utilizing soluble metallic TEAs. Kinetic studies by Ruebush et al. (12Ruebush S.S. Brantley S.L. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) show that reduction of soluble TEAs occurs preferentially at the CM/periplasm. Work from Lies et al. (13Lies D.P. Hernandez M.E. Kappler A. Mielke R.E. Gralnick J.A. Newman D.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4414-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) also suggested that reduction of soluble TEAs occurs mainly in the periplasm and CM. The recent results from Gescher et al. (14Gescher J.S. Cordova C.D. Spormann A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are consistent with the importance of CM/periplasm-localized reduction of soluble iron forms. These workers found that E. coli transformed and expressing a CM-localized protein involved in DIR in Shewanella, cymA, is able to utilize nitrilotriacetate-chelated ferric ion (NTA-Fe3+) as a TEA. Furthermore, Shewanella has been suggested to produce endogenous Fe3+ chelators when grown with insoluble iron (15Taillefert M. Beckler J.S. Carey E. Burns J.L. Fennessey C.M. DiChristina T.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2007; 101: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Also, soluble organic-Fe3+ complexes have been detected using voltammetric techniques (15Taillefert M. Beckler J.S. Carey E. Burns J.L. Fennessey C.M. DiChristina T.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2007; 101: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Jones et al. (16Jones M.E. Fennessey C.M. DiChristina T.J. Taillefert M. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 938-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) recently identified two mutants of S. oneidensis that are not able to produce soluble organic-Fe3+ complexes. These mutants were found to be deficient in anaerobic growth in both soluble and insoluble Fe3+. They suggested that the solubilization of iron oxide by endogenous iron chelators plays an important role in DIR of insoluble metal oxides.If indeed soluble iron reduction occurs predominantly in the periplasm, the question remains on the route by which soluble metal complex is able to gain access to the periplasm. To identify the components involved in iron transport for the DIR process, we have used metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) of proteins. MCO has been used as a powerful tool to identify the amino acids involved in metal binding to proteins (17Temple A. Yen T.Y. Gronert S. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2006; 17: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Amici A. Levine R.L. Tsai L. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3341-3346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Climent I. Tsai L. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidants generated by MCO are highly reactive, having short half lives (21Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). As such, they are not able to diffuse far and therefore only the amino acids within close proximity to the metal binding site are oxidized (21Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 22Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The most well-documented type of oxidative modification is the formation of carbonyl groups from MCO (22Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The detection of protein carbonyl groups therefore can be used to probe the location of the metal binding sites. The carbonyls can be detected by formation of Schiff bases with chromophores or fluorophores (19Climent I. Tsai L. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In this work we used fluoresceinamine to label carbonyl groups which are introduced into proteins as a result of MCO of total membrane (TM) fractions of S. oneidensis MR-1. The fluoresceinamine-labeled peptide was identified through tandem MS/MS. We found that Tyr-800 of a putative TonB-dependent receptor protein, which was encoded by SO2097, was oxidized. Compared with wild type (wt), the so2097 gene deletion mutant exhibited compromised growth rate in media containing soluble iron as the TEA. However, it maintained similar growth rates to that of wt when fumarate or oxygen was used as the TEA. We also expressed a truncated form of the TonB receptor and quantified its iron-binding capacity. Collectively, all these results suggest for the first time that so2097 is involved in reduction of soluble Fe3+ by MR-1, most likely via transporting soluble Fe3+ into the periplasm.DISCUSSIONThere are currently three proposed mechanism for how Shewanella is able to utilize insoluble metal oxides as TEAs in respiratory metabolism (9Gralnick J.A. Newman D.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar): (i) electron shuttles (e.g. flavins) (10Marsili E. Baron D.B. Shikhare I.D. Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Bond D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc.i U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 11von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), which deliver the reducing equivalents from the CM to the extracellular matrix, (ii) direct contact (either through hemeproteins and/or with nanowires (25Gorby Y.A. Yanina S. McLean J.S. Rosso K.M. Moyles D. Dohnalkova A. Beveridge T.J. Chang I.S. Kim B.H. Kim K.S. Culley D.E. Reed S.B. Romine M.F. Saffarini D.A. Hill E.A. Shi L. Elias D.A. Kennedy D.W.

Yongsunthon R. Droubay T.C. McCready D.E. Lower S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), and (iii) metal chelators (13Lies D.P. Hernandez M.E. Kappler A. Mielke R.E. Gralnick J.A. Newman D.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4414-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Taillefert M. Beckler J.S. Carey E. Burns J.L. Fennessey C.M. DiChristina T.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2007; 101: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which serve to solubilize the metal oxides such that they can contact with membrane-associated electron-transport components. Experimental evidence exists for all three mechanisms. Also, the three mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, different mechanism may be operative when the TEAs are soluble metals (e.g. U6+ or chelated ferric ion). As such, it would seem plausible that reduction of low molecular weight ferric species would also occur in the periplasm where it can gain contact with the CM. While iron exists primarily as insoluble, solid phase minerals at pH at or above circumneutral, ferric ion can be soluble when chelated and indeed soluble biological chelated iron forms have been detected in the environment (15Taillefert M. Beckler J.S. Carey E. Burns J.L. Fennessey C.M. DiChristina T.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2007; 101: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Campbell J.A. Stromatt R.W. Smith M.R.

Wilderer P.A. Venugopalan V.P. Water Res. 2006; 40: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Evidence also shows that the utilization of soluble ferric ion is of physiological relevance. Voltammetric techniques have provided evidence for the production of iron chelators by Shewanella (16Jones M.E. Fennessey C.M. DiChristina T.J. Taillefert M. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 938-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The importance of soluble iron reduction is also supported by the recent work of Gescher et al. (14Gescher J.S. Cordova C.D. Spormann A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showing that the expression of S. oneidensis CymA in E. coli confers it the ability to use soluble ferric ion as a TEA (as measured by growth). Work from our laboratory (12Ruebush S.S. Brantley S.L. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) has also shown that the reduction of soluble iron forms is all catalyzed by the CM. The reduction of insoluble iron forms is also totally dependent upon the CM, however, OM components facilitate the process (12Ruebush S.S. Brantley S.L. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition to soluble ferric iron, a number of other soluble TEAs are shown to be reduced by the CM which include fumarate (37Pealing S.L. Cheesman M.R. Reid G.A. Thomson A.J. Ward F.B. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6153-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), nitrate, nitrite, DMSO (38Schwalb C. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9491-9497Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and U(VI) (39Wade R. DiChristina T.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 143-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The present study is actually not the first to suggest a role for the Ton-B-dependent receptor (SO2907) in DIR. Using two-dimensional gels, we previously showed that SO2907 is up-regulated in cultures grown with ferric citrate as the TEA (12Ruebush S.S. Brantley S.L. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These growth conditions contained 50 mm ferric citrate and at such high concentrations, would indicate that SO2907 is not involved in the classic, iron-limiting siderophore-mediated iron acquisition process (33Madigan M.T. Martinko J.M. Parker J. Brock Biology of Microorganisms. Prentice Hall, 2000Google Scholar). Using the MCO system to identify the iron binding site of proteins, this putative TonB-dependent receptor (locus name SO2907) was the major protein to be labeled.It is widely known that for Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, the iron uptake system relies on a TonB-dependent transportation system (see reviews (40Postle K. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 41Postle K. Larsen R.A. Biometals. 2007; 20: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)). Basically, Gram-negative bacteria use iron-binding specific transporters in the OM to deliver iron complexes to the periplasmic space. This transport is proposed to be driven by the CM-dependent proton motive force involving a complex of proteins (TonB, ExbB, ExbD) (41Postle K. Larsen R.A. Biometals. 2007; 20: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The TonB-dependent receptors differ from porins in several fundamental ways, including their high iron binding affinities and specificity for substrate binding and low transport rate.The SO2907 protein was examined using SWISS-MODEL workplace (42Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5983) Google Scholar). The results from the sequence alignments indicated that SO2907 belongs to the OM-channel protein family. It contains two conserved domains: TonB-dependent receptor β-barrel domain (residues 554–884) and TonB-dependent receptor plug domain (residues 52–167). Both conserved domains are typically found in other OM TonB-dependent receptors involved in iron transport. One example is FepA from E. coli serving as ligand-gated transporter for ferric chelates and vitamin B12 (43Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L. Palnitkar M. Chakraborty R. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar).The importance of SO2907 in DIR is supported by the phenotype of the knock-out mutant, ΔSO2907. ΔSO2907 exhibited the same growth rate and final yield when grown with either molecular oxygen or fumarate as the TEA. Only with iron as the TEA did ΔSO2907 have a slower growth rate and slower rate of iron reduction. The greatest decrease was observed with soluble iron forms citrate-Fe3+ and NTA-Fe3+. A decrease was also observed with goethite or ferrihydrite but the extent of this decrease was not as much as that with soluble Fe3+. This finding is consistent with the transport of chelated iron by TonB as the rate-limiting step when soluble iron forms are used as TEA. However, when using iron oxides, either other steps are more rate-limiting than ferric ion transport or other mechanisms are involved (e.g. electron shuttle agents (11von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar)).Using a truncated form of SO2907, the portion identified by MCO, we determined the binding constant to chelated iron by both ITC and fluorometry. Both methods yielded a binding constant of ∼50 μm. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified Tyr-800 as one of iron binding residues on SO2907. This is consistent with the result of oxidation studies where the Tyr-800 is modified. The iron binding affinity of SO2907 is in contrast to traditional TonB receptors which typically show iron-siderophore binding affinities in the range of 0.1 and 100 nm (44Postle K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For an example, the dissociation constant of FepA binding to ferric-enterobactin is lower than 0.1 nm (26Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The relative weaker binding of SO2907 to iron citrate or iron-NTA is consistent with this protein not being involved in iron assimilation. This is confirmed by its identical growth curve to wild type under fumarate and oxygen respiratory conditions. As such, our results with two-dimensional gels (12Ruebush S.S. Brantley S.L. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) show that SO2907 is up-regulated under iron-rich conditions. Therefore, we propose that SO2907 may function as a low-affinity iron transporter inside the CM/periplasm for DIR. The weak absorption of iron citrate can mediate rapid diffusion of soluble iron inside the periplasm/CM for DIR.Our results here provide a mechanism for transport of chelated ferric species across the OM into the periplasm where it can contact the electrons of respiratory metabolism within the CM. We speculate that the relative contribution of this process is dependent upon the nature of the TEA. With soluble ferric species, SO2907 appears to play a significant role whereas with insoluble iron oxides, it apparently plays a minor role (or is not the rate-limiting step) in the overall respiratory pathway. Nevertheless, our results show the high plasticity of Shewanella's respiratory system possessing a variety of mechanisms to utilize a wide range of TEAs. IntroductionIron is the fourth most-abundant element in the Earth's crust. The redox transition between the Fe2+ and Fe3+ is an important biogeochemical process and is believed to play an important role in environmental biogeochemistry (1Nealson, K. H., Banfield, J. F.

Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidants generated by MCO are highly reactive, having short half lives (21Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). As such, they are not able to diffuse far and therefore only the amino acids within close proximity to the metal binding site are oxidized (21Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 22Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The most well-documented type of oxidative modification is the formation of carbonyl groups from MCO (22Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The detection of protein carbonyl groups therefore can be used to probe the location of the metal binding sites. The carbonyls can be detected by formation of Schiff bases with chromophores or fluorophores (19Climent I. Tsai L. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In this work we used fluoresceinamine to label carbonyl groups which are introduced into proteins as a result of MCO of total membrane (TM) fractions of S. oneidensis MR-1. The fluoresceinamine-labeled peptide was identified through tandem MS/MS. We found that Tyr-800 of a putative TonB-dependent receptor protein, which was encoded by SO2097, was oxidized. Compared with wild type (wt), the so2097"
