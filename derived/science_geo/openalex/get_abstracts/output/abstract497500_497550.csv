https://openalex.org/W2002508442,"A new mass-spectrometry method has been developed to obtain high-resolution spectra of folded proteins bound to lipids; using this technique as well as X-ray crystallography provides evidence for membrane protein conformational change as a result of lipid–protein interaction. Many of the high-resolution membrane protein structures published recently are notable for the presence of lipids closely associated with the protein, prompting the question, how are these lipids influencing membrane complex structure? Carol Robinson and colleagues have developed a new ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) method that enabled them to obtain mass spectra of folded protein conformations bound to lipids. Using this method they identified lipids that altered the stability of MscL (mechanosensitive channel of large conductance), aquaporin Z and the ammonia channel. They then determined the X-ray crystal structure of the ammonia channel bound to one of these lipids (phosphatidylglycerol), which revealed how a conformational change in a specific loop led to the formation of a phosphatidylglycerol-binding site. The major conclusion from this work is that an individual lipid-binding event can change the stability of a membrane complex. On the cover, IM-MS captures a native membrane protein complex emerging from an ion mobility cell. Shown is the ammonia channel in apo, one- and two-lipid bound states. Previous studies have established that the folding, structure and function of membrane proteins are influenced by their lipid environments1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and that lipids can bind to specific sites, for example, in potassium channels8. Fundamental questions remain however regarding the extent of membrane protein selectivity towards lipids. Here we report a mass spectrometry approach designed to determine the selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. We investigate the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) and the ammonia channel (AmtB) from Escherichia coli, using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which reports gas-phase collision cross-sections. We demonstrate that folded conformations of membrane protein complexes can exist in the gas phase. By resolving lipid-bound states, we then rank bound lipids on the basis of their ability to resist gas phase unfolding and thereby stabilize membrane protein structure. Lipids bind non-selectively and with high avidity to MscL, all imparting comparable stability; however, the highest-ranking lipid is phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in line with its proposed functional role in mechanosensation9. AqpZ is also stabilized by many lipids, with cardiolipin imparting the most significant resistance to unfolding. Subsequently, through functional assays we show that cardiolipin modulates AqpZ function. Similar experiments identify AmtB as being highly selective for phosphatidylglycerol, prompting us to obtain an X-ray structure in this lipid membrane-like environment. The 2.3 Å resolution structure, when compared with others obtained without lipid bound, reveals distinct conformational changes that re-position AmtB residues to interact with the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that resistance to unfolding correlates with specific lipid-binding events, enabling a distinction to be made between lipids that merely bind from those that modulate membrane protein structure and/or function. We anticipate that these findings will be important not only for defining the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, but also for understanding the role of lipids in modulating protein function or drug binding."

https://openalex.org/W2029532148,"The mir-34/449 family consists of six homologous miRNAs at three genomic loci. Redundancy of miR-34/449 miRNAs and their dominant expression in multiciliated epithelia suggest a functional significance in ciliogenesis. Here we report that mice deficient for all miR-34/449 miRNAs exhibited postnatal mortality, infertility and strong respiratory dysfunction caused by defective mucociliary clearance. In both mouse and Xenopus, miR-34/449-deficient multiciliated cells (MCCs) exhibited a significant decrease in cilia length and number, due to defective basal body maturation and apical docking. The effect of miR-34/449 on ciliogenesis was mediated, at least in part, by post-transcriptional repression of Cp110, a centriolar protein suppressing cilia assembly. Consistent with this, cp110 knockdown in miR-34/449-deficient MCCs restored ciliogenesis by rescuing basal body maturation and docking. Altogether, our findings elucidate conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms through which miR-34/449 regulate motile ciliogenesis. Loss-of-function studies of the miR-34/449 microRNA family in mouse and Xenopus reveal their evolutionarily conserved role in ciliogenesis by repressing expression of the centriolar protein Cp110. The six microRNAs (miRNAs) of the miR-34/449 family are highly similar. Their functions overlap, so it is difficult to determine their specific biological roles. Lin He and colleagues present data obtained from mice deficient for all six miR-34/449 miRNAs. These animals exhibited frequent postnatal mortality, respiratory dysfunction — resembling respiratory complications seen in some patients with primary cilia dyskinesia — and infertility. The main underlying defects were shorter and fewer cilia in the cells of the respiratory tract, largely due to defects in basal body docking to the apical membrane. Of the 57 potential targets of miR-34/449 miRNAs that the authors identify, one is Cp110, a centriolar protein that suppresses cilia assembly. Interestingly, aberrant Cp110 levels in association with respiratory illness have already been uncovered."

The adjacent retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells phagocytize and digest shed photoreceptor outer segment, which provides a rich source of fatty acids that could be utilized as an energy substrate. From a microarray analysis, we found that RPE cells express particularly high levels of the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) compared with all other tissues (except the liver and colon), leading to the hypothesis that RPE cells, like hepatocytes, can produce β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) from fatty acids. Using primary human fetal RPE (hfRPE) cells cultured on Transwell filters with separate apical and basal chambers, we demonstrate that hfRPE cells can metabolize palmitate, a saturated fatty acid that constitutes ≈15% of all lipids in the photoreceptor outer segment, to produce β-HB. Importantly, we found that hfRPE cells preferentially release β-HB into the apical chamber and that this process is mediated primarily by monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1). Using a GC-MS analysis of 13C-labeled metabolites, we showed that retinal cells can take up and metabolize 13C-labeled β-HB into various TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids. Collectively, our data support a novel mechanism of RPE-retina metabolic coupling in which RPE cells metabolize fatty acids to produce β-HB, which is transported to the retina for use as a metabolic substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1999911038,"Mitochondria capture and subsequently release Ca(2+) ions, thereby sensing and shaping cellular Ca(2+) signals. The Ca(2+) uniporter MCU mediates Ca(2+) uptake, whereas NCLX (mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger) and LETM1 (leucine zipper-EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1) were proposed to exchange Ca(2+) against Na(+) or H(+), respectively. Here we study the role of these ion exchangers in mitochondrial Ca(2+) extrusion and in Ca(2+)-metabolic coupling. Both NCLX and LETM1 proteins were expressed in HeLa cells mitochondria. The rate of mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux, measured with a genetically encoded indicator during agonist stimulations, increased with the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]mt) elevations. NCLX overexpression enhanced the rates of Ca(2+) efflux, whereas increasing LETM1 levels had no impact on Ca(2+) extrusion. The fluorescence of the redox-sensitive probe roGFP increased during [Ca(2+)]mt elevations, indicating a net reduction of the matrix. This redox response was abolished by NCLX overexpression and restored by the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor CGP37157. The [Ca(2+)]mt elevations were associated with increases in the autofluorescence of NAD(P)H, whose amplitude was strongly reduced by NCLX overexpression, an effect reverted by Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibition. We conclude that NCLX, but not LETM1, mediates Ca(2+) extrusion from mitochondria. By controlling the duration of matrix Ca(2+) elevations, NCLX contributes to the regulation of NAD(P)H production and to the conversion of Ca(2+) signals into redox changes."
https://openalex.org/W1977646155,"Research suggests that women of reproductive age who are involved in household decision-making are more likely than those who are not involved to be able to control their fertility. Little is known, however, about this relationship among women at the upper end of the reproductive spectrum. The aim of this study was to determine the association between household decision-making power and modern contraceptive use among Nigerian women ages 35-49 years.A descriptive, cross-sectional study involving a secondary analysis of data from the Nigerian 2008 Demographic and Health Survey was conducted among women ages 35-49 years who were considered to be in need of contraception. The outcome was modern contraceptive use while the main independent variable was a woman's household decision-making power score, constructed using principal component analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether the women's household decision-making power score, categorized into tertiles, was independently associated with modern contraceptive use. Data were weighted and adjusted for the complex survey design.Prevalence of modern contraceptive use among Nigerian women deemed to be in need of contraception in this study was 18.7%. Multivariate logistic regression showed that women's decision-making power remained statistically significantly associated with modern contraceptive use, even after adjusting for age, education, religion, polygyny, parity, wealth and domicile. Women who were in the highest decision-making power tertile had more than one and a half times the odds of using modern contraception compared with women in the lowest tertile [Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.70; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.31-2.21, p<0.001].Older Nigerian women who are involved in making household decisions are also able to make decisions related to their fertility. Programs in Nigeria focused on increasing modern contraceptive use should include strategies to increase women's status through encouraging more visible involvement in decision-making across different spheres of their lives."
https://openalex.org/W2148928811,"Many freshwater fish species are considered vulnerable to stream temperature warming associated with climate change because they are ectothermic, yet there are surprisingly few studies documenting changes in distributions. Streams and rivers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains have been warming for several decades. At the same time these systems have been experiencing an increase in the severity and frequency of wildfires, which often results in habitat changes including increased water temperatures. We resampled 74 sites across a Rocky Mountain watershed 17 to 20 years after initial samples to determine whether there were trends in bull trout occurrence associated with temperature, wildfire, or other habitat variables. We found that site abandonment probabilities (0.36) were significantly higher than colonization probabilities (0.13), which indicated a reduction in the number of occupied sites. Site abandonment probabilities were greater at low elevations with warm temperatures. Other covariates, such as the presence of wildfire, nonnative brook trout, proximity to areas with many adults, and various stream habitat descriptors, were not associated with changes in probability of occupancy. Higher abandonment probabilities at low elevation for bull trout provide initial evidence validating the predictions made by bioclimatic models that bull trout populations will retreat to higher, cooler thermal refuges as water temperatures increase. The geographic breadth of these declines across the region is unknown but the approach of revisiting historical sites using an occupancy framework provides a useful template for additional assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2049948334,"Transmembrane lipid transporters are believed to establish and maintain phospholipid asymmetry in biological membranes; however, little is known about the in vivo function of the specific transporters involved. Here, we report that developing erythrocytes from mice lacking the putative phosphatidylserine flippase ATP11C showed a lower rate of PS translocation in vitro compared with erythrocytes from wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the mutant mice had an elevated percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing mature erythrocytes in the periphery. Although erythrocyte development in ATP11C-deficient mice was normal, the mature erythrocytes had an abnormal shape (stomatocytosis), and the life span of mature erythrocytes was shortened relative to that in control littermates, resulting in anemia in the mutant mice. Thus, our findings uncover an essential role for ATP11C in erythrocyte morphology and survival and provide a new candidate for the rare inherited blood disorder stomatocytosis with uncompensated anemia."
https://openalex.org/W1975913236,"The effect of gold nanoparticles on lung cancer cells is not yet clear. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and cell invasion activity of lung cancer cells after treatment with gold nanoparticles and showed that small gold nanoparticles can be endocytosed by lung cancer cells and that they facilitate cell invasion. The growth of A549 cells was inhibited after treatment with 5-nm gold nanoparticles, but cell invasion increased. Endocytosed gold nanoparticles (size, 10 nm) notably promoted the invasion activity of 95D cells. All these effects of gold nanoparticles were not seen after treatment with larger particles (20 and 40 nm). The enhanced invasion activity may be associated with the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In this study, we obtained evidence for the effect of gold nanoparticles on lung cancer cell invasion activity in vitro. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, key modulators of cell invasion, were found to be regulated by gold nanoparticles. These data also demonstrate that the responses of the A549 and 95D cells to gold nanoparticles have a remarkable relationship with their unique size-dependent physiochemical properties. Therefore, this study provides a new perspective for cell biology research in nanomedicine."
https://openalex.org/W2054391889,"Background To clarify the genetic mutations associated with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and IPMN-related pancreatic tumours, we conducted cancer-related gene profiling analyses using pure pancreatic juice and resected pancreatic tissues. Methods Pure pancreatic juice was collected from 152 patients [nine with a normal pancreas, 22 with chronic pancreatitis (CP), 39 with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and 82 with IPMN], and resected tissues from the pancreas were collected from 48 patients (six IPMNs and 42 PDACs). The extracted DNA was amplified by multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 46 cancer-related genes containing 739 mutational hotspots. The mutations were analysed using a semiconductor-based DNA sequencer. Results Among the 46 cancer-related genes, KRAS and GNAS mutations were most frequently detected in both PDAC and IPMN cases. In pure pancreatic juice, GNAS mutations were detected in 7.7% of PDAC cases and 41.5% of IPMN cases (p<0.001 vs. others). All PDAC cases with GNAS mutations (n = 3) were accompanied by IPMN. Multivariate analysis revealed that GNAS mutations in IPMN cases were associated with dilated main pancreatic ducts (MPD, p = 0.016), while no statistically independent associations with clinical variables were observed for KRAS mutations. In the resected pancreatic tissues, GNAS mutations were detected in 50% of PDAC cases concomitant with IPMN, 33.3% of PDAC cases derived from IPMN, and 66.7% of IPMN cases, while no GNAS mutations were detected in cases of PDAC without IPMN. Conclusions The GNAS mutation was specifically found in the cases with IPMN and it was speculated that some PDACs might be influenced by the concomitant but separately-located IPMN in their pathogenic mechanism. Furthermore, the GNAS mutation was significantly associated with MPD dilatation in IPMN cases, suggesting its role in mucus hypersecretion."
https://openalex.org/W2076706100,"Despite advances in early diagnosis and multimodality therapy for cancers, most of lung cancer patients have been locally advanced or metastatic at the time of diagnosis, suggesting the highly progressive characteristic of lung cancer cells. The mechanisms underling invasiveness and metastasis of lung cancer are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of CXCL16-CXCR6 in human lung cancer tissues. It was demonstrated that similar to CXCL12 and CXCR4, CXCL16 and CXCR6 were also coexpressed in human primary lung cancer tissues. After confirming the functional existence of CXCL16 and CXCR6 protein in A549, 95D and H292 cells by ELSA and flow cytometry analysis, we further explored the significance of CXCL16-CXCR6 axis in the biological functions of lung cancer cell lines in vitro. It was found that CXCL16 had no effects on the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression of A549, 95D and H292 cells. However, both exogenous CXCL16 and CM (conditioned medium from A549, 95D or H292) significantly improved the in vitro viability and invasion of three lung cancer cell lines. The neutralizing antibody to CXCL16 or down-regulation of CXCR6 was able to inhibit the increased viability and invasiveness of A549, 95D and H292 cells stimulated by CXCL16 or CM. Our results imply that CXCL16-CXCR6 axis is involved in the regulation of viability and invasion rather than PCNA expression of lung caner cells, which opens the door for better understanding the mechanisms of lung tumor progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2162697345,"Functional interpretations of limb bone structure frequently assume that diaphyses adjust their shape by adding bone primarily across the plane in which they are habitually loaded in order to minimize loading-induced strains. Here, to test this hypothesis, we characterize the in vivo strain environment of the sheep tibial midshaft during treadmill exercise and examine whether this activity promotes bone formation disproportionately in the direction of loading in diaphyseal regions that experience the highest strains. It is shown that during treadmill exercise, sheep tibiae were bent in an anteroposterior direction, generating maximal tensile and compressive strains on the anterior and posterior shaft surfaces, respectively. Exercise led to significantly increased periosteal bone formation; however, rather than being biased toward areas of maximal strains across the anteroposterior axis, exercise-related osteogenesis occurred primarily around the medial half of the shaft circumference, in both high and low strain regions. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that loading-induced bone growth is not closely linked to local strain magnitude in every instance. Therefore, caution is necessary when bone shaft shape is used to infer functional loading history in the absence of in vivo data on how bones are loaded and how they actually respond to loading."

Anti-Jo-1 antibodies from different disease-afflicted patients react mostly with spatially separated epitopes in the three-dimensional structure of human HisRS. We noted that two HisRS splice variants (SVs) include these spatially separated regions, but each SV lacks the HisRS catalytic domain. Despite the large deletions, the two SVs cross-react with a substantial population of anti-Jo-l antibodies from myositis patients. Moreover, expression of at least one of the SVs is up-regulated in dermatomyositis patients, and cell-based experiments show that both SVs and HisRS can be secreted. We suggest that, in patients with inflammatory myositis, anti-Jo-1 antibodies may have extracellular activity.

https://openalex.org/W2094769847,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are an ancient enzyme family that specifically charges tRNA molecules with cognate amino acids for protein synthesis. Glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) is one of the most intriguing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases due to its divergent quaternary structure and abnormal charging properties. In the past decade, mutations of human GlyRS (hGlyRS) were also found to be associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. However, the mechanisms of traditional and alternative functions of hGlyRS are poorly understood due to a lack of studies at the molecular basis. In this study we report crystal structures of wild type and mutant hGlyRS in complex with tRNA and with small substrates and describe the molecular details of enzymatic recognition of the key tRNA identity elements in the acceptor stem and the anticodon loop. The cocrystal structures suggest that insertions 1 and 3 work together with the active site in a cooperative manner to facilitate efficient substrate binding. Both the enzyme and tRNA molecules undergo significant conformational changes during glycylation. A working model of multiple conformations for hGlyRS catalysis is proposed based on the crystallographic and biochemical studies. This study provides insights into the catalytic pathway of hGlyRS and may also contribute to our understanding of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease."
https://openalex.org/W1993270397,"Background Currently there is a critical need for accurate and standardized wildlife-vehicle collision data, because it is the underpinning of mitigation projects that protect both drivers and wildlife. Gathering data can be challenging because wildlife-vehicle collisions occur over broad areas, during all seasons of the year, and in large numbers. Collecting data of this magnitude requires an efficient data collection system. Presently there is no widely adopted system that is both efficient and accurate. Methodology/Principal Findings Our objective was to develop and test an integrated smartphone-based system for reporting wildlife-vehicle collision data. The WVC Reporter system we developed consisted of a mobile web application for data collection, a database for centralized storage of data, and a desktop web application for viewing data. The smartphones that we tested for use with the application produced accurate locations (median error = 4.6–5.2 m), and reduced location error 99% versus reporting only the highway/marker. Additionally, mean times for data entry using the mobile web application (22.0–26.5 s) were substantially shorter than using the pen/paper method (52 s). We also found the pen/paper method had a data entry error rate of 10% and those errors were virtually eliminated using the mobile web application. During the first year of use, 6,822 animal carcasses were reported using WVC Reporter. The desktop web application improved access to WVC data and allowed users to easily visualize wildlife-vehicle collision patterns at multiple scales. Conclusions/Significance The WVC Reporter integrated several modern technologies into a seamless method for collecting, managing, and using WVC data. As a result, the system increased efficiency in reporting, improved accuracy, and enhanced visualization of data. The development costs for the system were minor relative to the potential benefits of having spatially accurate and temporally current wildlife-vehicle collision data."

The present study examined the role of ER stress in senescence using oncogene-dependent models. Increased ER stress attenuated senescence in part by up-regulating phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and decreasing phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK). A positive feed forward loop between p-AKT, ER stress, and UPR was discovered whereby a transient increase of ER stress caused reduced senescence and promotion of tumorigenesis. Decreased ER stress was further correlated with increased senescence in both mouse and human tumors. Interestingly, H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ null cells and tumors having increased cell proliferation exhibited enhanced ER stress, decreased cellular senescence, and/or enhanced tumorigenicity.

The shRNA catalogue numbers are: mouse Atf4 shRNA (TRCN0000071727), mouse Xbp1 shRNA (TRCN0000008420), and non-target control shRNA (SHC002). Primary keratinocytes from newborn wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice were prepared and cultured as previously described (12Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H.

Western blot analysis was performed from whole cell lysates as described below. Keratinocyte preparations from newborn mouse skin were placed into culture dishes for 1 h. After this “pre-attachment” period, the culture medium was removed and replated into new culture dishes. This approach minimizes the contamination of fibroblasts with primary keratinocytes. Primary keratinocytes were plated at high density and infected with the H-RAS retrovirus on day 2 of culture. For transient treatment, infected keratinocytes were treated with tunicamycin or thapsigargin for 4 days before culture in normal Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.05 mm calcium and 8% FBS (low calcium) or in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.5 mm calcium medium and 8% FBS (high calcium) for 8 weeks. For prolonged treatment, infected keratinocytes were treated with tunicamycin or thapsigargin throughout the experiment. Colonies of keratinocytes were identified by staining the cells with 0.35% rhodamine, 10% formalin. Rhodamine-stained colonies were counted with a dissecting microscope.

Briefly, H-RAS-expressing keratinocytes cultured in chamber slides were treated with different chemicals for 3 days before being pulsed with 50 μm l-azidohomoalanine in methionine-free medium for 1 h. Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 and then underwent a ligation reaction for 30 min in the dark. Representative photomicrographs were obtained with a light microscope (OLYMPUS BX61), and the mean intensity of Alexa-488 signal from at least 1000 cells was measured using Cell Profiler software (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Image-iT live green reactive oxygen species detection kit (Invitrogen) was used to measure the level of ROS in H-RAS-expressing keratinocytes. Wild-type H-RAS-expressing keratinocytes were treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin for 4 days. After treatment, cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and incubated with 25 μm 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution before being subjected to imaging using a fluorescence microscope. The mean intensity of the fluorescent signal from at least 1000 cells was measured using Cell Profiler software (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Basement membrane extract (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was diluted with low calcium medium at the final concentration of 1 mg/ml and plated on top of 8 μm pore size cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences). An equal number of H-RAS-expressing keratinocytes transiently treated with either thapsigargin, tunicamycin, or vehicle control were plated on top of the half-gelled basement membrane extract and cultured with low calcium medium for 24 h. After 24 h, cells migrating across the membrane were identified by staining the insert membrane with 0.35% rhodamine, 10% formalin. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR was performed as previously described (22Palkar P.S. Borland M.G. Naruhn S.

For detection of spliced Xbp1 mRNA (162 bp) and unspliced Xbp1 mRNA (188 bp), the forward primer (5′-AAGAACACGCTTGGGAATGGACAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACAGTGTCAGAGTCCATGGGAAGA-3′) were used. Western blot analysis using radioactive detection methods was performed as previously described (13Borland M.G. Khozoie C. Albrecht P.P. Zhu B. Lee C. Lahoti T.S. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M.

Matched pairs of frozen normal colon tissue and colon adenomas were obtained from The Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute Tissue Bank. All data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was assessed using one-tailed Student's t test or linear regression analysis. H-RAS expression caused morphologic changes in keratinocytes characterized by a temporal increase in vacuolization (Fig. 1A). However, vacuolization occurred earlier, and the percentage of vacuolized cells was higher in H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null keratinocytes as compared with wild-type keratinocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). Because vacuolization can be indicative of an expanded ER compartment, ER content was quantified. The mean density staining of the ER tracker DPX (staining relative to cell size) was lower in H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells compared with Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with this observation, decreased expression of CALNEXIN (an ER-resident protein) was found in H-RAS-expressing wild-type compared with Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 1D). The vacuolization and expansion of the ER compartment are consistent with previously observed H-RAS-induced ER stress previously observed in primary melanocytes (3Denoyelle C. Abou-Rjaily G.

Anti-oncogenic role of the endoplasmic reticulum differentially activated by mutations in the MAPK pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In response to ER stress, UPR is activated to attenuate the ER stress by activating the three branches of the UPR pathway: 1) PERK, 2) ATF6, and 3) IRE1 (1Lin J.H. Walter P. Yen T.S. Endoplasmic reticulum stress in disease pathogenesis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3: 399-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 2Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. The unfolded protein response, degradation from endoplasmic reticulum and cancer.Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 764-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). Microarray analysis from a previously published study (10Zhu B. Khozoie C. Bility M.T. Ferry C.H. Blazanin N. Glick A.B. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ cross-talks with E2F and attenuates mitosis in H-RAS-expressing cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 2065-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) revealed increased expression of key UPR regulators in both wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null cells in response to H-RAS activation, but the relative increase was markedly higher in Pparβ/δ-null cells compared with wild type (Fig. 1, G and H). Western blot analysis confirmed decreased expression of the UPR sensor BiP and ATF6 in H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells compared with Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, although phosphorylated PERK (pPERK) was not detected in H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells, pPERK was found in H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 1D), an effect not due to a difference in H-RAS expression, which was expressed at similar levels in both cell types (Fig. 1D). Knockdown of PPARβ/δ in 308 keratinocytes, a cell line that expresses a constitutively active H-RAS, revealed similar results (Fig. 1E). Higher expression of ATF4, ATF6, and BiP were observed in 308 keratinocytes when PPARβ/δ was knocked down as compared with controls (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that PPARβ/δ attenuates two of the three branches of the UPR pathway activated by ER stress (Fig. 1F). Alternative splicing of Xbp1 mRNA was examined as an indirect measure of the third branch of the UPR pathway, IRE1 activity (Fig. 1F). Reduced splicing of Xbp1 mRNA was observed in H-RAS-expressing wild type compared with Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that PPARβ/δ also attenuates the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR response in H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells. H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells were also less sensitive to tunicamycin (an ER stress inducer)-induced cell death as compared with Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 2B), consistent with the reduced ER stress observed in H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Although the UPR initially promotes cell survival, in the presence of prolonged ER stress it can also activate pathways leading to apoptosis (1Lin J.H. Walter P. Yen T.S. Endoplasmic reticulum stress in disease pathogenesis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3: 399-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 2Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. The unfolded protein response, degradation from endoplasmic reticulum and cancer.Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 764-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed similar expression of pro-apoptotic BAD and BAX protein in H-RAS-expressing wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 2C), consistent with propidium iodide staining revealing no change in the percentage of apoptotic cells in H-RAS-expressing wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 2D). Additionally, overexpression of PPARβ/δ in human HaCaT keratinocytes decreased expression of the UPR markers ATF4, ATF6, and IRE1α (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that PPARβ/δ represses H-RAS-induced ER stress without triggering apoptosis. p-AKT activity can influence ER stress (3Denoyelle C. Abou-Rjaily G. Bezrookove V. Verhaegen M. Johnson T.M. Fullen D.R. Pointer J.N. Gruber S.B. Su L.D. Nikiforov M.A. Kaufman R.J. Bastian B.C. Soengas M.S. Anti-oncogenic role of the endoplasmic reticulum differentially activated by mutations in the MAPK pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This is consistent with relatively lower H-RAS-induced ER stress and lower p-AKT in H-RAS-expressing wild-type keratinocytes compared with H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null cells (11Zhu, B., Ferry, C. H., Blazanin, N., Bility, M. T., Khozoie, C., Kang, B. H., Glick, A. B., Gonzalez, F. J., Peters, J. M., (November 11, 2013) PPARβ/δ promotes H-RAS-induced senescence and tumor suppression by potentiating p-ERK and repressing p-AKT signaling. Oncogene 10.1038/onc.2013.477Google Scholar). Similarly, this is consistent with relatively higher H-RAS-induced ER stress and higher p-AKT in H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null keratinocytes compared with H-RAS-expressing wild-type keratinocytes (11Zhu, B., Ferry, C. H., Blazanin, N., Bility, M. T., Khozoie, C., Kang, B. H., Glick, A. B., Gonzalez, F. J., Peters, J. M., (November 11, 2013) PPARβ/δ promotes H-RAS-induced senescence and tumor suppression by potentiating p-ERK and repressing p-AKT signaling. Oncogene 10.1038/onc.2013.477Google Scholar). These collective observations support the hypothesis that p-AKT (which is activated by PI3K) promotes ER stress in H-RAS-expressing cells. Inhibition of PI3K activity with LY294002 significantly decreased the percentage of vacuolized H-RAS-expressing cells in both genotypes (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 decreased p-AKT and decreased expression of the ER stress and UPR mediators ATF6 and BiP in H-RAS-expressing cells (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that p-AKT activity promotes H-RAS-induced ER stress. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein complex that could potentially mediate p-AKT-induced ER stress because 1) mTOR is a target of p-AKT (23Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4692) Google Scholar) and 2) increased mTOR activity can cause increased protein synthesis (24Chiang G.G. Abraham R.T. Targeting the mTOR signaling network in cancer.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), which could overload the ER, leading to ER stress. Inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 significantly decreased expression of the mTOR target genes phospho-p70S6K (p-p70S6K) and phospho-S6RP (p-S6RP) in H-RAS-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). This suggests that mTOR is indeed a target of p-AKT in H-RAS-expressing keratinocytes. Consistent with a higher activity of mTOR in H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null cells (Fig. 4A), H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null cells also exhibited an ∼4-fold higher protein synthesis rate compared with wild-type counterparts (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of PI3K and mTOR with LY294002 and rapamycin, respectively, reduced the rate of protein synthesis to a level similar to that of H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells. (Fig. 4, B and C) Although only an ∼2-fold decrease was observed in H-RAS-expressing wild-type cells as compared with Pparβ/δ-null cell (Fig. 4, B and C). Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin also decreased the percentage of vacuolized cells and expression of ER stress and UPR markers IRE1α and BiP in H-RAS-expressing cells (Fig. 4, D–F), and the magnitude of these changes were greater in H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ-null cells. These data collectively suggest that p-AKT activity increases H-RAS-induced ER stress by activating mTOR signaling leading to increased protein synthesis. Furthermore, these data also indicate that PPARβ/δ represses ER stress by attenuating p-AKT/mTOR signaling. PPARβ/δ promotes H-RAS-"
https://openalex.org/W2057508736,"Bacteria encounter environmental stresses that regulate a gene expression program required for adaptation and survival. Here, we report the 1.8-Å crystal structure of the Escherichia coli toxin-antitoxin complex YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ, a key component of the stress response. The antitoxin DinJ dimer adopts a ribbon-helix-helix motif required for transcriptional autorepression, and toxin YafQ contains a microbial RNase fold whose proposed active site is concealed by DinJ binding. Contrary to previous reports, our studies indicate that equivalent levels of transcriptional repression occur by direct interaction of either YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ or a DinJ dimer at a single inverted repeat of its recognition sequence that overlaps with the -10 promoter region. Surprisingly, multiple YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ complexes binding to the operator region do not appear to amplify the extent of repression. Our results suggest an alternative model for transcriptional autorepression that may be novel to DinJ-YafQ."

Previous findings suggested a potential role of additional genetic modifiers and environment factors on phenotypic expression among the affected patients. We conducted clinical and genetic investigations to perform genotype-phenotype correlation in two large families living in a socio-culturally isolated community with the highest prevalence of Wilson’s disease ever reported of 1∶1130. Sequencing of ATP7B gene in seven affected individuals and 43 family members identified a common compound heterozygous genotype, H1069Q/M769H-fs, in five symptomatic and two asymptomatic patients and detected the presence of two out of seven identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in all affected patients. Symptomatic patients had similar clinical phenotype and age at onset (18±1 years) showing dysarthria and dysphagia as common clinical features at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, all symptomatic patients presented Kayser-Fleischer rings and lack of dystonia accompanied by unfavourable clinical outcomes. Our findings add value for understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in Wilson’s disease based on a multifamily study in an isolated population with high extent of genetic and environmental homogeneity as opposed to majority of reports. We observed an equal influence of presumed other genetic modifiers and environmental factors on clinical presentation and age at onset of Wilson’s disease in patients with a particular genotype. These data provide valuable inferences that could be applied for predicting clinical management in asymptomatic patients in such communities."

https://openalex.org/W2050921543,"Iron is required for several metabolic functions involved in cellular growth. Although several players involved in iron transport have been identified, the mechanisms by which iron-responsive transcription factors are controlled are still poorly understood. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Fep1 transcription factor represses genes involved in iron acquisition in response to high levels of iron. In contrast, when iron levels are low, Fep1 becomes inactive and loses its ability to associate with chromatin. Although the molecular basis by which Fep1 is inactivated under iron starvation remains unknown, this process requires the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4. Here, we demonstrate that Fra2 plays a role in the negative regulation of Fep1 activity. Disruption of fra2+ (fra2Δ) led to a constitutive repression of the fio1+ gene transcription. Fep1 was consistently active and constitutively bound to its target gene promoters in cells lacking fra2+. A constitutive activation of Fep1 was also observed in a php4Δ fra2Δ double mutant strain in which the behavior of Fep1 is freed of its transcriptional regulation by Php4. Microscopic analyses of cells expressing a functional Fra2-Myc13 protein revealed that Fra2 localized throughout the cells with a significant proportion of Fra2 being observed within the nuclei. Further analysis by coimmunoprecipitation showed that Fra2, Fep1 and Grx4 are associated in a heteroprotein complex. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments brought further evidence that an interaction between Fep1 and Fra2 occurs in the nucleus. Taken together, results reported here revealed that Fra2 plays a role in the Grx4-mediated pathway that inactivates Fep1 in response to iron deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2051414892,"Worldwide, paracetamol is administered as a remedy for complaints that occur after vaccination. Recently published results indicate that paracetamol inhibits the vaccination response in infants when given prior to vaccination. The goal of this study was to establish whether paracetamol exerts similar effects in young adults. In addition, the effect of timing of paracetamol intake was investigated. In two randomized, controlled, open-label studies 496 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to three groups. The study groups received paracetamol for 24 hours starting at the time of (prophylactic use) - or 6 hours after (therapeutic use) the primary (0 month) and first booster (1 month) hepatitis B vaccination. The control group received no paracetamol. None of the participants used paracetamol around the second booster (6 months) vaccination. Anti-HBs levels were measured prior to and one month after the second booster vaccination on ADVIA Centaur XP. One month after the second booster vaccination, the anti-HBs level in the prophylactic paracetamol group was significantly lower (p = 0.048) than the level in the control group (4257 mIU/mL vs. 5768 mIU/mL). The anti-HBs level in the therapeutic paracetamol group (4958 mIU/mL) was not different (p = 0.34) from the level in the control group. Only prophylactic paracetamol treatment, and not therapeutic treatment, during vaccination has a negative influence on the antibody concentration after hepatitis B vaccination in adults. These findings prompt to consider therapeutic instead of prophylactic treatment to ensure maximal vaccination efficacy and retain the possibility to treat pain and fever after vaccination.

https://openalex.org/W2112668369,"In Brazil, the degradation of nutrient-poor Ferralsols limits productivity and drives agricultural expansion into pristine areas. However, returning agricultural residues to the soil in a stabilized form may offer opportunities for maintaining or improving soil quality, even under conditions that typically promote carbon loss. We examined the use of biochar made from filtercake (a byproduct of sugarcane processing) on the physicochemical properties of a cultivated tropical soil. Filtercake was pyrolyzed at 575°C for 3 h yielding a biochar with increased surface area and porosity compared to the raw filtercake. Filtercake biochar was primarily composed of aromatic carbon, with some residual cellulose and hemicellulose. In a three-week laboratory incubation, CO2 effluxes from a highly weathered Ferralsol soil amended with 5% biochar (dry weight, d.w.) were roughly four-fold higher than the soil-only control, but 23-fold lower than CO2 effluxes from soil amended with 5% (d.w.) raw filtercake. We also applied vinasse, a carbon-rich liquid waste from bioethanol production typically utilized as a fertilizer on sugarcane soils, to filtercake- and biochar-amended soils. Total CO2 efflux from the biochar-amended soil in response to vinasse application was only 5% of the efflux when vinasse was applied to soil amended with raw filtercake. Furthermore, mixtures of 5 or 10% biochar (d.w.) in this highly weathered tropical soil significantly increased water retention within the plant-available range and also improved nutrient availability. Accordingly, application of sugarcane filtercake as biochar, with or without vinasse application, may better satisfy soil management objectives than filtercake applied to soils in its raw form, and may help to build soil carbon stocks in sugarcane-cultivating regions."
https://openalex.org/W2033863969,"Mycoplasmas are regarded to be useful models for studying the minimum genetic complement required for independent survival of an organism. Mycoplasma bovis is a globally distributed pathogen causing pneumonia, mastitis, arthritis, otitis media and reproductive tract disease, and genome sequences of three strains, the type strain PG45 and two strains isolated in China, have been published. In this study, several Tn4001 based transposon constructs were generated and used to create a M. bovis PG45 insertional mutant library. Direct genome sequencing of 319 independent insertions detected disruptions in 129 genes in M. bovis, 48 of which had homologues in Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides SC and 99 of which had homologues in Mycoplasma agalactiae. Sixteen genes found to be essential in previous studies on other mycoplasma species were found to be dispensable. Five of these genes have previously been predicted to be part of the core set of 153 essential genes in mycoplasmas. Thus this study has extended the list of non-essential genes of mycoplasmas from that previously generated by studies in other species."
https://openalex.org/W2093148268,"Explosive growth of next-generation sequencing data has resulted in ultra-large-scale data sets and ensuing computational problems. Cloud computing provides an on-demand and scalable environment for large-scale data analysis. Using a MapReduce framework, data and workload can be distributed via a network to computers in the cloud to substantially reduce computational latency. Hadoop/MapReduce has been successfully adopted in bioinformatics for genome assembly, mapping reads to genomes, and finding single nucleotide polymorphisms. Major cloud providers offer Hadoop cloud services to their users. However, it remains technically challenging to deploy a Hadoop cloud for those who prefer to run MapReduce programs in a cluster without built-in Hadoop/MapReduce.We present CloudDOE, a platform-independent software package implemented in Java. CloudDOE encapsulates technical details behind a user-friendly graphical interface, thus liberating scientists from having to perform complicated operational procedures. Users are guided through the user interface to deploy a Hadoop cloud within in-house computing environments and to run applications specifically targeted for bioinformatics, including CloudBurst, CloudBrush, and CloudRS. One may also use CloudDOE on top of a public cloud. CloudDOE consists of three wizards, i.e., Deploy, Operate, and Extend wizards. Deploy wizard is designed to aid the system administrator to deploy a Hadoop cloud. It installs Java runtime environment version 1.6 and Hadoop version 0.20.203, and initiates the service automatically. Operate wizard allows the user to run a MapReduce application on the dashboard list. To extend the dashboard list, the administrator may install a new MapReduce application using Extend wizard.CloudDOE is a user-friendly tool for deploying a Hadoop cloud. Its smart wizards substantially reduce the complexity and costs of deployment, execution, enhancement, and management. Interested users may collaborate to improve the source code of CloudDOE to further incorporate more MapReduce bioinformatics tools into CloudDOE and support next-generation big data open source tools, e.g., Hadoop BigTop and Spark.CloudDOE is distributed under Apache License 2.0 and is freely available at http://clouddoe.iis.sinica.edu.tw/."

Transfection of APP−/− cells with a vector encoding APP restored nuclear import of anMan-containing HS. In WT MEFs and N2a neuroblastoma cells exposed to β- or γ-secretase inhibitors, nuclear translocation was greatly impeded, suggesting involvement of APP/APLP2 degradation products. In Tg2576 MEFs, the β-inhibitor blocked transport, but the γ-inhibitor did not. During chase in ascorbate-free medium, anMan-containing HS disappeared from the nuclei of WT MEFs.

Gpc-1 can be internalized via a caveolin-1-associated pathway and is recycled via endosomes and the Golgi. During or after uptake, specific cysteines in the Gpc-1 core protein are S-nitrosylated in a reaction that is dependent on copper that could be provided by APP. In endosomes, the Gpc-1 HS chains are deaminatively cleaved in an S-nitrosothiol (SNO)-catalyzed reaction, resulting in release of HS chains and oligosaccharides containing reducing terminal anhydromannose (anMan).

We have previously shown that anMan immunoreactivity is present in AD plaques, that a 50–55-kDa anMan- and Aβ-immunoreactive component can be isolated from fibroblasts of transgenic AD mice (Tg2576), and that anMan-containing HS degradation products can suppress Aβ42 oligomerization in vitro (24Cheng F.

As this may reflect normal functions for APP, Aβ peptides, and anMan-containing HS, we decided to examine whether APP and its degradation products play a role in the generation and/or localization of anMan-containing HS. We showed by using wild-type, APP−/−, APLP2−/−, and Tg2576 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells that APP/APLP2 expression is required to initiate transport of anMan-containing HS from endosomes via the cytosol into the nucleus. HS then returns to the cytosol and accumulates in autophagosomes. Mammalian transfection plasmid pIRESpuro-APP695 (Clontech) encoded the APP695 cDNA.

In brief, cells were fixed in acetone to retain cellular and subcellular structure and to ensure the preservation of carbohydrates. The fixed cells were first precoated with 10% antimouse total Ig and then exposed to primary antibodies overnight. The secondary antibodies used were Texas Red-tagged goat anti-mouse Ig when the primary antibody was monoclonal and FITC-tagged goat anti-rabbit IgG or sometimes FITC-tagged donkey anti-goat IgG when the primary antibody was polyclonal. In the controls, the primary antibody was omitted. DNA staining with DAPI as well as staining with antibodies was performed as recommended by the manufacturers. The fluorescence images were analyzed by using a Carl Zeiss AxioObserver inverted fluorescence microscope with deconvolution technique and equipped with objective EC “Plan-Neofluar” 63×/1.25 oil M27 and AxioCam MRm Rev camera. Identical exposure settings and times were used for all images. Several cells were observed before a representative image was selected. Images were also taken using the Z-stacking function in the AxioVision Release 4.8 software. Once the cell of interest was identified, a series of 10 images were automatically captured every 1.5 μm of the focal plane. Following capture, the 10 images were combined into a movie to allow visualization of a three-dimensional image of the entire cell. In colocalization and quantification measurements using line scan analysis, the fluorophores were excited in a sequential manner using multitrack acquisition. This procedure minimizes channel cross-talk. Data analysis for colocalization was performed using Zeiss AxioVision Release 4.8 software. Cells were analyzed by using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope with a C-apochromat 63×/1.20 water correction ring objective and Zen 2009 software. Colocalization analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.48v module FIJI. For preparation of the nuclear fraction, 5 × 106 cells in minimum Eagle's medium containing 1 mm ascorbate and supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 were treated with 6 mIU/ml heparinase I and 2 mIU/ml heparinase III for 30 min at 37 °C. Enzyme addition was repeated for another 30 min. Cells were washed off the plate, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed. Intact nuclei were separated from “non-nuclear” cell components (cytosol, other organelles, and membrane fragments) using the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA). The purity of the preparation was assessed at each step by phase-contrast microscopy. The final preparation had no observable intact cells and consisted of bare nuclei. The nuclear preparation was lysed in 4 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8.

We have shown previously that proliferating human fetal lung fibroblasts constitutively generate Gpc-1-derived, anMan-containing HS degradation products, which were demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using an anMan-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb AM).

Ascorbate can be taken up by growth-quiescent fibroblasts and induce deaminative autodegradation of Gpc-1 HS, resulting in reappearance of anMan staining (14Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-A.

In untreated cells and in cells treated for 1 min, staining with mAb AM was undetectable (Fig. 1, A and B, AM). After 5 min of ascorbate treatment, anMan staining was visible in cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 1C, AM and DAPI). After 15 min, most of the staining was in the nuclei (Fig. 1D), and after 1 h, nuclear accumulation appeared to have reached its maximum (Fig. 1, E and F). To confirm the nuclear localization, we generated an image from a section through the center of a nucleus (Fig. 1G) and a three-dimensional image of the nuclei (Fig. 1H). To examine whether expression of APP or APLP2 is required for formation and nuclear translocation of anMan-containing HS degradation products, we investigated APP−/− and APLP2−/− MEFs. Although all WT MEFs observed showed nuclear anMan staining after ascorbate treatment (Fig. 2A and B, AM), very little anMan staining appeared in APP−/− and APLP2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2, C and D and E and F, AM). Tg2576 mice carry a mutation in APP that affects its processing, and MEFs from such mice overexpress APP and generate increased amounts of Aβ peptides. Treatment with ascorbate resulted in intense nuclear staining with mAb AM in all cells observed, indicating that anMan-containing HS degradation products were produced in large amounts and accumulated in the nuclei of Tg2576 MEFs (Fig. 2, G and H, AM and DAPI). In an attempt to restore formation and nuclear translocation of anMan-containing HS degradation products in APP−/− MEFs, cells were transiently transfected with a vector encoding APP695 cDNA, treated with ascorbate, and stained with mAb AM and a polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of APP (A8717). Transfected cells expressed APP (Fig. 2J, A8717; cf. Fig. 2I), and anMan staining of the nuclei was intense in these cells, indicating that APP expression is required for both formation and nuclear targeting of anMan-containing HS degradation products (Fig. 2J, AM and DAPI; cf. Fig. 2I). To confirm that HS was present in the nuclei of WT MEFs upon ascorbate treatment, [35S]sulfate-labeled cells were treated with ascorbate, and a nuclear fraction was analyzed by gel exclusion chromatography on Superdex peptide before and after deaminative cleavage by nitrous acid at the HS-specific N-sulfated glucosamines. The amount of 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans eluting near the void volume increased almost 3-fold after ascorbate treatment (Fig. 2, K and L). In untreated cells, there was very little nuclear HS as judged from the relative insensitivity to nitrous acid (Fig. 2K, inset), whereas a large part of the nuclear glycosaminoglycans in ascorbate-treated cells consisted of HS (Fig. 2L, inset). Hence, the increase in nuclear 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans can be attributed to accumulation of HS. Both APP and APLP2 are processed by the β- and γ-secretases (1Walsh D.M. Minogue A.M.

To determine whether processing is required for endosome exit and nuclear import of the anMan-containing HS degradation products, we used the β- and γ-secretase inhibitors LY2811376 and BMS-708163, respectively. When WT MEFs were incubated with 100 nm LY2811376 for 48 h and then treated with 1 mm ascorbate for 1 h, the staining for anMan remained essentially extranuclear, and nuclear accumulation of HS was prevented (Fig. 3, A and B; cf. Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with 10 nm BMS-708163 partly suppressed nuclear import (Fig. 3, C and D; cf. Fig. 2, A and B). When Tg2576 MEFs were incubated with the β-secretase inhibitor followed by ascorbate, nuclear anMan-staining was undetectable (Fig. 3, E and F; cf. Fig. 2, G and H). In contrast, treatment with 10 nm γ-secretase inhibitor was essentially unable to prevent ascorbate-induced nuclear import of anMan-containing HS-degradation products in Tg2576 MEFs (Fig. 3, G and H; cf. Fig. 2, G and H). We also tested higher concentrations of the γ-inhibitor, but the cells did not survive. Overall, β-secretase inhibition was considerably more effective than γ-secretase inhibition in blocking nuclear translocation of HS. APP and Gpc-1 colocalize in N2a neuroblastoma cells (10Cappai R.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer disease and its paralog, APLP2, modulate the Cu/Zn-nitric oxide-catalyzed degradation of glypican-1 heparan sulfate in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13913-13920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These cells constitutively produce anMan-containing HS degradation products that are mainly located extranuclearly (15Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-A. Constitutive and vitamin C-induced, NO-catalyzed release of heparan sulfate from recycling glypican-1 in late endosomes.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To increase formation of these products by ascorbate treatment, endosomal accumulation of the Gpc-1-SNO precursor is required. This is achieved by pretreatment with the synthetic cationic steroid U18666A, which inhibits transport from early to late endosomes and thereby precludes deaminative cleavage of HS (15Mani K. Cheng F. Fransson L.-A. Constitutive and vitamin C-induced, NO-catalyzed release of heparan sulfate from recycling glypican-1 in late endosomes.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When N2a cells were treated with ascorbate only, anMan staining of the nuclei was negligible (Fig. 4A). However, treatment with U18666A followed by ascorbate resulted in intense nuclear staining by the anMan-specific mAb in most cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether APP processing by β- and/or γ-secretase was required for nuclear translocation of anMan-containing HS, N2a cells were treated with the respective inhibitors. In the presence of either LY2811376 or BMS-708163, anMan staining remained extranuclear in most cells following exposure to U18666A and ascorbate (Fig. 4, C–F). Ishihara et al. (20Ishihara M. Fedarko N.S. Conrad H.E. Transport of heparan sulfate into the nuclei of hepatocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13575-13580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a minor portion of HS derived from both endogenously produced and exogenously supplied [35S]sulfate-labeled HS proteoglycan accumulated for up to 20 h in the nuclei of rat hepatocytes and subsequently disappeared from the nuclei with a half-life of 8 h. We therefore examined whether the nuclear anMan-containing HS degradation products disappeared from the nuclei of wild-type MEF cells during chase in ascorbate-free medium. After 8 h of chase, the vast majority of the anMan-containing HS still remained in the nuclei; only a very weak, diffuse anMan staining was seen in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A, left panels). However, after 24 h of chase, most of the anMan-staining had disappeared from the nuclei and appeared to be both diffusely distributed in the cytosol and concentrated in cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 5A, middle panels). After 32 h of chase, the anMan staining was exclusively associated with vesicles of varying size (Fig. 5A, right panels). To determine whether the anMan-staining was associated with acidic vesicles, cells were also exposed to LTR and examined by confocal microscopy. There was extensive (approximately 83%) colocalization between anMan staining and LTR (Fig. 5B), suggesting a phagosomal or lysosomal localization. Staining with anti-LC3, a recognized marker for autophagosomes (30Nixon R.A. The role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), also revealed extensive (approximately 87%) colocalization with the anMan-stained HS degradation products at paranuclear sites (Fig. 5C). Nuclear recycling of HS may depend on the growth state of the cells. We therefore examined the location of anMan-containing HS degradation products in proliferating wild-type MEFs by confocal microscopy. Most (approximately 87%) of the anMan-staining in ascorbate-treated proliferating cells appeared to be in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 6A), suggesting a rapid transfer from endosomes into the nucleus and out to autophagosomes/lysosomes. Degradation in lysosomes can be impeded by treatment with chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that interferes with phagosome-lysosome fusion and/or lysosomal degradation (20Ishihara M. Fedarko N.S. Conrad H.E. Transport of heparan sulfate into the nuclei of hepatocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13575-13580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, chloroquine treatment resulted in increased anMan staining that colocalized both with the nuclei (approximately 54%) and LTR-positive cytoplasmic vesicles (approximately 87%) (Fig. 6B). Thus, in proliferating MEFs, the endosomal and nuclear HS pools may be small, and most of the anMan-containing HS undergoes degradation in lysosomes. In addition to HS, a number of exogenous growth factors and their receptors can be targeted to the nucleus (23Bryant D.M. Stow J.L. Nuclear translocation of cell-surface receptors: lessons from fibroblast growth factor.Traffic. 2005; 6: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of cell surface proteins and HS proteoglycans is well understood, but how they cross the lipid bilayer and escape into the cytosol remains an unresolved issue. HS, which is a highly polyanionic polysaccharide, is nevertheless transported from endosomes to the cytosol and then into the nucleus. We have demonstrated that expression of APP and/or APLP2 is required to initiate an intracellular HS recycling route. anMan-containing HS degradation products that are derived from Gpc-1 by constitutive or ascorbate-induced, SNO-dependent deaminative cleavage are transferred from endosomes into the cytosol and then into the nucleus. Eventually this HS disappears from the nucleus and is taken up by autophagosomes and degraded (Fig. 6C shows a schematic summary). We favor a non-vesicular transfer of HS through the cytosol because the anMan staining was diffuse both in the cytosol and in the nucleus. The present results also indicate that the traffic of anMan-containing HS is different between proliferating and growth-quiescent WT MEFs. In proliferating cells, anMan-containing HS is rapidly transferred to the nucleus and then to autophagosomes. In growth-quiescent MEFs, the HS that is susceptible to deaminative cleavage is mainly attached to endosomal Gpc-1. In previous studies (24Cheng F. Cappai R. Ciccotosto G.D. Svensson G. Multhaup G. Fransson L.-Å. Mani K. Suppression of amyloid β A11 antibody immunoreactivity by vitamin C. Possible role of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides derived from glypican-1 by ascorbate-induced, nitric oxide (NO)-catalyzed degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27559-27572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we did not observe extensive nuclear accumulation of anMan-containing HS when Tg2576 MEFs were exposed to ascorbate for 3 h or more. The present results show that nuclear accumulation of HS is complete within 30 min in WT MEFs. Prolonged ascorbate treatment of Tg2576 MEFs may have exhausted the Gpc-1-SNO pool, and most of the HS may have reached the autophagosome compartment. Staining with mAb AM could be affected by changes in HS structure and/or by epitope availability. Changes in HS structure near the anMan of the reducing end after release from Gpc-1 by heparanase cleavage is unlikely as its cleavage sites should be far removed from the reducing end. In the nucleus where HS can interact strongly with the basic histones, epitope availability did not appear to be a problem. Nuclear translocation of anMan-containing HS was affected by inhibition of β- and γ-secretases. Although the inhibitors used could affect other signaling pathways, it appears likely that APP/APLP2 degradation products are involved in the endosome-to-cytosol transfer. The β-inhibitor efficiently blocked nuclear uptake in both WT and Tg2576 MEFs as well as in N2a cells. β-Cleavage generates a soluble N-terminal APP fragment (sAPPβ) and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (βCTF) that may be involved in the S-nitrosylation of Gpc-1 (10Cappai R. Cheng F. Ciccotosto G.D. Needham B.E. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. Fransson L.-A. Mani K. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer disease and its paralog, APLP2, modulate the Cu/Zn-nitric oxide-catalyzed degradation of glypican-1 heparan sulfate in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13913-13920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in the transfer of HS across the lipid bilayer, respectively. The γ-inhibitor efficiently blocked nuclear targeting in N2a cells, whereas it was less efficient in WT MEFs and totally inactive in Tg2576 MEFs. These results imply that Aβ peptides and/or Aβ-like peptides as well as the remaining C-terminal fragment of APP (γCTF) may also be involved. The lack of effect in Tg2576 MEFs may reflect an inability to reach a sufficiently high inhibitor concentration to diminish production of Aβ. Aβ peptides can assume a variety of oligomeric conformations, some of which may be pore-forming or may function as cell-penetrating peptides that can deliver large cargo molecules, including HS, into cells (2Benilova I.

Biosci. 2013; 5: 509-516Crossref Google Scholar). Such Aβ assemblies formed in vitro can be toxic to cells (2Benilova I. Karran E. De Strooper B. The toxic Aβ oligomer and Alzheimer's disease: an emperor in need of clothes.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that Aβ assemblies formed in the presence of anMan-containing HS degradation products are non-toxic (25Cheng F. Ruscher K. Fransson L.-Å. Mani K. Non-toxic amyloid β formed in the presence of glypican-1 or its deaminatively generated heparan sulfate degradation products.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 1510-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is possible that complexes between Aβ peptides and anMan-containing HS are involved in endosomal exit of HS. Thereby, formation of toxic Aβ is precluded. The deaminative cleavage sites in Gpc-1 HS are preferentially located near the linkage region to the core protein. Therefore, the anMan-containing HS degradation products consist mostly of almost full-length HS chains (11Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-A.

The nuclear HS isolated from hepatocytes was also of polysaccharide size (19Fedarko N.S. Conrad H.E. A unique heparan sulfate in the nuclei of hepatocytes. Structural changes with the growth state of the cells.J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The functional role of HS inside the nucleus remains to be elucidated. Earlier studies have implicated histones, transcription factors, kinases, and topoisomerases as target molecules (34Dudás J. Ramadori G. Knittel T. Neubauer K. Raddatz D. Egedy K. Kovalszky I.

J. 2000; 350: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Evidence that nuclear HS regulates the cell cycle, proliferation, transcription, and nuclear import of cargo is mounting (35Stewart M.D. Sanderson R.D. Heparan sulfate in the nucleus and its control of cellular functions.Matrix Biol. 2014; 35C: 56-59Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of anMan-containing HS may require binding to proteins that contain a nuclear localization signal (35Stewart M.D. Sanderson R.D. Heparan sulfate in the nucleus and its control of cellular functions.Matrix Biol. 2014; 35C: 56-59Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The anMan residue, which contains a free aldehyde, can couple reversibly to amino groups in proteins via an aldimine bond. HS may transport positively charged cargo from the cytosol into the nucleus (31Sandgren S. Wittrup A. Cheng F. Jönsson M. Eklund E. Busch S. Belting M. The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 transfers extracellular DNA plasmids to the nuclear compartment of mammalian cells via lipid rafts and proteoglycan-dependent endocytosis.J. Biol.

This should be particularly important for non-dividing cells like neurons. Manipulations of Aβ production may thus have deleterious effects upon HS function in the nucleus. The present findings may also contribute to an understanding of the physiological function of APP, which is still incomplete (36Shariati S.A. De Strooper B. Redundancy and divergence in the amyloid precursor protein family.FEBS Letters. 2013; 587: 2036-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)."

However, 48% (120/249) PP also reported use of serological tests for TB diagnosis. In the new TB case vignette, 38% (94/249) PP reported use of at least one second line anti-TB drug in the treatment regimen. RNTCP training was not associated with diagnostic or treatment practices.In Pune, India, despite a decade of training activities by the RNTCP, high proportions of providers resorted to TB serology for diagnosis and second-line anti-TB drug use in new TB patients. Efforts to achieve universal access to quality TB management must account for the low quality of care by PP and the lack of demonstrated effect of current training efforts."

Understanding protein sub-nuclear localization can hence be an important step towards understanding biological functions of the nucleus. Here we have described a method, SubNucPred developed by us for predicting the sub-nuclear localization of proteins. This method predicts protein localization for 10 different sub-nuclear locations sequentially by combining presence or absence of unique Pfam domain and amino acid composition based SVM model. The prediction accuracy during leave-one-out cross-validation for centromeric proteins was 85.05%, for chromosomal proteins 76.85%, for nuclear speckle proteins 81.27%, for nucleolar proteins 81.79%, for nuclear envelope proteins 79.37%, for nuclear matrix proteins 77.78%, for nucleoplasm proteins 76.98%, for nuclear pore complex proteins 88.89%, for PML body proteins 75.40% and for telomeric proteins it was 83.33%. Comparison with other reported methods showed that SubNucPred performs better than existing methods.

Strain F is given to 0–7 days old chicks and R2B is given to older birds which are around 6–8 weeks old. To understand the genetic makeup of these two strains, a complete genome study and phylogenetic analysis of the F, HN genes of these vaccine strains were carried out. Both the viral strains had a genome length of 15,186 nucleotides and consisted of six genes with conserved complimentary 3' leader and 5' trailer regions. The fusion protein cleavage site of strain F is GGRQGRL and strain R2B is RRQKRF. Although both the viral strains had different virulence attributes, the length of the HN protein was similar with 577 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of F, HN and complete genome sequences grouped these two strains in genotype II category which are considered as early genotypes and corroborated with their years of isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2042274537,"Although the intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors controls specific signaling events, it is unclear how the spatiotemporal control of signaling contributes to complex pathophysiological processes such as inflammation. By using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and superresolution microscopy, we found that substance P (SP) induces the association of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) with two classes of proteins that regulate SP signaling from plasma and endosomal membranes: the scaffolding proteins β-arrestin (βARRs) 1 and 2 and the transmembrane metallopeptidases ECE-1c and ECE-1d. In HEK293 cells and non-transformed human colonocytes, we observed that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and βARR1/2 terminate plasma membrane Ca(2+) signaling and initiate receptor trafficking to endosomes that is necessary for sustained activation of ERKs in the nucleus. βARRs deliver the SP-NK1R endosomes, where ECE-1 associates with the complex, degrades SP, and allows the NK1R, freed from βARRs, to recycle. Thus, both ECE-1 and βARRs mediate the resensitization of NK1R Ca(2+) signaling at the plasma membrane. Sustained exposure of colonocytes to SP activates NF-κB and stimulates IL-8 secretion. This proinflammatory signaling is unaffected by inhibition of the endosomal ERK pathway but is suppressed by ECE-1 inhibition or βARR2 knockdown. Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, which also contributes to sustained NK1R signaling at the plasma membrane, similarly attenuates IL-8 secretion. Thus, the primary function of βARRs and ECE-1 in SP-dependent inflammatory signaling is to promote resensitization, which allows the sustained NK1R signaling from the plasma membrane that drives inflammation."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the key characteristics of oral paediatric medicines in the PIPs and the changes implemented as a result of the EMA/PDCO review.All PIPs agreed by 31 December 2011 were identified through a proprietary EMA-database. PIPs were included if they contained an agreed proposal to develop an oral medicine for children 0 to 11 years. Information on the therapeutic area (EMA classification system); target age range (as defined by industry) and pharmaceutical characteristics (active substance, dosage form(s) as listed in the PIP, strength of each dosage form, excipients in each strength of each dosage form) was extracted from the EMA website or the EMA/PDCO assessment reports.A hundred and fifty PIPs were included corresponding to 16 therapeutic areas and 220 oral dosage forms in 431 strengths/compositions. Eighty-two PIPs (37%) included tablets, 44 (20%) liquids and 35 (16%) dosage forms with a specific composition/strength that were stored as a solid but swallowed as a liquid e.g. dispersible tablets. The EMA/PDCO review resulted in an increase of 13 (207 to 220) oral paediatric dosage forms and 44 (387 to 431) dosage forms with a specific composition/strength. For many PIPs, the target age range was widened and the excipient composition and usability aspects modified.The EMA/PDCO review realized an increase in the number of requirements for the development of oral dosage forms and a larger increase in the number of dosage forms with a specific composition/strength, both targeting younger children.

https://openalex.org/W1965843623,"A frequent pattern emerging from biodiversity-ecosystem function studies is that functional group richness enhances ecosystem functions such as primary productivity. However, the manipulation of functional group richness goes along with major disadvantages like the transformation of functional trait data into categories or the exclusion of functional differences between organisms in the same group. In a mesocosm study we manipulated plant functional diversity based on the multi-trait Functional Diversity (FD)-approach of Petchey and Gaston by using database data of seven functional traits and information on the origin of the species in terms of being native or exotic. Along a gradient ranging from low to high FD we planted 40 randomly selected eight-species mixtures under controlled conditions. We found a significant positive linear correlation of FD with aboveground productivity and a negative correlation with invasibility of the plant communities. Based on community-weighted mean calculations for each functional trait, we figured out that the traits N-fixation and species origin, i.e. being native or exotic, played the most important role for community productivity. Our results suggest that the identification of the impact of functional trait diversity and the relative contributions of relevant traits is essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity for ecosystem functions such as aboveground biomass production and resistance against invasion."

Methods In this study, GPx4+/−, GPx4+/+, and GPx4-overexpressing transgenic mice were created for comparison. The mRNA and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in RPE/choroid tissue were evaluated before and after CNV induction by laser. Moreover, we investigated the changes in the VEGF-A mRNA level in RPE/choroid tissue in the CNV model that have not been clearly shown previously. Lipid peroxidation in RPE/choroid tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using antibody against 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. To investigate the protective role of GPx4, the size of laser-induced CNV was compared on day 7 among the mice expressing different levels of GPx4. Results In the laser-induced CNV mouse model, laser treatment reduced the VEGF-A mRNA level in RPE/choroid tissue, while it increased the VEGF-A protein level. Evaluation of VEGF-A expression in RPE/choroid tissue of the GPx4+/−, GPx4+/+, and GPx4 transgenic mice revealed that GPx4 increased the VEGF-A protein level under physiological conditions (i.e., without laser treatment), while GPx4 suppressed the increase in the VEGF-A protein level under pathological conditions (i.e., after CNV induction by laser). In addition, GPx4 reduced the CNV size in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. Conclusions GPx4 suppresses the increase in the VEGF-A protein level, which occurs during the development of pathological CNV, thus partly explaining the protective effect of GPx4 against CNV."
https://openalex.org/W2074925042,"Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), a free radical scavenger, is used for the clinical treatment of retinal injury. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of edaravone against diabetic retinal damage in the mouse. Diabetic retinopathy in the mouse was induced by injection of streptozotocin. Edaravone was given once-daily and was intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated at a dose of 3 mg/kg from streptozotocin injection to 4 weeks after onset of diabetes. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) damage was evaluated by recording the pattern electroretinogram (ERG). RGCs damage was also detected by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined fluorometrically. The expressions of phosporylated-ERK1/2, BDNF, and caspase-3 were determined by Western blot analysis. Retinal levels of ROS, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly increased, whereas the expression of BDNF was significantly decreased in the retinas of diabetic mice, compared to nondiabetic mice. Administration of edaravone significantly attenuated diabetes induced RGCs death, upregulation of ROS, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and cleaved caspase-3 and downregulation of BDNF. These findings suggest that oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in diabetic retinal damage and that systemic administration of edaravone may slow the progression of retinal neuropathy induced by diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2021338023,"Web services today are among the most widely used groups for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Service selection is one of the most significant current discussions in SOA, which evaluates discovered services and chooses the best candidate from them. Although a majority of service selection techniques apply Quality of Service (QoS), the behaviour of QoS-based service selection leads to service selection problems in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). In the existing works, the confidence level of decision makers is neglected and does not consider their expertise in assessing Web services. In this paper, we employ the VIKOR (VIšekriterijumskoKOmpromisnoRangiranje) method, which is absent in the literature for service selection, but is well-known in other research. We propose a QoS-based approach that deals with service selection by applying VIKOR with improvement of features. This research determines the weights of criteria based on user preference and accounts for the confidence level of decision makers. The proposed approach is illustrated by an example in order to demonstrate and validate the model. The results of this research may facilitate service consumers to attain a more efficient decision when selecting the appropriate service."
https://openalex.org/W2041579432,"Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations have been used to predict the binding affinity of a set of ligands towards HIV-1 RT associated RNase H (RNH). The QM based chelation calculations show improved binding affinity prediction for the inhibitors compared to using an empirical scoring function. Furthermore, full protein fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations were conducted and subsequently analysed for individual residue stabilization/destabilization energy contributions to the overall binding affinity in order to better understand the true and false predictions. After a successful assessment of the methods based on the use of a training set of molecules, QM based chelation calculations were used as filter in virtual screening of compounds in the ZINC database. By this, we find, compared to regular docking, QM based chelation calculations to significantly reduce the large number of false positives. Thus, the computational models tested in this study could be useful as high throughput filters for searching HIV-1 RNase H active-site molecules in the virtual screening process."
https://openalex.org/W2053938169,"Initial steps in protein synthesis are highly regulated processes as they define the reading frame of the translation machinery. Eukaryotic translation initiation is a process facilitated by numerous factors (eIFs), aimed to form a ""scanning"" mechanism toward the initiation codon. Translation initiation of the main open reading frame (ORF) in an mRNA transcript has been reported to be regulated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in a manner of re-initiation. This mode of regulation is governed by the phosphorylation status of eIF2α and controlled by cellular stresses. Another mode of translational initiation regulation is leaky scanning, and this regulatory process has not been extensively studied. We have identified arsenite- inducible regulatory particle-associated protein (AIRAP) transcript to be translationally induced during arsenite stress conditions. AIRAP transcript contains a single uORF in a poor-kozak context. AIRAP translation induction is governed by means of leaky scanning and not re-initiation. This induction of AIRAP is solely dependent on eIF1 and the uORF kozak context. We show that eIF1 is phosphorylated under specific conditions that induce protein misfolding and have biochemically characterized this site of phosphorylation. Our data indicate that leaky scanning like re-initiation is responsive to stress conditions and that leaky scanning can induce ORF translation by bypassing poor kozak context of a single uORF transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2054884766,"We have constructed a small and highly efficient binary Ti vector pSiM24 for plant transformation with maximum efficacy. In the pSiM24 vector, the size of the backbone of the early binary vector pKYLXM24 (GenBank Accession No. HM036220; a derivative of pKYLX71) was reduced from 12.8 kb to 7.1 kb. The binary vector pSiM24 is composed of the following genetic elements: left and right T-DNA borders, a modified full-length transcript promoter (M24) of Mirabilis mosaic virus with duplicated enhancer domains, three multiple cloning sites, a 3'rbcsE9 terminator, replication functions for Escherichia coli (ColE1) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (pRK2-OriV) and the replicase trfA gene, selectable marker genes for kanamycin resistance (nptII) and ampicillin resistance (bla). The pSiM24 plasmid offers a wide selection of cloning sites, high copy numbers in E. coli and a high cloning capacity for easily manipulating different genetic elements. It has been fully tested in transferring transgenes such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) both transiently (agro-infiltration, protoplast electroporation and biolistic) and stably in plant systems (Arabidopsis and tobacco) using both agrobacterium-mediated transformation and biolistic procedures. Not only reporter genes, several other introduced genes were also effectively expressed using pSiM24 expression vector. Hence, the pSiM24 vector would be useful for various plant biotechnological applications. In addition, the pSiM24 plasmid can act as a platform for other applications, such as gene expression studies and different promoter expressional analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2074710473,"Cognitive processing generally deteriorates as people age. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in human-specific behavior, such as preparing for future actions and prospective memory; hence, the PFC may be voluntarily activated even during the ""resting"" condition that precedes task execution. The purpose of the present study was to investigate changes in voluntary pre-task activation as a result of aging using a paradigm that includes a longer intertrial interval (e.g., 30 sec) than has been used in previous studies.A total of 120 cognitively normal adults (young: 60, old: 60) participated in this near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study. All subjects performed 6 repetitions of the working memory task, which included a 30 sec resting period and a 28.8 sec task period. The resting period was divided into baseline and pre-task (preT) periods, and the task period was divided into early easy task (eT) and late difficult task (dT) periods. We then normalized the data, analyzed the magnitude of task-related NIRS responses in each period and compared the results between groups using an analysis of variance test.Statistical analyses revealed a significant interaction between group × optode location × period, in which hemodynamic responses in the PFC during the preT period were smaller in the elderly in than young adults. By contrast, during the task period, the hemodynamic responses were higher in the lateral PFC in the elderly than in young adults. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between hemodynamic changes during the preT period in the PFC and correct answer ratios in both groups.These findings suggest that more pre-task activation in the anterior PFC is related to better cognitive performance in humans. Thus, a reduction in this activation might partly explain cognitive decline in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W1983240281,"Although artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology has been used frequently in gene silencing in plants, little research has been devoted to investigating the accuracy of amiRNA precursor processing. In this work, amiRNAchs1 (amiRchs1), based on the Arabidopsis miR319a precursor, was expressed in order to suppress the expression of CHS genes in petunia. The transgenic plants showed the CHS gene-silencing phenotype. A modified 5' RACE technique was used to map small-RNA-directed cleavage sites and to detect processing intermediates of the amiRchs1 precursor. The results showed that the target CHS mRNAs were cut at the expected sites and that the amiRchs1 precursor was processed from loop to base. The accumulation of small RNAs in amiRchs1 transgenic petunia petals was analyzed using the deep-sequencing technique. The results showed that, alongside the accumulation of the desired artificial microRNAs, additional small RNAs that originated from other regions of the amiRNA precursor were also accumulated at high frequency. Some of these had previously been found to be accumulated at low frequency in the products of ath-miR319a precursor processing and some of them were accompanied by 3'-tailing variant. Potential targets of the undesired small RNAs were discovered in petunia and other Solanaceae plants. The findings draw attention to the potential occurrence of undesired target silencing induced by such additional small RNAs when amiRNA technology is used. No appreciable production of secondary small RNAs occurred, despite the fact that amiRchs1 was designed to have perfect complementarity to its CHS-J target. This confirmed that perfect pairing between an amiRNA and its targets is not the trigger for secondary small RNA production. In conjunction with the observation that amiRNAs with perfect complementarity to their target genes show high efficiency and specificity in gene silencing, this finding has an important bearing on future applications of amiRNAs in gene silencing in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2021343058,"Despite the pleiotropic effects of the progesterone receptor in breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms in play remain largely unknown. To gain a global view of the PR-orchestrated networks, we used next-generation sequencing to determine the progestin-regulated transcriptome in T47D breast cancer cells. We identify a large number of PR target genes involved in critical cellular programs, such as regulation of transcription, apoptosis, cell motion and angiogenesis. Integration of the transcriptomic data with the PR-binding profiling of hormonally treated cells identifies numerous components of the small-GTPases signaling pathways as direct PR targets. Progestin-induced deregulation of the small GTPases may contribute to the PR's role in mammary tumorigenesis. Transcript expression analysis reveals significant expression changes of specific transcript variants in response to the extracellular hormonal stimulus. Using the NET1 gene as an example, we show that the PR can dictate alternative promoter usage leading to the upregulation of an isoform that may play a role in metastatic breast cancer. Future studies should aim to characterize these selectively regulated variants and evaluate their clinical utility in prognosis and targeted therapy of hormonally responsive breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2004478810,"Inclusion bodies (IBs) are typically non-functional particles of aggregated proteins. However, some proteins in fusion with amyloid-like peptides, viral coat proteins, and cellulose binding domains (CBDs) generate IB particles retaining the original functions in cells. Here, we attempted to generate CBD IBs displaying functional leucine zipper proteins (LZs) as bait for localizing cytosolic proteins in E. coli. When a red fluorescent protein was tested as a target protein, microscopic observations showed that the IBs red-fluoresced strongly. When different LZ pairs with KDs of 8–1,000 µM were tested as the bait and prey, the localization of the red fluorescence appeared to change following the affinities between the LZs, as observed by fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. This result proposed that LZ-tagged CBD IBs can be applied as an in vivo matrix to entrap cytosolic proteins in E. coli while maintaining their original activities. In addition, easy detection of localization to IBs provides a unique platform for the engineering and analyses of protein-protein interactions in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1993295153,"Our previous work has characterized the functional and clonotypic features of two respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epitope-specific T cell responses in mice. Following single-cell sequencing, we selected T cell receptor sequences to represent both a public and a private clone specific for the dominant KdM282–90 epitope for the generation of T cell receptor transgenic (TCR Tg) mice. We evaluated cells from these TCR Tg strains for three major functions of CD8+ T cells: proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity. In vitro comparisons of the functional characteristics of T cells from the newly-generated mice demonstrated many similarities in their responsiveness to cognate antigen stimulation. Cells from both TRBV13-1 (private) and TRBV13-2 (public) TCR Tg mice had similar affinity, and proliferated similarly in vitro in response to cognate antigen stimulation. When transferred to BALB/c mice, cells from both strains demonstrated extensive proliferation in mediastinal lymph nodes following RSV infection, with TRBV13-2 demonstrating better in vivo proliferation. Both strains similarly expressed cytokines and chemokines following stimulation, and had similar Granzyme B and perforin expression, however cells expressing TRBV13-1 demonstrated better cytolytic activity than TRBV13-2 cells. These new, well-characterized mouse strains provide new opportunities to study molecular mechanisms that control the phenotype and function of CD8+ T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2167445050,"Although cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI) is an important mediator of cGMP signaling and upcoming drug target, its in vivo-biochemistry is not well understood. Many studies showed that purified cGKI autophosphorylates multiple sites at its N-terminus. Autophosphorylation might be involved in kinase activation, but it is unclear whether this happens also in intact cells. To study cGKI autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, we have generated phospho-specific antisera against major in vitro-autophosphorylation sites of the cGKI isoforms, cGKIα and cGKIβ. These antisera detected specifically and with high sensitivity phospho-cGKIα (Thr58), phospho-cGKIα (Thr84), or phospho-cGKIβ (Thr56/Ser63/Ser79). Using these antisera, we show that ATP-induced autophosphorylation of cGKI in purified preparations and cell extracts did neither require nor induce an enzyme conformation capable of substrate heterophosphorylation; it was even inhibited by pre-incubation with cGMP. Interestingly, phospho-cGKI species were not detectable in intact murine cells and tissues, both under basal conditions and after induction of cGKI catalytic activity. We conclude that N-terminal phosphorylation, although readily induced in vitro, is not required for the catalytic activity of cGKIα and cGKIβ in vivo. These results will also inform screening strategies to identify novel cGKI modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2056956870,"There are two isoforms of cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase (hcArgRS) in human cells. The long form is a component of the multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, and the other is an N-terminal truncated form (NhcArgRS), free in the cytoplasm. It has been shown that the two forms of ArgRS arise from alternative translational initiation in a single mRNA. The short form is produced from the initiation at a downstream, in-frame AUG start codon. Interestingly, our data suggest that the alternative translational initiation of hcArgRS mRNA also takes place in Escherichia coli transformants. When the gene encoding full-length hcArgRS was overexpressed in E. coli, two forms of hcArgRS were observed. The N-terminal sequencing experiment identified that the short form was identical to the NhcArgRS in human cytoplasm. By constructing a bicistronic system, our data support that the mRNA encoding the N-terminal extension of hcArgRS has the capacity of independently recruiting E. coli ribosomes. Furthermore, two critical elements for recruiting prokaryotic ribosomes were identified, the “AGGA” core of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the “A-rich” sequence located just proximal to the alternative in-frame initiation site. Although the mechanisms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic translational initiation are distinct, they share some common features. The ability of the hcArgRS mRNA to recruit the prokaryotic ribosome may provide clues for shedding light on the mechanism of alternative translational initiation of hcArgRS mRNA in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976685883,"The role of the CD200 ligand-CD200 receptor (CD200-CD200R) inhibitory axis is highly important in controlling myeloid cell function. Since the activation of myeloid cells is crucial in arteriogenesis, we hypothesized that disruption of the CD200-CD200R axis promotes arteriogenesis in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. Female Cd200−/− and wildtype (C57Bl/6J) mice underwent unilateral femoral artery ligation. Perfusion recovery was monitored over 7 days using Laser-Doppler analysis and was increased in Cd200−/− mice at day 3 and 7 after femoral artery ligation, compared to wildtype. Histology was performed on hindlimb muscles at baseline, day 3 and 7 to assess vessel geometry and number and inflammatory cell influx. Vessel geometry in non-ischemic muscles was larger, and vessel numbers in ischemic muscles were increased in Cd200−/− mice compared to wildtype. Furthermore, T lymphocyte influx was increased in Cd200−/− compared to wildtype. CD200R agonist treatment was performed in male C57Bl/6J mice to validate the role of the CD200-CD200R axis in arteriogenesis. CD200R agonist treatment after unilateral femoral artery ligation resulted in a significant decrease in vessel geometry, perfusion recovery and T lymphocyte influx at day 7 compared to isotype treatment. In this study, we show a causal role for the CD200-CD200R inhibitory axis in arteriogenesis in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. Lack of CD200R signaling is accompanied by increased T lymphocyte recruitment to the collateral vasculature and results in enlargement of preexisting collateral arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2055157770,"This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel."
https://openalex.org/W2068545520,"The majority of HIV-1 strains enter CD4+ T cells using the CCR5 and/or CXCR4 co-receptor. However, we recently identified a transmitted/founder (T/F) virus (ZP6248) that efficiently used an alternative coreceptor GPR15, rather than commonly used CXCR4 and CCR5, to establish clinical infection. To understand which regions in the env gene were critical for the atypical coreceptor usage, we generated a set of V3 mutants and determined their infectivity in GHOST cells that expressed different coreceptors. When the variable loop 3 (V3) in YU2 was replaced with the ZP6248 V3 (YU2.6248V3), the chimera YU2.6248V3 infected GPR15+ cells but not CCR5+ cells. To determine which amino acids in V3 was responsible for this phenotype change, each of the eight amino acids that differed from the subtype B consensus V3 was substituted with alanine. The G306A and S322A mutations significantly reduced the replication capacity of YU2.6248V3 in GPR15+ cells, while all other alanine substitutions at positions 307, 314, 315, 316, 317 and 318 completely abrogated the infectivity of YU2.6248V3 in GPR15+ cells. The E314A mutation, as the E314G mutation reported before, also rendered the YU2.6248V3 infectious in CCR5+ cells, while none of other alanine mutants could infect CCR5+ cells. These results demonstrated that amino acids in ZP6248 V3 might form a unique conformation that was critical for the interaction with GPR15 while the amino acids at position 314 in the V3 crown of ZP6248 played a key role in interaction with both CCR5 and GPR15. The unique phenotypes of ZP6248 can serve as a model to understand how HIV-1 explores the diverse coreceptor reservoir through novel genetic variants to establish clinical infection."
