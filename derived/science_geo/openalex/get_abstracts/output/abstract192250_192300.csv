https://openalex.org/W2047167226,"INTERSEXES in Asellus aquaticus L., in which the anterior abdominal appendages are intermediate in form between the male and female condition, have been recorded from time to time and their occurrence has been reviewed by Maercks1. They were always females, 5–8 mm. in length. Needham2 has pointed out that their anterior pleopods, which were never completely male in form, correspond to various stages in the normal development of the male organs."
https://openalex.org/W2033003230,"A MOULD, isolated by Kurung1 in 1944 and considered to be a strain of Aspergillus ustus (Bain.) Thom and Church, was shown to produce a metabolic liquor which possessed a marked antibiotic activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. ranae. Afterwards, Hogeboom and Craig2, by application of a counter-current technique, were able to isolate, from an ethereal extract of this mould and its substrate, two crystalline products, called compound I and compound II, which showed a very high activity against M. ranae. Doering, Dubos, Noyce and Dreyfus3, using the same strain of mould, isolated a number of chlorine-containing metabolic products, one of which was proved to be identical with Hogeboom and Craig's compound I. Doering et al. proposed the name ‘ustin’ for this compound, established its empirical formula (C19H15O5Cl3) and published a superficial account of some of its chemical properties."

https://openalex.org/W1977394030,"Mytilicola intestinalis is common in the mussel, Mytilus edulis, at several points around the coast of Britain. It has also been reported from oysters, Ostrea edulis1. In an effort to determine the conditions governing the infection of oysters, and the extent to which other molluscs may act as a reservoir of Mytilicola intestinalis, a number of artificial infections have been attempted."

https://openalex.org/W2024477710,"WE have previously discussed1,2 the classification of lower milk canines by multivariate statistical analysis. By this means we have shown that the Taungs and Kromdraai specimens found in South Africa are neither those of chimpanzees, gorillas nor orang-utans and that, in tests based on four carefully chosen dimensions of the specimens, they cannot be distinguished from the teeth of humans."

https://openalex.org/W2034656802,"DURING an investigation on bat malaria on the East African coast, mosquitoes were fed on infected bats to ascertain the possible course of sporogony of the parasite. The contents of the mid-gut of mosquitoes, fed at various intervals before dissection, were then examined, and instead of ookinetes of malaria, numerous flagellates were found in all the specimens. These included the following:"

Fifty plants when at the 8-leaf stage were infected artificially with pure virus. Groups of these and of the corresponding control plants were harvested 17, 27 and 40 days after infection."

https://openalex.org/W2078488240,"IT is difficult to obtain accurate information about the properties of viruses which lose their infectivity in vitro too quickly. Tomato spotted wilt virus is one of these, and investigations on it are further limited by the fact that it is inactivated at comparatively low temperatures (35° C). The in vitro life of tomato spotted wilt virus was reported by Bald and Samuel1 to be about four hours in undiluted expressed juice held at room temperature. Subsequent work by Best and Samuel2 and by Best3 showed that the factors causing inactivation were the pH value of the juice and a tyrosinase catalysed oxidation, and that by controlling the pH value and redox potential of the medium4 the virus could be maintained infective in solution for thirty-five days at 2° C."
https://openalex.org/W2084207323,"IT is generally assumed that the intestinal epithelium is formed in the crypts of Lieberkuhn. From this region of numerous mitoses the cells are presumed to move up towards the summit of the villi1 from which they are shed. The average time required for the cells to pass through this phase has been calculated to be 1.57 days in the duodenum and 1.35 days in the ileum of the white rat2. How, when and where the goblet cells evacuate their mucus is not definitely known."

https://openalex.org/W1981138203,"EXPERIMENTS using monoenergetic protons from a Van de Graaff accelerator have been carried out on the formation of hydrogen peroxide in water. The irradiation chamber was of ‘Pyrex’ glass, including a thin window through which the protons entered. The total volume of water irradiated was 0.4 c.c.; however, the irradiation volume was only 6.9 × 10−4 c.c., because of the short range of the protons in the sample. The absolute amount of hydrogen peroxide which is formed does not change when the total amount of water is varied from 0.2 to 0.5 c.c. The chemical determinations were made with a Beckman model B spectrophotometer at 3500 A. utilizing the iodide method suggested by Ghormley1; this method is capable of measuring 2 × 1018 molecules of hydrogen peroxide per litre. The water was freshly prepared by redistillation from a permanganate solution with a ‘Pyrex’ still."

(It would have been better to use secretions taken from the cervix itself; but such samples were too small for the technique available.) All samples were then reduced to a constant solid content of 0.14 per cent by dispersing in water and clearing in a centrifuge for one hour at about 7,000 g. Absorption curves, determined between 200 and 400 mµ, in general showed a maximum at about 273 mµ and a minimum at about 259 mµ."

The wheat roots are provided with a complete cytochrome system, the prosthetic groups of which correspond to the cytochromes a (cytochrome oxidase), c and b. Before b, a fourth component, probably identical with succinic dehydrogenase, acts as the source of electrons. This component has a strong band at 570–575 mµ."

We have found, however, that chloranilic acid, previously used by Tyner2 for the colorimetric estimation of calcium, is preferable to picrolonic acid in that it is more sensitive and requires a much shorter reaction-time."
