https://openalex.org/W2088178444,"The interpretation of micropaleontological data based on the fossil remains of planktonic organisms requires an appropriate reference frame. The environmental changes that the plankton experience are a combination of geographic and seasonal factors, correlated by the average drift trajectories. Appropriate methods have been developed to study two drifts in the North Atlantic, one form the west-central Sargasso Sea to the Norwegian Sea and another around the subtropical Sargasso Gyre. The data on planktonic foraminifera from core tops can be used to relate the relative species distribution to the characteristics of the present sea surface. At any one location, the fossil assembly results from a superposition of plankton that have had varied time-temperature histories. To interpret the climatic and geologic history from downcore data will require an iterative technique. One assumes a surface climatology, determines the fossil record this would produce, and then compares this inference with available core data. The climatological assumptions are then modified until a satisfactory agreement is reached."

The economics would improve if irrigation was practiced all year round, even in the hot summer season. The calculations made here are expected to be valid for the windier 10 percent of the locations identified from available wind speed records. Other, windier locations are expected to be identified when more wind speed data are collected in the future. Governmental policies along lines similar to those for rural electrification may be needed to support research and development efforts to optimize the designs of windmills and to promote their use in rural areas."

Roever, of Washington University, presented an elaborate paper discussing in detail the subject of the establishment of the method of least squares. Professor F. E. Nipher presented two papers, entitled respectively Positive Photography, with special reference to eclipse work, and The Frictional Effects oi Railway Trains upon the Air; and Mr. C. F. Baker exhibited an interesting collection representing nearly all of the species of fleas thus far known, which he had prepared for the United States National Museum."
