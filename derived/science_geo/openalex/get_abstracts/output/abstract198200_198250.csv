https://openalex.org/W2060612952,"DURING the past year or more, Dr. Fred H. Allen, jun.1,2, of the Blood Grouping Laboratory, Boston, has opened up the Kell blood-group system through the discovery of two antibodies additional to anti-K and anti-k, called anti-Kpa and anti-Kpb, which unquestionably define antigens in the Kell system. The former, he tells us, reacts with about two per cent of random bloods, while the latter reacted with all but 2 of 5,500. All bloods tested reacted with at least anti-K or anti-k and one of the new antibodies. In order to facilitate further investigation of the Kell system, Dr. Allen supplied certain laboratories, of which ours was one, with samples of these two antibodies. Having these to hand allowed us recently to define a new Kell phenotype, namely, K–, k–, Kp(a–b–), in two sisters. The Kell phenotypes of the family are as follows :"

https://openalex.org/W2084699919,"IN isolated metathoraxes of the cockroach Periplaneta americana, 85 per cent of the mass of which is formed by the thoracic muscles, changes in various fractions of acid-soluble phosphorus compounds were followed during exposure of the preparations to anoxia. It was found that in such conditions there is a rapid breakdown of the labile phosphorus compounds, namely, arginine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate1. At the same time, however, the level of inorganic phosphate did not increase significantly; on the contrary, in many cases it showed a tendency to decrease. As the total acid-soluble phosphorus did not change at all, these facts indicated an accumulation of some stable phosphorus compound during anaerobiosis: this compound was found to be stable even to prolonged acid hydrolysis (three hours in normal acid)."

https://openalex.org/W2057805229,"THE relationship between the length of the chromosomes and the frequency with which they form chiasmata at meiosis is well known and has been analysed extensively by Darlington1, Mather2 and others. In general, it is found that long chromosomes form more chiasmata than short chromosomes in the same nucleus. The chiasma frequency, however, is not always found to be directly proportional to length, that is, the potential for forming chiasmata varies between chromosomes to some degree independently of their length. The details of such variation could be investigated in most favourable circumstances during observations made in Locusta migratoria. These are briefly described below."
https://openalex.org/W2012255027,"SOME sheep appear to pass consistently lower urine volumes than others, and during metabolism cage experiments with HK and LK 1 Scottish Blackface sheep there was a suggestion that within each of these two groups there was much more variation between animals than between repeated observations on the same animal, and that, on the whole, urine volumes from LK animals tended to be lower than those from HK animals. The results of an analysis of the results from fifteen trials involving 19 LK and 17 HK animals are given below. Four or six animals were used per trial and equal numbers of LK and HK were used in all except three trials. The animals were in the cages for 10, 20, 32 or 93 days in each trial. A standard ration of hay and concentrates (oats and linseed meal) was fed throughout, and a sodium chloride supplement was given in all except three trials, but this did not have a marked effect on urine output."

https://openalex.org/W2017918561,"IN recent years, polyamino-acids, and ethylene-diaminetetra-acetic acid in particular, have proved of substantial value as therapeutic agents in cases of poisoning by radioactive or stable metals. However, the compounds hitherto investigated are of very poor efficiency when treatment is delayed1, and are unable to prevent the deposition of certain elements, such as cerium2 or lanthanum3, in the skeleton, even when administered in most favourable conditions. In view of these findings, experiments on several other chelating substances were performed in the hope of obtaining more effective agents."

https://openalex.org/W2055862407,"MAST cells in epithelium are considered to be extremely rare, and those who have noted them in this site consider that they have migrated from other tissues1. During a study of the structure of the mucous membrane of the œsophagus in the adult cat, we have been impressed by the constant finding of large numbers of mast cells in the epithelium. Basic lead acetate was used as a tissue fixative and meta-chromasia was demonstrated by staining with azure A or with toluidine blue. The mast cells are situated in the basal layers of the epithelium (Fig. 1), and were never observed in the more superficial regions. Although comparative counts have not yet been carried out, it appeared that the epithelium of the cranial two-thirds of the œsophagus contained fewer mast cells than the caudal third where, in any high-power field, as many as seven cells might be found. From the present work, in which the œsophagi of thirty animals have been examined, no evidence can be put forward to suggest that these mast cells appear in the epithelium as the result of migration from the subepithelial tissues, or that they migrate within the epithelium itself."

A number of origins are marked at adequate intervals near the lower edge, the standard and unknown solutions are dropped on these origins (see Fig. 1) and chromatographic development allowed to take place in an upward direction. The cone is immersed in the solvent in a Petri dish placed in a glass vessel with a tight lid (see Fig. 2)."
