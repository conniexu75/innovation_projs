https://openalex.org/W1982499214,"The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk) family is implicated in apoptosis, but its function in brain development is unclear. Here, we address this issue using mutant mice lacking different members of the family (Jnk1, Jnk2, and Jnk3). Mice deficient in Jnk1, Jnk2, Jnk3, and Jnk1/Jnk3 or Jnk2/Jnk3 double mutants all survived normally. Compound mutants lacking Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes were embryonic lethal and had severe dysregulation of apoptosis in brain. Specifically, there was a reduction of cell death in the lateral edges of hindbrain prior to neural tube closure. In contrast, increased apoptosis and caspase activation were found in the mutant forebrain, leading to precocious degeneration. These results suggest that Jnk1 and Jnk2 regulate region-specific apoptosis during early brain development."

https://openalex.org/W2043562994,"The Eph family is thought to exert its function through the complementary expression of receptors and ligands. Here, we show that EphA receptors colocalize on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with EphA ligands, which are expressed in a high-nasal-to-low-temporal pattern. In the stripe assay, only temporal axons are normally sensitive for repellent axon guidance cues of the caudal tectum. However, overexpression of ephrinA ligands on temporal axons abolishes this sensitivity, whereas treatment with PI-PLC both removes ephrinA ligands from retinal axons and induces a striped outgrowth of formerly insensitive nasal axons. In vivo, retinal overexpression of ephrinA2 leads to topographic targeting errors of temporal axons. These data suggest that differential ligand expression on retinal axons is a major determinant of topographic targeting in the retinotectal projection."

https://openalex.org/W1555782211,"A portable, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument, consisting of an array of microfabricated silicon reaction chambers with integrated optical detectors, analyzed samples of 5 to 500 bacteria cells in as little as 7 minutes. The analysis included cell lysis, PCR, detection of the PCR product with a target-specific fluorescence energy transfer probe, and automated alerting of positive signals by the software. Thermal cycle times of only 17 seconds, the fastest that could be achieved on the instrument, yielded good productivity at each cycle and indicated that still faster analysis could potentially be performed. The short run times were achieved because of efficient heating and cooling of the reactions, precision in which the target temperatures were reached, and the sensitive, dedicated mini-optical detection systems."

https://openalex.org/W2094182857,"Recruitment of the coactivator CBP by signal-regulated transcription factors and stimulation of CBP activity are key regulatory events in the induction of gene transcription following Ca2+ flux through ligand- and/or voltage-gated ion channels in hippocampal neurons. The mode of Ca2+ entry (L-type Ca2+ channels versus NMDA receptors) differentially controls the CBP recruitment step to CREB, providing a molecular basis for the observed Ca2+ channel type–dependent differences in gene expression. In contrast, activation of CBP is triggered irrespective of the route of Ca2+ entry, as is activation of c-Jun, that recruits CBP independently of phosphorylation at major regulatory c-Jun phosphorylation sites, serines 63 and 73. This control of CBP recruitment and activation is likely relevant to other CBP-interacting transcription factors and represents a general mechanism through which Ca2+ signals associated with electrical activity may regulate the expression of many genes."
https://openalex.org/W2319017688,"IGF-II, produced by breast cancer epithelial and stromal cells, enhances tumor growth by activating the IGF-I receptor (IGF-I-R) via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Previously we found that the insulin receptor (IR), which is related to the IGF-I-R, is overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Herein, we find that, in breast cancer the IR is activated by IGF-II. In eight human breast cancer cell lines studied there was high affinity IGF-II binding to the IR, with subsequent IR activation. In these lines, IGF-II had a potency up to 63% that of insulin. In contrast, in non malignant human breast cells, IGF-II was less than 1% potent as insulin. Via activation of the IR tyrosine kinase IGF-II stimulated breast cancer cell growth. Moreover, IGF-II also activated the IR in breast cancer tissue specimens; IGF-II was 10-100% as potent as insulin. The IR occurs in two isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exon 11; these isoforms are IR-A (Ex11-) and IR-B (Ex11+). IR-A was predominantly expressed in breast cancer cells and specimens and the potency of IGF-II was correlated to the expression of this isoform (P<0.0001). These data indicate, therefore, that the IR-A, which binds IGF-II with high affinity, is predominantly expressed in breast cancer cells and represents a new autocrine/paracrine loop involved in tumor biology."
https://openalex.org/W2020808982,"The glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila adds new boutons and branches during larval development. We generated transgenic fruit flies that express a novel green fluorescent membrane protein at the postsynaptic specialization, allowing for repeated noninvasive confocal imaging of synapses in live, developing larvae. As synapses grow, existing synaptic boutons stretch apart and new boutons insert between them; in addition, new boutons are added at the ends of existing strings of boutons. Some boutons are added de novo, while others bud from existing boutons. New branches form as multiple boutons bud from existing boutons. Nascent boutons contain active zones, T bars, and synaptic vesicles; we observe no specialized growth structures. Some new boutons exhibit a lower level of Fasciclin II, suggesting that the levels of this synaptic cell adhesion molecule vary locally during synaptic growth."
https://openalex.org/W1998475911,"Oxamflatin [(2E) - 5 - [3 - [(phenylsufonyl) amino] phenyl]-pent-2-en-4-ynohydroxamic acid] induces transcriptional activation of junD and morphological reversion in various NIH3T3-derived transformed cell lines. We found that oxamflatin showed in vitro antiproliferative activity against various mouse and human tumor cell lines with drastic changes in the cell morphology and in vivo antitumor activity against B16 melanoma. Oxamflatin caused an elongated cell shape with filamentous protrusions as well as arrest of the cell cycle at the G1 phase in HeLa cells. These phenotypic changes of HeLa cells were apparently similar to those by trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). The effect of oxamflatin on the transcriptional activity of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was examined and compared with known HDAC inhibitors, TSA, sodium n-butyrate, and FR901228. Oxamflatin as well as all these inhibitors greatly enhanced the transcriptional activity of the CMV promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Oxamflatin, like TSA, inhibited intracellular HDAC activity, as a result of which marked amounts of acetylated histone species accumulated. Finally, effects on expression of several endogenous genes involved in cell morphology and cell cycle control in HeLa cells were analysed. Expression of gelsolin, cyclin E and Cdk inhibitors including p21WAF1/Cip1 was highly augmented, while that of cyclin A and cyclin D1 was decreased by oxamflatin. These results suggest that changes in the expression pattern of the genes regulating cell morphology and the cell cycle due to histone hyperacetylation are responsible for the antitumor activity, the morphological change and the cell cycle arrest induced by oxamflatin."
https://openalex.org/W2155645083,"The transcription factor CREB is involved in mediating many of the long-term effects of activity-dependent plasticity at glutamatergic synapses. Here, we show that activation of NMDA receptors and voltage-sensitive calcium channels leads to CREB-mediated transcription in cortical neurons via a mechanism regulated by CREB-binding protein (CBP). Recruitment of CBP to the promoter is not sufficient for transactivation, but calcium influx can induce CBP-mediated transcription via two distinct transactivation domains. CBP-mediated transcription is stimulus strength-dependent and can be induced by activation of CaM kinase II, CaM kinase IV, and protein kinase A, but not by activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. These observations indicate that CBP can function as a calcium-sensitive transcriptional coactivator that may act as a regulatory switch for glutamate-induced CREB-mediated transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1982914586,"Little is known about how the generation of specific neuronal types at stereotypic positions within the hindbrain is linked to Hox gene–mediated patterning. Here, we show that during neurogenesis, Hox paralog group 2 genes control both anteroposterior (A-P) and dorsoventral (D-V) patterning. Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 differentially regulate, in a rhombomere-specific manner, the expression of several genes in broad D-V-restricted domains or narrower longitudinal columns of neuronal progenitors, immature neurons, and differentiating neuronal subtypes. Moreover, Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 can functionally synergize in controlling the development of ventral neuronal subtypes in rhombomere 3 (r3). Thus, in addition to their roles in A-P patterning, Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 have distinct and restricted functions along the D-V axis during neurogenesis, providing insights into how neuronal fates are assigned at stereotypic positions within the hindbrain."

https://openalex.org/W1968523385,"A general increase in protein synthesis and a specific increase in the synthesis of growth-promoting proteins are necessary for mitogenesis. Regulation of protein synthesis, as well as preferential translation of some mRNAs coding for growth promoting proteins (e.g. cyclin D1), involves the essential protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-4E. This factor is induced by various oncoproteins, and, when overexpressed, it can transform cultured cells. In this report we explore the roles of eIF-4E in human neoplastic disorders of the colon and in the regulation of general and specific protein synthesis. We find that eIF-4E is increased in colon adenomas and carcinomas, and this increase is accompanied in most but not all cases by elevation of cyclin D1 levels. While general protein synthesis is increased by eIF-4E overexpression in cultured cells, only a small proportion of proteins is preferentially up-regulated by eIF-4E, as revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These results are consistent with the view that eIF-4E plays a role in carcinogenesis by increasing general protein synthesis and by preferentially upregulating a subset of putative growth promoting proteins. Our results, taken together with the recent findings that c-myc transcription is negatively regulated by APC and our earlier data on transcriptional activation of eIF-4E expression by c-Myc suggest that eIF-4E is a downstream target of the APC/β-catenin/Tcf-4 pathway, and is strongly involved in colon tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2078147751,"We have investigated the specification of noradrenergic neurotransmitter identity in neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Retroviral expression of both wild-type and dominant-negative forms of the paired homeodomain transcription factor Phox2a indicates a crucial and direct role for this protein (and/or the closely related Phox2b) in the regulation of endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-β hydroxylase (DBH) gene expression in these cells. In collaboration with cAMP, Phox2a can induce expression of TH but not of DBH or of panneuronal genes. Phox2 proteins are, moreover, necessary for the induction of both TH and DBH by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) (which induces Phox2a/b) and forskolin. They are also necessary for neuronal differentiation. These data suggest that Phox2a/b coordinates the specification of neurotransmitter identity and neuronal fate by cooperating environmental signals in sympathetic neuroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2048530738,"In the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, we analyze the contribution of mutations E237A and V251T, together with the proline insertion P236′, in the conversion of the charge selectivity from cationic to anionic. We show that the triple mutant exhibits spontaneous openings displaying anionic selectivity. Furthermore, at position 251, hydrophilic or even negatively charged residues are compatible with an anionic channel. In contrast, the additional proline yields an anionic channel only when inserted between positions 234 and 237; insertion before 234 yields a cationic channel and after 238 alters the receptor surface expression. The coiled 234–238 loop thus directly contributes to the charge selectivity filter of the α7 channel."
https://openalex.org/W2029043803,"We report the role of dCREB2, the Drosophila homolog of CREB/CREM, in circadian rhythms. dCREB2 activity cycles with a 24 hr rhythm in flies, both in a light:dark cycle and in constant darkness. A mutation in dCREB2 shortens circadian locomotor rhythm in flies and dampens the oscillation of period, a known clock gene. Cycling dCREB2 activity is abolished in a period mutant, indicating that dCREB2 and Period affect each other and suggesting that the two genes participate in the same regulatory feedback loop. We propose that dCREB2 supports cycling of the Period/Timeless oscillator. These findings support CREB’s role in mediating adaptive behavioral responses to a variey of environmental stimuli (stress, growth factors, drug addiction, circadian rhythms, and memory formation) in mammals and long-term memory formation and circadian rhythms in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2091455591,"Different Drosophila photoreceptors (R cells) connect to neurons in different optic lobe layers. R1-R6 axons project to the lamina; R7 and R8 axons project to separate layers of the medulla. We show a receptor tyrosine phosphatase, PTP69D, is required for lamina target specificity. In Ptp69D mutants, R1-R6 project through the lamina, terminating in the medulla. Genetic mosaics, transgene rescue, and immunolocalization indicate PTP69D functions in R1-R6 growth cones. PTP69D overexpression in R7 and R8 does not respecify their connections, suggesting PTP69D acts in combination with other factors to determine target specificity. Structure-function analysis indicates the extracellular fibronectin type III domains and intracellular phosphatase activity are required for targeting. We propose PTP69D promotes R1-R6 targeting in response to extracellular signals by dephosphorylating substrate(s) in R1-R6 growth cones."
https://openalex.org/W2035095971,"Slob is a novel protein that binds to the carboxy-terminal domain of the Drosophila Slowpoke (dSlo) calcium-dependent potassium (KCa) channel. A yeast two-hybrid screen with Slob as bait identifies the ζ isoform of 14–3–3 as a Slob-binding protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments from Drosophila heads and transfected cells confirm that 14–3–3 interacts with dSlo via Slob. All three proteins are colocalized presynaptically at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. Two serine residues in Slob are required for 14–3–3 binding, and the binding is dynamically regulated in Drosophila by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation. 14–3–3 coexpression dramatically alters dSlo channel properties when wild-type Slob is present but not when a double serine mutant Slob that is incapable of binding 14–3–3 is present. The results provide evidence for a dSlo/Slob/14–3–3 regulatory protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2020789455,"This study of rat cerebellar slices yielded two lines of evidence indicating that the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) found in climbing fibers (CFs) is critical for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber (PF) synapses of Purkinje cells (PCs) by their conjunctive activation with either stimulation of CFs or depolarization of PCs. First, LTD induction was effectively blocked by specific CRF receptor antagonists, α-helical CRF-(9–41) (α-h CRF) and astressin; and second, LTD was no longer observed in CF-deprived cerebella but was restored by CRF replenishment. The data obtained in this study suggest that these effects are mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and not by Ca2+ signaling or cyclic GMP (cGMP) production."
https://openalex.org/W2092819390,"Group I mGluRs heterologously expressed in sympathetic neurons inhibited calcium (ICa) and M-type potassium (IM) currents. Treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) revealed a voltage-dependent (VD), PTX-sensitive component of ICa inhibition and a voltage-independent (VI), PTX-insensitive component. Coexpression of RGS2 occluded mGluR1a inhibition of IM and made ICa inhibition VD in PTX-treated cells, presumably by blocking the effects of Gαq/11–GTP. These data indicate that mGluR1a can couple to Gi/o as well as Gq/11. In addition, VI ICa inhibition proceeds through a Gαq/11-GTP-mediated pathway, which can be occluded by expressing RGS2, leaving the VD, Gβγ-mediated inhibition active. These data may reveal a functional role for the upregulation of RGS2 expression in in vivo systems."
https://openalex.org/W2330069610,"Bufalin, a component of the Chinese medicine chan'su, induces apoptosis in various lines of human tumor cells, such as leukemia HL60 and U937 cells, by altering the expression of apoptosis-related genes, for example, bcl-2 and c-myc. In this study, we characterized a gene that is involved in bufalin-induced apoptosis by the differential display (DD) technique. The partial nucleotide sequence of one of the differentially expressed clones obtained after treatment with bufalin was identical to that of the human gene for Tiam1. When U937 cells were treated with 10(-7) M bufalin, expression of both Tiam1 mRNA and the protein was induced 1 h after the start of the treatment. The increase of Tiam1 mRNA was transient but the level of Tiam1 protein continued to increase at least for 6 h. In addition, the activities of Rac1 and p21-activated kinase (PAK) were also stimulated by bufalin treatment. To evaluate the role of Tiam1 in the apoptotic process, we examined the effects of the expression of sense and antisense RNA for Tiam1 in U937 cells. Apoptosis was strongly induced by bufalin in cells that expressed sense RNA for Tiam1 as compared to apoptosis in control cells treated with bufalin only. Cells expressing antisense RNA for Tiaml were significantly more resistant than the control bufalin-treated cells to induction of DNA fragmentation in response to bufalin. Moreover, sense transformants had elevated activities of PAK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that Tiaml might play a critical role in bufalin-induced apoptosis through the activation of Rac1, PAK, and JNK pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2313642356,"Rho family small GTPases regulate organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Among them, RhoA plays essential roles in the formation of the actin stress fibers, the associated focal adhesions, and the contractile rings necessary for cytokinesis. Recently, RhoD, a novel member of Rho family has been identified. The amino acid sequences of its effector domain is distinct from those of the other Rho family proteins, suggesting its unique cellular functions. Introduction of the constitutively active form of RhoDG26V into fibroblasts by microinjection or transfection resulted in disassembly of the actin stress fibers and the focal adhesions, whereas the dominant negative form of RhoDT31K did not affect these structures. The degree of cell migration assessed by the phagokinetic tracks on a substrate covered with gold particles was diminished by the expression of RhoDG26V but not by RhoDT31K. Thus, cytoskeletal alterations including the loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions by RhoD seems to lead to the retardation of cell migration. Transfection of RhoDG26V cDNA into cultured cells also induced multinucleation. Moreover, RhoDG26V microinjected into fertilized eggs and embryos of Xenopus laevis caused cleavage arrest only in the injected cells, and the uncleaved cells contained multiple nuclei. These results imply that RhoD does not affect nuclear division but can interfere with cytokinesis presumably by preventing the formation of the actin-based contractile ring. Enhancement of the stress fibers by RhoA or RhoA-activating lysophosphatidic acid was reversed by the transfection of RhoD cDNA. Accordingly, the cellular functions of RhoD are likely to be antagonistic to those of RhoA."
https://openalex.org/W2327681374,"In an attempt to examine whether the inactivation of p16INK4a is an important early event in the development of sporadic melanoma in vivo, we have systematically analysed 46 uncultured primary cutaneous melanomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome region 9p21-22 (where the p16INK4a resides) was detected in 11 tumours (24%) by PCR-based LOH analyses. Direct sequencing of all three exons of the p16INK4a gene in these 11 tumours revealed no somatic mutation although germline mutations which have not been reported previously as common polymorphisms were detected in two patients. Further sequencing analyses of the p16INK4a gene exon 2 in 19 additional tumours with no evidence of LOH on 9p21-22 identified only one heterozygous C – >T mutation at codon 81 altering a proline to a leucine. A sensitive methylation-specific PCR assay did not reveal de novo methylation of the 5′CpG island in exon 1 of the p16INK4a gene in any of the tumours showing 9p21-22 allelic loss or a heterozygous p16INK4a mutation. Complete loss of p16INK4a protein, most likely due to homozygous deletion of the p16INK4a gene, was observed in 6 (15%) out of 39 evaluable cases by immunohistochemical analyses on frozen sections using two different anti-p16INK4a antibodies. The results show that inactivation of p16INK4a is not as frequent in primary melanoma as has been reported in cell lines, and warrant further search for another tumour suppressor on 9p21-22. This study also emphasizes the importance of examining uncultured primary tumours rather than cell lines to define early events in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2324203392,"Human T-cells immortalized (interleukin-2 [IL-2] dependent) by the human T-cell lymphotropic/leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), in time, become transformed (IL-2 independent). To understand the biochemical basis of this transition, we have used the sibling HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, N1186 (IL-2 dependent) and N1186-94 (IL-2 independent), as models to assess the responses to antiproliferative signals. In N1186 cells arrested in G1 after serum/interleukin-2 (IL-2) deprivation, downregulation of the cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity correlated with decreased phosphorylation of CDK2 and accumulation of p27Kip1 bound to the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, as seen in normal activated PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). In contrast, N1186-94 cells failed to arrest in G1 upon serum starvation, displayed constitutive cyclin E-associated kinase activity, and, although CDK2 was partially dephosphorylated, the amount of p27Kip1 bound to the complex did not increase. This observation, extended to two other IL-2-dependent as well as to three IL-2-independent HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, suggests that the lack of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase downregulation found in the late phase of HTLV-I transformation may correlate with insufficient amounts of p27Kip1 associated with the cyclin E-CDK2 complex. Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that the addition of p27Kip1 to lysates from N1186-94 starved cells resulted in the downregulation of cyclin E-associated kinase activity supporting the notion that the unresponsiveness of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex to growth inhibitory signals may be due to inadequate amounts of p27Kip1 assembled with the complex in HTLV-I-transformed T-cells. In fact, the amount of p27Kip1 protein was lower in most HTLV-I-transformed (IL-2-independent) than in the immortalized (IL-2-dependent) HTLV-I-infected T-cells. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) induced an increase of p27Kip1 protein levels, which correlated with G1 arrest, in both IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent HTLV-I-infected T-cells. Altogether, these results suggest that maintaining a low level of expression of p27Kip1 is a key event in HTLV-I transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2055749816,"Synthetic ceramides induce apoptotic death of Jurkat and HL60 leukaemia cell lines. By contrast we show here that ceramide induces non-apoptotic killing of malignant cells from patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and of normal B lymphocytes. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid readily induces apoptosis of B-CLL cells, indicating that this death pathway is fully functional in these cells. The ability of ceramide to activate the apoptotic protease caspase 3 in HL60 cells but not in B-CLL cells, as well as the lack of correlation of ceramide-mediated killing of different B-CLL isolates with expression of the apoptosis-regulating proteins bcl-2 and bax reinforce the conclusion that ceramide killing of B-CLL cells is by a non-apoptotic mechanism. Fludarabine treatment or γ-irradiation of B-CLL cells resulted in ceramide elevation and in killing by both apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms, suggesting that a ceramide-triggered non-apoptotic mechanism may play a role in the killing of these cells. Therefore, the results here show that ceramide can induce either apoptotic or non-apoptotic death, depending on the cellular context. The inability of synthetic dihydroceramide to kill B-CLL cells or normal B lymphocytes suggests that non-apoptotic killing by ceramide is via interaction with a specific, but unidentified, cellular target."

https://openalex.org/W2322288555,"The Wilms' tumor susceptibility gene, WT1, is altered in a subset of Wilms' tumors and encodes a transcription factor with four zinc fingers. Here we describe the isolation of native WT1 protein from frozen normal human kidney and Wilms' tumor samples. Through size exclusion chromatography and Western blot analysis we determined the elution pattern of WT1. The majority of WT1 from adult kidney and Wilms' tumor specimens was found to elute at a size of approximately 120 kDa, consistent with a WT1 homodimer and some WT1 protein was also found in a higher molecular weight complex. In 14 week fetal kidney the majority of the WT1 protein eluted at a size of 80 kDa, suggesting that at this developmental stage the WT1 protein is not present as a homodimer. The identity of complexing partners can now be studied using this approach."

https://openalex.org/W2094305535,"dMax, a naturally occurring splice variant of the Myc binding protein Max, lacks the DNA binding basic region and helix 1 of the Helix-Loop-Helix domain; dMax interacts with c-Myc in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits E-box Myc site driven transcription in transient transfection assays. Here we have investigated the expression, function and interactions of dMax. RT/PCR analyses detected dmax mRNA in multiple tissues of the developing, newborn and adult mouse. Functionally, dMax reduced the ability of c-Myc to cooperate with the progression factor A-Myb to promote S phase entry of quiescent smooth muscle cells. In contrast, dMax failed to ablate inhibition of initiator element (Inr)-mediated transcription by c-Myc in Jurkat T cells. In in vitro protein:protein association assays, dMax interacted with c-Myc, N-Myc, L-Myc, Mad1, Mxi1, Mad3 and Mad4, but not with itself or wild-type Max. These interactions required an intact leucine zipper. Inhibition of E-box-mediated transactivation by induction of dMax overexpression resulted in apoptosis of WEHI 231 B cells. Thus, dMax is a widely expressed, naturally occurring protein, with the capacity to bind most members of the Myc/Max superfamily; dMax has little effect on Inr-mediated repression by c-Myc, but can significantly decrease E-box-mediated events promoting proliferation and cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2316966598,"The human ST5 gene is expressed as 4.6, 3.1 and 2.8 kb transcripts encoding putative 126, 82 and 70 kDa proteins that function in the MAP kinase signaling pathway in transient expression assays. Expression of the 2.8 kb transcript correlates with reduced tumorigenicity in HeLa-fibroblast hybrids, suggesting a role in tumor suppression. We now report the detection of ST5 proteins in cellular extracts, demonstrate specific expression of p70 in non-tumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrids, extend the correlation between p70 expression and cellular morphology to a wide variety of cell lines, and provide direct evidence that p70 can effect changes in cell growth and morphology. ST5 proteins were identified in extracts of human, mouse and simian epithelial cells and fibroblasts, but were absent from lymphoid cells. Transfection of the 2.8 kb cDNA into a p70-negative mouse fibroblast line yielded stable transfectants with a flattened, less refractile morphology relative to controls. The p70 expressing clones had initial growth rates similar to those of control cells but their saturation density was reduced threefold, suggesting a restoration of contact-regulated growth. In conjunction with previous findings, these results suggest that ST5 proteins participate directly in events affecting cytoskeletal organization and tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2073214543,"Mammals use two parallel olfactory systems to process information about their environment. The main olfactory organ senses thousands of volatile odorants to initiate a flexible repertoire of behaviors. The more specialized vomeronasal organ (VNO) senses a limited range of molecules, particularly pheromones that evoke innate hormonal and behavioral responses. How is activation of vomeronasal neurons transformed into species-specific sexual and social responses? While this is not a question we can answer at present, two papers in the April 16th issue of Cell provide a first glimpse into the sensory map in the VNO and reveal a picture that is strikingly different from other sensory maps (1Belluscio L. Koentges G. Axel R. Dulac C. Cell. 1999; 97: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Rodriguez I. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Cell. 1999; 97 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the main olfactory system, selective receptor expression and axon targeting cooperate to produce a precise sensory map. Each olfactory neuron expresses one (or a few) of about 1000 different G protein–coupled olfactory receptor genes (2Buck, L., and Axel, R. (1991). 65, 175–187.Google Scholar). Olfactory receptor genes exhibit monoallelic expression—only one of the two alleles of a given gene is expressed in one cell (3Chess A. Simon I. Cedar H. Axel R.

All 10,000 neurons expressing a single olfactory receptor gene project their axons to one or two glomeruli at stereotyped positions in the olfactory bulb (see figure) (7Mombaerts P. Wang F. Dulac C. Chao S.H. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Edmondson J. Axel R. Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Receptor swap and receptor deletion experiments suggest that the olfactory receptor proteins play an instructive role in the targeting of axons to the correct glomeruli: replacing the coding sequence of one olfactory receptor gene with another can redirect those axons to a glomerulus at a different stereotyped position of the olfactory bulb (7Mombaerts P. Wang F. Dulac C. Chao S.H. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Edmondson J. Axel R. Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 12Wang F. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Axel R. Cell. 1998; 93: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The Mombaerts lab (8Rodriguez I. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Cell. 1999; 97 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and the Dulac and Axel labs (1Belluscio L. Koentges G. Axel R. Dulac C. Cell. 1999; 97: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have now analyzed vomeronasal neurons using mouse gene knockins and knockouts. It is known that each vomeronasal neuron expresses one (or a few) of about 100–200 vomeronasal receptor genes from two gene families that are completely unrelated to olfactory receptor genes (4Dulac C. Axel R. Cell. 1995; 83: 195-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 5Herrada G. Dulac C. Cell. 1997; 90: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 6Matsunami H. Buck L.B. Cell. 1997; 90: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 9Ryba N.J.P. Tirindelli R. Neuron. 1997; 19: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To examine the organization of the VNO sensory map and the relationship between receptor expression and projection pattern, each of the two labs began with the family of receptor genes that are expressed in a Gi-expressing subset of vomeronasal neurons and made use of a technology for expressing two polypeptides from a single transcript using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (7Mombaerts P. Wang F. Dulac C. Chao S.H. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Edmondson J. Axel R. Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). By using an IRES, a marker protein such as a tau–lacZ fusion protein can be expressed in the exact subset of neurons that express a particular vomeronasal receptor gene without disrupting the coding region of the receptor gene. 1Belluscio L. Koentges G. Axel R. Dulac C. Cell. 1999; 97: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar labeled two different receptor genes using the tau–lacZ method, while 8Rodriguez I. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Cell. 1999; 97 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar labeled a single receptor gene using both tau–lacZ and a newly developed tau–GFP marker. Each knockin receptor/IRES/marker construct was expressed in a small number of neurons (about 250 per allele) that were scattered across the VNO epithelium, as expected from previous in situ hybridizations with vomeronasal receptor clones. Using double labeling with receptor–GFP and receptor–lacZ, 8Rodriguez I. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Cell. 1999; 97 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar were able to show that their vomeronasal receptor exhibited monoallelic expression. In animals in which one allele of a receptor gene was green (tau–GFP) and the other allele was blue (tau–lacZ), the cells in the VNO epithelium were either green or blue but never both. The reason for this exclusivity is unknown, but it could be to guarantee that each cell expresses exactly one receptor. Monoallelic expression is insurance against heterogeneity caused by differences between the two alleles of one receptor gene. Such heterogeneity could be common; 8Rodriguez I. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Cell. 1999; 97 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar found polymorphisms in one receptor gene in different mouse subspecies. In any case, the logic by which a single allele of one receptor gene is expressed in each neuron is quite similar in the vomeronasal and olfactory systems. When the VNO neurons project to their targets, the story is dramatically different from the story in the olfactory system. The 250 VNO neurons expressing a single vomeronasal receptor gene projected to many glomeruli, somewhere between 10 and 30, in the accessory olfactory bulb (see figure). The projections from VNO neurons expressing one receptor were widely distributed across the accessory bulb, with clusters of linked glomeruli in several regions. Because they studied two different genes and performed serial reconstructions in multiple animals, 1Belluscio L. Koentges G. Axel R. Dulac C. Cell. 1999; 97: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar were able to argue strongly that each receptor has a characteristic projection pattern. The pattern was variable, but clusters of glomeruli were found in similar regions in all animals examined, suggesting that the accessory olfactory bulb is divided into several distinct subdomains for axon targeting. There is far less convergence in the vomeronasal map than in the olfactory map, and even the glomeruli receiving VNO projections may be heterogeneous. Glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb are small and poorly defined morphologically, but their structures could be inferred from expression of synaptic proteins and from DiI labeling of VNO inputs. Both groups detected some microglomeruli that received axons only from lacZ-positive neurons expressing one receptor gene, but 1Belluscio L. Koentges G. Axel R. Dulac C. Cell. 1999; 97: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar also found mixed glomeruli that also received projections from other VNO neurons. What does this complex projection pattern mean for information coding in the vomeronasal system? Hard to say. The VNO sensory neurons synapse onto mitral cells that have dendrites spread out over multiple glomeruli (10Takami S. Graziadei P.P.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 311: 65-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At this point, there is no way to determine exactly what relationship exists between one set of incoming receptor neurons and the inputs to a given mitral cell. It is possible that many VNO neurons expressing one receptor actually project to the same mitral cell, so the pattern could be more organized and convergent than it appears. By the same token, it could be much more divergent. It is most likely that a single mitral cell receives input from more than one class of receptor neuron, but the question remains open. One caution should be raised about these targeting studies: in this system, unlike the olfactory system, it was not possible to show that cells with lacZ-modified vomeronasal receptor genes project to the same glomeruli as cells with intact receptor genes. The stories are consistent, but details could change as the system is refined. Do vomeronasal receptors contribute to the complex projection pattern of vomeronasal axons? Both groups generated mice in which a single vomeronasal receptor was deleted, and the resulting cells were labeled with tau–lacZ. Receptor-negative cells projected at random in the accessory olfactory bulb, indicating that the vomeronasal receptor is essential for normal targeting (an alternative possibility, that the receptor-null cells induced expression of a second receptor gene, would still imply that the second receptor gene directly or indirectly affects neuronal targeting). Deleting the receptor also led to a substantial decrease in the number of blue cells, suggesting that the receptor is required for cell maintenance or survival. Amazingly, 8Rodriguez I. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Cell. 1999; 97 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar were able to rescue these cells when an olfactory receptor gene was expressed instead of the normal vomeronasal receptor. Cell number was increased and the axons converged into many glomeruli, but targeting was probably not restored, since the rescued neurons did not converge with neurons expressing the original receptor with IRES–tau–GFP. The olfactory receptor is unrelated to the vomeronasal receptor in sequence, and its normal signaling pathway is not present in vomeronasal neurons, so it is astonishing that the VNO can use that receptor to create a rough semblance of normality. Since normal VNO projections are somewhat variable between animals, one might wonder whether activity-dependent mechanisms are operating or whether the receptors have other features that are not obvious. The striking lesson from these papers is that the VNO map is complex, and that the simple spatial map characteristic of the olfactory system is nowhere to be found. To our eyes, this map is harder to read than the olfactory map or the maps of visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. Why is this true? One possible explanation lies in the fundamental nature of species-specific pheromones, which can be blends of compounds whose individual components are present in several species. It is important that the innate all-or-none response to pheromones be triggered by a conspecific animal and not triggered by other species’ similar chemicals or mixtures (11Vickers N.J. Christensen T.A. Hildebrand J.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 400: 35-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To recognize the correct pheromone cocktail, the VNO may need to reject closely related molecules and discard more near matches than the more generous olfactory system. It may use convergent wiring to focus on the exact composition of the mixture rather than any individual component, sacrificing the terrific discrimination generated in the olfactory bulb where thousands of axons expressing one receptor converge onto a single glomerulus. Both the VNO and the olfactory system use receptor proteins during the process of neuronal targeting, yet they construct very different maps in the target areas. How are the maps generated? How are guidance cues distributed in the target regions? And once this map is formed, how is it read? These elegant in vivo experiments pose questions that need biochemistry and more neuroanatomy for answers."
https://openalex.org/W2001544881,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by degeneration of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra, which leads to dopamine deficiency in the main dopaminergic innervation targets, the caudate nucleus and putamen (collectively called the striatum). Affected individuals, numbering over a million in North America, typically exhibit tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia or bradykinesia (absence or slowness of voluntary movement), postural instability, and reduced life expectancy. The best current therapy is the dopamine supplement L-DOPA (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine). It is orally active, crosses the blood–brain barrier, and can be converted to dopamine by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase in the remaining DA neurons and possibly other cell types. Unfortunately, L-DOPA often fails to improve tremor, does not always elicit consistent response, and loses its effectiveness as PD progresses and more of the DA neurons that utilize it degenerate. L-DOPA also causes significant side effects including dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements) and psychiatric disturbances. Other treatments include dopamine agonists (bromocriptine) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (selegiline), which are often effective only early in the course of PD (6Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339 (a): 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 7Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339 (b): 1130-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Because the current therapies do not change the disease progression and ultimately fail to provide relief, novel therapeutic approaches are being investigated. These include compensatory surgical destruction or inhibitory electrical stimulation of basal ganglia targets such as the internal segment of the globus pallidus (reducing L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and other symptoms of PD), the motor thalamus (effective at controlling tremor), and subthalamic nuclei. In addition, the use of survival (neurotrophic) factors for DA neurons (prevention therapy) and transplantation (replacement therapy) are under active investigation in animal models and in the clinic (11Rosenthal A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 169-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The goal of transplantation is to provide a continuous local cellular source of dopamine in the dopaminedepleted caudate and putamen as well as trophic support to the remaining endogenous DA neurons. Human embryonic fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue, which contains DA neurons, has been grafted into the striatum of PD patients. Although these grafts occasionally provide long-lasting clinical benefits (10Olanow C.W. Kordower J.H. Freeman T.B. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), they are not readily available. Moreover, even though in rodent models graft survival can be improved with antioxidants, caspase inhibitors, neurotrophic factors, and supportive cografts, graft survival in humans is still poor (∼5%). Other tissues and cells that produce dopamine are also being tested in animal models and/or patients with PD. These include adrenal medulla, sympathetic ganglia, porcine embryonic DA neurons, and neural progenitor cells as well as primary fibroblasts, myoblasts, and astrocytes genetically engineered to produce L-DOPA or dopamine. Unfortunately, these grafts (e.g., adrenal medulla) provide only short-term and inconsistent clinical benefits (4Gage F.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 18-24PubMed Google Scholar) or carry some risk of viral infections. A potential autologous dopamine source that has received little attention until recently is the carotid body. The carotid body is located near the bifurcation of the carotid artery and contains dopamine-rich glomus cells. These paraneuronal cells contain chemoreceptors that are sensitive to changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as pH, and they help to regulate respiration rate (3Fidone, S.J., and Gonzalez, C. (1987). In Encyclopedia of Neuroscience, G. Adelman, ed. (Boston: Birkhäuser), pp. 189–191.Google Scholar). A decrease in oxygen pressure at the carotid artery induces these cells to increase their firing rate and to stimulate medullar neurons that in turn cause a dramatic increase in respiratory rate. Thus, these cells thrive and are activated under the hypoxic conditions that exist in the graft environment. Carotid bodies are not normally essential because respiratory rate is independently regulated by carbon dioxide– and acid-sensitive receptors in the brain stem. Humans survive unilateral and bilateral resection even though their responses to hypoxia are significantly depressed (5Honda Y. J. Applied Physiol. 1992; 73: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Autologous transplantation, which avoids the problem of immune rejection, is thus a real possibility. A further advantage of the carotid body is its ability to produce, in addition to dopamine, glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (9Nosrat C.A. Tomac A. Lindqvist E. Lindskog S. Humpel C. Stromberg I. Ebendal T. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), a potent neurotrophic factor that promotes the survival, function, and sprouting of DA neurons. In a previous issue of Neuron (2Espejo E.F. Montoro R.J. Armengol J.A. López-Barneo J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Lopez-Barneo and colleagues demonstrated that isogenic grafts of carotid body, but not control carotid artery fragment grafts, led to improvement in a rat model of PD that was created by unilateral lesion of DA neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine. Greater than 40% of grafted tyrosine hydroxylase–positive (TH+) glomus cells survived in the rat striatum. Rats with carotid body grafts improved in several behavioral tests. Spontaneous and amphetamine-induced turning, which reflects imbalance in dopamine release, was eliminated at 10 days, 1 month, and 3 months after grafting. In addition, sensorimotor neglect was reduced at 1 and 3 months. However, the distance traveled in the open field, a parameter of bradykinesia, did not improve in these rats. Consistent with the results of the behavioral tests, TH+ fibers were observed in the grafted striatum, and the reinnervated areas showed increased evoked release of dopamine in vitro 3 months after the transplantation. Given the promising results in the rodent model, Lopez-Barneo and colleagues have now extended their studies to a nonhuman primate model of PD (8Luquin M.R. Montoro R.J. Guillén J. Saldise L. Insausti R. Del Rio J. López-Barneo J. Neuron. 1999; 22 (this issue): 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar [this issue of Neuron]). They used two Cynomolgus monkeys that received weekly intravenous injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) over 10 months. MPTP is converted by MAO-B to 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP+), which enters DA neurons through the dopamine transporter, interferes with ATP production in the mitochondria, and leads to cell death. As a result, these monkeys developed stable and severe bilateral parkinsonism, which manifested in tremor, freezing, impaired balance, poor posture, and reduction in spontaneous activity. In addition, the monkey that was trained prior to the MPTP treatment on a fine motor task suffered an increase in the number of failures and time to complete the task. Three or seven months after the last MPTP injection, one carotid body was harvested and cut into 0.2–0.3 mm diameter aggregates, and two sites in the left putamen were grafted with three to five aggregates per site. One monkey also received a single vehicle injection in the right putamen to control for the effects of surgical trauma. Both monkeys showed improvement that began 2–4 weeks after transplantation and lasted throughout the duration of the study (3 or 5 months). Initially, the monkeys exhibited a reduction in tremor. Subsequently, they displayed an increase in spontaneous activity, more frequent use of the contralateral limbs, and improvement in posture and balance, resulting in a 40% or 50% reduction in total disability score. The monkey that was trained on a fine motor task also showed partial restoration of fine motor skills with the limb contralateral to the graft. Analysis of the grafts post mortem revealed that only 80–100 TH+ glomus cells survived in each of the graft sites. The small number of surviving cells was unexpected, given the survival rate of grafted glomus cells in the rat (250–450 of 400–600 transplanted). However, samples of the carotid body from the two MPTP-treated monkeys revealed fibrosis and a low density of TH+ glomus cells, suggesting that the low survival rate is most likely due to damage by MPTP and not the grafting procedure. Given the small number of glomus cells in the transplant, the amelioration of the PD symptoms appears spectacular. By comparison, several thousands grafted embryonic DA neurons are required to provide a similar functional improvement. Despite the poor graft survival, both the caudate and putamen on the grafted side showed increased density of TH+ fibers, while the contralateral striatum, including the vehicle-injected putamen, had few TH+ fibers. The poor graft survival and the presence of TH+ fibers, which most likely originated from the remaining endogenous DA neurons, raise a question regarding the mechanism by which the glomus grafts mediate their beneficial effects. Although the unilateral recovery makes it unlikely, in light of the fact that only two monkeys were grafted unilaterally, and only one vehicle-injected putamen served as a control, spontaneous recovery cannot be completely excluded. Alternatively, it is possible that the high dopamine content of glomus cells enables a small number of them to substitute for thousands of neurons. Finally, trophic and sprouting-inducing factors such as GDNF, which are produced by the carotid bodies and can act on the endogenous DA neurons, rather then dopamine may account for the observed benefits. Changes in the survival and fiber density of the endogenous DA neurons in the grafted monkeys were not investigated. However, the histological results are quite similar to these obtained with adrenal medullary grafts, which survive poorly but can induce the reappearance of host TH+ fibers (1Bohn M.C. Cupit L. Marciano F. Gash D.M. Science. 1987; 237: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms by which the glomus grafts ameliorate PD symptoms in monkeys may enable their better usage and point to novel therapeutic avenues for this disorder. Regardless of the mechanism, glomus cell transplants could become effective therapy for PD in humans. Before clinical trials are attempted, more extensive and better controlled trials, as well as direct comparisons to fetal DA grafts, must be conducted in primates. In addition, it will be important to determine whether the carotid bodies show degenerative changes in PD patients, which may have an impact on their use. The new results will hopefully prompt additional investigators to study the utility of carotid body grafts and to help determine whether they can turn into a clinical reality."
https://openalex.org/W2013074640,"The development of the multilayered cellular architecture found in many regions of the CNS requires axons originating in one layer or locale to terminate their growth with specificity in the layers that harbor their postsynaptic targets. In the developing chick visual system, for example, retinal ganglion cells of distinct subtypes send their axons to subtype-specific layers of the tectum (10Yamagata M. Sanes J.R. Development. 1995; 121: 3763-3776PubMed Google Scholar). A similar pattern of connectivity is found in the visual system of Drosophila, where photoreceptor axons, according to their cell type, terminate in either of two ganglion layers within the brain’s optic lobe. The six outer photoreceptors, R1–R6, of a single ommatidial unit of the fly compound eye terminate their axonal ingrowth within the brain’s most superficial layer, known as the lamina. The remaining two photoreceptors of an ommatidial unit, R7 and R8, extend beyond the lamina into a deeper layer known as the medulla. The specificity of outer photoreceptor axon termination in the lamina provides an attractive opportunity to elucidate the local mechanisms controlling a growth cone’s decision to stop or go. The eight axons from an ommatidial unit in the eye travel into the brain together as part of an ommatidium-specific fascicle (see the schematic diagram). Studies of photoreceptor axon elongation in larger insects reveal that transit along an ommatidial fascicle follows the temporal pattern of photoreceptor cell differentiation within the ommatidial unit in the eye (reviewed by 7Meinertzhagen, I.A., and Hanson, T.E. (1993). In The Development of Drosophila melanogaster, M. Bate and A. Martinez-Arias, eds. (Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press), pp. 1363–1491.Google Scholar). The growth cone from the initial R8 cell can be thought to pioneer the path to a retinotopic target destination, while the growth cones of R2 and R5, R3 and R4, R1 and R6, and R7 follow in sequence along the expanding ommatidial fiber. Whether the R8 axon is an essential pioneer for the fiber, and whether the other photoreceptor axonal types make the navigational decisions required of the R8 growth cone, is unclear. However, because the R8 axons grow into the deeper medulla layer, the R1–R6 growth cones must make the common decision to stop in the more superficial lamina layer. One could imagine a switch that terminates R1–R6 axonal extension, employing signals to which the R7 and R8 growth cones are blind. This is indeed an implication of the work reported in this issue of Neuron by 3Garrity P.A. Lee C.-H. Salecker I. Robertson H. Desai C. Zinn K. Zipursky S.L. Neuron. 1999; 22 (this issue): 707-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar. Garrity et al. examine the role of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP69D in photoreceptor axon pathfinding in Drosophila. Loss of PTP69D function in the retina results in a specific defect. The R1–R6 growth cones sometimes continue beyond their lamina termination point, following the paths of R7 and R8 axons into the deeper medulla layer. Further experiments demonstrate that an extracellular region harboring fibronectin-like motifs and at least one of the two intracellular phosphatase domains must be intact for PTP69D to function in lamina-specific termination. Presumably, upon ligand binding, PTP69D dephosphorylates substrates in the R1–R6 growth cones in order to terminate growth. The substrates that are dephosphorylated and the ligand involved remain to be determined. PTP69D, like two other Drosophila receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), Dlar and PTP99A, is in the collection of molecules with a role in the establishment of neuromuscular connectivity (reviewed by 2Desai C.J. Sun Q. Zinn K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7 (b): 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These neural RPTPs are expressed on a subset of motor axons and growth cones. The motor neuron pathfinding defects in animals harboring one or multiple RPTP mutations are typically a stall or miscue at particular choice points. In Dlar mutants, the intersegmental nerve branch b (ISNb) motor axons sometimes fail to properly defasciculate from the intersegmental nerve (ISN) at the choice point leading to the ventrolateral muscle (VLM) field. The ISNb axons instead continue to grow dorsally, bypassing their VLM targets. This characteristic “bypass” phenotype is strongly enhanced by the additional loss of PTP69D function (1Desai C. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Zinn K. Development. 1997; 124 (a): 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an overlap in the functional roles of PTP69D and Dlar at the ISNb choice point. What is the relationship of the neuromuscular RPTP mutant phenotypes to the behavior of R1–R6 growth cones in a Ptp69D mutant? One might view the visual system defect as a “bypass” of the R1–R6 axons’ lamina termination point. Blind to a lamina signal, the R1–R6 growth cones may fail to defasciculate from the R8 pioneer fiber. The observation that the majority of R1–R6 growth cones do stop in the lamina in a strong Ptp69D mutant background is consistent with the notion that other RPTPs, such as Dlar, contribute to proper R1–R6 termination. The answer to this question awaits the analysis of animals bearing multiple RPTP mutations. A deeper connection between RPTP activity and growth cone motility is suggested by the genetic and physical interactions of Dlar, the Abl tyrosine kinase, and the Abl substrate Enabled (Ena; 9Wills Z. Bateman J. Korey C.A. Comer A. Van Vactor D. Neuron. 1999; 22: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar; reviewed by 6Hu S. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1999; 22: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As with Dlar and Ptp69D, abl and ena loss of function yields defects in the dissociation of SNb motor axons from the ISN. Ena associates with the actin cytoskeleton at points of polymerization, where it may, via binding to profilin, modulate actin polymerization (see, for example, 4Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The observation that Ena binds one of the intracellular phosphatase domains of PTP69D (9Wills Z. Bateman J. Korey C.A. Comer A. Van Vactor D. Neuron. 1999; 22: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) suggests one possible connection between the reception of a lamina stop signal and the cytoskeletal events that control the motility of the R1–R6 growth cones. While the experiments of Garrity et al. implicate PTP69D in the R1–R6 growth cone’s initial decision to stop in the lamina, nitric oxide (NO) signal reception is apparently required to keep them there (5Gibbs S.M. Truman J.W. Neuron. 1998; 20: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). NO is synthesized by lamina cells and can induce the synthesis of cGMP by the photoreceptor axons. Under pharmacological conditions that interfere with NO signaling, the R1–R6 growth cones initially stop in the lamina but later abandon the lamina and continue on further into the brain. The relative roles of these two signaling pathways in modulating R1–R6 growth cone motility is unclear. For example, it is not known whether the continued activity of PTP69D is required once the R1–R6 growth cones become dependent on NO to remain in the lamina. A further elaboration of the intersection between these two pathways in the modulation of growth cone motility would be an exciting avenue for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2007479870,"At any moment, the brain is inundated with data about the sensory environment, yet we are perfectly able to focus on particular aspects of this torrent of information. In the case of vision, some selection is carried out by low-level visual mechanisms, but this stereotyped processing cannot provide the flexibility that complex organisms need to adapt to their ever-changing environment. Processing resources are limited and therefore must be dynamically allocated to deal with the task at hand. This is a job for attention. Beyond our subjective impressions, attention can be demonstrated to improve performance in many behavioral tasks (6Posner M. Quart. J. Exp. Psych. 1980; 32: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7038) Google Scholar). For example, cuing a subject to attend to a particular location enhances the ability to discriminate or react to a stimulus that appears later at that location but not at distant, uncued locations. This suggests that attention primes or biases the visual system in a spatially specific manner, changing the baseline vigilance. In this issue of Neuron3Kastner S. Pinsk M. De Weerd P. Desimone R. Ungerleider L. Neuron. 1999; 22 (this issue,): 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar offer an intriguing glimpse into the neuronal framework that might underlie this biasing property of attention. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human subjects, the authors observed spatially specific increases in the activity of visual cortex as attention is shifted to the particular location at which a visual stimulus will be presented, even before the stimulus actually becomes visible. The past several decades have seen an explosion of work on the neuronal basis of attention (5Maunsell J. Science. 1995; 270: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Most studies involve awake, behaving macaque monkeys trained to direct their attention to different locations on a stimulus screen. The experiments are usually designed to keep the visual stimulation to the retina constant, so that differences in neuronal activity can be specifically attributed to attention. For example, two or more stimuli may be presented at the same locations on every trial but the animal cued to attend to only one of them at a time. By training the animals to hold their gaze on a fixation point while they direct their attention to different locations, the focus of attention varies while the physical visual stimulation remains the same. The general finding is that the visual response of a neuron is larger when the animal is attending the location of that cell’s receptive field, versus attending elsewhere. The neural response is further enhanced when the distracting stimuli are placed closer to the attended stimuli, suggesting that attention may arbitrate a competition among nearby visual stimuli. This might allow neurons in later stages of visual processing to select among multiple visual stimuli that could fit in their large receptive fields (1Desimone R. Duncan J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5965) Google Scholar). Recently, noninvasive functional imaging techniques, such as fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET), have shown that visual responses in human cortex are likewise enhanced for attended stimuli (for a recent discussion, see 7Somers D. Dale A. Seiffert A. Tootell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 1663-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In the fMRI study of 2Kastner S. DeWeerd P. Desimone R. Ungerleider L.G. Science. 1998; 282: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, fixating subjects were cued to direct their attention to the upper right visual quadrant, to count the occurrences of a particular visual stimulus in a sequence of stimuli flashed at that location (attend condition). On alternate sequences, the subjects maintained fixation but ignored the flashed stimuli (unattend condition). As in fMRI studies from a number of groups, responses to the stimuli were elevated in extrastriate cortical areas in the attend condition compared to the unattend condition, and the enhancements were specific to the regions that had been activated by the unattend condition. Here, Kastner et al. go further by showing that attention enhanced cortical activity even before the stimuli were presented: rather than beginning the stimulus presentation immediately following the cue to attend to the upper right quadrant, the authors waited 11 s before beginning the stimulus sequence. During this time, the subjects could expect the stimuli to occur at the cued location, although no stimulus was actually visible. This is exactly when one might expect the priming effect of attention to be active at full force. During this expectation period, several cortical areas became more active in the attend condition compared to the equivalent period before stimulus presentation in the unattend condition—as if the baseline activity had increased. Like the enhancement of visual responses, the increase in baseline activity was retinotopically restricted to regions that were activated by the stimuli themselves. This is a remarkable finding, in that it seems to provide a neuronal correlate for the covert priming effect of attention. Previous studies in both monkeys and humans had focused on the modulation of visual responses with attention; while there are some reports in the monkey that attention can enhance baseline firing rates of single neurons, these effects are at best slight or inconsistent. The large baseline effects observed by Kastner et al. could be explained if attention provides a subthreshold increase in cortical excitability. Modulation of this sort would have little or no effect on firing rates but might still impose a metabolic burden that should generate an fMRI signal. If so, then fMRI experiments can provide information about attention that might be overlooked with single unit recording. Several issues raised by the Kastner paper could be addressed in more detail. One concern is that the increased activity during the expectation period may have been due to nonspecific “arousal” as the subjects prepared for the imminent peripheral attention task. This concern is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that the expectation effects were retinotopically confined to the representation of the upper right visual quadrant. It is also partly controlled for by the demonstration that no such increases were observed before a different visual attention task using stimuli presented at the fovea, although it was not specified whether subjects were cued in the same way before stimulus presentation in the foveal task. However, it may be difficult to compare foveal and peripheral attention tasks directly. A further concern is that the upper right quadrant was the only part of visual space that was stimulated in the experiment. An experiment in which the same peripheral attention task is also performed in a different visual quadrant, say the upper left, while observing cortical activity in the representation of the upper right quadrant, would eliminate the possibility that a nonspecific increase in activity triggered by the cue might especially involve the most recently activated regions, which may have higher metabolic demands. These concerns notwithstanding, the results raise many fascinating questions. First, what is the source and mechanism of the baseline bias? One possibility raised in the paper is that the bias signal may come from more anterior areas such as the superior parietal lobule and frontal and supplementary eye fields, which are reciprocally connected to some posterior areas. Unlike the posterior visual areas, these areas all showed baseline increases in the attend condition that did not increase further upon visual stimulation, as if providing a “pure” bias signal. Another intriguing question is the mechanism by which the bias amplifies responses to subsequent visual input. A recent result in the monkey that may address this is that attention linearly scales the strength of visual responses of single neurons (4MacAdams C. Maunsell J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 431-441PubMed Google Scholar). The baseline effect observed by Kastner et al. might then reflect a modulatory influence that acts to scale feedforward sensory input. Given this view, it would be extremely useful if the subthreshold activity of single neurons could be assessed during attentional modulation in single cell physiological studies. Finally, these findings beg comparison to results from many other experiments that report neuronal activity in the absence of visual input. These “extraretinal” signals are typically interpreted in the context of the particular behavioral task by which they are revealed, ranging from mental imagery, to working memory, to motor preparation. Perhaps these seemingly different signals share a common cellular mechanism, if not a common source. Thus, the search for the mechanisms of attention may highlight a lot more than we might expect at first glance."
