https://openalex.org/W1989362179,The light intensity-fusion frequency relationship of the goldfish electroretinogram follows the Ferry-Porter law except at the higher intensities. Maximum fusion frequency increases with temperature thus contradicting the results of studies elsewhere on the behavioral responses in sunfish.

The field expands in area as a function of exposure time, and there are frequent irregularities in its shape."

Weight losses in the group averaged from 12 to 36 pounds. There was no change in potassium content or in lean body weight. Weight loss resulted from the loss of excess body fat."

That an uncharged calcium-lactose complex is formed was demonstrated by the use of paper electrophoresis and of calcium-45 as a label for the complex. Enhancement of the intestinal absorption of calcium ion by sugars could result from a complex of low molecular weight."

https://openalex.org/W1990218711,"The success of ""auditory analgesia"" in dental operations may be a result of distraction, suggestion, or cross-sensory masking, or of a combination of the three. An attempt to separate these influences was made by measuring the change in sensitivity to electrical stimulation of the teeth in typical dental patients upon presentation of loud white noise. No differences in this ""tingle"" threshold under noise and no-noise conditions were found, either when preliminary instructions were neutral or after implicit or explicit suggestion that the noise would raise the threshold. These results indicate that auditory analgesia is probably not an example of cross-sensory masking, and that its successful use in the clinical situation depends both on distraction and on suggestion."

https://openalex.org/W90021598,"The liver of the fetal guinea pig was recently found not to concentrate several unmetabolizable model amino acids (1). This result seemed at first to represent an unusual, if not unique, discrimination against these substances. Our attention was brought, however, to the work of Nemeth and his associates, which showed that a number of characteristic enzymes of the liver appear to be absent in the fetus. These enzymes develop within the first day after birth, or the first day after artificial removal of the fetus from the fetal environment ((Z-10); cf. (11) and bibliographies of these papers). Further exploration of the matter of amino acid uptake shows that the transport deficiency of the liver of the fetal guinea pig concerns normal as well as artificial amino acids, and that a very rapid increase in the extent of amino acid concentration occurs during the first 24 hours after Pregnant guinea pigs near term were maintained on Rockland guinea pig pellets, with fresh lettuce every second or third day. When the opening of the pubic symphysis indicated that delivery was about 5 days away, 2.2 to 2.5 mg of l-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid-l-Cl4 (12), representing about 10 mc and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl, were injected subcutaneously in the scapular region. This procedure allowed several days for the amino acid to be distributed, with little loss of radioactivity because this amino acid is so slowly excreted (13). The animals reported in Table I, and two of those reported in the figures, were delivered by section; all the rest were permitted to deliver spontaneously, the time of separation from the maternal circulation being noted. The analyses designated as “zero time” were made on animals killed within minutes of birth or, in the two exceptional cases, immediately after removal by section about 1 day before expected birth. Blood was taken from the heart of the animal under ether anesthesia. After the animal was killed by a blow on the head, the liver was removed, cut, and blotted to remove blood. It and the muscles of one thigh were weighed and then extracted with 10 ml of 0.01 N acetic acid for each gram by thorough grinding in a mortar. The resulting suspension was held for 3 minutes at 100” and then centrifuged to remove coagulated material. The plasma was deproteinized by adding 4 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting extracts were analyzed for glycine by the method of Alexander, Landwehr, and Seligman (14) as modified by Christensen, Riggs, and Ray (15). Radioactivity was determined on 0.2-ml portions of the extracts added"
https://openalex.org/W2423268907,"Conventional determinations of the effect of uncoupling agents on osidative phosphorylation have usually been obtained in terms of the diminution of the P :0 ratio’ (l-3). When tightly coupled preparations are used, it is possible to determine the effect of the uncoupling agent in terms of the diminution of the respiratory control ratio (4-6). With spectroscopic methods, it is similarly possible to titrate the steady state oxidation-reduction level of the respiratory carriers with the uncoupling agent; cytochrome b and reduced pyridine nucleotide are particularly easy to measure (7-9). Similarly, a low concentration of azide allows a titration of cytochrome a or c with the uncoupling agent (8-10). All such methods measure the effect of the uncoupling agent on the steady state values of the P:O ratio, the respiratory control ratio, or the oxidation-reduction level of the respiratory pigments. There are two similar equations for the reduction of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide in an energy-linked reaction in the presence of succinate (11). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE"

https://openalex.org/W2024855062,Radioactive dopamine was injected into the blood that was perfusing an isolated heart preparation. Analysis of the norepinephrine obtained from the heart 1 hour later demonstrated that it contained radioactivity. Between 1.4 and 10.8 percent of the norepinephrine present had been formed from the dopamine. The turnover of norepinephrine was substantially higher in the ventricles than in the atria.

So far, the regime's achievements reflect credit more on contributions from other countries, especially the United States, than on the creative work of its own entomologists. In a decade or so, Communist China may approach Western standards in applied entomology, but her contributions to basic research will be spotty at best. According to a statement made in 1956 by an Indian delegation which visited China (30), ""There is no technical measure in the field of agriculture practiced in China which is really new. But it is the manner in which these technical measures are being implemented which is remarkable."""

Reports on the cytopathology of human strains of the para-influenza viruses1–6 in stained tissue culture preparations record only the finding of intracytoplasmic inclusions, although in FL cells specific intranuclear immunofluorescent staining has been demonstrated with para-influenza 3 (ref. 3). Reisinger et al.7 reported both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions in calf kidney tissue culture infected with the SF 4 bovine strain of para-influenza 3."

These authors isolated from unroasted peanuts by extraction with calcium hydroxide and acetone precipitation an active protease inhibitor which affected the fibrinolytic system presumably as an anti-activator1,2. Ethanol extract of peanuts recommended for the treatment of haemophilia by Boudreaux et al.3,4 revealed in Astrup's experiments only little or no antiprotease activity."

https://openalex.org/W1971005154,"SEVERAL recent investigations have directed attention to the influence of tetracycline on the metabolic behaviour of radiostrontium. The results, however, are ambiguous. In contrast to Nakatsuka et al.1, who were not able to observe any significant effect, it was claimed by Ogawa et al.2 that tetracycline administered immediately after radiostrontium injection prevents its skeletal deposition and enhances its urinary excretion. This effect was thought to be due to the chelating properties of the compound. Positive results were also obtained by Richards et al.3. Repeated daily doses of tetracycline—given 4 days prior until 24 days after the administration of radiostrontium—did not affect the initial deposition of radiostrontium, but rather accelerated its elimination from the bone. The treatment schedule used by the foregoing authors, however, does not permit deciding whether the pro-treatment, or post-treat ment, or both, were responsible for the effect."

https://openalex.org/W2093001764,"DURING an investigation of the relative availability to man of strontium in bread and cow's milk1, three normal subjects ingested approximately 500 mµc of strontium-85 daily for 4 weeks. Bulked samples of plasma from blood taken thrice weekly showed a lower specific activity (85Sr/Sr) than urine for the same period. These results are shown in Table 1 as mean values for the first three subjects. Two further normal subjects followed a similar regimen, but less-frequent and larger samples of blood were taken. This allowed the specific activity to be determined on each blood sample for comparison with the specific activity of urine over a contemporary 2-h period. It will be seen that these results were substantially the same as those in the earlier case; and a similar finding was obtained in another subject given a single oral dose of strontium-87m."
