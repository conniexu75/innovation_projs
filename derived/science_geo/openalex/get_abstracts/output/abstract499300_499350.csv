https://openalex.org/W2133836136,"Although the CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA system efficiently cleaves intracellular DNA at desired target sites, major concerns remain on potential ""off-target"" cleavage that may occur throughout the whole genome. In order to improve CRISPR-Cas9 specificity for targeted genome editing and transcriptional control, we describe a bioinformatics tool ""sgRNAcas9"", which is a software package developed for fast design of CRISPR sgRNA with minimized off-target effects. This package consists of programs to perform a search for CRISPR target sites (protospacers) with user-defined parameters, predict genome-wide Cas9 potential off-target cleavage sites (POT), classify the POT into three categories, batch-design oligonucleotides for constructing 20-nt (nucleotides) or truncated sgRNA expression vectors, extract desired length nucleotide sequences flanking the on- or off-target cleavage sites for designing PCR primer pairs to validate the mutations by T7E1 cleavage assay. Importantly, by identifying potential off-target sites in silico, the sgRNAcas9 allows the selection of more specific target sites and aids the identification of bona fide off-target sites, significantly facilitating the design of sgRNA for genome editing applications. sgRNAcas9 software package is publicly available at BiooTools website (www.biootools.com) under the terms of the GNU General Public License."
https://openalex.org/W2083857255,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and proteins containing antibody domains are the most prevalent class of biotherapeutics in diverse indication areas. Today, established techniques such as immunization or phage display allow for an efficient generation of new mAbs. Besides functional properties, the stability of future therapeutic mAbs is a key selection criterion which is essential for the development of a drug candidate into a marketed product. Therapeutic proteins may degrade via asparagine (Asn) deamidation and aspartate (Asp) isomerization, but the factors responsible for such degradation remain poorly understood. We studied the structural properties of a large, uniform dataset of Asn and Asp residues in the variable domains of antibodies. Their structural parameters were correlated with the degradation propensities measured by mass spectrometry. We show that degradation hotspots can be characterized by their conformational flexibility, the size of the C-terminally flanking amino acid residue, and secondary structural parameters. From these results we derive an accurate in silico prediction method for the degradation propensity of both Asn and Asp residues in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of mAbs."
https://openalex.org/W1969930465,"Fibrillar type I collagen is the major organic component in bone, providing a stable template for mineralization. During collagen biosynthesis, specific hydroxylysine residues become glycosylated in the form of galactosyl- and glucosylgalactosyl-hydroxylysine. Furthermore, key glycosylated hydroxylysine residues, α1/2-87, are involved in covalent intermolecular cross-linking. Although cross-linking is crucial for the stability and mineralization of collagen, the biological function of glycosylation in cross-linking is not well understood. In this study, we quantitatively characterized glycosylation of non-cross-linked and cross-linked peptides by biochemical and nanoscale liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometric analyses. The results showed that glycosylation of non-cross-linked hydroxylysine is different from that involved in cross-linking. Among the cross-linked species involving α1/2-87, divalent cross-links were glycosylated with both mono- and disaccharides, whereas the mature, trivalent cross-links were primarily monoglycosylated. Markedly diminished diglycosylation in trivalent cross-links at this locus was also confirmed in type II collagen. The data, together with our recent report (Sricholpech, M., Perdivara, I., Yokoyama, M., Nagaoka, H., Terajima, M., Tomer, K. B., and Yamauchi, M.

Covalent intermolecular cross-linking of collagen is initiated by the conversion of Lys/Hyl residues located in the non-helical C- and N-telopeptides (C- and N-telo) of the molecule to the respective aldehydes Lysald/Hylald, catalyzed by lysyl oxidase. In type I collagen, there are two Lys/Hyl residues in the C-telo part (two of the α1-16C; i.e. 16th residue from the N terminus in the C-telo) and three in the N-telo domains (two α1-9N and one α2-5N; i.e. 9th and 5th residue from the N terminus in the α1 and α2 N-telo, respectively). The aldehyde can then form an iminium bond to a juxtaposed ϵ-amino group of Lys/Hyl in the helical domain of the staggered adjacent molecule. The possible combinations are as follows: α1-16C × α1-87, α1-16C × α2-87, α1-9N × α1-930, α1-9N × α2-933, α2-5N × α1-930, and α2-5N × α2-933. Some of these combinations are preferred for cross-linking (27.Yamauchi M. Katz E.P. The post-translational chemistry and molecular packing of mineralizing tendon collagens.Connect. Tissue Res. 1993; 29: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In skeletal tissues, these divalent cross-links can then mature into trivalent cross-links, pyridinoline (Pyr), deoxypyridinoline (d-Pyr), and pyrrole (Prl) (1.Yamauchi M. Sricholpech M.

This information, however, is essential to understand the role of glycosylation in collagen biosynthesis and function. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become increasingly used in the structural characterization of collagens from different sources, and several studies have utilized MS to characterize collagen cross-linked peptides (30.Hanson D.A.

Although these studies pioneered the MS-based characterization of collagen cross-linked species, their major limitation is the use of low resolution mass analyzers. This renders accurate characterization of species bearing naturally occurring heterogeneity (e.g. incomplete hydroxylation of Lys or Pro) or of species with similar mass/charge ratio (m/z), difficult. In the present study, we used high performance/high resolution nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC/MS/MS) to comprehensively characterize the glycosylation at various molecular loci in non-cross-linked and cross-linked peptides in bovine bone type I collagen. A multistep chromatographic approach was employed to obtain highly purified cross-linked tryptic peptides. The analytical challenges associated with these large cross-linked species were overcome with the use of an alternative enzyme. The molecular distribution of glycosylation in non-cross-linked Hyl and immature and mature cross-links was quantitatively determined by nanoLC/MS. The results revealed a differential glycosylation pattern, depending on the involvement in cross-linking, molecular loci, and type and maturational stage of cross-linking. Fresh femoral bone samples from 2–3-year-old bovine animals were obtained commercially (Aries Scientific, Dallas, TX). After removing the surrounding connective tissues, both ends of the bone, and the bone marrow, the bones were cut into small pieces. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. The bone pieces were pulverized to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using a Spex Freezer Mill (Spex, Inc., Metuchen, NJ). Pulverized samples were washed several times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cold distilled water, centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min, and lyophilized. Bone powder was then demineralized with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, for 2 weeks with several changes of the EDTA solution by centrifugation at 4000 × g. The EDTA-insoluble residue was thoroughly washed with cold distilled water by repeated centrifugation at 4000 × g and lyophilized. Demineralized bone (∼2.0 g) was suspended in buffer containing 0.15 m N-trismethyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid and 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and reduced with standardized NaB3H4. The specific activity of the NaB3H4 was determined by the method described previously (35.Yamauchi M. Katz E.P. Mechanic G.L.

The reduced samples were washed with cold distilled water several times by repeated centrifugation at 4000 × g and lyophilized. Upon reduction, the dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine (dehydro-DHLNL) and dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine (dehydro-HLNL) and their respective keto amine forms are reduced to stable secondary amines, DHLNL and HLNL, and radiolabeled simultaneously (+2 Da molecular mass increase). Hereafter, the terms DHLNL and HLNL will be used for both the unreduced and reduced forms. Reduced collagen was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl and subjected to cross-link analysis as described previously (37.Kuboki Y Tsuzaki M Sasaki S Liu CF Mechanic GL Location of the intermolecular cross-links in bovine dentin collagen, solubilization with trypsin, and isolation of cross-link peptides containing dihydroxylysinonorleucine and pyridinoline.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reducible cross-links were analyzed as their reduced forms (i.e. DHLNL and HLNL, respectively). The levels of the immature reducible (DHLNL and HLNL) and mature non-reducible cross-links (Pyr and d-Pyr) were quantified and expressed in mol/mol of collagen. Digestion with trypsin of reduced bone collagen was prepared by the procedure described previously (37.Kuboki Y Tsuzaki M Sasaki S Liu CF Mechanic GL Location of the intermolecular cross-links in bovine dentin collagen, solubilization with trypsin, and isolation of cross-link peptides containing dihydroxylysinonorleucine and pyridinoline.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the reduced collagen was heated at 65 °C for 15 min, digested with 1% (w/w) trypsin for 16 h at 37 °C, reheated to 65 °C for 10 min, and retreated with 0.5% (w/w) trypsin for 3 h at 37 °C. Over 99% of the starting material was recovered in the supernatant of the trypsin digest. Molecular sieve chromatography of the bone tryptic digest was performed on a HiLoad Superdex 75 preparative scale column (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9) at room temperature. Aliquots of the reduced bone tryptic digest (∼200 mg) were injected and separated at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected, and their absorbance (230 nm), radioactivity, and fluorescence (excitation 330 nm and emission 390 nm) were measured. Fluorescence measurement was employed to detect Pyr and d-Pyr, and radioactivity was used to detect DHLNL and HLNL. The main fluorescent (F1–F3) and radioactive (R1 and R2) fractions were recovered. An equal aliquot from each fraction was lyophilized and subjected to cross-link analysis as described above. The majority of aliquots were subjected to further purification by reversed phase chromatography or digestion with chymotrypsin (see below). To identify fractions containing the Prl cross-link, aliquots from each fraction were subjected to Ehrlich's chromogen (EC) analysis following reported methods (30.Hanson D.A. Eyre D.R.

A collagen-associated Ehrlich chromogen: a pyrrolic cross-link?.Biosci. Rep. 1981; 1: 611-618Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the aliquots were lyophilized and resuspended in distilled water, and 35 μl of a 5% solution (w/v) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 4 m perchloric acid were added. The reaction was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The absorbance (572 nm) was monitored with a F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The main EC-positive fractions (P1–P3) eluted at similar positions as F1–F3 and were further characterized by mass spectrometry (see below). Chymotrypsin digestion of the fractions F1–F3, R1, and R2 collected after molecular sieve chromatography was performed as follows. The lyophilized fractions were dissolved in 100 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.4). Aliquots of 50 μl from each fraction were incubated with 2 μl of chymotrypsin solution (0.5 μg/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate) overnight at room temperature. These digests were further analyzed by nanoLC/MS/MS. The lyophilized fluorescent and radioactive fractions resolved by molecular sieve chromatography were further fractionated by reversed phase on a SOURCE 5RPC ST 4.6/150 column (GE Healthcare) using a Varian HPLC system (Prostar 240/310, Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). The solvents employed were 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium acetate (solvent A) and 70% acetonitrile in deionized water (v/v) (solvent B). The samples were dissolved in solvent A and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 15% solvent B for the first 10 min, followed by a linear gradient from 15 to 50% solvent B over the next 50 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. The effluent was monitored for absorbance (230 nm) and fluorescence (excitation 330 nm, emission 390 nm). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and aliquots were subjected to radioactivity and fluorescence measurements. The radioactive and fluorescent fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and subjected to further analysis. Ion-exchange chromatography of fractions collected after reversed phase separation was performed on a TSK-GEL DEAE-5PW column (8.0 × 75 mm, Tosoh Bioscience LLC, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated with 0.01 m NH4HCO3 containing 1% isopropyl alcohol. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 0.01 to 0.25 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, monitoring the absorbance at 230 nm. One-minute fractions were collected, and those corresponding to fluorescent and/or radioactive signals were pooled and lyophilized. Their structural characterization was performed by mass spectrometry. Glycosylated, non-cross-linked collagen peptides were characterized by nanoLC/MS/MS from a bovine bone tryptic digest on a nanoACQUITY UPLC-Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA).

Flow injection analyses of purified cross-linked tryptic peptides were performed by positive ion nanoelectrospray (ESI+) on a Waters Micromass Q-Tof Micro mass spectrometer (Waters). The samples were desalted using a C18 ZipTip pipette tip (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and reconstituted in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v). Dilutions were performed as needed to ensure optimal signal intensity. Mass spectrometer parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.8 kV; sampling cone, 30; source temperature, 80 °C; desolvation temperature, 20 °C. NanoLC/MS/MS analyses of cross-linked peptides were carried out on a nanoACQUITY UPLC-Q-Tof Global mass spectrometer (Waters) with data-dependent acquisition and charge state selection of the top four ions. Separations of chymotryptic digests of fractions after molecular sieve chromatography were carried out on a C18 BEH column (1.7 μm, 75 μm × 100 mm) at 0.3 μl/min, with a gradient from 1 to 50% solvent B over 30 min. The solvents were as follows: solvent A (0.1% formic acid in deionized water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Mass spectrometer settings for (+)-nano-ESI were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.4 kV; sampling cone, 30; source temperature, 80 °C. To ensure optimal fragmentation, the collision energies were optimized over the range 20–30 V. Data analysis was performed using the MassLynx software, version 4.1 (Waters), including the embedded deconvolution algorithms MaxEnt 1 and 3.

https://openalex.org/W2053236795,"Objectives To investigate the suggested role of Porphyromonas gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) in the relationship between the aetiology of periodontal disease and experimentally induced arthritis and the possible association between these two conditions. Methods A genetically modified PAD-deficient strain of P. gingivalis W50 was produced. The effect of this strain, compared to the wild type, in an established murine model for experimental periodontitis and experimental arthritis was assessed. Experimental periodontitis was induced following oral inoculation with the PAD-deficient and wild type strains of P. gingivalis. Experimental arthritis was induced via the collagen antibody induction process and was monitored by assessment of paw swelling and micro-CT analysis of the radio-carpal joints. Experimental periodontitis was monitored by micro CT scans of the mandible and histological assessment of the periodontal tissues around the mandibular molars. Serum levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and P. gingivalis were assessed by ELISA. Results The development of experimental periodontitis was significantly reduced in the presence of the PAD-deficient P. gingivalis strain. When experimental arthritis was induced in the presence of the PAD-deficient strain there was less paw swelling, less erosive bone damage to the joints and reduced serum ACPA levels when compared to the wild type P. gingivalis inoculated group. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that a PAD-deficient strain of P. gingivalis was associated with significantly reduced periodontal inflammation. In addition the extent of experimental arthritis was significantly reduced in animals exposed to prior induction of periodontal disease through oral inoculation of the PAD-deficient strain versus the wild type. This adds further evidence to the potential role for P. gingivalis and its PAD in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and exacerbation of arthritis. Further studies are now needed to elucidate the mechanisms which drive these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2074965142,"Objective Acinetobacter baumannii is considered the prototypical example of a multi- or pan- drug-resistant bacterium. It has been increasingly implicated as a major cause of nosocomial and community-associated infections. This study proposed to evaluate the efficacy of immunological approaches to prevent and treat A. baumannii infections. Methods Mice were immunized with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) prepared from a clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strain of A. baumannii. Pneumonia and sepsis models were used to evaluate the efficacy of active and passive immunization with OMVs. The probable effective mechanisms and the protective potential of clonally distinct clinical isolates were investigated in vitro using an opsonophagocytic assay. Results Intramuscular immunization with OMVs rapidly produced high levels of OMV-specific IgG antibodies, and subsequent intranasal challenge with A. baumannii elicited mucosal IgA and IgG responses. Both active and passive immunization protected the mice from challenges with homologue bacteria in a sepsis model. Bacterial burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF), lung, and spleen, inflammatory cell infiltration in BALF and lung, and inflammatory cytokine accumulation in BALF was significantly suppressed in the pneumonia model by both active and passive immunization strategies. The antisera from immunized mice presented with significant opsonophagocytic activities in a dose-dependent manner against not only homologous strains but also five of the other six clonally distinct clinical isolates. Conclusions Utilizing immunological characteristics of outer membrane proteins to elevate protective immunity and circumvent complex multidrug-resistance mechanisms might be a viable approach to effectively control A. baumannii infections."
https://openalex.org/W1989406910,"Background The high morbidity and socio-economic loss associated with the recent massive global outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emphasize the need to understand the biology of the virus for developing effective antiviral therapies. Methods and Findings In this study, an attempt was made to understand the molecular mechanism involved in Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) mediated regulation of CHIKV infection in mammalian cells using CHIKV prototype strain (S 27) and Indian outbreak strain of 2006 (DRDE-06). Our results showed that Hsp90 is required at a very early stage of viral replication and Hsp90 inhibitor Geldanamycin (GA) can abrogate new virus particle formation more effectively in the case of S 27 than that of DRDE-06. Further analysis revealed that CHIKV nsP2 protein level is specifically reduced by GA treatment as well as HSP90-siRNA transfection; however, viral RNA remains unaltered. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that nsP2 interacts with Hsp90 during infection; however this interaction is reduced in the presence of GA. In addition, our analysis on Hsp90 associated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway demonstrated that CHIKV infection stabilizes Raf1 and activates Hsp90 client protein Akt, which in turn phosphorylates mTOR. Subsequently, this phosphorylation leads to the activation of two important downstream effectors, S6K and 4EBP1, which may facilitate translation of viral as well as cellular mRNAs. Hence, the data suggests that CHIKV infection is regulated by Hsp90 associated Akt phosphorylation and DRDE-06 is more efficient than S 27 in enhancing the activation of host signaling molecules for its efficient replication and virus production. Conclusion Hsp90 positively regulates Chikungunya virus replication by stabilizing CHIKV-nsP2 through its interaction during infection. The study highlights the possible molecular mechanism of GA mediated inhibition of CHIKV replication and differential effect of this drug on S 27 and DRDE-06, which will be informative for developing effective anti-CHIKV therapies in future."
https://openalex.org/W2161037416,"The epithelial complement inhibitory proteins (CIPs) cluster of differentiation 46 and 55 (CD46 and CD55) regulate circulating immune complex-mediated complement activation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our previous studies demonstrated that IL-17A mediates epithelial injury via transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and down-regulates CIPs. In the current study, we examined the mechanistic role of TGF-β1 in complement activation-mediated airway epithelial injury in IPF pathogenesis. We observed lower epithelial CIP expression in IPF lungs compared to normal lungs, associated with elevated levels of complement component 3a and 5a (C3a and C5a), locally and systemically. In normal primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), C3a, or C5a (100 nM), we observed loss of CIPs and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation [also observed with RNA interference (RNAi) of CD46/CD55]. TGF-β1-mediated loss of CIPs and Snail induction [SNAI1; a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin (E-CAD)] was blocked by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK; SB203580) and RNAi silencing of SNAI1. C3a- and C5a-mediated loss of CIPs was also blocked by p38MAPK inhibition. While C3a upregulated TGFb transcripts, both C3a and C5a down-regulated SMAD7 (negative regulator of TGF-β), and whereas TGF-β1 induced C3a/C5a receptor (C3aR/C5aR) expression, pharmacologic C3aR/C5aR inhibition protected against C3a-/C5a-mediated loss of CIPs. Taken together, our results suggest that epithelial injury in IPF can be collectively amplified as a result of TGF-β1-induced loss of CIPs leading to complement activation that down-regulates CIPs and induces TGF-β1 expression"

In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of EVO on human colon COLO205 and HT-29 cells and their potential mechanisms. MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed that the viability of COLOL205 and HT-29 cells was inhibited by EVO at various concentrations in accordance with increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins. Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential by EVO was accompanied by increased Bax, caspase-9 protein cleavage, and cytochrome (Cyt) c protein translocation in COLO205 and HT-29 cells. Application of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) inhibited H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis, but did not affect EVO-induced apoptosis of COLO205 or HT-29 cells. Significant increases in the G2/M ratio and cyclinB1/cdc25c protein expression by EVO were respectively identified in colon carcinoma cells via a flow cytometric analysis and Western blotting. Induction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein phosphorylation was detected in EVO-treated cells, and the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, but not the ERK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited EVO-induced phosphorylated JNK protein expression, apoptosis, and G2/M arrest of colon carcinoma cells. Data of the structure-activity analysis showed that EVO-related chemicals containing an alkyl group at position 14 were able to induce apoptosis, G2/M arrest associated with increased DNA ladder formation, cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, and elevated cycB1 and cdc25c protein expressions in COLO205 and HT-29 cells. Evidence supporting JNK activation leading to EVO-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in colon carcinoma cells is provided, and alkylation at position 14 of EVO is a critical substitution for treatment of colonic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2014688316,"Abnormal histone acetylation occurs during neuropathic pain through an epigenetic mechanism. Silent information regulator 1 (sir2 or SIRT1), a NAD-dependent deacetylase, plays complex systemic roles in a variety of processes through deacetylating acetylated histone and other specific substrates. But the role of SIRT1 in neuropathic pain is not well established yet. The present study was intended to detect SIRT1 content and activity, nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the spinal cord using immunoblotting or mass spectroscopy over time in mice following chronic constriction injury (CCI) or sham surgery. In addition, the effect of intrathecal injection of NAD or resveratrol on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia was evaluated in CCI mice. Finally, we investigated whether SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 could reverse the anti-nociceptive effect of NAD or resveratrol. It was found that spinal SIRT1 expression, deacetylase activity and NAD/NAM decreased significantly 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after CCI surgery as compared with sham group. In addition, daily intrathecal injection of 5 µl 800 mM NAD 1 h before and 1 day after CCI surgery or single intrathecal injection of 5 µl 90 mM resveratrol 1 h before CCI surgery produced a transient inhibitory effect on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in CCI mice. Finally, an intrathecal injection of 5 µl 1.2 mM EX-527 1 h before NAD or resveratrol administration reversed the anti-nociceptive effect of NAD or resveratrol. These data indicate that the reduction in SIRT1 deacetylase activity may be a factor contributing to the development of neuropathic pain in CCI mice. Our findings suggest that the enhancement of spinal NAD/NAM and/or SIRT1 activity may be a potentially promising strategy for the prevention or treatment of neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2053621251,"Beclin 1 interacts with UV-irradiation-resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) to form core complexes that induce autophagy. While cells with defective autophagy are prone to genomic instability that contributes to tumorigenesis, it is unknown whether Beclin1 or UVRAG can regulate the DNA damage/repair response to cancer treatment in established tumor cells. We found that siRNA knockdown of Beclin 1 or UVRAG can increase radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), shown by pATM and γH2Ax, and promote colorectal cancer cell death. Furthermore, knockdown of Beclin 1, UVRAG or ATG5 increased the percentage of irradiated cells with nuclear foci expressing 53BP1, a marker of nonhomologous end joining but not RAD51 (homologous recombination), compared to control siRNA. Beclin 1 siRNA was shown to attenuate UVRAG expression. Cells with a UVRAG deletion mutant defective in Beclin 1 binding showed increased radiation-induced DSBs and cell death compared to cells with ectopic wild-type UVRAG. Knockdown of Beclin 1 or UVRAG, but not ATG5, resulted in a significant increase in centrosome number (γ-tubulin staining) in irradiated cells compared to control siRNA. Taken together, these data indicate that Beclin 1 and UVRAG confer protection against radiation-induced DNA DSBs and may maintain centrosome stability in established tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2060705166,"Morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa) have increased in recent years worldwide. Currently existing methods for diagnosis and treatment do not make the situation improve, especially for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The lack of molecular probes for PCa hindered the early diagnosis of metastasis and accurate staging for PCa. In this work, we have developed a new aptamer probe Wy-5a against PCa cell line PC-3 by cell-SELEX technique. Wy-5a shows high specificity to the target cells with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, and does not recognize other tested PCa cell lines and other tested tumor cell lines. The staining of clinical tissue sections with fluorescent dye labeled Wy-5a shows that sections from high risk group with metastasis exhibited stronger fluorescence and sections from Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) did not exhibit notable fluorescence, which suggests that aptamer Wy-5a may bind to protein related to the progression of PCa. The high affinity and specificity of Wy-5a makes this aptamer hold potential for application in diagnosis and target therapy of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2057511515,"Mounting evidence shows that urate may become a biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis and prognosis and a neuroprotectant candidate for PD therapy. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective actions remain poorly understood.In this study, we showed that urate pretreatment protected dopaminergic cell line (SH-SY5Y and MES23.5) against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and hydrogen peroxide- induced cell damage. Urate was found to be accumulated into SH-SY5Y cells after 30 min treatment. Moreover, urate induced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) accumulation by inhibiting its ubiquitinationa and degradation, and also promoted its nuclear translocation; however, it did not modulate Nrf2 mRNA level or Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) expression. In addition, urate markedly up-regulated the transcription and protein expression of γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (γ-GCLC) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), both of which are controlled by Nrf2 activity. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown by siRNA abolished the intracellular glutathione augmentation and the protection exerted by urate pretreatment.Our findings demonstrated that urate treatment may result in Nrf2-targeted anti-oxidant genes transcription and expression by reducing Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation and promoting its nuclear translocation, and thus offer neuroprotection on dopaminergic cells against oxidative stresses."
https://openalex.org/W1966751635,"Streptococcus pyogenes, a human-restricted pathogen, accounts for substantial mortality related to infections worldwide. Recent studies indicate that streptococci produce and respond to several secreted peptide signaling molecules (pheromones), including those known as short hydrophobic peptides (SHPs), to regulate gene expression by a quorum-sensing mechanism. Upon transport into the bacterial cell, pheromones bind to and modulate activity of receptor proteins belonging to the Rgg family of transcription factors. Previously, we reported biofilm regulation by the Rgg2/3 quorum-sensing circuit in S. pyogenes. The aim of this study was to identify the composition of mature pheromones from cell-free culture supernatants that facilitate biofilm formation. Bioluminescent reporters were employed to detect active pheromones in culture supernatants fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography, and mass spectrometry was used to characterize their properties. Surprisingly, multiple SHPs that varied by length were detected. Synthetic peptides of each variant were tested individually using bioluminescence reporters and biofilm growth assays, and although activities differed widely among the group, peptides comprising the C-terminal eight amino acids of the full-length native peptide were most active. Direct Rgg/SHP interactions were determined using a fluorescence polarization assay that utilized FITC-labeled peptide ligands. Peptide receptor affinities were seen to be as low as 500 nm and their binding affinities directly correlated with observed bioactivity. Revelation of naturally produced pheromones along with determination of their affinity for cognate receptors are important steps forward in designing compounds whose purpose is positioned for future therapeutics aimed at treating infections through the interference of bacterial communication."
https://openalex.org/W2044891682,"One of the best-studied mechanosensitive channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). MscL senses tension in the membrane evoked by an osmotic down shock and directly couples it to large conformational changes leading to the opening of the channel. Spectroscopic techniques offer unique possibilities to monitor these conformational changes if it were possible to generate tension in the lipid bilayer, the native environment of MscL, during the measurements. To this end, asymmetric insertion of l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the lipid bilayer has been effective; however, how LPC activates MscL is not fully understood. Here, the effects of LPC on tension-sensitive mutants of a bacterial MscL and on MscL homologs with different tension sensitivities are reported, leading to the conclusion that the mode of action of LPC is different from that of applied tension. Our results imply that LPC shifts the free energy of gating by interfering with MscL-membrane coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned addition of LPC can be used for controlled activation of MscL in spectroscopic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2048570423,"The Janus cassette permits marker-free allelic replacement or knockout in streptomycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) through sequential positive and negative selection. Spontaneous revertants of Janus can lead to high level of false-positives during negative selection, which necessitate a time-consuming post-selection screening process. We hypothesized that an additional counter-selectable marker in Janus would decrease the revertant frequency and reduce false-positives, since simultaneous reversion of both counter-selectable makers is much less likely. Here we report a modified cassette, Sweet Janus (SJ), in which the sacB gene from Bacillus subtilis conferring sucrose sensitivity is added to Janus. By using streptomycin and sucrose simultaneously as selective agents, the frequency of SJ double revertants was about 105-fold lower than the frequency of Janus revertants. Accordingly, the frequency of false-positives in the SJ-mediated negative selection was about 100-fold lower than what was seen for Janus. Thus, SJ enhances negative selection stringency and can accelerate allelic replacement in pneumococcus, especially when transformation frequency is low due to strain background or suboptimal transformation conditions. Results also suggested the sacB gene alone can function as a counter-selectable marker in the Gram-positive pneumococcus, which will have the advantage of not requiring a streptomycin-resistant strain for allelic replacement."
https://openalex.org/W1972045548,"Finasteride is an inhibitor of 5-α-reductase used against male androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Reported side effects of finasteride comprise sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction, male infertility, and loss of libido. Recently these effects were described as persistent in some subjects. Molecular events inducing persistent adverse sexual symptoms are unexplored. This study was designed as a retrospective case-control study to assess if androgen receptor (AR) and nerve density in foreskin prepuce specimens were associated with persistent sexual side effects including loss of sensitivity in the genital area due to former finasteride use against AGA. Cases were 8 males (aged 29–43 years) reporting sexual side effects including loss of penis sensitivity over 6 months after discontinuation of finasteride who were interviewed and clinically visited. After informed consent they were invited to undergo a small excision of skin from prepuce. Controls were 11 otherwise healthy matched men (aged 23–49 years) who undergone circumcision for phimosis, and who never took finasteride or analogues. Differences in AR expression and nerve density in different portions of dermal prepuce were evaluated in the 2 groups. Density of nuclear AR in stromal and epithelial cells was higher in cases (mean 40.0%, and 80.6% of positive cells, respectively) than controls (mean 23.4%, and 65.0% of positive cells, respectively), P = 0.023 and P = 0.043, respectively. Conversely, percentage of vessel smooth muscle cells positive for AR and density of nerves were similar in the 2 groups. The ratio of AR positive stromal cells % to serum testosterone concentrations was 2-fold higher in cases than in controls (P = 0.001). Our findings revealed that modulation of local AR levels might be implicated in long-term side effects of finasteride use. This provides the first evidence of a molecular objective difference between patients with long-term adverse sexual effects after finasteride use versus drug untreated healthy controls in certain tissues."

However, the optimal operationalization of ""early change"" for maximizing its predictive ability, and differences in predictive ability of disorder-specific versus general mental health measures has yet to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate how well early change predicted outcome depending on the week it was measured, the calculation method (regression slope or simple subtraction), the type of measures used, and the target disorder. During 10-15 weeks of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for depression, social anxiety disorder, or panic disorder, weekly ratings were collected through both disorder-specific measures and general measures (Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 (CORE-10)). With outcome defined as the disorder-specific measure, change at week four was the optimal predictor. Slope and subtraction methods performed equally well. The OQ-45 explained 18% of outcome for depression, 14% for social anxiety disorder, and 0% for panic disorder. Corresponding values for CORE-10 were 23%, 29%, and 25%. Specific measures explained 41%, 43%, and 34% respectively: this exceeded the ability of general measures also when they predicted themselves. We conclude that a simple calculation method with a disorder-specific measure at week four seems to provide a good choice for predicting outcome in time-limited cognitive behavior therapy."

Antibodies are the key to prevention of infections at the mucosal surface, but it is currently unclear whether the B cell repertoire at mucosal surfaces reflects the dominant antibodies found in the systemic compartment or whether mucosal tissues harbor unique repertoires. We examined the expressed antibody variable gene repertoires from 10 different human tissues using RNA samples derived from a large number of individuals. The results revealed that mucosal tissues such as stomach, intestine and lung possess unique antibody gene repertoires that differed substantially from those found in lymphoid tissues or peripheral blood. Mutation frequency analysis of mucosal tissue repertoires revealed that they were highly mutated, with little evidence for the presence of naïve B cells, in contrast to blood. Mucosal tissue repertoires possessed longer heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 loops than lymphoid tissue repertoires. We also noted a large increase in frequency of both insertions and deletions in the small intestine antibody repertoire. These data suggest that mucosal immune repertoires are distinct in many ways from the systemic compartment."

It contains capillaries, fibroblasts, immune cells and the steroidogenic cells that synthesize androgens for conversion to estradiol by the neighboring granulosa cells. During reproductive life only a small number of follicles will grow to a sufficient size to ovulate, whereas the majority of follicles will undergo regression/atresia and phagocytosis by macrophages. To identify genes which are differentially regulated in the theca interna during follicular atresia, we undertook transcriptome profiling of the theca interna from healthy (n = 10) and antral atretic (n = 5) bovine follicles at early antral stages (<5 mm). Principal Component Analyses and hierarchical classification of the signal intensity plots for the arrays showed primary clustering into two groups, healthy and atretic. A total of 543 probe sets were differentially expressed between the atretic and healthy theca interna. Further analyses of these genes by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis Toolkit software found most of the genes being expressed were related to cytokines, hormones and receptors as well as the cell cycle and DNA replication. Cell cycle genes which encode components of the replicating chromosome complex and mitotic spindle were down-regulated in atretic theca interna, whereas stress response and inflammation-related genes such as TP53, IKBKB and TGFB1 were up-regulated. In addition to cell cycle regulators, upstream regulators that were predicted to be inhibited included Retinoblastoma 1, E2 transcription factor 1, and hepatocyte growth factor. Our study suggests that during antral atresia of small follicles in the theca interna, arrest of cell cycle and DNA replication occurs rather than up- regulation of apoptosis-associated genes as occurs in granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2057981235,"Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is currently the standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Cisplatin has been shown to induce both apoptosis and necrosis in cancer cells, but the mechanism by which programmed necrosis is induced remains unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that cisplatin induces necrotic cell death in apoptosis-resistant esophageal cancer cells. This cell death is dependent on RIPK3 and on necrosome formation via autocrine production of TNFα. More importantly, we demonstrate that RIPK3 is necessary for cisplatin-induced killing of esophageal cancer cells because inhibition of RIPK1 activity by necrostatin or knockdown of RIPK3 significantly attenuates necrosis and leads to cisplatin resistance. Moreover, microarray analysis confirmed an anti-apoptotic molecular expression pattern in esophageal cancer cells in response to cisplatin. Taken together, our data indicate that RIPK3 and autocrine production of TNFα contribute to cisplatin sensitivity by initiating necrosis when the apoptotic pathway is suppressed or absent in esophageal cancer cells. These data provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin-induced necrosis and suggest that RIPK3 is a potential marker for predicting cisplatin sensitivity in apoptosis-resistant and advanced esophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1978186126,"Formyl peptide-receptor 1 and 2 (FPR1 and FPR2) in mice were identified as receptors with contrary affinity for the PAMP fMLF. Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine is either part of the bacterial membrane and is secreted by the mitochondria of eukaryotic ceslls during apoptosis. Furthermore FPR1 and 2 are described as highly relevant factors for the chemotaxis of immune cells. Their role during the acute liver injury has not been investigated yet.Constitutive knockout mice for FPR1 (mFPR1-/-), FPR2 (mFPR2-/-) and wild type (WT) mice were challenged with LPS i.p. for 3 h and 6 h. Liver and serum were sampled for further analysis.Liver transaminases were elevated in all mice 3 h and 6 h post LPS stimulation. Gene expression analysis displayed a reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL1 after 3 h in the mFPR1-/- compared to wild type and mFPR2-/- mice. After 6 h, IL-6, TNF-α and CXCL1 were significantly higher in mice lacking mFPR1 or 2. Consistent to these findings the numbers of CD11b+ and Ly6G+ immune cells were altered in the livers. The analysis of TLR2 and TLR4 revealed time and genotype specific changes in theirs gene expression. Additionally, the liver in mFPR1- and mFPR2-deficient mice seem to be more susceptible to apoptosis by showing a significant higher number of TUNEL+-cells in the liver than WT-mice and displayed less Ki67-positive nuclei in the liver.The results suggest a prominent role of FPRs in the regulation of the hepatic inflammatory response after LPS induced liver injury. Deletion of mFPR1 or mFPR2 leads to deregulation of the inflammatory response compared to WT mice, associated with more severe liver injury represented by higher levels of transaminases, apoptotic cells and a reduced regenerative capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2054130010,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) is a permanent threat due to its capacity to cross species barriers and generate severe infections and high mortality in humans. Recent findings have highlighted the potential role of PB1-F2, a small accessory influenza protein, in the pathogenesis process mediated by HPAIV in mammals. In this study, using a recombinant H5N1 HPAIV (wt) and its PB1-F2-deleted mutant (ΔF2), we studied the effects of PB1-F2 in a chicken model. Unexpectedly, when using low inoculation dose we observed that the wt-infected chickens had a higher survival rate than the ΔF2-infected chickens, a feature that contrasts with what is usually observed in mammals. High inoculation dose had similar mortality rate for both viruses, and comparison of the bio-distribution of the two viruses indicated that the expression of PB1-F2 allows a better spreading of the virus within chicken embryos. Transcriptomic profiles of lungs and blood cells were characterized at two days post-infection in chickens inoculated with the wild type (wt) or the ΔF2 mutant viruses. In lungs, the expression of PB1-F2 during the infection induced pathways related to calcium signaling and repressed a large panel of immunological functions. In blood cells, PB1-F2 was associated with a gene signature specific for mitochondrial dysfunction and down-modulated leucocytes activation. Finally we compared the effect of PB1-F2 in lungs of chickens and mice. We identified that gene signature associated to tissue damages is a PB1-F2 feature shared by the two species; by contrast, the early inhibition of immune response mediated by PB1-F2 observed in chickens is not seen in mice. In summary, our data suggest that PB1-F2 expression deeply affect the immune response in chickens in a way that may attenuate pathogenicity at low infection dose, a feature differing from what was previously observed in mammal species."
https://openalex.org/W2094586368,"Competition is a driving force regulating communities often considered an intermittent phenomenon, difficult to verify and potentially driven by environmental disturbances. Insecticides are agents of environmental disturbance that can potentially change ecological relationships and competitive outcomes, but this subject has seldom been examined. As the co-existing cereal grain beetle species Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and Rhyzopertha dominica F. share a common realized niche, directly competing for the same resources, they were used as models in our study. Intraspecific competition experiments were performed with increasing insect densities and insecticide doses in additive and replacement series using various density combinations of both beetle species maintained on insecticide-free or -sprayed grains. Insecticide-mediated release from competitive stress was not observed in our study of intraspecific competition in grain beetles. The insecticide enhanced the effect of insect density, particularly for the maize weevil S. zeamais, further impairing population growth at high densities. Therefore, insecticide susceptibility increased with intraspecific competition favoring insecticide efficacy. However, the effect of insecticide exposure on competitive interaction extends beyond intraspecific competition, affecting interspecific competition as well. Sitophilus zeamais was the dominant species when in interspecific competition prevailing in natural conditions (without insecticide exposure), but the dominance and species prevalence shifted from S. zeamais to R. dominica under insecticide exposure. Therefore, high conspecific densities favored insecticide efficacy, but the strength of the relationship differs with the species. In addition, the insecticide mediated a shift in species dominance and competition outcome indicating that insecticides are relevant mediators of species interaction, potentially influencing community composition and raising management concerns as potential cause of secondary pest outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2076960574,"Although type IV collagen is heavily glycosylated, the influence of this post-translational modification on integrin binding has not been investigated. In the present study, galactosylated and nongalactosylated triple-helical peptides have been constructed containing the α1(IV)382-393 and α1(IV)531-543 sequences, which are binding sites for the α2β1 and α3β1 integrins, respectively. All peptides had triple-helical stabilities of 37 °C or greater. The galactosylation of Hyl(393) in α1(IV)382-393 and Hyl(540) and Hyl(543) in α1(IV)531-543 had a dose-dependent influence on melanoma cell adhesion that was much more pronounced in the case of α3β1 integrin binding. Molecular modeling indicated that galactosylation occurred on the periphery of α2β1 integrin interaction with α1(IV)382-393 but right in the middle of α3β1 integrin interaction with α1(IV)531-543. The possibility of extracellular deglycosylation of type IV collagen was investigated, but no β-galactosidase-like activity capable of collagen modification was found. Thus, glycosylation of collagen can modulate integrin binding, and levels of glycosylation could be altered by reduction in expression of glycosylation enzymes but most likely not by extracellular deglycosylation activity."
https://openalex.org/W2085454600,"Twenty-four individuals with transtibial amputation were recruited to a randomized, crossover design study to examine stride-to-stride fluctuations of lower limb joint flexion/extension time series using the largest Lyapunov exponent (λ). Each individual wore a ""more appropriate"" and a ""less appropriate"" prosthesis design based on the subject's previous functional classification for a three week adaptation period. Results showed decreased λ for the sound ankle compared to the prosthetic ankle (F1,23 = 13.897, p = 0.001) and a decreased λ for the ""more appropriate"" prosthesis (F1,23 = 4.849, p = 0.038). There was also a significant effect for the time point in the adaptation period (F2,46 = 3.164, p = 0.050). Through the adaptation period, a freezing and subsequent freeing of dynamic degrees of freedom was seen as the λ at the ankle decreased at the midpoint of the adaptation period compared to the initial prosthesis fitting (p = 0.032), but then increased at the end compared to the midpoint (p = 0.042). No differences were seen between the initial fitting and the end of the adaptation for λ (p = 0.577). It is concluded that the λ may be a feasible clinical tool for measuring prosthesis functionality and adaptation to a new prosthesis is a process through which the motor control develops mastery of redundant degrees of freedom present in the system."
https://openalex.org/W2002972295,"Following activation, the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) interacts with its adaptor protein receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) to propagate immune signaling and initiate a proinflammatory immune response. This interaction is mediated by the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of both proteins. Polymorphisms in immune proteins can affect receptor function and predispose individuals to specific autoinflammatory disorders. In this report, we show that mutations in helix 2 of the CARD of NOD1 disrupted receptor function but did not interfere with RIP2 interaction. In particular, N43S, a rare polymorphism, resulted in receptor dysfunction despite retaining normal cellular localization, protein folding, and an ability to interact with RIP2. Mutation of Asn-43 resulted in an increased tendency to form dimers, which we propose is the source of this dysfunction. We also demonstrate that mutation of Lys-443 and Tyr-474 in RIP2 disrupted the interaction with NOD1. Mapping the key residues involved in the interaction between NOD1 and RIP2 to the known structures of CARD complexes revealed the likely involvement of both type I and type III interfaces in the NOD1·RIP2 complex. Overall we demonstrate that the NOD1-RIP2 signaling axis is more complex than previously assumed, that simple engagement of RIP2 is insufficient to mediate signaling, and that the interaction between NOD1 and RIP2 constitutes multiple CARD-CARD interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1963567957,"To investigate sensory reweighting as a fundamental property of sensor fusion during standing, we probed postural control with simultaneous rotations of the visual scene and surface of support. Nineteen subjects were presented with pseudo-random pitch rotations of visual scene and platform at the ankle to test for amplitude dependencies in the following conditions: low amplitude vision: high amplitude platform, low amplitude vision: low amplitude platform, and high amplitude vision: low amplitude platform. Gain and phase of frequency response functions (FRFs) to each stimulus were computed for two body sway angles and a single weighted EMG signal recorded from seven muscles. When platform stimulus amplitude was increased while visual stimulus amplitude remained constant, gain to vision increased, providing strong evidence for inter-modal reweighting between vision and somatosensation during standing. Intra-modal reweighting of vision was also observed as gains to vision decreased as visual stimulus amplitude increased. Such intra-modal and inter-modal amplitude dependent changes in gain were also observed in muscular activity. Gains of leg segment angle and muscular activity relative to the platform, on the other hand, showed only intra-modal reweighting. That is, changing platform motion amplitude altered the responses to both visual and support surface motion whereas changing visual scene motion amplitude did not significantly affect responses to support surface motion, indicating that the sensory integration scheme between somatosensation (at the support surface) and vision is asymmetric."
https://openalex.org/W2000156152,"In herbivorous insects, food selection depends on sensitivity to specific chemical stimuli from host-plants as well as to secondary metabolites (bitter) and to sugars (phagostimulatory). Bitter compounds are noxious, unpalatable or both and evoke an aversive feeding response. Instead, sugars and sugar alcohols play a critical role in determining and enhancing the palatability of foods. We assumed that peripheral taste sensitivity may be related to the width of the host selection. Our model consists of two closely phylogenetically related Papilionid species exhibiting a difference in host plant choice: Papilio hospiton and Papilio machaon. The spike activity of the lateral and medial maxillary styloconic taste sensilla was recorded following stimulation with several carbohydrates, nicotine and NaCl, with the aim of characterizing their gustatory receptor neurons and of comparing their response patterns in the light of their different acceptability in feeding behaviour. The results show that: a) each sensillum houses phagostimulant and phagodeterrent cells; b) the spike activity of the gustatory neurons in response to different taste stimuli is higher in P. hospiton than in P. machaon; c) sugar solutions inhibit the spike activity of the deterrent and salt cells, and the suppression is higher in P. machaon than in P. hospiton. In conclusion, we propose that the different balance between the phagostimulant and phagodeterrent inputs from GRNs of maxillary sensilla may contribute in determining the difference in food choice and host range."
https://openalex.org/W2009289908,"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) has been proposed as one of the Parkinson's disease (PD) related genes, but the possible molecular connection between UCH-L1 and PD is not well understood. In this study, we discovered an N-terminal 11 amino acid truncated variant UCH-L1 that we called NT-UCH-L1, in mouse brain tissue as well as in NCI-H157 lung cancer and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. In vivo experiments and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) studies showed that NT-UCH-L1 is readily aggregated and degraded, and has more flexible structure than UCH-L1. Post-translational modifications including monoubiquitination and disulfide crosslinking regulate the stability and cellular localization of NT-UCH-L1, as confirmed by mutational and proteomic studies. Stable expression of NT-UCH-L1 decreases cellular ROS levels and protects cells from H2O2, rotenone and CCCP-induced cell death. NT-UCH-L1-expressing transgenic mice are less susceptible to degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons seen in the MPTP mouse model of PD, in comparison to control animals. These results suggest that NT-UCH-L1 may have the potential to prevent neural damage in diseases like PD."
https://openalex.org/W2022667018,"Lactic acid is an important chemical with various industrial applications, and it can be efficiently produced by fermentation, in which Bacillus coagulans strains present excellent performance. Betaine can promote lactic acid fermentation as an effective osmoprotectant. Here, positive effect of betaine on fermentation by B. coagulans is revealed. Betaine could enhance lactic acid production by protecting l-LDH activity and cell growth from osmotic inhibition, especially under high glucose concentrations and with poor organic nitrogen nutrients. The fermentation with 0.05 g/L betaine could produce 17.9% more lactic acid compared to the fermentation without betaine. Beet molasses, which is rich in sucrose and betaine, was utilized in a co-feeding fermentation and raised the productivity by 22%. The efficient lactic acid fermentation by B. coagulans is thus developed by using betaine and beet molasses."
https://openalex.org/W2046359103,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most frequent autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease of the joints and it is characterized by the inflammation of the synovial membrane and the subsequent destruction of the joints. In RA, CD4+ T cells are the main drivers of disease initiation and the perpetuation of the damaging inflammatory process. To date, however, the genetic regulatory mechanisms of CD4+ T cells associated with RA etiology are poorly understood. The genome-wide analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in disease-relevant cell types is a recent genomic integration approach that is providing significant insights into the genetic regulatory mechanisms of many human pathologies. The objective of the present study was to analyze, for the first time, the genome-wide genetic regulatory mechanisms associated with the gene expression of CD4+ T cells in RA. Whole genome gene expression profiling of CD4+ T cells and the genome-wide genotyping (598,258 SNPs) of 29 RA patients with an active disease were performed. In order to avoid the excessive burden of multiple testing associated with genome-wide trans-eQTL analysis, we developed and implemented a novel systems genetics approach. Finally, we compared the genomic regulation pattern of CD4+ T cells in RA with the genomic regulation observed in reference lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We identified a genome-wide significant cis-eQTL associated with the expression of FAM66C gene (P = 6.51e−9). Using our new systems genetics approach we identified six statistically significant trans-eQTLs associated with the expression of KIAA0101 (P<7.4e−8) and BIRC5 (P = 5.35e−8) genes. Finally, comparing the genomic regulation profiles between RA CD4+ T cells and control LCLs we found 20 genes showing differential regulatory patterns between both cell types. The present genome-wide eQTL analysis has identified new genetic regulatory elements that are key to the activity of CD4+ T cells in RA."
https://openalex.org/W2025377341,"The temporo-spatial relationship between the three organs (lung, spleen and lymph node) involved during the initial stages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has been poorly studied. As such, we performed an experimental study to evaluate the bacillary load in each organ after aerosol or intravenous infection and developed a mathematical approach using the data obtained in order to extract conclusions. The results showed that higher bacillary doses result in an earlier IFN-γ response, that a certain bacillary load (BL) needs to be reached to trigger the IFN-γ response, and that control of the BL is not immediate after onset of the IFN-γ response, which might be a consequence of the spatial dimension. This study may have an important impact when it comes to designing new vaccine candidates as it suggests that triggering an earlier IFN-γ response might not guarantee good infection control, and therefore that additional properties should be considered for these candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1971967263,"The human melatonin MT1 receptor-belonging to the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-plays a key role in circadian rhythm regulation and is notably involved in sleep disorders and depression. Structural and functional information at the molecular level are highly desired for fine characterization of this receptor; however, adequate techniques for isolating soluble MT1 material suitable for biochemical and biophysical studies remain lacking. Here we describe the evaluation of a panel of constructs and host systems for the production of recombinant human MT1 receptors, and the screening of different conditions for their solubilization and purification. Our findings resulted in the establishment of an original strategy using a mixture of Fos14 and CHAPS detergents to extract and purify a recombinant human MT1 from Pichia pastoris membranes. This procedure enabled the recovery of relatively pure, monomeric and ligand-binding active MT1 receptor in the near-milligram range. A comparative study based on extensive ligand-binding characterization highlighted a very close correlation between the pharmacological profiles of MT1 purified from yeast and the same receptor present in mammalian cell membranes. The high quality of the purified MT1 was further confirmed by its ability to activate its cognate Gαi protein partner when reconstituted in lipid discs, thus opening novel paths to investigate this receptor by biochemical and biophysical approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1973097746,"Cathepsin K (CatK), a major lysosomal collagenase produced by osteoclasts, plays an important role in bone resorption. Evidence exists that the collagenase activity of CatK is promoted by chondroitin sulfate (CS), a sulfated glycosaminoglycan. This study examines the role of CS in facilitating CatK activation. We have demonstrated that chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S) promotes autoprocessing of the pro-domain of CatK at pH ≤ 5, leading to a fully matured enzyme with collagenase and peptidase activities. We present evidence to demonstrate this autoactivation process is a trans-activation event that is efficiently inhibited by both the covalent cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 and the reversible selective CatK inhibitor L-006,235. During bone resorption, CatK and C4-S are co-localized at the ruffled border between osteoclast bone interface, supporting the proposal that CatK activation is accomplished through the combined action of the acidic environment together with the presence of a high concentration of C4-S. Formation of a multimeric complex between C4-S and pro-CatK has been speculated to accelerate CatK autoactivation and promote efficient collagen degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that CS plays an important role in contributing to the enhanced efficiency of CatK collagenase activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1999698423,"Computational prediction of ligand entry and egress paths in proteins has become an emerging topic in computational biology and has proven useful in fields such as protein engineering and drug design. Geometric tunnel prediction programs, such as Caver3.0 and MolAxis, are computationally efficient methods to identify potential ligand entry and egress routes in proteins. Although many geometric tunnel programs are designed to accommodate a single input structure, the increasingly recognized importance of protein flexibility in tunnel formation and behavior has led to the more widespread use of protein ensembles in tunnel prediction. However, there has not yet been an attempt to directly investigate the influence of ensemble size and composition on geometric tunnel prediction. In this study, we compared tunnels found in a single crystal structure to ensembles of various sizes generated using different methods on both the apo and holo forms of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP119, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Several protein structure clustering methods were tested in an attempt to generate smaller ensembles that were capable of reproducing the data from larger ensembles. Ultimately, we found that by including members from both the apo and holo data sets, we could produce ensembles containing less than 15 members that were comparable to apo or holo ensembles containing over 100 members. Furthermore, we found that, in the absence of either apo or holo crystal structure data, pseudo-apo or -holo ensembles (e.g. adding ligand to apo protein throughout MD simulations) could be used to resemble the structural ensembles of the corresponding apo and holo ensembles, respectively. Our findings not only further highlight the importance of including protein flexibility in geometric tunnel prediction, but also suggest that smaller ensembles can be as capable as larger ensembles at capturing many of the protein motions important for tunnel prediction at a lower computational cost."

We propose a non-invasive method (NIRS, near infrared spectroscopy) to be used in routine clinical practice to evaluate a potential impairment of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity during exercise in children previously diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of skeletal muscle to extract O2 in 10 children diagnosed with ALL, 1 year after the end of malignancy treatment, compared to a control group matched for gender and age (mean±SD = 7.8±1.5 and 7.3±1.4 years, respectively).Participants underwent an incremental exercise test on a treadmill until exhaustion. Oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), heart rate (HR), and tissue oxygenation status (Δ[HHb]) of the vastus lateralis muscle evaluated by NIRS, were measured. The results showed that, in children with ALL, a significant linear regression was found by plotting [Formula: see text] vs Δ[HHb] both measured at peak of exercise. In children with ALL, the slope of the HR vs [Formula: see text] linear response (during sub-maximal and peak work rates) was negatively correlated with the peak value of Δ[HHb].The present study proves that the NIRS technique allows us to identify large inter-individual differences in levels of impairment in muscle O2 extraction in children with ALL. The outcome of these findings is variable and may reflect either muscle atrophy due to lack of use or, in the most severe cases, an undiagnosed myopathy."

Cyanide is a toxic chemical compound, which is synthesized, excreted, and metabolized by many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects to avoid predation or competition (6.Cipollone R.

Biotechnol. 2008; 15: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rhodanese-containing proteins play a role in the detoxification of cyanide by catalysis of the sulfane sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide, leading to the formation of the less toxic thiocyanate (5.Papenbrock J. Guretzki S. Henne M. Latest news about the sulfurtransferase protein family of higher plants.Amino Acids. 2010; 41: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6.Cipollone R. Ascenzi P. Tomao P.

An active site cysteine in a six-amino acid residue loop of the rhodanese domain is thereby essential for the sulfurtransferase activity. The enzymatic reaction takes place in two steps. In the first step, the thiol group of the cysteine reacts with the thiosulfate anion (S2O3−) to form an enzyme-persulfide intermediate, which reacts in a second step with the cyanide ion to produce thiocyanate (SCN−) (7.Bordo D.

Toward an understanding of the mechanism of action, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the α-helical membrane protein YgaP from E. coli by solution state NMR, and we studied the enzymatic activity of its rhodanese domain. To simplify the resonance assignment of full-length YgaP, we designed a construct expressing the cytoplasmic rhodanese domain alone, hereafter called rhodanese-F (comprising residues 2–109 of YgaP according to the numbering by Li et al. (11.Li H. Bi Y. Xia B. Jin C. 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments of the rhodanese domain of YgaP from Escherichia coli.Biomol.

Similarly, the rhodanese variants C63D and C63A were expressed and purified following the protocol described by Tzitzilonis et al. (12.Tzitzilonis C. Eichmann C. Maslennikov I. Choe S. Riek R.

Note that all the YgaP preparations used lack the Met at the N terminus when compared with the UniProt database, therefore, Ala is the first amino acid residue (numbered Ala-1) of the sequence used. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 700 MHz Avance III spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe.

The side-chain 1H resonances were assigned using three-dimensional ct-HCCH-total correlation spectroscopy (mixing time (τm) = 21.7 ms) (15.Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Singer A.U. Muhandiram D.R. Forman-Kay J.D.

Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy, Principles and Practice. Academic, San Diego1996Google Scholar) experiments. Therefore, the previously determined 13C and 1HN chemical shifts were used as starting points for the analysis (16.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy, Principles and Practice. Academic, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Ambiguities were resolved by three-dimensional 13C/15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY experiments (τm = 60 ms) (17.Ikura M. Kay L.E. Tschudin R. Bax A.

This approach yielded an almost complete sequential assignment with the exception of Gln-64. Interesting to note is the 1Hϵ chemical shift of Arg-24 (9.13 ppm), which indicates that Arg-24 forms a salt bridge. Based on the three-dimensional structure, the salt bridge could be with Glu-28 (Fig. 1A). transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy constant time paramagnetic relaxation enhancement hydrogen bond root mean square deviation double electron electron resonance 1-oxyl-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate 1-acetyl-(2,2,5,5-tetrametyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) transmembrane α-helix 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine. An important step in the sequential assignment of YgaP− began with mapping the backbone assignment of rhodanese-F onto the spectra of full-length 2H (∼50%),13C,15N-labeled YgaP−. The sequential backbone assignment of YgaP− was mainly obtained from the three-dimensional ct-TROSY-HNCA. Ambiguities were resolved with the three-dimensional ct-TROSY-HN(CO)CA. The sequential amide-amide NOE connectivities (19.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986: 17-166Google Scholar) in the three-dimensional 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY (τm = 100 ms) were used to check and to fix ambiguities in the backbone assignment of the transmembrane domain of YgaP−. Although the membrane protein-typical high percentage (here 31%) of the hydrophobic residues isoleucine, leucine, and valine within the transmembrane helices of YgaP− combined with the lack of 13Cβ chemical shifts posed a challenge for the sequential assignment, the combination of triple resonance and NOESY experiments resulted in a nearly complete backbone 1HN, 13Cα, and 15N resonance assignment. However, the backbone assignments of Ile-124, Leu-125, Val-128, Leu-130, Leu-140, and Leu-141 could not be obtained from the procedure described above. The lack of these resonances could result from conformational exchange dynamics. For example, residues 140 and 141 are in the loop between the two transmembrane α-helices, which may undergo conformational exchange due to a potential interaction of the loop with the micelle surface. Assignment of the missing 1HN, 13Cα, and 15N resonances for the remaining above-mentioned residues could not be obtained from the three-dimensional 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY due to severe NOE cross-peak overlap between rhodanese and transmembrane domains close to the diagonal amide proton region and/or due to NOE peak overlap within the two transmembrane helices. A summary of the NMR data obtained for YgaP− is shown schematically in Fig. 2A. Identification of the secondary structure elements was based on the 13Cα chemical shift deviations from the corresponding random coil chemical shifts (20.Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Random coil chemical shifts in acidic 8 m urea: implementation of random coil shift data in NMRView.J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and the characteristic 1HN-1HN NOE connectivities (19.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986: 17-166Google Scholar). Overall, the collected NMR data indicate the presence of two transmembrane helices, residues Met-113–Phe-138 and residues Ser-142–Met-167 (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the presence of exchange NOE cross-peaks between amide protons and the solvent (water) resonance (1HN-H2O cross-peaks in the three-dimensional 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY spectrum) was analyzed. The shielding from the solvent of these amide protons suggests either involvement in hydrogen bonding, and/or being in a water-free environment, such as the interior of the protein-detergent complex. The difference between the chemical shifts of the amide protons and the corresponding random coil values (19.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986: 17-166Google Scholar) Δδ1HN was used for a more detailed characterization of the two transmembrane helices. The 1HN chemical shifts were referenced to the water signal at 30 °C according to δ(H2O) = 7.83 − T/96.9 ppm (T is shown in K) (16.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy, Principles and Practice. Academic, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Δδ1HN changed in a periodic pattern along the amino acid sequence within the two transmembrane α-helices. The spacings between the minima/maxima were observed for each third or fourth residue (Fig. 2A). This characteristic periodicity is consistent with the results of Kuntz et al. (21.Kuntz I.D. Kosen P.A. Craig E.C. Amide chemical shifts in many helices and proteins are periodic.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 105: 5948-5949Google Scholar), Shenkarev et al. (22.Shenkarev Z.O. Paramonov A.S.

Soc. 1992; 114: 4320-4326Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that amide protons in α-helices show a 3–4 repeat periodicity in 1HN chemical shifts. The side chain assignment of rhodanese-F was used as a starting point in the analysis of the three-dimensional 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY and three-dimensional 13C-resolved 1H,1H NOESY (τm = 100 ms) of a 2H (∼50%), 13C,15N, and a 13C,15N-labeled YgaP− sample. In the 13C-resolved 1H,1H NOESY spectrum, the 6 mm protonated 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DHPC-7) gave rise to strong t1 noise in the methyl spectral region, which masked vital information. Despite applying a 1-ms spin-lock pulse at the 1H carrier frequency prior to acquisition (24.Messerle B.A. Wider G. Otting G. Weber C. Wüthrich K. Solvent suppression using a spin-lock in 2D and 3D NMR spectroscopy with H2O solutions.J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 608-613Google Scholar) to suppress signals originating from the detergent, the spectrum remained unreadable in some areas of interest. Consequently, only partial side-chain assignment of the transmembrane domain of YgaP− was achieved, and the side-chain assignment of the rhodanese domain in YgaP− was limited. Additionally, fast T2 relaxation in a 13C,15N-labeled sample caused severe signal loss in the transmembrane region of YgaP− (Fig. 3, C and D). For the identification of intermolecular NOEs between neighboring subunits, a mixed sample was prepared with a 1: 1 ratio of the 2H,15N-labeled protein and the unlabeled protein. A three-dimensional 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY spectrum (τm = 220 ms, time domain data size 128·32·2048 complex points, t1 max(1H) = 12.8 ms, t2 max(15N) = 14.4 ms, t3 max(1H) = 204.9 ms) was recorded with this mixed sample. Because in this spectrum there is a lack of strong cross-peaks observed in the NOESY spectra of homogenously labeled samples, it could be excluded that the NOE cross-peaks observed in the mixed sample are based on residual protonation (Table 1).TABLE 1Unambiguous intermolecular NOEs of the homodimeric transmembrane domain of YgaP− used for the structure calculation2H-perdeuterated, 15N-labeled YgaP−Unlabeled YgaP−Upper limit distance restraintÅGln-108(HN)Gln-108(Hα)13.0Arg-114(HN)Arg-114(Hα)9.0Gln-117(HN)Gln-117(Hα)9.0Ile-118(HN)Ile-118(Hγ2)9.0Ala-120(HN)Ile-118(Hγ2)13.0Gly122(HN)Ile-154(Hδ1)9.0Gly-131(HN)Gly-131(Hα)9.5Tyr-132(HN)Tyr-132(Hα)9.0Thr-133(HN)Thr-133(Hα)9.5Val-134(HN)Gly-131(Hα)13.0Val-134(HN)Thr-133(Hα)13.0Asn-135(HN)Asn-135(Hα)9.0Leu-164(HN)Leu-164(Hβ2)13.5Asp-165(HN)Leu-164(Hα)13.0Asp-165(HN)Asp-165(Hβ3)13.0 Open table in a new tab Additional intermolecular distance constraints were derived from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements on the YgaP(C63D) variant labeled with the thiol-reactive nitroxide 1-oxyl-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) at the position of the natural Cys-158 mixed with a 2H (∼50%), 15N-labeled full-length YgaP(C63D/C158S) sample in a ratio of 1:1. Two-dimensional 15N,1H TROSY spectra (time domain data size 256·2048 complex points, t1 max(15N) = 44.8 ms and t2 max(1H) = 204.9 ms) under paramagnetic MTSL and diamagnetic 1-acetyl-(2,2,5,5-tetrametyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (DML, both from Toronto Research Chemicals) conditions were then acquired yielding only intermolecular PRE data. The PRE data were assigned to three different categories as follows: 15N-1H cross-peaks showing a paramagnetic/diamagnetic intensity ratio of <15% were translated to corresponding PRE upper limit distance restraints of 9–12 Å. Peaks with an intensity ratio between 15 and 85% were translated to upper limit distance restraints of 14–18 Å (25.Battiste J.L. Wagner G.

The atoms involved in the distance restraints were the Cβ atom of the spin-labeled Cys-158 and the hydrogen atom of the 15N-1H moieties of the affected cross-peaks (Table 2).TABLE 2Unambiguous intermolecular PREs of the homodimeric transmembrane domain of YgaP− used for the structure calculation2H (∼50%), 15N-labeled YgaP (C63D/C158S)MTSL-labeled YgaP(C63D)Upper limit distance restraintÅLeu-110(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)18.0Leu-112(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)14.0Met-113(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)12.0Gln-117(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)9.0Ala-120(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)11.0Gly-121(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)9.0Gly-122(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)11.0Gly-127(HN)Cys-158(Cβ)11.0 Open table in a new tab The interaction of YgaP− with DHPC-7 was studied using the three-dimensional 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY (τm = 220 ms) recorded with the 2H,15N-labeled YgaP− mixed with the unlabeled YgaP− in a ratio of 1:1 in DHPC-7/LMPG (1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol)) micelles at 30 °C, pH 7.0 (Table 3). No intermolecular NOEs between the amide protons and LMPG were observed, probably due to the low concentration of LMPG when compared with DHPC-7. The resonance assignment of DHPC-7 in a 6:1 mixture with LMPG was obtained from a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum with the hydrophobic -CH3- groups at 0.82 ppm, the -CH2- groups of the chain at 1.21, 1.52, and 2.30 ppm, and the choline methyl resonances at 3.20 ppm. The proton chemical shifts were referenced to the water signal at 30 °C according to δ(H2O) = 7.83 ppm − T/96.9 ppm = 4.70 ppm (T is shown in K). It has to be mentioned that for some residues data were not available or were ambiguous due to NOE peak overlap between the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domain of YgaP−.TABLE 3Detergent-protein interactions and chemical exchange between H2O and amide protons in the transmembrane region of YgaP− Steady-state heteronuclear 15N-{1H} NOE data (27.Kay L.E.

TROSY-based 15N-{1H} NOE experiments (time domain data size 128·2048 complex points, t1 max(15N) = 28.8 ms, t2 max(1H) = 204.9 ms, relaxation delay 2.0 s) were performed in the presence and absence of a 3-s proton presaturation period prior to the 15N excitation. A total of 16 transients per increment were collected in each experiment. Steady-state NOE values were determined by the ratio of cross-peak heights elucidated from cross-sections through the spectra parallel to the 15N dimension acquired with and without 1H presaturation during the recycle delay. For R1 and R1ρ spectra with 64·2048 complex time domain data points (R1, R1ρ: t1 max(15N) = 14.4 ms, t2 max(1H) = 204.9 ms) were measured with eight transients and a recycle delay of 1.0 s. R1 and R1ρ relaxation rate constants were obtained by fitting the logarithm of peak intensities to a linear function by the least square method using the following relaxation periods T for R1 and R1ρ: T = 40, 91, 191, 292, 393, 594, 796, and 997 ms and 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 ms, respectively. Three-dimensional structures of rhodanese-F were calculated using the established procedures having seven cycles of the iterative CANDID approach (30.Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K.

The structure of full-length YgaP− was calculated for the rhodanese domain (residues 1–108) and the transmembrane domain (residues 106–173) separately. The structure determination of the rhodanese domain in full-length YgaP− was calculated as described above for rhodanese-F. In contrast, a two-step approach was used for the structure calculation of the transmembrane domain of full-length YgaP−. First, the monomer structure (Table 5) was calculated using the backbone torsion angle restraints, distance constraints derived from NOEs, and hydrogen bond constraints. The backbone torsion angle restraints were derived from the 13Cα chemical shifts (32.Luginbühl P. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K.

In B16-F0 cells, the polymer increased the transfection efficiency of naked DNA by 700-fold and yielded better transfection efficiencies than Fugene HD (threefold higher) and PEI 25 kDa (fivefold higher). The high transfection efficiency of the polymer was not affected by the presence of serum during transfection. In addition to B16-F0 cells, the polymer enabled efficient transfection of HepG2 and U87 cells with low cytotoxicity. Our results indicated that our polymer is a safe and efficient transfection reagent that warrants further development for in vitro, in vivo and clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2014644734,"Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion (T3S) to inject effector proteins into the host cell to create appropriate conditions for infection and intracellular replication. Chlamydia spp. are believed to use T3S to infect their host cell, and the translocator proteins are an essential component of this system. Chlamydia pneumoniae contains genes encoding two sets of translocator proteins; CopB and CopD, and CopB2 and CopD2. In this study, we identified novel interactions between CopD and three type III secretion proteins; namely, CopN, CdsN, and CdsF. We identified a CopD putative chaperone binding motif, PxLxxP, within the N-terminal region (CopD amino acids 120–125), which was necessary for interaction with its putative chaperone LcrH_1. Using size exclusion chromatography, we showed that CopD and LcrH_1 formed higher order structures in solution with CopD and LcrH_1 binding in a ratio of 1∶1, which is unique for T3SS translocator proteins. Lastly, we showed that antibodies to CopD reduced C. pneumoniae infectivity by >95%. Collectively, this data suggests that CopD plays a critical role in pathogenesis and likely functions as a hydrophobic translocator of the type III secretion system in Chlamydia pneumoniae."

Hepatic steatosis shows a greater negative influence on graft function following prolonged cold ischaemia. As the impact of steatosis on hepatocyte metabolism during extended cold ischaemia is not well-described, we compared markers of metabolic capacity and mitochondrial function in steatotic and lean livers following clinically relevant durations of cold preservation.Livers from 10-week old leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob, n = 9) and lean C57 mice (n = 9) were preserved in ice-cold University of Wisconsin solution. Liver mitochondrial function was then assessed using high resolution respirometry after 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours of storage. Metabolic marker enzymes for anaerobiosis and mitochondrial mass were also measured in conjunction with non-bicarbonate tissue pH buffering capacity.Ob/ob and lean mice livers showed severe (>60%) macrovesicular and mild (<30%) microvesicular steatosis on Oil Red O staining, respectively. Ob/ob livers had lower baseline enzymatic complex I activity but similar adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels compared to lean livers. During cold storage, the respiratory control ratio and complex I-fueled phosphorylation deteriorated approximately twice as fast in ob/ob livers compared to lean livers. Ob/ob livers also demonstrated decreased ATP production capacities at all time-points analyzed compared to lean livers. Ob/ob liver baseline lactate dehydrogenase activities and intrinsic non-bicarbonate buffering capacities were depressed by 60% and 40%, respectively compared to lean livers.Steatotic livers have impaired baseline aerobic and anaerobic capacities compared to lean livers, and mitochondrial function indices decrease particularly from after 5 hours of cold preservation. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical recommendation of shorter cold storage durations in steatotic donor livers."
https://openalex.org/W1973755033,"A hallmark of inflammation, increased vascular permeability, is induced in endothelial cells by multiple agonists through stimulus-coupled assembly of the CARMA3 signalosome, which contains the adaptor protein BCL10. Previously, we reported that BCL10 in immune cells is targeted by the ""death"" adaptor CRADD/RAIDD (CRADD), which negatively regulates nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-dependent cytokine and chemokine expression in T cells (Lin, Q., Liu, Y., Moore, D. J., Elizer, S. K., Veach, R. A., Hawiger, J., and Ruley, H. E. (2012) J. Immunol. 188, 2493-2497). This novel anti-inflammatory CRADD-BCL10 axis prompted us to analyze CRADD expression and its potential anti-inflammatory action in non-immune cells. We focused our study on microvascular endothelial cells because they play a key role in inflammation. We found that CRADD-deficient murine endothelial cells display heightened BCL10-mediated expression of the pleotropic proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in response to LPS and thrombin. Moreover, these agonists also induce significantly increased permeability in cradd(-/-), as compared with cradd(+/+), primary murine endothelial cells. CRADD-deficient cells displayed more F-actin polymerization with concomitant disruption of adherens junctions. In turn, increasing intracellular CRADD by delivery of a novel recombinant cell-penetrating CRADD protein (CP-CRADD) restored endothelial barrier function and suppressed the induction of IL-6 and MCP-1 evoked by LPS and thrombin. Likewise, CP-CRADD enhanced barrier function in CRADD-sufficient endothelial cells. These results indicate that depletion of endogenous CRADD compromises endothelial barrier function in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, we define a novel function for CRADD in endothelial cells as an inducible suppressor of BCL10, a key mediator of responses to proinflammatory agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2088462205,"Population genetic structure, historical biogeography and historical demography of the alpine toad Scutiger ningshanensis were studied using the combined data mtDNA cytochrome b (cyt b) and the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) as the molecular markers. This species has high genetic variation. There was a significant genetic differentiation among most populations. Three lineages were detected. The phylogenetic relationship analyses and the SAMOVA (spatial analysis of molecular variance) results showed significant phylogeographic structure. 82.15% genetic variation occurred among populations whereas differentiation within populations only contributed 17.85% to the total. Mantel test results showed a significant correlation between the pairwise calculated genetic distance and pairwise calculated geographical distance of the populations (regression coefficient = 0.001286, correlation coefficient = 0.77051, p (rrand≥robs) = 0.0185<0.05), indicating the existence of isolation-by-distance pattern of genetic divergence for cyt b + COI sequence, which suggests that the distribution of genetic variation is due to geographical separation rather than natural selection. The population expansion or contraction and genetic differentiation between populations or lineages could be explained by topography and the repetitive uplifts of the Tsinling Mountains and the climatic cycles during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. S. ningshanensis experienced a rapid population expansion about 40,000 years before present. The current decline in population size was probably caused by anthropogenic disturbance. Current populations of S. ningshanensis are from different refugia though the location of these refugia could not be determined in our study. Topography, climatic changes and repetitive population expansion/contraction together led to the high level of genetic variation in S. ningshanensis. A total of three management units (MUs) was determined, which must be considered when conservation policy is made in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2067331800,"Borna disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic, enveloped, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus that infects a wide variety of vertebrate species from birds to humans across a broad global geographic distribution. Animal symptomatology range from asymptomatic infection to behavioral abnormalities to acute meningoencephalitis. Asymptomatic BDV infection has been shown to be more frequent than conventionally estimated. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underyling asymptomatic BDV infection remain largely unknown. Here, based on real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting, a total of 18 horse hippocampi were divided into BDV-infected (n = 8) and non-infected control (n = 10) groups. A gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomic approach, in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis, was used to characterize the hippocampal metabolic changes associated with asymptomatic BDV infection. Multivariate statistical analysis showed a significant discrimination between the BDV-infected and control groups. BDV-infected hippocampi were characterized by lower levels of D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate, glutamate, phosphoethanolamine, heptadecanoic acid, and linoleic acid in combination with a higher level of ammonia. These differential metabolites are primarily involved in glutamate and lipid metabolism. These finding provide an improved understanding of hippocampal changes associated with asymptomatic BDV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2076005019,"We investigated the passive mechanical properties of villi in ex vivo preparations of sections of the wall of the distal ileum from the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) by using a flow cell to impose physiological and supra-physiological levels of shear stress on the tips of villi. We directly determined the stress applied from the magnitude of the local velocities in the stress inducing flow and additionally mapped the patterns of flow around isolated villi by tracking the trajectories of introduced 3 µm microbeads with bright field micro particle image velocimetry (mPIV). Ileal villi were relatively rigid along their entire length (mean 550 µm), and exhibited no noticeable bending even at flow rates that exceeded calculated normal physiological shear stress (>0.5 mPa). However, movement of villus tips indicated that the whole rigid structure of a villus could pivot about the base, likely from laxity at the point of union of the villous shaft with the underlying mucosa. Flow moved upward toward the tip on the upper portions of isolated villi on the surface facing the flow and downward toward the base on the downstream surface. The fluid in sites at distances greater than 150 µm below the villous tips was virtually stagnant indicating that significant convective mixing in the lower intervillous spaces was unlikely. Together the findings indicate that mixing and absorption is likely to be confined to the tips of villi under conditions where the villi and intestinal wall are immobile and is unlikely to be greatly augmented by passive bending of the shafts of villi."
https://openalex.org/W2044274781,"Copy number variation (CNV) has been recognized as a major contributor to human genome diversity. It plays an important role in determining phenotypes and has been associated with a number of common and complex diseases. However CNV data from diverse populations is still limited. Here we report the first investigation of CNV in the indigenous populations from Peninsular Malaysia. We genotyped 34 Negrito genomes from Peninsular Malaysia using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray and identified 48 putative novel CNVs, consisting of 24 gains and 24 losses, of which 5 were identified in at least 2 unrelated samples. These CNVs appear unique to the Negrito population and were absent in the DGV, HapMap3 and Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) datasets. Analysis of gene ontology revealed that genes within these CNVs were enriched in the immune system (GO:0002376), response to stimulus mechanisms (GO:0050896), the metabolic pathways (GO:0001852), as well as regulation of transcription (GO:0006355). Copy number gains in CNV regions (CNVRs) enriched with genes were significantly higher than the losses (P value <0.001). In view of the small population size, relative isolation and semi-nomadic lifestyles of this community, we speculate that these CNVs may be attributed to recent local adaptation of Negritos from Peninsular Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2009089168,"Zoopharmacognosy denotes a constellation of learned ingestive responses that promote healing and survival of infected or poisoned animals. A similar self-medication phenomenon was reported in diseased laboratory rodents. In particular, a series of studies revealed that autoimmune MRL/lpr mice readily consume solutions paired or laced with cyclophosphamide (CY), an immunosuppressive drug that prevents inflammatory damage to internal organs. However, due to design limitations, it could not be elucidated whether such a response reflects the learned therapeutic effect of CY, or a deficit in sensory input. We presently assess the behavioural effects of prolonged consumption of CY-laced, 16% sucrose solution in a continuous choice paradigm, with tap water available ad lib. Contrary to overall expectation, MRL/lpr mice did not increase their intake of CY with disease progression. Moreover, they ingested lower doses of CY and preferred less CY-laced sucrose solution than age-matched controls. The results obtained could not confirm zoopharmacognosy in diseased MRL/lpr mice, likely due to impaired responsiveness to palatable stimulation, or attenuated survival mechanisms after prolonged inbreeding in captivity. However, by revealing the effectiveness of unrestricted drinking of drug-laced sucrose solution on behavior and immunity, the current study supports broader use of such an administration route in behavioural studies sensitive to external stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2027508640,"Background The altered composition of immune cells in peripheral blood has been reported to be associated with cancer patient survival. However, analysis of the composition of peripheral immune cells are often limited in retrospective survival studies employing banked blood specimens with long-term follow-up because the application of flow cytometry to such specimens is problematic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of deconvolving blood-based gene expression profiles (GEPs) to estimate the proportions of immune cells and determine their prognostic values for cancer patients. Methods and Results Here, using GEPs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we deconvolved the immune cell proportions and analyzed their association with patient survival. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a low proportion of T cells was significantly associated with poor patient survival, as was the proportion of T helper cells; however, only the proportion of T cells was independently prognostic for patients by a multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.01–4.92; p = .048). Considering that altered peripheral blood compositions can reflect altered immune responses within the tumor microenvironment, based on a tissue-based GEPs of NSCLC patients, we demonstrated a significant association between poor patient survival and the low level of antigen presentation, which play a critical role in T cell proliferation. Conclusions These results demonstrate that it is feasible to deconvolve GEPs from banked blood specimens for retrospective survival analysis of alterations of immune cell composition, and suggest the proportion of T cells in PBMC which might reflect the antigen presentation level within the tumor microenvironment can be a prognostic marker for NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W1996587467,"In MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian mast cells (OMCs) are more abundant than in other mouse strains, and tend to distribute beneath the ovarian surface epithelium at birth. This study investigated the factors regulating the appearance of neonatal OMCs in progeny of the cross between MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6N strains. F1 neonates had less than half the number of OMCs than MRL/MpJ. Interestingly, MRLB6F1 had more neonatal OMCs than B6MRLF1, although they were distributed over comparable areas. Furthermore, in MRL/MpJ fetuses for which parturition was delayed until embryonic day 21.5, the number of OMCs was significantly higher than in age-matched controls at postnatal day 2. These results suggest that the number of OMCs was influenced by the environmental factors during pregnancy. Quantitative trait locus analysis using N2 backcross progeny revealed two significant loci on chromosome 8: D8Mit343-D8Mit312 for the number of OMCs and D8Mit86-D8Mit89 for their distribution, designated as mast cell in the ovary of MRL/MpJ 1 (mcom1) and mcom2, respectively. Among MC migration-associated genes, ovarian expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 at mcom1 locus was significantly higher in MRL/MpJ than in C57BL/6N, and positively correlated with the expression of OMC marker genes. These results indicate that the appearance of neonatal OMCs in MRL/MpJ is controlled by environmental factors and filial genetic factors, and that the abundance and distribution of OMCs are regulated by independent filial genetic elements."
