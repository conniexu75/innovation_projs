https://openalex.org/W2560760305,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves substantial genetic contributions. These contributions are profoundly heterogeneous but may converge on common pathways that are not yet well understood. Here, through post-mortem genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the largest cohort of samples analysed so far, to our knowledge, we interrogate the noncoding transcriptome, alternative splicing, and upstream molecular regulators to broaden our understanding of molecular convergence in ASD. Our analysis reveals ASD-associated dysregulation of primate-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), downregulation of the alternative splicing of activity-dependent neuron-specific exons, and attenuation of normal differences in gene expression between the frontal and temporal lobes. Our data suggest that SOX5, a transcription factor involved in neuron fate specification, contributes to this reduction in regional differences. We further demonstrate that a genetically defined subtype of ASD, chromosome 15q11.2-13.1 duplication syndrome (dup15q), shares the core transcriptomic signature observed in idiopathic ASD. Co-expression network analysis reveals that individuals with ASD show age-related changes in the trajectory of microglial and synaptic function over the first two decades, and suggests that genetic risk for ASD may influence changes in regional cortical gene expression. Our findings illustrate how diverse genetic perturbations can lead to phenotypic convergence at multiple biological levels in a complex neuropsychiatric disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2558981096,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) and is decoded by YTH domain proteins. The mammalian mRNA m6A methylosome is a complex of nuclear proteins that includes METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, WTAP (Wilms tumour 1-associated protein) and KIAA1429. Drosophila has corresponding homologues named Ime4 and KAR4 (Inducer of meiosis 4 and Karyogamy protein 4), and Female-lethal (2)d (Fl(2)d) and Virilizer (Vir). In Drosophila, fl(2)d and vir are required for sex-dependent regulation of alternative splicing of the sex determination factor Sex lethal (Sxl). However, the functions of m6A in introns in the regulation of alternative splicing remain uncertain. Here we show that m6A is absent in the mRNA of Drosophila lacking Ime4. In contrast to mouse and plant knockout models, Drosophila Ime4-null mutants remain viable, though flightless, and show a sex bias towards maleness. This is because m6A is required for female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, which determines female physiognomy, but also translationally represses male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) to prevent dosage compensation in females. We further show that the m6A reader protein YT521-B decodes m6A in the sex-specifically spliced intron of Sxl, as its absence phenocopies Ime4 mutants. Loss of m6A also affects alternative splicing of additional genes, predominantly in the 5' untranslated region, and has global effects on the expression of metabolic genes. The requirement of m6A and its reader YT521-B for female-specific Sxl alternative splicing reveals that this hitherto enigmatic mRNA modification constitutes an ancient and specific mechanism to adjust levels of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2558519551,"Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in β-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local (α)-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing β-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in α-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on β-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in β-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local α-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the α-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the β-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification."
https://openalex.org/W2560723481,"A quantum spin liquid is an exotic quantum state of matter in which spins are highly entangled and remain disordered down to zero temperature. Such a state of matter is potentially relevant to high-temperature superconductivity and quantum-information applications, and experimental identification of a quantum spin liquid state is of fundamental importance for our understanding of quantum matter. Theoretical studies have proposed various quantum-spin-liquid ground states, most of which are characterized by exotic spin excitations with fractional quantum numbers (termed `spinon'). Here, we report neutron scattering measurements that reveal broad spin excitations covering a wide region of the Brillouin zone in a triangular antiferromagnet YbMgGaO4. The observed diffusive spin excitation persists at the lowest measured energy and shows a clear upper excitation edge, which is consistent with the particle-hole excitation of a spinon Fermi surface. Our results therefore point to a QSL state with a spinon Fermi surface in YbMgGaO4 that has a perfect spin-1/2 triangular lattice as in the original proposal of quantum spin liquids."
https://openalex.org/W2558936320,"Maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations can cause fatal or severely debilitating syndromes in children, with disease severity dependent on the specific gene mutation and the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy) in each cell and tissue. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are relatively common, with an estimated 778 affected children born each year in the United States. Mitochondrial replacement therapies or techniques (MRT) circumventing mother-to-child mtDNA disease transmission involve replacement of oocyte maternal mtDNA. Here we report MRT outcomes in several families with common mtDNA syndromes. The mother's oocytes were of normal quality and mutation levels correlated with those in existing children. Efficient replacement of oocyte mutant mtDNA was performed by spindle transfer, resulting in embryos containing >99% donor mtDNA. Donor mtDNA was stably maintained in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) derived from most embryos. However, some ES cell lines demonstrated gradual loss of donor mtDNA and reversal to the maternal haplotype. In evaluating donor-to-maternal mtDNA interactions, it seems that compatibility relates to mtDNA replication efficiency rather than to mismatch or oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. We identify a polymorphism within the conserved sequence box II region of the D-loop as a plausible cause of preferential replication of specific mtDNA haplotypes. In addition, some haplotypes confer proliferative and growth advantages to cells. Hence, we propose a matching paradigm for selecting compatible donor mtDNA for MRT."

https://openalex.org/W2560791640,"The internal mechanics of proteins-the coordinated motions of amino acids and the pattern of forces constraining these motions-connects protein structure to function. Here we describe a new method combining the application of strong electric field pulses to protein crystals with time-resolved X-ray crystallography to observe conformational changes in spatial and temporal detail. Using a human PDZ domain (LNX2PDZ2) as a model system, we show that protein crystals tolerate electric field pulses strong enough to drive concerted motions on the sub-microsecond timescale. The induced motions are subtle, involve diverse physical mechanisms, and occur throughout the protein structure. The global pattern of electric-field-induced motions is consistent with both local and allosteric conformational changes naturally induced by ligand binding, including at conserved functional sites in the PDZ domain family. This work lays the foundation for comprehensive experimental study of the mechanical basis of protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2560019178,"Precursor mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans and defects in global pre-mRNA splicing associated with age are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1. The collapse of protein homeostasis and increasing error rates in transcription are key risk factors for various chronic diseases, and are associated with ageing. William Mair and colleagues demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans, and that defects in global pre-mRNA splicing associated with age are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1). SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension both by dietary restriction, and modulation of TORC1 pathway components. Overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan. This work suggests that modulation of specific spliceosome components can promote healthy ageing. Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis1,2,3 and is the key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses4,5. However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in dietary restriction longevity and suggest that modulation of specific spliceosome components may prolong healthy ageing."

Here we discuss the main advantages and limitations of iPSC modeling, and how the method intersects with other patient-derived models of cancer, such as organoids, organs-on-chips and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).

https://openalex.org/W2559565289,"Complex biological processes are often performed by self-organizing nanostructures comprising multiple classes of macromolecules, such as ribosomes (proteins and RNA) or enveloped viruses (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids). Approaches have been developed for designing self-assembling structures consisting of either nucleic acids or proteins, but strategies for engineering hybrid biological materials are only beginning to emerge. Here we describe the design of self-assembling protein nanocages that direct their own release from human cells inside small vesicles in a manner that resembles some viruses. We refer to these hybrid biomaterials as 'enveloped protein nanocages' (EPNs). Robust EPN biogenesis requires protein sequence elements that encode three distinct functions: membrane binding, self-assembly, and recruitment of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. A variety of synthetic proteins with these functional elements induce EPN biogenesis, highlighting the modularity and generality of the design strategy. Biochemical analyses and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that one design, EPN-01, comprises small (~100 nm) vesicles containing multiple protein nanocages that closely match the structure of the designed 60-subunit self-assembling scaffold. EPNs that incorporate the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein can fuse with target cells and deliver their contents, thereby transferring cargoes from one cell to another. These results show how proteins can be programmed to direct the formation of hybrid biological materials that perform complex tasks, and establish EPNs as a class of designed, modular, genetically-encoded nanomaterials that can transfer molecules between cells."
https://openalex.org/W2559087576,"The functionality of stem cells declines during ageing, and this decline contributes to ageing-associated impairments in tissue regeneration and function. Alterations in developmental pathways have been associated with declines in stem-cell function during ageing, but the nature of this process remains poorly understood. Hox genes are key regulators of stem cells and tissue patterning during embryogenesis with an unknown role in ageing. Here we show that the epigenetic stress response in muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells) differs between aged and young mice. The alteration includes aberrant global and site-specific induction of active chromatin marks in activated satellite cells from aged mice, resulting in the specific induction of Hoxa9 but not other Hox genes. Hoxa9 in turn activates several developmental pathways and represents a decisive factor that separates satellite cell gene expression in aged mice from that in young mice. The activated pathways include most of the currently known inhibitors of satellite cell function in ageing muscle, including Wnt, TGFβ, JAK/STAT and senescence signalling. Inhibition of aberrant chromatin activation or deletion of Hoxa9 improves satellite cell function and muscle regeneration in aged mice, whereas overexpression of Hoxa9 mimics ageing-associated defects in satellite cells from young mice, which can be rescued by the inhibition of Hoxa9-targeted developmental pathways. Together, these data delineate an altered epigenetic stress response in activated satellite cells from aged mice, which limits satellite cell function and muscle regeneration by Hoxa9-dependent activation of developmental pathways."

CPPs can also theoretically be used to modulate intracellular processes. However, their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation often limits their utility in these applications. Previous studies have explored the consequences for cellular uptake of converting the residues in CPPs from l- to d-stereochemistry, but conflicting results have been reported and specific steps en route to intracellular activity have not been explored. Here we use dimeric fluorescence TAT as a model CPP to explore the broader consequences of l- to d-stereochemical conversion. We show that inversion of chirality provides protease resistance without altering the overall mode of cellular entry, a process involving endocytic uptake followed by endosomal escape and cytosolic access. However, whereas inversion of chirality reduces endocytic uptake, the d-peptide, once in the endosome, is significantly more prone to escape than its l-counterpart. Moreover, the d-peptide is retained in the cytosol of cells for several days, whereas the l-peptide is degraded within hours. Notably, while the l-peptide is relatively innocuous to cells, the d-peptide exerts a prolonged anti-proliferative activity.

Instead of crossing the plasma membrane directly, certain CPPs are first internalized by endocytosis and accumulate inside endosomes. In a second step, CPPs escape from endosomes to penetrate the cytosolic space (22Erazo-Oliveras A. Muthukrishnan N. Baker R. Wang T.Y. Pellois J.P.

The effect of chirality on endocytosis has been reported for the CPPs R9, penetratin, and hLF. Preferential uptake of l-CPPs over d-CPPs was observed, suggesting that chirality is important for the interactions between these compounds and cell surface partners that induce endocytosis (24Verdurmen W.P.

Together, these studies reveal conflicting results that highlight how l- to d-amino acid conversion may lead to CPP-dependent results. To date, several questions related to the effect of chirality on CPPs' activities remain unanswered. In particular, how chirality impacts endosomal escape during the cell penetration process and how an unnatural d-CPP affects cell physiology once inside a cell are still unclear (25Tünnemann G. Ter-Avetisyan G. Martin R.M. Stöckl M. Herrmann A. Cardoso M.C. Live-cell analysis of cell penetration ability and toxicity of oligo-arginines.J. Pept. Sci. 2008; 14: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The issue of endosomal escape is important because this step is critical for the successful delivery of molecules of interest into a cell (26Pan C. Lu B. Chen H. Bishop C. Reprogramming human fibroblasts using HIV-1 TAT recombinant proteins OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC.Mol. Biol. Rep. 2010; 37: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, the issue concerning the physiological impact of cell penetration is of significance when one considers, for instance, using cellular delivery protocols as a tool for cell biology and therapeutic applications (i.e. most applications would benefit from delivery protocols that only minimally disrupt cells). In this report, we address these questions by using dimeric fluorescent TAT (dfTAT) as a model CPP. dfTAT is a disulfide-bonded dimer of the prototypical CPP TAT. dfTAT is capable of escaping from endosomes with extremely high efficiency (27Erazo-Oliveras A.

For instance, whereas TAT escapes endosomes with an estimated efficiency of <1% (i.e. 1% of peptide present in a cell reaches the cytosol, whereas 99% remains trapped inside endosomes), the endosomal escape efficiency of dfTAT exceeds 90% (27Erazo-Oliveras A.

This egress appears to be mediated by the leaky fusion of late endosomal membranes and involves interactions between the positively charged CPP and the anionic lipid bis(monoacyl)glycerophosphate (BMP) (30Erazo-Oliveras A. Najjar K. Truong D. Wang T.Y. Brock D.J. Prater A.R. Pellois J.P.

Biol. 2016; 23: 598-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). From a delivery point of view, the mode of cell penetration by dfTAT is useful because macromolecules, endocytosed along with dfTAT after co-incubation with cells, can also be released into the cytosol of cells (i.e. by leaking out of late endosomes along with the endosomolytic CPP). This approach has been used to deliver an enzyme, a transcription factor, peptides, and cell-impermeable small molecules with high efficiencies (27Erazo-Oliveras A. Najjar K. Dayani L. Wang T.-Y. Johnson G.A. Pellois J.-P. Protein delivery into live cells by incubation with an endosomolytic agent.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 861-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the leakage induced by dfTAT appears to be relatively innocuous to cells because dfTAT-mediated delivery does not lead to changes in cellular proliferation or transcriptional responses. dfTAT therefore represents a CPP with desirable properties and with an activity sufficiently high to enable mechanistic studies. Herein, we investigate the cell penetration of a d-amino acid analog of dfTAT to establish the impact of chirality on cytosolic access. We establish that an l- to d-amino acid substitution, by inhibiting peptide degradation from endocytic proteases, promotes enhanced endosomal escape activity. We also establish that the d-CPP, after successful cytosolic entry, gives rise to perturbations in proliferation and transcription more severe than l-CPP. This can be attributed to the prolonged intracellular retention of the d-peptide. Therefore, for the first time, we report on an anti-proliferative effect of a d-CPP and reveal additional advantages and disadvantages inherent to conferring protease resistance to an endosomolytic agent. We envision that these findings are relevant to other cell-permeable molecules (e.g. stapled peptides, peptoids, CPPs, etc.), in particular those that, like dfTAT, have high arginine residue content. dfTAT (i.e. l-dfTAT) and d-dfTAT were prepared by synthesis of the peptide CK(TMR)RKKRRQRRRG or ck(TMR)rkkrrqrrrG, respectively, on solid phase followed by disulfide bond formation of the cysteine residue in solution (Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). TMR is the red fluorophore carboxytetramethylrhodamine. To confirm that the incorporation of d-amino acids confers protease resistance to d-dfTAT, the peptide was exposed to trypsin in vitro. Consistent with the high Arg and Lys content of the TAT sequence, the parent compound dfTAT was degraded by trypsin within minutes, as evidenced by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1B). In contrast, d-dfTAT remained intact for the duration of the experiment (48 h). To determine whether the cell penetration activity of dfTAT is retained after a l- to d-amino acid substitution, HeLa and human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells were incubated with 1 or 5 μm dfTAT or d-dfTAT for 1 h and examined by fluorescence microscopy. At 1 μm, both peptides show a punctate distribution indicative of endosomal entrapment (as previously reported for dfTAT). In contrast, at 5 μm peptide incubation, cells displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescent signal accompanied with a nucleolar staining observable immediately after incubation (Fig. 1C). These fluorescence stainings are consistent with successful entry of each peptide into the cell’s cytosolic space because cytosolic entry presumably precedes targeting to nucleoli (27Erazo-Oliveras A.

In addition, the fluorescence signal of d-dfTAT was low in the nucleus (apart from the nucleoli), and a sharp contrast was observed with the cytoplasmic/nucleolar signal. The fluorescence staining of cells was monitored for 24 h to establish how the fluorescence signal of each peptide changes overtime (Fig. 1D). The nucleolar staining of dfTAT disappeared within 2 h. The diffuse signal of dfTAT also progressively disappeared over time and was replaced by a punctate distribution in less than 24 h (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the fluorescence signal of d-dfTAT remained unchanged, and a strong nucleolar staining was retained throughout the duration of the experiment (Fig. 1D). To assess the stability of each peptide in cellulo, an analysis of cellular extracts was performed using gel electrophoresis. A high percentage acrylamide gel was used to separate the full-length peptides from smaller degradation fragments (the peptides are reduced with DTT to simplify the analysis; consequently, the monomeric peptides fTAT and d-fTAT are detected in this assay). The fluorescence signal of TMR, a moiety presumably not readily degradable by cells, was used to detect all of the species generated upon cellular exposure. Cells were incubated with dfTAT or d-dfTAT (5 μm) for 1 h, washed, and incubated with fresh medium (medium not containing peptide) for up to 24 h. Incubation medium and cell lysates were extracted at various time points. The samples recovered from the medium immediately after incubation of cells with dfTAT and d-dfTAT display a single species comparable in size with that of the pure control peptide fTAT (reduced dfTAT) (Fig. 1E). The cell lysates obtained from cells incubated with d-dfTAT show a similar band, independent of incubation time. In contrast, the lysates of cells incubated with dfTAT for 1 h show a band corresponding to fTAT and a smear corresponding to smaller degradation species. Analysis of the band intensities by densitometry shows that ∼25% of the peptide is intact, whereas 75% is degraded. This ratio remains relatively unchanged after an additional 1 and 3 h of incubation in fresh medium. However, the band corresponding to fTAT is not present anymore at the 24 h time point. Overall, these data indicate that dfTAT is rapidly degraded during incubation with cells and during the delivery process. The degradation of dfTAT continues after cellular penetration but on a slower time scale. In contrast, d-dfTAT resists degradation throughout the duration of the experiment. The utility of dfTAT is based on the fact that this reagent renders endosomes leaky and that, consequently, it can mediate the efficient cytosolic delivery of macromolecules into live cells by a simple co-incubation protocol (27Erazo-Oliveras A. Najjar K. Dayani L. Wang T.-Y. Johnson G.A. Pellois J.-P. Protein delivery into live cells by incubation with an endosomolytic agent.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 861-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether d-dfTAT displays a similar activity, a Cre recombinase delivery assay was performed. In this assay, successful nuclear delivery of Cre recombinase (38 kDa) results in the expression of an EGFP reporter. We used TAT-Cre, a Cre recombinase fused to the protein transduction domain (PTD) TAT. TAT-Cre has previously been shown to enter cells, and we therefore used this reagent to assess how dfTAT-mediated delivery compares with the commonly used PTD approach (33Peitz M. Pfannkuche K. Rajewsky K. Edenhofer F. Ability of the hydrophobic FGF and basic TAT peptides to promote cellular uptake of recombinant Cre recombinase: a tool for efficient genetic engineering of mammalian genomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4489-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation of cells with TAT-Cre led to expression of EGFP in ∼10% of the cell population. In contrast, the addition of 5 μm dfTAT or d-dfTAT peptide during incubation led to >70% of cells positive for EGFP expression. These data suggest that both dfTAT and d-dfTAT are capable of delivering a macromolecule inside the cytosol and nucleus of live cells at a level superior to that observed with a PTD fusion alone. dfTAT penetrates the cytosol of cells by escaping from late endosomes via interactions with the lipid BMP (30Erazo-Oliveras A. Najjar K. Truong D. Wang T.Y. Brock D.J. Prater A.R. Pellois J.P.

Biol. 2016; 23: 598-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To examine whether d-dfTAT follows the same route for cellular entry, d-dfTAT was incubated with cells transfected with a dominant negative Rab7 (DN-Rab7), a construct known to block endocytic trafficking between early and late endosomes (34Colpitts T.M. Moore A.C. Kolokoltsov A.A. Davey R.A.

Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Rab7: a key to lysosome biogenesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The effect of Rab7 and DN-Rab7 on peptide endocytic uptake was established by measuring the overall fluorescence of cell lysates. The cytosolic penetration activity of d-dfTAT was established by counting the number of cells displaying a distinct nucleolar staining by the peptide. Notably, this assay does not directly measure how much peptide remains trapped inside endosomes versus how much escapes endosomes. Instead, it is a binary assay that establishes whether or not endosomal leakage is achieved above a detection threshold determined by our fluorescence microscopy set-up. As observed previously with dfTAT, the overall endocytic uptake of d-dfTAT was not significantly altered by overexpression of the Rab7 constructs, indicating that DN-Rab7 does not prevent d-dfTAT from accumulating inside endosomes. However, DN-Rab7 inhibited cytosolic penetration of d-dfTAT, whereas wild type did not (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that DN-Rab7 blocks the endosomal escape of d-dfTAT and that, consequently, d-dfTAT escapes from endocytic organelles that are downstream of early endosomes in the endocytic pathway. In addition, to further test the involvement of endocytic trafficking in cell penetration, cells were preincubated with anti-BMP (50 μg/ml), an antibody previously shown to block membrane fusion within late endosomes (36Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

Localization of lysobisphosphatidic acid-rich membrane domains in late endosomes.Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As in the case of DN-Rab-7, the cell penetration of dfTAT and d-dfTAT was inhibited by this treatment to a similar extent (supplemental Fig. S3). Overall, these data support the model that both dfTAT and d-dfTAT reach the cytosol by an endocytic route in a majority of cells. It is important to note that penetration persisted in ∼5% of cells in the presence of DN-Rab7 or anti-BMP. On one hand, it is possible that the inhibitors did not work effectively in these cells (i.e. maybe because of low expression, degradation, etc.). On the other hand, these results may suggest that a secondary route of entry (e.g. direct plasma membrane translocation) is also plausible, albeit much less predominant than endosomal escape. In principle, the previous results indicate that the escape of the peptide from either late endosomes or lysosomes is possible (39Piper R.C. Katzmann D.J. Biogenesis and function of multivesicular bodies.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 519-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In the case of dfTAT, we have previously ruled out the involvement of lysosomes by establishing that dfTAT does not release material loaded inside lysosomes (30Erazo-Oliveras A. Najjar K. Truong D. Wang T.Y. Brock D.J. Prater A.R. Pellois J.P. The late endosome and its lipid BMP act as gateways for efficient cytosolic access of the delivery agent dfTAT and its macromolecular cargos.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 598-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), yet d-dfTAT might differ significantly from dfTAT in this instance. In particular, one can envision how dfTAT might be rendered inactive inside lysosomes because it is extensively degraded. In contrast, by being protease-resistant, d-dfTAT could remain membrane-disrupting in this milieu. To test this idea, the endosomes of HeLa cells were preloaded with DEAC-k5, a fluorescent and protease-resistant polylysine peptide (supplemental Fig. S4). As shown in experiment 1 (exp 1) of Fig. 2C, endosomes loaded with DEAC-k5 are observed by fluorescence microscopy as puncta insid"

Field potential recordings were obtained from commercially available hiPSC-CMs using multi-electrode array (MEA) platform with and without ion channel antagonists in the recording solution. Under control conditions, MEA-measured interspike interval and field potential duration (FPD) ranged widely from 1049 to 1635 ms and from 334 to 527 ms, respectively and provided positive linear regression coefficients similar to native QT-RR plots obtained from human electrocardiogram (ECG) analyses in the ongoing cardiovascular-based Framingham Heart Study. Similar to minimizing the effect of heart rate on the QT interval, Fridericia’s and Bazett’s corrections reduced the influence of beat rate on hiPSC-CM FPD. In the presence of E-4031 and cisapride, inhibitors of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current, hiPSC-CMs showed reverse use-dependent FPD prolongation. Categorical analysis, which is usually applied to clinical QT studies, was applicable to hiPSC-CMs for evaluating torsadogenic risks with FPD and/or corrected FPD. Together, this results of this study links hiPSC-CM electrophysiological endpoints to native ECG endpoints, demonstrates the appropriateness of clinical analytical practices as applied to hiPSC-CMs, and suggests that hiPSC-CMs are a reliable models for assessing the arrhythmogenic potential of drug candidates in human."

Nitro-conjugated linoleic acid (NO2-CLA) is preferentially formed, constitutes the most abundant nitrated fatty acid in humans, and contains two carbons that could potentially react with thiols, modulating signaling actions and levels. In this work, we examined the reactions of NO2-CLA with low molecular weight thiols (glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine, cysteinylglycine, and β-mercaptoethanol) and human serum albumin. Reactions followed reversible biphasic kinetics, consistent with the presence of two electrophilic centers in NO2-CLA located on the β- and δ-carbons with respect to the nitro group. The differential reactivity was confirmed by computational modeling of the electronic structure. The rates (kon and koff) and equilibrium constants for both reactions were determined for different thiols. LC-UV-Visible and LC-MS analyses showed that the fast reaction corresponds to β-adduct formation (the kinetic product), while the slow reaction corresponds to the formation of the δ-adduct (the thermodynamic product). The pH dependence of the rate constants, the correlation between intrinsic reactivity and thiol pKa, and the absence of deuterium solvent kinetic isotope effects suggested stepwise mechanisms with thiolate attack on NO2-CLA as rate-controlling step. Computational modeling supported the mechanism and revealed additional features of the transition states, anionic intermediates, and final neutral products. Importantly, the detection of cysteine-δ-adducts in human urine provided evidence for the biological relevance of this reaction. Finally, human serum albumin was found to bind NO2-CLA both non-covalently and to form covalent adducts at Cys-34, suggesting potential modes for systemic distribution.

Thiols are excellent nucleophiles and are able to react with different electrophiles, including oxidants. This property constitutes the basis of the fundamental roles of particular thiols in signaling, detoxification, and antioxidant response processes.

The intracellular compartment presents an elevated concentration of reduced thiols.

Importantly, in the case of NO2-CLA, both the β- and δ-carbons with respect to the nitro group are, in principle, electrophilic and thus susceptible to reaction with nucleophiles. Herein, we provide an experimental and computational study of the reaction of NO2-CLA, the most abundant endogenous nitroalkene, with biological thiols. We found that two reversible products are formed, the β-adducts and the δ-adducts. The β-adducts are formed with faster kinetics, but the δ-adducts are more stable. The reaction mechanisms are stepwise, with thiolate attack on the nitroalkene being the rate-controlling step. In addition, HSA is able to bind NO2-CLA non-covalently. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical basis of the signaling and pharmacological actions of nitroalkene fatty acids. Stopped-flow mixing of a solution consisting of 9- and 12-NO2-CLA (Fig. 1A) with excess GSH led to a reduction in absorbance at 330 nm, consistent with loss of double bond conjugation. The decrease was biexponential and included a fast phase that lasted ∼0.5 min followed by a second phase that was slower by a factor of ∼30 (Fig. 1B). No significant changes in absorbance occurred in the absence of thiols. Although the NO2-CLA stock contains an ∼1:1 mixture of the positional isomers 9- and 12-NO2-CLA, the existence of two phases could not be explained by a differential reactivity of the isomers, as purified 9- and 12-NO2-CLA yielded comparable biphasic kinetics (Fig. 1B, inset). In contrast, the reaction with the monounsaturated derivative nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA), which has only one electrophilic site, was monophasic (Fig. 1C) (29Baker L.M. Baker P.R. Golin-Bisello F. Schopfer F.J. Fink M. Woodcock S.R. Branchaud B.P. Radi R. Freeman B.A. Nitro-fatty acid reaction with glutathione and cysteine. Kinetic analysis of thiol alkylation by a Michael addition reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31085-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When NO2-CLA was mixed with the yellow thiol thionitrobenzoate (TNB), which allows us to follow changes in thiol concentration due to its absorbance at 412 nm, the kinetics were also biphasic, confirming that thiol consumption occurred in both phases (Fig. 1D). Regarding the concentration dependence of the reaction between NO2-CLA and excess GSH, a linear dependence with a non-zero y axis intercept was observed between the pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) of the fast phase and GSH concentration (Fig. 1E), while a hyperbolic dependence with a non-zero intercept was observed for the slow phase (Fig. 1F). Taken together, the kinetic results are consistent with two parallel and reversible processes involving two non-equivalent electrophilic centers in NO2-CLA. These centers react with thiols forming two products that we hypothesize are the β- and the δ-adducts as shown in to Scheme 1, where konβ and konδ are second-order rate constants at pH 7.4 for the forward addition reaction of the fast and slow processes, respectively, and koffβ and koffδ correspond to first-order rate constants for the reverse elimination reactions. 6konβ and konδ are konβ, pH 7.4 and konδ, pH 7.4, the apparent rate constants at pH 7.4. The same applies to koffβ and koffδ. The notation was simplified for clarity. The coupled differential equations derived from Scheme 1 can be solved in matrix form yielding complex biexponential concentration functions. The relation of the exponential constants kobs with the rate constants and concentrations is simplified when one phase is faster than the other (30Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1999: 150-153Google Scholar, 31Fierke C.A. Hammes G.G. Transient kinetic approaches to enzyme mechanisms.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 3-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this case, the larger exponential constant, kobs(fast), increases linearly with thiol concentration according to Equation 1 (Fig. 1E). kobs(fast)=konβ[thiol]+koffβ(Eq. 1) For GSH reactions, konβ = 34 ± 4 m−1 s−1 was determined from the slope of the plot, whereas koffβ = 0.10 ± 0.02 s−1 was obtained from the y axis intercept. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Keqβ) was calculated by dividing koffβ by konβ and its value was (2.8 ± 0.9) × 10−3 m (25 °C, pH 7.4). The smaller exponential constant, kobs(slow), is given by the sum of the forward and reverse effective rate constants, where the former is konδ [thiol] multiplied by the fraction of free NO2-CLA, and it increases hyperbolically with thiol concentration according to Equation 2 (Fig. 1F). kobs(slow)=konδKeqβ[thiol]Keqβ[thiol]+koffδ(Eq. 2) From fits to this equation, the konδ for the reaction with GSH was determined to be 3.5 ± 0.5 m−1 s−1 whereas Keqβ was (3.0 ± 0.2) × 10−3 m, in excellent agreement with the value determined from the fast phase. The koffδ was obtained using data at relatively low thiol concentrations and was (3 ± 1) × 10−4 s−1. The Keqδ was (9 ± 4) × 10−5 m. Similar determinations were carried out for cysteine, homocysteine, cysteinylglycine, and β-mercaptoethanol (BME), and the rate and equilibrium constants are shown in Table 1. The rate constants were higher for the presumed β-adducts in all cases. The equilibrium constants were lower by factors of 20–65 for the δ-adducts, reflecting higher stability. It is worth mentioning that at higher cysteine concentrations (30 mm) a third slow phase became evident (kobs = (1.33 ± 0.01) × 10−3 s−1), which was not further characterized. No reaction was observed with histidine (≤40 mm), suggesting that additions of α-amino and imidazole groups were not significant, consistent with nitrogenous bases being weaker nucleophiles toward Michael acceptors than thiolates (23Bernasconi C.F.

Open table in a new tab The electrophilic Fukui f+(r) function, which measures the propensity of NO2-CLA to gain electron density in a nucleophilic attack, is shown in Fig. 2, mapped on a total electronic density isosurface calculated at the PCM-DFT level in aqueous solution. Two well defined and distinct soft electrophilic regions (Fig. 2, depicted in blue) involving the Cβ and Cδ centers are found in both isomers. Whereas the region around Cβ appears extended over the molecular surface and connected to the electrophilic nitro group envelope, the region enclosing Cδ is considerably smaller. These features would make Cβ more prone to nucleophilic attack by thiols. Atomic softness data calculated from global softness and condensed Fukui fA+ (Table 2) completes the picture enabling a quantitative comparison, showing that Cβ is significantly softer than Cδ, establishing the non-equivalency of the electrophilic Cβ and Cδ centers and contributing to consolidate the hypothesis of their association with the fast and slow reactions, respectively.TABLE 2Atomic softness sA+ for the carbon centers in the conjugated nitroalkene moieties embedded in each NO2-CLA regioisomer (in au)RegioisomerCarbon centerCαCβCγCδ9-NO2-CLA−0.0360.684−0.1130.46212-NO2-CLA−0.0290.6990.1170.523 Open table in a new tab To define the products generated in each phase of the reaction, spectrophotometric, LC-UV-Visible, and LC-MS/MS experiments were performed. First, the time course of the reaction with GSH was followed at three different wavelengths. During the fast phase, the decrease in absorbance at 330 nm correlated with an increase at 250 nm, although no changes were observed at 290 nm. In the slow phase, however, the decrease at 330 nm correlated with an increase at 290 nm (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the product formed during the slow reaction contains an intact nitroalkene moiety due to thiol addition at the δ-carbon (29Baker L.M. Baker P.R. Golin-Bisello F.

https://openalex.org/W2560338897,"Lin28 RNA-binding proteins play important roles in pluripotent stem cells, but the regulation of their expression and the mechanisms underlying their functions are still not definitively understood. Here we address the above-mentioned issues in the first steps of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. We observed that the expression of Lin28 genes is transiently induced soon after the exit of ESCs from the naive ground state and that this induction is due to the Hmga2-dependent engagement of Otx2 with enhancers present at both Lin28 gene loci. These mechanisms are crucial for Lin28 regulation, as demonstrated by the abolishment of the Lin28 accumulation in Otx2-or Hmga2-knockout cells compared to the control cells. We have also found that Lin28 controls Hmga2 expression levels during ESC differentiation through a let-7-independent mechanism. Indeed, we found that Lin28 proteins bind a highly conserved element in the 3′ UTR of Hmga2 mRNA, and this provokes a down-regulation of its translation. This mechanism prevents the inappropriate accumulation of Hmga2 that would modify the proliferation and physiological apoptosis of differentiating ESCs. In summary, we demonstrated that during ESC differentiation, Lin28 transient induction is dependent on Otx2 and Hmga2 and prevents an inappropriate excessive rise of Hmga2 levels.—Parisi, S., Passaro, F., Russo, L., Musto, A., Navarra, A., Romano, S., Petrosino, G., Russo, T.

The multifunctional fibrillar adhesin CshA, which mediates binding to both host molecules and other microorganisms, is an important determinant of colonization by Streptococcus gordonii, an oral commensal and opportunistic pathogen of animals and humans. CshA binds the high-molecular-weight glycoprotein fibronectin (Fn) via an N-terminal non-repetitive region, and this protein-protein interaction has been proposed to promote S. gordonii colonization at multiple sites within the host. However, the molecular details of how these two proteins interact have yet to be established. Here we present a structural description of the Fn binding N-terminal region of CshA, derived from a combination of X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, and complementary biophysical methods. In vitro binding studies support a previously unreported two-state “catch-clamp” mechanism of Fn binding by CshA, in which the disordered N-terminal domain of CshA acts to “catch” Fn, via formation of a rapidly assembled but also readily dissociable pre-complex, enabling its neighboring ligand binding domain to tightly clamp the two polypeptides together.

The adherence of bacteria to material and host cell surfaces is essential for colonization, persistence, and pathogenicity. This process is facilitated by bacterial cell-surface components termed adhesins, which recognize and bind specific partner molecules presented on the surfaces of host cells and other microorganisms (1Kline K.A.

The filamentous adhesins, comprising pili and fibrils, are among the largest and most complex of all bacterial surface proteins. They are found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including many pathogenic species, and have attracted considerable attention due to their roles in colonization, infection, and as vaccine candidates (2Demuyser L.

Characteristically, these proteins form sizable polymeric assemblies that project outwards from the bacterial cell surface, presenting an adhesive target-binding region at their tip. Fibrillar adhesins are expressed by a wide variety of bacteria and display an extraordinarily diverse array of adhesive functions. In contrast to the extensively studied pili, much still remains to be learned about the structures and functions of these proteins. Fibrillar adhesins usually include a single multidomain polypeptide chain, covalently tethered to the bacterial cell wall (1Kline K.A. Fälker S. Dahlberg S. Normark S. Henriques-Normark B.

Streptococcus gordonii, a primary colonizer of the human oral cavity and an opportunistic pathogen, has been shown to present a number of fibrillar adhesins on its surface, including the polypeptide CshA.

CshA has been shown to bind the high molecular weight glycoprotein fibronectin (Fn) via an interaction that is mediated by the N-terminal non-repetitive region of the protein (7Jakubovics N.S.

Despite the importance of CshA, little is known about the molecular structure and function of this protein. Such information would provide fundamental mechanistic insight and may inform the development of anti-adhesive agents that target S. gordonii and related streptococci. Here we report a structural and functional description of the non-repetitive Fn-binding region of CshA. We reveal that this part of the polypeptide is composed of three distinct domains, designated herein as non-repetitive domain 1 (NR1, CshA(42–222)), non-repetitive domain 2 (NR2, CshA(223–540)), and non-repetitive domain 3 (NR3, CshA(582–814)). In vitro Fn binding assays of truncated CshA proteins heterologously expressed on the surface of the non-adherent bacterium Lactococcus lactis demonstrate that both NR1 and NR2, but not NR3, confer adhesive properties to CshA. Biolayer interferometry analysis of Fn binding by the recombinant CshA NR domains reveals that NR2 binds both cellular and plasma fibronectin with significantly lower ka, kd, and KD values than NR1. Using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and allied biophysical methods, NR1 is shown to constitute a discrete intrinsically disordered domain (IDD). The crystal structure of NR2 is also presented, which adopts a lectin-like fold with a clearly identifiable ligand-binding site. Together, our data are consistent with a two-state mechanism of Fn binding by CshA, where NR1 functions to recognize and bind Fn, forming a dissociable pre-complex, which is subsequently stabilized by a high affinity binding interaction mediated by NR2. This “catch-clamp” mechanism of Fn binding may be of general significance in other bacterial adhesins that contain intrinsically disordered domains. CshA has previously been shown to comprise four distinct regions as follows: an N-terminal signal peptide; a >80-kDa non-repetitive region; 17 ∼100-aa residue repeat domains, and a C-terminal cell wall anchor. In an effort to provide a more detailed description of the domain architecture of CshA, the sequence of this polypeptide was subjected to comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. Predictions of secondary and tertiary structure, disorder content, domain composition, and homology modeling of selected regions of the protein were performed. Our reassigned CshA domain composition is summarized in Fig. 1. The most significant consequence was assignment of the non-repetitive region of CshA into three distinct domains, designated NR1 (CshA(42–222)), NR2 (CshA(223–540)), and NR3 CshA(582–814)). In previous studies, CshA has been shown to promote adherence by S. gordonii DL1 to the extracellular matrix protein Fn, an interaction mediated by the non-repetitive region of the protein (7Jakubovics N.S. Brittan J.L. Dutton L.C. Jenkinson H.F.

McNab R. Jenkinson H.F. Candida albicans binding to the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii involves multiple adhesin-receptor interactions.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4680-4685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which of the NR domains of CshA contribute to Fn binding, full-length CshA (Fl_CshA) and two truncated forms of the protein, CshAΔNR1 and CshAΔNR1 + 2, were expressed on the surface of the non-adherent bacterium L. lactis. Genes encoding full-length CshA, CshAΔNR1, and CshAΔNR1 + 2 were cloned into the pMSP7517 shuttle vector (18Hirt H. Erlandsen S.L. Dunny G.M. Heterologous inducible expression of Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 aggregation substance Asc10 in Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii contributes to cell hydrophobicity and adhesion to fibrin.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and transformed into wild type L. lactis by electroporation. Constructs encoding the two CshA deletion mutants included the wild type CshA leader peptide sequence fused to their N termini to ensure efficient export from the cytoplasm. Levels of surface-expressed CshA polypeptides were determined by dot immunoblot analysis of S. gordonii DL1, L. lactis MG1363, and L. lactis strains expressing Fl_CshA, CshAΔNR1, or CshAΔNR1 + 2. Blots were probed with antibodies raised against the repetitive region of the protein (Fig. 2A). There was no reactivity of the CshA antiserum with the L. lactis MG1363 control. However, S. gordonii DL1 and each of the three L. lactis strains engineered to express CshA proteins presented the respective polypeptides on their surfaces. Variations in the levels of CshA surface expression were observed in each of the different strains, with Fl_CshA produced in a greater amount than CshAΔNR1 or CshAΔNR1 + 2 (Fig. 2A). To measure the relative binding properties of heterologously expressed Fl_CshA, CshAΔNR1, and CshAΔNR1 + 2, the ability of lactococci expressing each of these proteins to adhere to immobilized human cellular Fn (cFn) was assessed (Fig. 2B). Levels of adherence were compared with those of wild type S. gordonii DL1 and non-CshA-expressing L. lactis MG1363. Expression of full-length CshA on the surface of L. lactis conferred the ability to bind cFn. L. lactis cells expressing CshAΔNR1 were ∼2-fold more adherent to cFn than L. lactis::Fl_CshA, suggesting that exposure of NR2, by deletion of NR1, promotes target binding by CshA. L. lactis cells expressing CshAΔNR1 + 2 bound cFn at a level not significantly greater (as established by analysis of variance) than L. lactis MG1363, suggesting that the NR3 domain is dispensable for cFn binding. To further probe the Fn binding properties of CshA NR domains, each of NR1, NR2, and NR3 were recombinantly overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity (>95% purity). Recombinant NR2 was isolated as a mixture of monomeric (∼70% of total material) and dimeric (∼30% of total material) species that could be readily separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Concentration of monomeric NR2 by ultrafiltration failed to yield the dimeric species, suggesting that NR2 dimerization is concentration-independent. Given this, and the absence of any prior experimental evidence to support homodimerization of the CshA non-repetitive region (4McNab R. Forbes H. Handley P.S. Loach D.M. Tannock G.W. Jenkinson H.F.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), monomeric NR2 was taken to be the biologically relevant form of the protein and was used in all subsequent Fn binding studies. The kinetics of human cFn and plasma Fn (pFn) binding by recombinant CshA NR domains were determined by biolayer interferometry (Blitz, ForteBio). Both cFn and pFn were analyzed as they share many structural features and functional properties but are synthesized by different cell types and at different locations. Fn proteins were amide-coupled to the tip surface of amine-reactive second-generation (AR2G) biosensors (ForteBio) prior to analysis. Binding affinities were measured between each of the two Fn proteins and NR1, monomeric NR2, and NR3; the control proteins BSA and CshA repeat domain 13 (R13); and a commercially sourced anti-Fn antibody (Dao; Fig. 3). The R13 domain of CshA was chosen for analysis as unlike other repetitive domains of the polypeptide, recombinant protein could be readily produced in high quantity. Experimentally determined kinetic parameters for cFn and pFn binding are summarized in Table 1. Neither BSA nor CshA R13 bound either form of Fn. By contrast, the anti-Fn antibody bound both substrates with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) in the low micromolar range (Table 1). Recombinant NR1 bound both cFn and pFn with a KD value approximately twice that of the anti-Fn antibody. This confirms that NR1 binds cFn and pFn but with lower affinity than the anti-Fn antibody. NR2 was found to bind cFn and pFn with a >10- and >4-fold lower KD value, respectively, than NR1, and a >5- and >2-fold lower KD value, respectively, than the anti-Fn antibody. These data demonstrate that NR2 binds Fn with high affinity, an observation in keeping with our heterologous expression studies, where deletion of NR1 serves to promote adherence to cFn by L. lactis strains. Kinetic parameters for Fn binding by CshA NR1 and NR2 suggest that NR1 forms a rapidly assembled (higher ka) but readily dissociable (higher kd) complex with Fn, whereas substrate binding by NR2 occurs over a longer time scale (lower ka), yielding a less rapidly dissociating complex (lower kd). Although there is variation in the kinetic parameters of cFn and pFn binding by individual CshA domains, the relative binding properties of each domain are consistent irrespective of the form of Fn used. NR3 is found to bind both cFn and pFn weakly, confirming a negligible role in defining the adhesive properties of CshA.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of cFn and pFn binding by recombinant CshA domainsCshA domainKDkaka errorkdkd errorμmm−1s−1m−1s−1s−1s−1cFn binding NR15.263.1 × 1038.71 × 1011.63 × 10−29.21 × 10−4 NR20.51.38 × 1031.35 × 1016.89 × 10−41.05 × 10−5 NR312.58.05 × 1022.10 × 1011.00 × 10−21.34 × 10−4 Anti-Fn antibody1.946.29 × 1032.95 × 1021.22 × 10−23.61 × 10−4pFn binding NR13.459.07 × 1036.67 × 1023.13 × 10−39.11 × 10−4 NR20.852.77 × 1032.21 × 1012.36 × 10−32.61 × 10−5 NR39.421.33 × 1033.73 × 1011.27 × 10−22.31 × 10−4 Anti-Fn antibody1.777.09 × 1033.48 × 1021.25 × 10−24.06 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab Inspection of the aa sequence of the NR1 domain of CshA reveals that this protein is rich in disorder-promoting residues (10% Pro, 11% Glu, and 12% Ser) and deficient in order-promoting residues (<5% Ile and Leu, with no Cys, Phe, Trp, or Tyr). Analysis of the NR1 sequence using PONDR-FIT (19Xue B. Dunbrack R.L. Williams R.W. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. PONDR-FIT: A meta-predictor of intrinsically disordered amino acids.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 996-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) suggests that >95% of NR1 is structurally disordered (Fig. 4A). To determine whether NR1 is indeed an IDD, the protein was subjected to biophysical and hydrodynamic characterization. Recombinant NR1 displays aberrant migratory behavior when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, characteristic of intrinsic disorder (20Habchi J. Tompa P. Longhi S. Uversky V.N. Introducing protein intrinsic disorder.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 6561-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼37 kDa (Fig. 4B), although it possesses an experimentally verified mass of 20.8 kDa (including hexahistidine tag and linker; data not shown). Similarly, the CD spectrum of the protein is consistent with an absence of secondary structure, with a single minimum centered around 200 nm and no strong negative signals above 205 nm (Fig. 4C). Deconvolution of this spectrum employing the CDSSTR algorithm (21Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy: Methods and reference databases.Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) and reference sets 6 and 7 (22Compton L.A.

Variable selection method improves the prediction of protein secondary structure from circular-dichroism spectra.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) gives a predicted disorder content of 79–81%. To further investigate the structure of NR1, this protein was analyzed by SAXS, a technique that is widely recognized as indispensable for the assignment and characterization of IDDs (24Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. Structural characterization of flexible proteins using small-angle X-ray scattering.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). SAXS data were processed to yield Guinier and Kratky plots and to calculate the shape and size of NR1 (Fig. 4D). The Guinier plot is linear in Q2 in the low angle region confirming that recombinant NR1 is monodisperse in solution (data not shown). Analysis of the Guinier region (RgQ <1.3) yields a radius of gyration of ∼67 Å, consistent with an extended conformation in solution. The Kratky plot derived from the NR1 scattering curve contains a distinct peak indicative of globular structure; however, the data do not progress to zero at high Q, suggestive of significant disorder content. Calculated dimensions of NR1 reveal an elongated structure of ∼250 × ∼70 Å in size, consistent with a loosely compacted but predominantly disordered structure. This contrasts with theoretically calculated dimensions of ∼560 × ∼2 Å for the fully disordered polypeptide. Having established that NR1 is an IDD, we next turned our attention to the NR2 domain of CshA. Both monomeric and dimeric forms of this protein were subjected to crystallization screening. Monomeric NR2 proved recalcitrant to crystallization; however, dimeric NR2 was readily crystallizable. The structure of this protein was determined to 2.7 Å resolution in space group P6222 using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method as applied to selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled crystals of dimeric NR2. The asymmetric unit includes two copies of NR2, each of which forms a strand-swapped homodimer with a partner monomer from a neighboring asymmetric unit (Fig. 5A). Compelling electron density was not observed for the residues comprising the vector-encoded His6 tag and cleavable linker and the residues 313–331, 393–397, and 488–560 in either of the two copies of NR2. These residues have consequently been omitted from our final model. Inspection of the NR2 strand-swapped dimer reveals that each of the two monomers buries its three C-terminal β-strands (residues 447–488) into the central core of its dimer partner (Fig. 5A). Such extensive strand-swapping is unusual even in entirely β-strand proteins (25Gronenborn A.M. Protein acrobatics in pairs–dimerization via domain swapping.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In Fl_CshA, the N and C termini of NR2 are tethered to their neighboring NR1 and NR3 domains, respectively, an organization that would disfavor NR2 strand-swapping. Furthermore, previous studies of heterologously expressed Fl_CshA have revealed no evidence of dimer or higher oligomer formation (4McNab R. Forbes H. Handley P.S. Loach D.M. Tannock G.W.

Purpose To evaluate the prevalence and 4-year progression of knee OA measured with 3T MR-imaging in individuals with ruptured, reconstructed or normal ACL and to assess the impact of thigh muscle characteristics. Methods A total of 54 knees (23/54 male, 31/54 female) were recruited from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). At baseline, 15/54 subjects had prevalent ACL ruptures and 15/54 subjects had prevalent ACL reconstruction (24/54 normal ACL). Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, Physical Activity Scores of the Elderly (PASE) and thigh muscle characteristics including strength, fat infiltration (Goutallier score) and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) MR measurements were obtained at baseline. Whole-organ MR-imaging Scores (WORMS) were obtained at baseline and at a 4-year follow-up time-point. Multivariate regression models, adjusting for covariates (age, gender, body mass index), were used for statistical analysis. Results At baseline, subjects with prevalent ACL ruptures had worse WORMS total scores (mean±SEM, 44.1±3.5) than subjects with ACL reconstruction (30.8±4.0; P = 0.015) and worse than subjects with normal ACL (21.3±3.0; P<0.001). Cartilage scores were worse in both femorotibial compartments in ACL injured knees than in knees with normal ACL (P<0.05). Knees with ACL reconstruction showed an increased degeneration of the medial meniscus (P = 0.036), cartilage degeneration at the medial femoral condyle (P = 0.011). In a multivariate regression model, including both ACL groups and total muscle characteristics as influence parameters, high thigh muscle CSA, high muscle/ fat ratio and low Goutallier scores were associated with less degenerative changes at the knee, independent of ACL status. Knees with ACL reconstruction showed an increased progression of cartilage degeneration at the medial tibia compared to the normal ACL group (P = 0.027). Conclusions High thigh muscle CSA is associated with less degenerative changes at the knee, independent of the ACL status and may potentially be advantageous in the prevention of early OA."
https://openalex.org/W2560463605,"The triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 (sterile α motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1) restricts HIV-1 replication in nondividing myeloid cells by depleting the dNTP pool, preventing reverse transcription. SAMHD1 is also reported to have ribonuclease activity that degrades the virus genomic RNA. Human SAMHD1 is regulated by phosphorylation of its carboxyl terminus at Thr-592, which abrogates its antiviral function yet has only a small effect on its phosphohydrolase activity. In the mouse, SAMHD1 is expressed as two isoforms (ISF1 and ISF2) that differ at the carboxyl terminus due to alternative splicing of the last coding exon. In this study we characterized the biochemical and antiviral properties of the two mouse isoforms of SAMHD1. Both are antiviral in nondividing cells. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that SAMHD1 is phosphorylated at several amino acid residues, one of which (Thr-634) is homologous to Thr-592. Phosphomimetic mutation at Thr-634 of ISF1 ablates its antiviral activity yet has little effect on phosphohydrolase activity in vitro. dGTP caused ISF1 to tetramerize, activating its catalytic activity. In contrast, ISF2, which lacks the phosphorylation site, was significantly more active, tetramerized, and was active without added dGTP. Neither isoform nor human SAMHD1 had detectable RNase activity in vitro or affected HIV-1 genomic RNA stability in newly infected cells. These data support a model in which SAMHD1 catalytic activity is regulated through tetramer stabilization by the carboxyl-terminal tail, phosphorylation destabilizing the complexes and inactivating the enzyme. ISF2 may serve to reduce the dNTP pool to very low levels as a means of restricting virus replication."

https://openalex.org/W2560110940,"Background Iron deficiency (ID) is common in toddlers in developing countries. Iron fortified or meat-based complementary foods may be effective to prevent ID. Objective Our objective was to compare iron status at 18 months and growth from 6 to 18 months in rural poor toddlers fed 3 different complementary foods. Methods The study was nested within a larger trial in which 6-month-old infants were randomized to receive 50g/d meat (MG), an equi-caloric fortified cereal supplement (FG) or local cereal supplement (LG) for 1 year. Hb, sTfR, HsCRP, ferritin and AGP were measured in 410 blood samples collected by a random sampling (MG, 137; FG, 140; LG, 133); calprotectin was measured in feces. Body iron = -[log (sTfR ×1000/ferritin)-2.8229] /0.1207. ID = ferritin<12ug/L. Results The toddlers in FG had the significantly highest levels in serum ferritin and body iron (P = 0.043, 0.004), and the rates of both ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were the lowest in FG (P = 0.010, 0.021). The rate of systemic inflammation in FG was 30.71%, which was the highest among three groups (P = 0.042). No intervention effects on either the rates of ID and IDA or iron stores (serum ferritin and body iron) were shown in MG. The change in length-for-age z scores (LAZ) from 6 to 18 months among three groups was significantly different (P = 0.021) and a smaller decrease of LAZ in MG and a larger decrease of LAZ in FG were observed. Conclusion Iron fortified cereal improved iron status of poor rural toddlers but was also associated with systemic inflammation which was likely to impair their growth."

https://openalex.org/W2560056494,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, is distributed along the axon and enriched at the presynaptic basal lamina. It hydrolyses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which inhibits synaptic transmission. Aberrant AChE activity and ectopic axonal accumulation of the enzyme are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. The molecular mechanism that underlies AChE transport is still unclear. Here, we show that expression of Drosophila AChE tagged with photoactivatable green fluorescent protein and m-Cherry (GPAC) in cholinergic neurons compensates for the RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous AChE activity. GPAC-AChE, which is enriched in the neuropil region of the brain, moves in the apparently vesicular form in axons with an anterograde bias in Drosophila larvae. Two anterograde motors, kinesin-1 and -2, propel distinct aspects of GPAC-AChE movements. Total loss of kinesin-2 reduces the density of anterograde traffic and increases bidirectional movements of GPAC-AChE vesicles without altering their speed. A partial loss of kinesin-1 reduces both the density and speed of anterograde GPAC-AChE traffic and enhances the pool of stationary vesicles. Together, these results suggest that combining activity of a relatively weak kinesin-2 with that of a stronger kinesin-1 motor could steer AChE-containing vesicles toward synapse, and provides a molecular basis for the observed subcellular distribution of the enzyme.-Kulkarni, A., Khan, Y., Ray, K. Heterotrimeric kinesin-2, together with kinesin-1, steers vesicular acetylcholinesterase movements toward the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2560469309,"Introduction HPV positive patients suffering from head and neck cancer benefit from intensified radiotherapy when applied as a primary as well as an adjuvant treatment strategy. However, HPV negative patients treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy lack validated prognostic biomarkers. It is therefore important to define prognostic biomarkers in this particular patient population. Especially, ´high-risk groups´ need to be defined in order to adapt treatment protocols. Since dysregulation of the sonic hedgehog pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis, we aimed to assess whether members of the sonic hedgehog-signaling pathway may act as prognostic factors in patients with HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, pretreatment tumor biopsies of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were taken during panendoscopy (2005 to 2008). All patients were treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. After assessment of HPV and p16 status, protein expression profiles of the Sonic hedgehog-signaling pathway were determined by immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray analyses in 36 HPV negative tumor biopsies. Expression profiles of Sonic hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, Patched, Smoothened, Gli-1, Gli-2 and Gli-3 were correlated with patients´ clinical data, local-control rate, disease-free as well as overall survival. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas databank were used for external validation of our results. Results Gli-1 (p = 0.04) and Gli-2 (p = 0.02) overexpression was significantly linked to improved overall survival of HPV negative patients. Gli-2 (p = 0.04) overexpression correlated significantly with prolonged disease-free survival. Cox-multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of Gli-2 correlated independently (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.16–0.95, p = 0.03) with increased overall survival. Discussion Gli-1 and Gli-2 overexpression represents a substantial prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced HPV negative head and neck cancer undergoing surgery and postoperative radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2560162123,"Salmonella Typhimurium GtgE is an effector protein contributing to the virulence of this pathogen. It was shown to possess highly selective proteolytic activity against a subset of Rab proteins that helps in evasion of Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) fusion with lysosomes. Cys45, His151 and Asp169 are essential for proteolytic activity. The structure of a C-terminal fragment GtgE(79-214) indicated the presence of a papain-like fold. Here, we present the structure of GtgE(17-214) containing the fully assembled active site. The design of a proteolytically active and crystallizable GtgE construct was aided by NMR spectroscopy. The protein indeed displays papain-like fold with an assembled Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad. Like the full-length GtgE, the crystallizable construct showed low activity in vitro for its known substrates, Rab32 and Rab29. NMR titration experiments showed at most very weak binding of GtgE to the peptide encompassing the Rab29 cleavage site. In view of the low in vitro activity and poor substrate binding, we postulate that the function of GtgE in vivo as a proteolytic enzyme is dependent on other factor(s), such as a protein partner or interactions with the SCV membrane, which stimulate(s) GtgE activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2559959958,"In order to verify the real-time reliability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight control system and comply with the airworthiness certification standard, we proposed a model-based integration framework for modeling and verification of time property. Combining with the advantages of MARTE, this framework uses class diagram to create the static model of software system, and utilizes state chart to create the dynamic model. In term of the defined transformation rules, the MARTE model could be transformed to formal integrated model, and the different part of the model could also be verified by using existing formal tools. For the real-time specifications of software system, we also proposed a generating algorithm for temporal logic formula, which could automatically extract real-time property from time-sensitive live sequence chart (TLSC). Finally, we modeled the simplified flight control system of UAV to check its real-time property. The results showed that the framework could be used to create the system model, as well as precisely analyze and verify the real-time reliability of UAV flight control system."
