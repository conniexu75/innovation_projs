https://openalex.org/W2088927685,"A technique is described for detecting fibrinolytic activity of single cells in culture. This method was applied to the analysis of rat ovarian granulosa cells. Cells obtained from follicles shortly before ovulation show high levels of fibrinolytic activity. This activity is plasminogen-dependent, indicating that it is due to plasminogen activator. The appearance of this activity is correlated with ovulation by temporal and functional criteria, and can be demonstrated both in immature animals primed with hormones and in mature cycling animals. Granulosa cell cultures can be stimulated to release plasminogen activator by exposure in vitro either to luteinizing hormone or to dibutyryl cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1592845670,"The synthesis of the complex-type oligosaccharide unit of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein is initiated by the en bloc transfer of a high molecular weight oligosaccharide from a lipid carrier to the nascent polypeptide. Following transfer the oligosaccharide is processed by removal of glucose and mannose residues and the sugars that constitute the outer branches of the complex-type oligosaccharide are added. The structure of the oligosaccharide moiety of the lipid-linked precursor has been elucidated in order to further define the steps involved in processing. Since it was not feasible to obtain adequate amounts of material for standard structural studies, most of the structural studies were performed on radiolabeled material, with radioactivity incorporated differentially into glucose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Based on endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase CII digestion, alpha-mannosidase digestion, acetolysis, Smith periodate degradation, methylation analysis, and periodate oxidation, we propose the following structure for the oligosaccharide moiety of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide."

When myosin light chain kinase is incubated with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, 1 mol of phosphate is incorporated per mol of myosin kinase. Brief tryptic digestion of the 32P-labeled myosin kinase liberates a single radioactive peptide with a molecular weight of approximately 22,000. Phosphorylation of myosin kinase results in a 2-fold decrease in the rate at which the enzyme phosphorylates the 20,000-dalton light chain of smooth muscle myosin. These results suggest that cyclic AMP has a direct effect on actin-myosin interaction in smooth muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1511336559,"Abstract Cholera toxin, using [32P]NAD+ as substrate, specifically radiolabels at least two proteins in plasma membranes of wild type S49 mouse lymphoma cells. The toxin-specific substrates are detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as bands corresponding to molecular weights of 45,000 and a doublet of 52,000 to 53,000. Membranes of two other cell types exhibit similar patterns of radiolabeled bands specifically produced by incubation with cholera toxin: the uncoupled variant S49 cell, which possesses adenylate cyclase activity unresponsive to hormones, and the HTC4 rat hepatoma cell, which lacks detectable catalytic adenylate cyclase activity but contains components of the cyclase system necessary for regulation by guanyl nucleotides and NaF. Little or no toxin-specific radiolabeling is observed in membranes of a fourth cell type, the adenylate cyclase activity-deficient S49 variant, which functionally lacks components of the cyclase system involved in cholera toxin action and regulation by guanyl nucleotides and NaF. The toxin-specific labeling pattern is not observed in membranes prepared from wild type S49 cells previously treated with cholera toxin in culture. One or both of the toxin substrates thus appears to be involved in regulation of adenylate cyclase by guanyl nucleotides and fluoride ion."

https://openalex.org/W1499674981,"Abstract The temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility of cytochrome oxidase and some of its derivatives has been measured from 7 to 200 K. The results obtained for the fully oxidized (resting) enzyme correspond exactly to the requirements of the model recently proposed by Palmer et al. (Palmer, G., Babcock, G. T., and Vickery, L. E. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 2206-2210) in which the enzyme possesses two magnetically isolated spin S = 1/2 centers and a spin-coupled S = 2 center. The S = 2 center paramagnetism has been interpreted as arising from a [cytochrome a33+(S = 5/2)--Cuu2+(S = 1/2)] antiferromagnetically coupled iron.copper binuclear complex of total spin S = 2 with -J greater than or equal to 200 cm-1. In addition, the wide temperature range used in the present studies has permitted an analysis of present and other available data (T less than 4K measurements) which readily accommodates results from this and other laboratories (Moss, T.H., Shapiro, E., King, T.E., Beinert, H., and Hartzell, C. R. (1978) J. Biol. Chem 253, 8072-8073) so that a fully consistent picture of the magnetic centers in cytochrome oxidase now appears to be available. Furthermore, anomalous magnetic behavior for the oxidized enzyme.cyanide complex has been interpreted in terms of an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction operating in the binuclear complex [cytochrome a33+.CN-(S = 1/2)--Cuu2+(S = 1/2)] with -J congruent to 40 cm-1. A structural model for the [cytochrome a3(3+)-bridge-CUu2+] center is advanced in which an imidazolate ion serves as the bridging ligand in a manner similar to that found in superoxide dismutase."

https://openalex.org/W1504341779,"Limited proteolysis of T4 helix destabilizing protein (gene 32 protein = gp32) produced three stable products, gp32*I, gp32*II, and gp32*III. Gp32*I and gp32*II produced by chymotrypsin digestion were purified by duplex DNA-cellulose column chromatography and their amino acid compositions, NH/sub 2/-terminal sequences, and isoelectric points were compared with those of the undigested gp32. Results indicated that removal of an acidic region (A) from the COOH-terminal of gp32 produced gp32*I. Removal of a basic region (B) from the NH-terminal of gp32*I produced gp32*III. In previous experiments with poly(d(A-T)) we have shown that gp32*I was a stronger helix destabilizer than gp32. With the removal of A-region, the kinetic block in melting of naturally occurring double-stranded DNA observed with gp32 seems to be eliminated. In the presence of gp32*I the temperature at the midpoint of the helix-coil transition of T4 DNA was lowered over 70/sup 0/C at 12 mM (Na/sup +/ + K/sup +/) and 56/sup 0/C at 102 mM (Na/sup +/ + K/sup +/). No extensive melting of T4 DNA was observed in the presence of gp32 before thermal denaturation of the protein occurred. With 10 mM Mg/sup 2 +/ ion the helix-coil transition of T4 DNA in the presence of gp32*Imore » was reversible. Proteolytic digestion of mMg32 bound to single-stranded DNA indicated that the NH/sub 2/-terminal is inside of the complex because it is protected from proteolytic enzymes while the COOH-terminal is outside because it is as or more vulnerable to proteases than when in unbound gp32.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1536841578,"Abstract A previous report from this laboratory showed that binding of iodine-labeled human choriogonadotropin to Leydig tumor cells is not a reversible process (Ascoli, M., and Puett, D. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4892--4899). Most of the cell-bound hormone was found to be degraded to 3'-monoiodotyrosine before being released from the cells, and the degradation process could be inhibited by the lysosomotropic agents NH4Cl, chloroquine, and Triton WR-1339. It is reported herein that the degradation of receptor-bound human choriogonadotropin is an energy-dependent process, which can be inhibited by compounds that interfere with glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. NaF, NaN3, NaCN, and 2-deoxyglucose). Hormone degradation is also inhibited by some protease inhibitors such as the chloromethyl ketones of lysine and phenylalanine, but not by specific trypsin inhibitors (e.g. p-aminobenzamidine and p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester). With the exception of NH4Cl, it was found that the compounds which inhibit hormone degradation also inhibit hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis. However, the present results involving dose dependency, and those given in the following paper (Ascoli, M. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7839--7843), indicate that these two phenomena are not related."
https://openalex.org/W1592371878,"A factor inactivating phosphorylase phosphatase was isolated from rabbit liver. The isolation procedure consisted of heat treatment at 85 degrees C, extraction with n-butyl alcohol, and chromatography on Dowex 1 and DEAE-cellulose columns. The purified factor was different from the known protein inhibitors and was shown to be tripeptide composed of equimolar amounts of glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal amino acids were determined as glutamic acid and glycine, respectively. The factor was finally identified as glutathione disulfide by high voltage paper electrophoresis, paper chromatography, and liquid column chromatography using an amino acid analyzer. Addition of the purified factor or glutathione disulfide converted phosphorylase phosphatase to a stable, less active enzyme species, the extent of conversion depending on the amount added. The inactivated phosphatase was completely reactivated by addition of both glutathione (or 2-mercaptoethanol) and Mn2+ and partially reactivated by adding glutathione alone. Injection of glutathione disulfide into the portal vein of rabbits caused a rapid increase in phosphorylase alpha activity in the liver. These results suggest that glutathione disulfide is involved in regulation of phosphorylase activity in vivo, by causing inactivation of phosphorylase phosphatase in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1560415311,"The catalytic subunit of rabbit skeletal muscle cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase I can catalyze self-phosphorylation. The autophosphorylation reaction uses ATP as the phosphoryl donor, requires Mg2+, and is inhibited by polyarginine. Prior treatment of the catalytic subunit with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase in the presence of bovine serum albumin greatly enhances the autophosphorylation of the subunit. The protein-bound phosphate is stable in acid but labile in base. Incubation of the 32P-labeled phosphoenzyme with histones led neither to the phosphorylation of histones nor to a loss of radioactivity from the phosphoenzyme. The results suggest that the phosphoenzyme does not represent an intermediate of the phosphotransferase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1599406342,"The major apoproteins of human high density lipoproteins (HDL) labeled with 125I have been shown to exchange between the two major HDL subclasses HDL2 and HDL3 in vitro. This bidirectional exchange process is inhibited by cross-linking with bifunctional reagents and is apparently dependent upon the formation of collision complexes. This exchange has been demonstrated both when the subclasses of HDL are free in solution and also when one of them is covalently bound to Sepharose. Using system involving Sepharose-bound HDL, it could be shown that not only free apoprotein molecules but subunits consisting of lipid-apoprotein combinations were exchanged between HDL2 and HDL3. The rate of exchange in these processes is significant in the lifetime of the protein particles in vivo equalling approximately 2.5% per h for apoprotein exchange. These experiments suggest that there is a dynamic relationship between HDL2 and HDL3 even though each of them exists alone in vitro as stable separate entities; when they are placed together in solution significant interaction occurs between the particles. Apoprotein exchange occurs between HDL2:HDL2 and HDL3:HDL3 as well as between HDL2 and HDL3 molecules. These data also suggest that the interconversion of HDL2 and HDL3 may be affected by the availability of lipids."

https://openalex.org/W1519215056,"We have partially purified and characterized two separate DNA polymerase activities associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EB virus). One activity is present in EB virus producer cell lines but not in nonproducer or negative cell lines. It adheres more strongly to DEAE-cellulose than any host cell enzymes, eluting at 210 to 270 mM potassium phosphate buffer. Further elution from phosphocellulose and sedimentation in glycerol gradients yields an enzyme purified 900-fold with an S value of 8.3. The second DNA polymerase activity co-purifies with EB viral particles, elutes at low salt from DEAE-cellulose (40 to 60 mM potassium phosphate buffer) and phosphocellulose (100 mM), and has an S value of 9.5 on glycerol gradient sedimentation. These two enzymes are referred to for convenience as the EB virus-induced DNA polymerase and the EB virion-associated DNA polymerase. The EB virus-induced polymerase can be distinguished from host alpha, beta, and the virion-associated polymerase in 1) being resistant to salt inhibition, 2) having a more basic pH optima in Tris buffer (pH 9.5), and 3) having a 10-fold lower saturating concentration for the activated DNA template. The EB virion-associated polymerase is distinguished from host alpha, beta, and the EB virus-induced polymerase, because it cannot utilize synthetic deoxy- and ribohomopolymer primer-templates in place of the activated calf thymus DNA template in DNA polymerase assays. Neither of the EB virus-associated polymerases can copy the ribohomopolymers dT10poly(rA) or dG12-18(poly(rC) efficiently and therefore can be distinguished from host gamma polymerase and reverse transcriptase. The activity of the EB virus-induced and virion-associated polymerases are unaffected both by antibody to alpha polymerase, and by antiserum with high antibody titers to EB early antigen and viral capsid antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1572610443,"The addition of physiological concentrations of either cAMP or cGMP stimulated the release of RNA from isolated prelabeled rat liver nuclei to a fortified cytosol in a cell-free system. The released RNA was shown to be primarily mRNA by its binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose and its sedimentation profile. Treatment of rats with cAMP or cGMP 30 min prior to the preparation of cyclic nucleotides on the cell-free system. Cyclic nucleotides stimulation of RNA release occurred in systems prepared from resting rat liver, Novikoff hepatoma, and Morris hepatoma 5123D, but not the 18-h regenerating liver. The response of the cell-free system to added cyclic nucleotides reflected the in vivo concentration of these substances in the tissues from which the system was prepared. Those with high in vivo levels were not stimulated while those with lower levels did respond to added cyclic nucleotides. Neither cAMP nor cGMP had an appreciable effect on rRNA release."
https://openalex.org/W1555736885,"Membrane vesicles were prepared from mouse fibroblasts transformed by SV40 virus (SV3T3). Following disruption of the cells by nitrogen cavitation, the membrane vesicles were obtained by differential centrifugation. As measured by enzyme markers, they consist mainly of membrane from the plasma membrane and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The vesicles transport Pi by two separate, mediated systems: one is independent of Na+, and the other is secondary active transport driven by a Na+ gradient. Electrical and chemical energy can be provided by a Na+ gradient to drive the concentrative uptake of Pi by the vesicles, one or both forces being used to energize transport. Evidence is provided that both the electrical and chemical potentials produced by the asymmetric distribution of Na+ across the membrane of SV3T3 membrane vesicles are utilized to concentrate phosphate in the vesicles. Phosphate transport by the vesicles cannot be accounted for by a small contamination of this fraction with mitochondria (1 to 4%). The Pi transport properties of the membrane vesicles differ from those of the fraction enriched in mitochondria in the following respects: their kinetic properties, and their responses to a Na+ gradient, N-ethylmaleimide, mersalyl, and succinate/acetate. However, the membrane vesicles share some properties of Pi transport with mitochondria. Cyanide, azide, oligomycin, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and carbonyl cyanide m-cholophenylhydrazone, inhibitors of Pi transport by mitochondria, also inhibit membrane vesicle, Pi transport. The vesicles retain all the features of Pi transport by SV3T3 cells that have been examined. They provide a simplified system for a determination of the details of the mechanism of Pi transport under conditions where transport is dissociated from intracellular reactions and in the presence of a defined electrochemical driving force."

Chem. 253, 7832--7838) show that the degradation of receptor-bound 125I-labeled human choriogonadotropin can be inhibited by chloroquine, protease inhibitors, and metabolic inhibitors. These compounds were also shown to inhibit gonadotropin-stimulated steroidogenesis. It is reported herein that these inhibitors also block the stimulation of steroidogenesis by both cholera toxin and 8-Br-adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, thus showing that they are not specific for the hormonal stimuli. These results, taken together with previous observations that show that NH2Cl can block hormone degradation without inhibiting hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis, strongly suggest that the degradation of choriogonadotropin is not required for its stimulatory action on progesterone production."

https://openalex.org/W1603996635,"The steady state kinetics and effects of salts on chicken breast phosphoglycerate mutase have been examined. The enzyme can catalyze three phosphoryl transfer reactions: mutase, bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase, and bisphosphoglycerate synthase. The mutase rate was measured in the favorable direction (Keq = glycerate-3-P/glycerate-2-P approximately equal to 12) using [2T]glycerate-2-P as substrate. The bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase activity was studied in the presence of the activator, glycolate-2-P. The latter is an analog of the glycerate-P's and appears to act as an abortive mutase substrate. The kinetic pattern obtained with both activities is that of a ping-pong mechanism with inhibition by the second substrate occurring at a lower concentration than the Km value for that substrate. The kinetic parameters for the mutase determined in 50 mM N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-amino]ethanesulfonate (TES)/sodium buffer containing 0.1 M KCl, pH 7.5, 25 degrees C are: Km glycerate-2,3-P2, 0.069 micron; Km glycerate-2-P, 14 micron; Km glycerate-3-P approximately 200 micron; Ki glycerate-2-P, 4 micron. The kinetic parameters for the phosphatase reaction in 50 mM triethanolamine/Cl- buffer, pH 7.5, 25 degrees C are: Km glycerate-2,3-P2, 0.065 micron:Km glycolate-2P, 479 micron; Ki glycolate-2-P, 135 micron. The enzyme is sensitive to changes in the ionic environment. Increasing salt concentrations activate the phosphatase in the presence of glycolate-2-P by decreasing the apparent Km of glycerate-2,3-P2. The effects are due to the anionic component and Cl- greater than acetate greater than TES. The same salts are competitive inhibitors with respect to glycolate-2-P. With high levels of KCl that produce a 30-fold decrease in the apparent maximal velocity due to competition with glycolate-2-P, the Km of glycerate-2,3-P2 remains low. These observations lead us to postulate that each monophosphoglycerate substrate has a separate site on the enzyme and that glycerate-2,3-P2 can bind to either site. The binding of anions to one site of the nonphosphorylated enzyme allows an increase in the on and off rates of glycerate-2,3-P2 at the alternate site. Salts inhibit the mutase reaction. The Km of glycerate-2,3-P2 is increased as is that of glycerate-2-P. The effect on the Km of glycerate-2,3-P2 is attributed to an increase in the off rate/on rate ratio for glycerate-2,3-P2. The bisphosphoglycerate synthase reaction is shown to require added glycerate-3-P. The equilibrium between enzyme and glycerate-1,3-P2 is favorable (Kdiss less than or equal 7 X 10(-8) M) and suggests that in the absence of a separate synthase this reaction may have functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W1511988795,"Abstract A novel phosphodiesterase has been found in commercially available extracts of Aspergillus niger and has been partially purified by fractionation with acetone and chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. The enzyme attacks glycerophosphodiester bonds with the liberation of free glycerol only. The synthetic substrate glucose 6-phospho-sn-1'(3')-glycerol is hydrolyzed with production of equivalent amounts of free glycerol and glucose 6-phosphate. Similarly, the enzymic hydrolysis of sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liberates glycerol and phosphocholine. The hydrophilic head groups of membrane phospholipids of Escherichia coli are continuously transferred to a closely related family of oligosaccharides (membrane-derived oligosaccharides) containing glucose as the sole sugar (van Golde, L. M. G., Schulman, H., and Kennedy, E. P. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 1368--1372). Oligosaccharide A-2 contains sn-1-glycerophosphate residues (derived from phosphatidylglycerol) in phosphodiester linkage. Treatment of this oligosaccharide with the phosphodiesterase led to the liberation of nearly all of the glycerol as free glycerol. Subsequent partial acid hydrolysis of the enzyme-treated oligosaccharide led to the recovery of glucose 6-phosphate in almost quantitative yield. The sn-1-glycerophosphate residues are therefore linked to position 6 of glucose units of the oligosaccharide. The activity of the enzyme is not restricted to glycerophosphodiesterases since it will hydrolyze phosphodiesters containing other polyols such as the synthetically prepared glucose 6-phospho-DL-1'(2'-hydroxy-3'-ethoxy)propane."

https://openalex.org/W1482174643,"Pb2+-stimulated phosphorylation of Electrophorus electricus electroplax (Na+ + K+)-adenosine triphosphatase is prevented by stoichiometric quantities of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol. The chelator in the same low concentrations does not block Na+-dependent phosphorylation. Both Pb2+-and Na+-dependent phosphorylation reactions show the same dependence on MgCl2. Phosphorylation in the presence of both Na+ and Pb2+ is cumulative suggesting that Pb2+ and Na+ bind at separate, independent sites. The enthalpy change due to binding of Pb2+ is about -1.76 kcal/mol. 32P-phosphopeptides obtained from pronase or pepsin digests of Pb2+-and Na+-dependent phosphoproteins are electrophoretically identical. Pb2+ does not stimulate but does inhibit ATP-ADP exchange activity under the conditions in which this activity is stimulated by Na+. Since the phosphorylation sites are identical, it is concluded that the differences in reactivity of the Na+- and Pb2+-phosphoenzymes are due to different conformational changes produced by binding of Na+ and Pb2+. The Pb2+-sensitive conformation is critical for Na+ specificity of phosphorylation, reversibility of phosphorylation, and for phosphatase activity but not for acceptor site phosphorylation by ATP. These findings have implications for enzyme reaction models."
https://openalex.org/W1506454779,"The low temperature (77 K) irradiation of oxidized ceruloplasmin and Rhus vernicifera laccase at the 330 nm absorption which arises from type 3 copper leads to the reduction of type 1 copper as demonstrated by bleaching of the 610 nm chromophore and the decrease of the EPR signal associated with this species. Type 2 copper remains unaffected. Concomitant with the type 1 copper reduction, a new EPR signal which is possibly that of a biradical appears. Upon thawing, type 1 copper is reversibly oxidized and the radical signal disappears. Irradiation of oxidized protein at the absorption band of type 1 copper produces no spectral change. An EPR study at room temperature confirms the wave-length specificity and reversibility of the photoreduction of type 1 copper and radical formation. Radical appearance and disappearance at room temperature are extremely slow (tau1/2 approximately 30 min). Optical studies at room temperature show that upon anaerobic irradiation of laccase in the 330 nm absorption band, both type 3 and type 1 chromophores are slowly reduced. Upon return to the dark and in the presence of O2, both type 3 and type 1 centers are reoxidized. Oxidizing equivalents either from O2 or K3Fe(CN)6 are required for the reoxidation reaction. These studies demonstrate that there is a direct energy transfer between type 3 and type 1 copper sites in blue copper oxidases."

Of those studied, only guanine nucleotide sugars moderate the activity of the enzyme. GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-alpha-D-glucose, GDP-alpha-D-rhamnose, and GDP-alpha-L-fucose on the other hand is strongly inhibitory. In the case of GDP-alpha-D-mannose stimulation, a physiological role seems possible, but the rationale is not entirely clear. The effects of GDP-beta-L-fucose, on the other hand may represent physiological control effected through feedback inhibition by and end product."

https://openalex.org/W62056008,"The addition of 0.167 to 4.0 mM cAMP to gel-filtered rabbit reticulocyte lysates stimulates the initial rate and the extent of polypeptide synthesis. The stimulation is at the initiation step of polypeptide synthesis as measured by the (i) increased dipeptide, methionyl-valine, accumulation in the presence of the specific initiation inhibitor, pactamycin, and (ii) increased formation of the 40 S and 80 S initiation complex when gel-filtered lysates are incubated with [35S]Met-tRNAFMet. Furthermore, a synergistic stimulation of protein synthesis is observed when cAMP and hexose phosphates (which alone elicit a 1.8-fold stimulation of protein synthesis) are added simultaneously to gel-filtered rabbit reticulocyte lysates. These results indicate that cAMP and hexose phosphates are both essential to maintain the high rate of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1633422148,"A single strand specific endonuclease, venom phosphodiesterase, acting on superhelical phiX174 DNA, inflicts at least seven specific cleavages. Six of these were located to within approximately +/-40 base-pairs by mapping with restriction endonucleases. They are at 12%, 27.4%, 42.7%, 47.5%, 76.1%, and 82.5%. All of these sites lie within regions containing runs of 16 or more base-pairs, of which 12 or more are A and T. Other similarly (A + T)-rich regions in the genome are not cleaved by the enzyme. Increasing the superhelical density of the substrate did not alter the locations of the cleavage sites. There is no correlation between the locations of the cleavage sites and the three known major promoter sites. Only two of five postulated transcription termination sites are cleaved by phosphodiesterase even though all of these terminators contain (A + T)-rich regions. The area containing the origin of viral DNA replication, which includes an (A + T)-rich sequence, is not cleaved."
