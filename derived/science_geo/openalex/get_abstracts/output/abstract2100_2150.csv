https://openalex.org/W1497854461,"The activator of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase of erythrocyte membranes was purified 13,000-fold to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. The protein gave a single band upon electrophoresis both with and without detergent, and upon isoelectric focusing. This protein was compared with Ca2+-binding modulator proteins from bovine brain and rat testis. All three proteins were homogeneous and co-migrated on electrophoresis both in the presence of detergent and without detergent at pH values on both sides of the isoelectric point of the protein. The amino acid compositions of the three proteins were nearly indistinguishable, and all three proteins contained 1 residue of the unusual amino acid, trimethyllysine. All three were also indistinguishable as measured by their ability to further stimulate the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase of human erythrocyte membranes. Thus, we conclude that they represent functionally the same protein. Upon storage of all three proteins, a second band was detectable by detergent gel electrophoresis; the biochemical activity and the behavior on nondetergent gels were not changed. The presence of this second band is probably responsible for previous reports of differences between the rat testis and bovine brain modulator protein. The possibility is discussed that this protein is a general intracellular Ca2+ receptor, which mediates the activities of Ca2+ as an intracellular messenger."

Methods have been developed to purify the subunits from coupling factor dissociated by sodium dodecyl sulfate, involving hydroxylapatite chromatography followed by gel filtration with the detergent still present. The amino acid composition of the subunits purified by these methods was determined, with some differences noted in values for cysteine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine compared to previously published values. The stoichiometry of the subunits was estimated as 2:2:1:1:2 from their relative adsorption of dye after gel electrophoresis, compared to dye adsorbed by known amounts of the purified subunits. Estimates of subunit stoichiometry are rounded off to nearest whole numbers; actual preparations of coupling factor usually show less than complete amounts of the two smallest subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1566709163,"Hydrolysis of ATP by rep protein proceeds in the presence of a single-stranded region of DNA 4 residues long, but the true effector for rep ATPase appears to be a replicating fork rather than a random coil. At or near a fork in duplex DNA, rep ATPase action is different from what it is on DNA lacking secondary structure (single-stranded): (i) Km for ATP is lower, (ii) specificity is for ATP and dATP with no action on other nucleoside triphosphates, (iii) sensitivity to certain ATP analogs is reduced, (iv) presence of a DNA-nicking enzyme (e.g. cistron A protein induced by phiX174) is required, and (v) Escherichia coli DNA binding protein facilitates rather than inhibits. During the separation of strands accompanying replication, 2 molecules of nucleoside triphosphate (ATP or dATP) are hydrolyzed for every nucleotide polymerized. Utilization of ATP by rep protein may provide energy for catalytic strand separation at a fork in advance of replication."

Isolation was accomplished by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and on a p-aminobenzoyl-L-arginine-Sepharose 6B affinity column. Carbohydrate accounts for 17% of the weight calculated from its amino acid and carbohydrate composition. The enzyme appears to consist of three subunits of Mr = 83,000, 55,000, and 49,000 and contains a significant amount of bound zinc.

https://openalex.org/W1587777700,"The main phosphofructokinase of Escherichia coli (PFK I) is an extensively studied allosteric enzyme specified by the pfkA gene. A nonallosteric phosphofructokinase was reported (Fraenkel, D.G., Kotlarz, D., and Bluc, H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4865-4866) in strains carrying the pfkB1 mutation, a suppressor of pfkA mutants, and very low levels of this enzyme have also been detected in strains not carrying the suppressor (i.e. pfkB+). The nonallosteric protein has now been prepared pure from three strains, one carrying pfkB1 and pfkA+, one carrying pfkB1 and completely deleted for pfkA, and one carrying pfkB+ and also deleted for pfkA. It is apparently the same enzyme (PFK II) in all three strains, which shows that pfkB1 is a mutation affecting the amount of a normally minor isozyme. PFK II is a tetramer of slightly larger subunit molecular weight than PFK I (36,000 and 34,000, respectively). No immunological cross-reactivity was detected between PFK II and PFK I. Unlike PFK I, PFK II does not show cooperative interactions with fructose-6-P, inhibition by P-enolpyruvate, or activation by ADP. Also unlike PFK I, PFK II is somewhat sensitive to inhibition by fructose-1,6-P2 and can use tagatose-6-P as substrate. Both enzymes can perform the reverse reaction, fructose-6-P + ATP from fructose-1,6-P2 + ADP in vitro, but not in vivo. The normal function of PFK II is not known."

The subunits of (Mr = 250,000) of the protein are cleaved asymmetrically into two fragments, heavy merofilamin, Mr = 240,000, and light merofilamin, Mr = 9,500. Digestion is complete at substrate to enzyme ratios of 100:1 and requires Ca2+ concentrations in excess of 0.3 mM. Heavy merofilamin binds to F-actin as evidenced by cosedimentation with F-actin, by direct observation under the electron microscope, and by its ability to inhibit actin activation of heavy meromyosin ATPase. Heavy merofilamin does not form a gel when mixed with actin, except at very low concentrations of KCl. Thus, actin binding and gelation are separable activities of filamin. We speculate that Ca2+-stimulated proteolysis may play a role in the regulation of actin-filamin interactions."

Relatively large quantities were obtained from ColE1-plasmid-containing cells in which the enzyme level was 7 to 10 times above wild type. The assay for rep protein was based on its essential role, with phage-induced cistron A protein, in enzymatic synthesis of phage phiX174 (+) strands, using duplex circular DNA as template. The protein exhibits a molecular weight of 65,000 under denaturing and reducing conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1525106122,"The coupling factor, F1-ATPase of Escherichia coli (ECF1) contains five different subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon. Properties of delta-deficient ECF1 have previously been described. F1-ATPase containing only the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits was prepared from E. coli by passage of delta-deficient ECF1 through an affinity column containing immobilized antibodies to the epsilon subunit. The delta, epsilon-deficient enzyme has normal ATPase activity but cannot bind to ECF1-depleted membrane vesicles. Both the delta and epsilon subunits are required for the binding of delta, epsilon-deficient ECF1 to membranes and the restoration of oxidative phosphorylation. Either delta or epsilon will bind to the deficient enzyme to form a four-subunit complex. Neither four-subunit enzyme binds to depleted membranes. The epsilon subunit, does, however, slightly improve the binding affinity between delta and delta-deficient enzyme suggesting a possible interaction between the two subunits. Neither subunit binds to trypsin-treated ECF1, which contains only the alpha and beta subunits. A role for gamma in the binding of epsilon to F1 is suggested. epsilon does not bind to ECF1-depleted membranes. Therefore, the in vitro reconstitution of depleted membranes requires an initial complex formation between epsilon and the rest of ECF1 prior to membrane attachment. Reconstitution experiments indicate that only one epsilon is required per functional ECF1 molecule."

Purification is up to 200-fold (relative to the homogenate), with a yield of 10 mg of protein from 200 g, wet weight, of brine shrimp nauplii. The enzyme preparations have specific activities up to 475 ..mu..mol of Pi/h/mg of protein, with an estimated 50% purity, assuming both the large and small subunits are the protein constituents of the holoenzyme.

The mass ratio is estimated to be greater than two, corresponding to a molar ratio of one large to one small subunit. Binding studies indicate that the preparation has an equivalent number of phosphorylation sites and ATP binding sites. The calculated molecular weight of a theoretically purified enzyme based on the binding studies is 230,000 and 220,000, respectively, for the two ligands.

https://openalex.org/W1547696108,"Results are presented that confirm and extend earlier findings that efrapeptin is a potent inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. Binding of efrapeptin is shown to be reversible, and a dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex is estimated to be 10(-8) M under conditions for either ATP synthesis or hydrolysis. Fifty per cent inhibition of the ATP hydrolysis activity of submitochondrial particles is obtained at a ratio of 0.56 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme. Studies of efrapeptin binding under pseudo-first order conditions show that the onset of inhibition is first order with respect to efrapeptin. Combined with the inhibition titer, these results indicate that there is one inhibitor binding site per molecule of enzyme. Steady state velocity studies using a substrate regenerating system show that efrapeptin is competitive with both ADP and phosphate during ATP synthesis. However, during ATP hydrolysis, a distinctly different mode of inhibition is indicated with respect to ATP. Data are presented which suggest that ATP promotes the binding of efrapeptin to the enzyme. Indications that efrapeptin is a catalytic site inhibitor make these results difficult to reconcile with a simple mechanistic scheme involving a single independnet catalytic site for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Our results are discussed in terms of support for catalytic cooperativity between adjacent subunits as recently proposed by Kayalar et al. (Kayalar, C., Rosing, J., and Boyer, P. D. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2486-2491)."

https://openalex.org/W1509190909,"Abstract An in vitro replication system reconstituted from six purified T4 bacteriophage each of which is essential for T4 DNA replication in vivo, requires ATP. Because of the complexity of the complete system, we examine in this report the involvement of ATP in two subsystems of the overall DNA synthesis reaction. One subsystem consists of the T4 DNA polymerase (gene 43 protein) and its proteins, the gene 44/62 and 45 products. An even simpler subsystem consists of the gene 44/62 and 45 proteins alone, which together have a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The combination of the 44/62 and 45 proteins hydrolyze ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of DNA. These essential accessory proteins have been previously shown to increase T4 DNA polymerase activity on primed, single-stranded DNA templates. In this report we use nucleotide analogues to demonstrate that this polymerase stimulation requires hydrolysis of the beta,gamma-phosphate bond of ATP. However, our data suggest that the mechanism of accessory protein stimulation is such that less than 1 ATP molecule need be hydrolyzed per 10 deoxyribonucleotides incorporated by the DNA polymerase into DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2159013752,"The synthesis of tryptophan from serine and indole or indoleglycerol phosphate catalyzed by native tryptophan synthetase or PZ protein is shown to proceed stereospecifically with retention of configuration at Cg. In the a$ elimination reaction of serine to give pyruvate and ammonia catalyzed by the fiz protein, the hydrogen from C, is transferred intramolecularly and without exchange with solvent protons to Cg, where it replaces the OH group with net retention of configuration. In a competing reaction, an abortive transamination in the presence of mercaptoethanol to give pyridoxamine and S-pyruvyl mercaptoethanol, the same proton is transferred to the extent of 70% to C-4’ of the cofactor when the reaction is carried out in DzO. Together with the finding of Dunathan and Voet (Dunathan, H. G. and Voet, J. G. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 3888) that the cofactor is protonated from the si face, these data fully define the geometry of the substrate l coenzyme complex and the position of an essential base relative to it. Since no isotope effect was observed in the protonation of C, of tryptophan synthesized from indole and serine in 50% DzO, the base must be monoprotic. The known inability of the enzyme to degrade tryptophan by a$ elimination is not due to inability to remove H, of tryptophan; native enzyme and j3~ protein catalyze a hydrogen exchange of tryptophan at a rate of20% and 14%, respectively, of that of tryptophan synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1501636295,"The affinity label 5'-p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl adenosine modifies rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase to the extent of one group/subunit. Modification appears to occur at a binding site specific for AMP, cyclic AMP, and ADP, i.e. those adenine nucleotides which are activators under conditions where regulatory kinetic behavior is obtained. The consequences of the modification are consistent with the model proposed previously for correlation between the pK of specific ionizable groups, regulatory kinetic behavior, ligand binding, and the reversible cold inactivation of the enzyme (Frieden, C., Gilbert. H. R., and Bock, P. E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5644-5647). Thus, the modification shifts the apparent pK of the essential ionizable groups from 6.9 to 6.4 at 25 degrees C, with the result that regulatory kinetic behavior at pH 6.9 and 25 degrees C is lost. Furthermore, the apparent affinity of a site (other than the active site) for ATP, as measured by ATP-dependent quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence at pH 6.9 and 25 degrees C, is decreased by the modification. Regulatory kinetic behavior for both substrates is obtained with the modified enzyme at a lower pH, consistent with the downward shift in the pK of the ionizable groups, but sensitivity to cAMP activation is abolished by the modification. The loss of regulatory kinetic behavior upon modification of sulfhydryl groups does not appear to be the same as that due to modification by the affinity label."
https://openalex.org/W2160770879,"Xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.37) is the first enzyme in the degradative pathway by which fungi convert purines to ammonia. In vivo, the activity is induced 6-fold by growth in uric acid. Hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine, or guanine also induce enzyme activity but to a lesser degree. Immunoelectrophoresis using monospecific antibodies prepared against Neurospora crassa xanthine dehydrogenase shows that the induced increase in enzyme activity results from increased numbers of xanthine dehydrogenase molecules, presumably arising from de novo enzyme synthesis. Xanthine dehydrogenase has been purified to homogeneity by conventional methods followed by immunoabsorption to monospecific antibodies coupled to Sepharose 6B. Electrophoresis of purified xanthine dehydrogenase reveals a single protein band which also exhibits enzyme activity. The average specific activity of purified enzyme is 140 nmol of isoxanthopterine produced/min/mg. Xanthine dehydrogenase activity is substrate-inhibited by xanthine (0.14 mM), hypoxanthine (0.3 mM), and pterine (10 micron), is only slightly affected by metal binding agents such as KCN (6 mM), but is strongly inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents such as p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (2 micron). The molecular weight of xanthine dehydrogenase is 357,000 as calculated from a sedimentation coefficient of 11.8 S and a Stokes radius of 6.37 nm. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the enzyme reveals a single protein band having a molecular weight of 155,000. So the xanthine dehydrogenase protein appears to be a dimer. In contrast to xanthine dehydrogenases from animal sources which typically possess as prosthetic groups 2 FAD molecules, 2 molybdenum atoms, 8 atoms of iron, and 8 acid-labile sulfides, the Neurospora enzyme contains 2 FAD molecules, 1 molybdenum atom, 12 atoms of iron, and 14 eq of labile sulfide/molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1609198249,"Abstract Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles rendered leaky by exposure to alkaline pH, like intact vesicles, catalyze a rapid Mg2+-dependent exchange of oxygens of medium Pi with water. The exchange with 10 mM Pi is strongly inhibited by 0.15 mM Ca2+. Upon addition and hydrolysis of ITP or ATP, a rapid phosphate-oxygen exchange is observed even with 0.15 mM Ca2+ present and a definite but smaller exchange at 8 mM Ca2+. Oxygen exchange per Pi formed is greater with ITP than with ATP. When no Pi is initially present, the extent of oxygen exchange is increased with time of incubation as Pi is formed. With 18O-labeled Pi present, ATP hydrolysis accelerates 18O loss. The results show that much of the oxygen exchange occurs as a result of reversible binding of medium Pi. Thus the binding and cleavage of ITP or ATP overcomes the Ca2+ inhibition of the medium Pi in equilibrium HOH exchange. Such findings support the concept that the cleavage cycle includes a transient conformational form which can reversibly react with Pi to give a phosphoryl enzyme and resultant oxygen exchange or in a rate-limiting step decay to a form with high Ca2+ and NTP affinity."

https://openalex.org/W1490071565,"The object of this investigation was to distinguish between two potential mechanisms of activation of human plasminogen (HPg) to plasmin (HPm) by catalytic levels of the activator complex, streptokinase.plasmin (SK.HPm). One mechanism, which is widely supported, postulates an enzymatic role for SK.HPm in the conversion of molar excesses of plasminogen to plasmin. A more recently described kinetic mechanism involves a direct conversion of HPg to HPm by streptokinase (SK). Here, it is believed that displacement of HPm from SK.HPm by excess HPg is the major source of free HPm in the activation process. The present paper shows that SK is not capable of undergoing rapid exchange from SK.HPm to other HPg or HPm molecules, thus precluding the possibility of direct activation of HPg by SK. Our evidence supports a mechanism involving an enzymatic role for SK.HPm as the major means of converting free HPg to HPm."

Hybrid formation, which apparently proceeds by way of dimers, can be blocked by fructose-1,6-P2, fructose-6-P, and high concentrations of MgATP. The A2B2 isozyme was separated from A4 and B4 by ion exchange chromatography. The kinetic regulatory properties of A2B2 were compared with those of A4, B4, and a 1:1 mixture of A4 and B4. ATP inhibition of A2B2 was intermediate between that observed with A4 and B4 and was clearly not identical to a simple summing of the effects of A and B subunits. Similar comparisons were made using other phosphofructokinase inhibitors, citrate, 2,3-P2-glycerate, and P-creatine. In each case the observed inhibition was intermediate between the observed with A4 and B4.

This dissection technique is used here to investigate the cytoplasmic distribution of 75S RNA of Balbiani ring origin. The Balbiani ring 75S RNA has properties of a messenger RNA coding for secretory proteins. After a pulse of RNA precursor to the living animal, labeled Balbiani ring 75S RNA is found mainly in the cytoplasm located closer to the nuclear envelope, with smaller amounts toward the periphery of the cell. This gradient, initially very steep, lasts for a least 2 days, but less than 6 days. Experiments with 5-fluorouridine indicate that the formation of the gradient does not depend upon simultaneous export of ribosomal subunits. After a pretreatment of the animals with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, however, newly synthesized 75S RNA distributes evenly in the cytoplasm-that is, this treatment prevents the formation of the 75S RNA gradient. The gradient in salivary glands of normally cultured animals is therefore likely to be the result of diffusion restriction of the labeled 75S RNA. Thus the 75S RNA located closer to the nuclear envelope is the most recently exported 75S RNA. An explanation of these results is the the 75S RNA associates with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum early or immediately after nuclear release. This association should occur in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus and may occur either as single particles and/or as parts of polysomes."

Under conditions optimal for allosteric kinetics the modified enzyme is less sensitive to inhibition by ATP and insensitive to activation by AMP, cyclic AMP, and ADP. The concentration of fructose-6-P necessary for half-maximal activity is markedly decreased, while the cooperativity to the same substrate is not changed under the same conditions. The modified enzyme is more stable at pH 6.5 when compared with the native enzyme. Changes in the allosteric kinetics of the enzyme are proportional to the extent of modification reaching maximal effect when 3.2 mol of the reagent were bound/mol of tetrameric enzyme. Affinity labeling of the enzyme by the adenine derivative does not affect significantly the catalytic site. This is evidenced by the demonstration that under assay conditions optimal for Michaelian kinetics neither the Km for ATP nor for fructose-6-P is significantly changed following chemical modification. Maximal activity of the modified enzyme was 60% of the native enzyme. ADP gives the best protection, while AMP gives less protection against modification by the reagent. ATP slows the rate of the reaction and causes a slight decrease in maximum binding of the reagent to the enzyme. Modification of the enzyme caused a marked reduction of AMP and ADP binding.

Kinetic treatment of the long term inactivation by ADP or Nb-S6ITP reveals a pseudo-first order process via the formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex for which a Km analogous constant is obtained that is identical with the corresponding Ki value of the competitive inhibition. The long term inactivation by ADP and Nb-S6ITP involves the successive tight binding of 6 +/- 1 nucleotides/F1 molecule. One additional ADP molecule/F1 complex which is also tightly bound has no effect on the ATPase activity. The long term inactivation by ADP and Nb-S6ITP is inhibited at higher inhibitor concentrations according to a kinetics analogous to a substrate excess inhibition. Evidence is presented indicating that the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by F1 and the long term inactivation by ADP or Nb-S6ITP are related processes.
