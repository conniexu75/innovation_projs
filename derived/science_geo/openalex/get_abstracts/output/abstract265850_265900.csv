https://openalex.org/W1974541812,"Mesoporous silica molecular sieves have been prepared by the hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate in the presence of low-cost, nontoxic, and biodegradable polyethylene oxide (PEO) surfactants, which act as the structure-directing (templating) agents. This nonionic, surfactant-neutral, inorganic-precursor templating pathway to mesostructures uses hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydrophilic surfaces of flexible rod- or worm-like micelles and Si(OC(2)H(5))(4-x)(OH)(x) hydrolysis products to assemble an inorganic oxide framework. Disordered channel structures with uniform diameters ranging from 2.0 to 5.8 nanometers have been obtained by varying the size and structure of the surfactant molecules. Metal-substituted silica and pure alumina mesostructures have also been prepared by the hydrolysis of the corresponding alkoxides in the presence of PEO surfactants. These results suggest that nonionic templating may provide a general pathway for the preparation of mesoporous oxides."
https://openalex.org/W2055630785,"Ecologists have long been studying stability in ecosystems by looking at the structuring and the strengths of trophic interactions in community food webs. In a series of real food webs from native and agricultural soils, the strengths of the interactions were found to be patterned in a way that is important to ecosystem stability. The patterning consisted of the simultaneous occurrence of strong ""top down"" effects at lower trophic levels and strong ""bottom up"" effects at higher trophic levels. As the patterning resulted directly from the energetic organization of the food webs, the results show that energetics and community structure govern ecosystem stability by imposing stabilizing patterns of interaction strengths."

In contrast, little or no change has been inferred from other marine-based proxy records. Experimental studies of the effect of growth rate and the magnitude of intraspecific differences indicate that biological controls on coral skeletal strontium/calcium uptake have been underestimated. These results call into question the reliability of strontium/calcium-based SST reconstructions."
https://openalex.org/W2031001450,"Endoreduplication is an endonuclear chromosome duplication that occurs in the absence of mitosis and in Zea mays (L.) is required for endosperm development. Induction of DNA synthesis during early stages of endosperm development is maintained by increasing the amount and activity of S phase—related protein kinases, which was demonstrated here by their ability to interact with human E2F or with the adenovirus E1A proteins. In addition it was shown that endoreduplicated endosperm cells contain an inhibitor that suppresses the activity of the M phase—promoting factor (MPF). These results demonstrate that in maize endosperm, endoreduplication proceeds as a result of two events, inhibition of MPF and induction of S phase—related protein kinases."

A particularly significant aspect of this description is that it furnishes a natural explanation for the observed differences in clustering properties of objects of different density in terms of multiscaling, the generic consequence of the application of a local density threshold to a multifractal set. The multiscaling hypothesis suggests ways of improving upon the traditional statistical measures of clustering pattern (correlation functions) and exploring further the connection between clustering pattern and dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W1998974496,"BRUSSELS, BELGIUM-High-energy physicists' current explanation for the behavior of subatomic particles and forces, known as the Standard Model, is doing just fine. That was the take-home message for the 800 delegates who gathered here from 27 July to 2 August for the International Europhysics Conference on High-Energy Physics. ""Mainly this was a conference of consolidation, steady progress, many very beautiful and detailed results,"" Christopher Llewellyn Smith, director general of CERN, the European particle physics laboratory, told Science. But while a multitude of presentations described ever more accurate tests and confirmations of the model, physicists also discussed hints that a whole new range of phenomena beyond the Standard Model is lurking just above the energies of current accelerators-and within range of the next generation of experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2035037174,"Abstract In a preceding issue of this journal 2 the the writer pointed out that it had been possible to ascertain which hens were the best layers in a small group of White Plymouth Rocks, (maintained as an experimental flock at the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station) by resort to a method which involved the weighing of the April or the September eggs, and by then calculating, for each individual of the flock, the relation which the mean weight of these April or September eggs bore to the mean weight of the first ten eggs laid by the same bird at the outset of her first laying year. It was pointed out that those hens which showed the highest percentage of increase in mean weight of eggs when this weight was measured at the period of the vernal or of the autumnal production maximum, were, on the average, the best producers of …"
