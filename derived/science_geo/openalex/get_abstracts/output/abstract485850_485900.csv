https://openalex.org/W2082898864,"The cellular cues that regulate the apoptosis of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) remain incompletely understood, yet may play a role in diseases characterized by ISC loss including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) was recently found to be expressed on ISCs, where its activation leads to ISC apoptosis through mechanisms that remain incompletely explained. We now hypothesize that TLR4 induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress within ISCs, leading to their apoptosis in NEC pathogenesis, and that high ER stress within the premature intestine predisposes to NEC development. Using transgenic mice and cultured enteroids, we now demonstrate that TLR4 induces ER stress within Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5)-positive ISCs, resulting in crypt apoptosis. TLR4 signaling within crypts was required, because crypt ER stress and apoptosis occurred in TLR4ΔIEC-OVER mice expressing TLR4 only within intestinal crypts and epithelium, but not TLR4ΔIEC mice lacking intestinal TLR4. TLR4-mediated ER stress and apoptosis of ISCs required PERK (protein kinase-related PKR-like ER kinase), CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), but not ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) or XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1). Human and mouse NEC showed high crypt ER stress and apoptosis, whereas genetic inhibition of PERK or CHOP attenuated ER stress, crypt apoptosis, and NEC severity. Strikingly, using intragastric delivery into fetal mouse intestine, prevention of ER stress reduced TLR4-mediated ISC apoptosis and mucosal disruption. These findings identify a novel link between TLR4-induced ER stress and ISC apoptosis in NEC pathogenesis and suggest that increased ER stress within the premature bowel predisposes to NEC development.

https://openalex.org/W1985895239,"Many studies report significant associations between PM(2.5) (particulate matter <2.5 micrometers) and hospital admissions. These studies mostly rely on a limited number of monitors which introduces exposure error, and excludes rural and suburban populations from locations where monitors are not available, reducing generalizability and potentially creating selection bias.Using prediction models developed by our group, daily PM(2.5) exposure was estimated across the Mid-Atlantic (Washington D.C., and the states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York and West Virginia). We then investigated the short-term effects of PM(2.5)exposures on emergency hospital admissions of the elderly in the Mid-Atlantic region.We performed case-crossover analysis for each admission type, matching on day of the week, month and year and defined the hazard period as lag01 (a moving average of day of admission exposure and previous day exposure).We observed associations between short-term exposure to PM(2.5) and hospitalization for all outcomes examined. For example, for every 10-µg/m(3) increase in short-term PM(2.5) there was a 2.2% increase in respiratory diseases admissions (95% CI = 1.9 to 2.6), and a 0.78% increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) admission rate (95% CI = 0.5 to 1.0). We found differences in risk for CVD admissions between people living in rural and urban areas. For every10-µg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) exposure in the 'rural' group there was a 1.0% increase (95% CI = 0.6 to 1.5), while for the 'urban' group the increase was 0.7% (95% CI = 0.4 to 1.0).Our findings showed that PM(2.5) exposure was associated with hospital admissions for all respiratory, cardio vascular disease, stroke, ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions. In addition, we demonstrate that our AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) based exposure models can be successfully applied to epidemiological studies investigating the health effects of short-term exposures to PM(2.5)."

CENP-A is a unique histone H3 variant conserved in eukaryotic centromeres. The assembly of CENP-A to the centromere is mediated by Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP) in early G1 phase. However, it remains elusive how HJURP governs CENP-A incorporation into the centromere. Here we show that human HJURP directly binds to Mis18β, a component of the Mis18 complex conserved in the eukaryotic kingdom. A minimal region of HJURP for Mis18β binding was mapped to residues 437–460. Depletion of Mis18β by RNA interference dramatically impaired HJURP recruitment to the centromere, indicating the importance of Mis18β in HJURP loading. Interestingly, phosphorylation of HJURP by CDK1 weakens its interaction with Mis18β, consistent with the notion that assembly of CENP-A to the centromere is achieved after mitosis. Taken together, these data define a novel molecular mechanism underlying the temporal regulation of CENP-A incorporation into the centromere by accurate Mis18β-HJURP interaction.

Biochemically, the centromere-targeting domain of CENP-A is sufficient to direct its centromere incorporation, whereas the assembly of a functional kinetochore requires the N-terminal and C-terminal tails of CENP-A (17.Fachinetti D.

A recent study showed that the centromere localization of HJURP is dependent on the Mis18 complex (22.Barnhart M.C. Kuich P.H. Stellfox M.E. Ward J.A. Bassett E.A. Black B.E. Foltz D.R.

However, the mechanism by which Mis18 directs HJURP recruitment to centromere is still unclear. Holliday junction recognition protein immunoprecipitation activation domain binding domain anti-centromere antibody. In this study, we report that Mis18β is a novel binding partner of HJURP. A minimal region of HJURP (residues 437–460) is required for the direct interaction with Mis18β. A central fragment of HJURP (residues 401–490) is sufficient for the centromere recruitment of HJURP. In contrast, a mutant of HJURP lacking residues 437–460 failed to localize on the centromere. Depletion of Mis18β by siRNA perturbed the recruitment of HJURP to the centromere. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of HJURP by CDK1 reduced its binding affinity to Mis18β. Our findings provide novel insights into how centromere deposition of CENP-A occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The cDNA of RbAp46, Mis18α, and CENP-N were amplified from the human testis cDNA library (Clontech) using a standard PCR protocol. The cDNA of Mis18β, Mis18BP1 (Knl-2), and RbAp48 were purchased from GeneCopoeia. The cDNA of HJURP was purchased from Proteintech Group. The cDNA of CENP-C was a gift from Dr. Andrea Musacchio (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). Constructs of AD and BD fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the indicated cDNAs into pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (Clontech), respectively. Constructs of 3×FLAG, GFP, GST, and His6-tagged proteins were generated by subcloning the indicated cDNAs into p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-24 (Sigma), pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), pGEX-5X-3 (GE Healthcare), and pET-28a (Novagen), respectively. To generate mCherry-Mis18β, cDNA of GFP in GFP-Mis18β was replaced by cDNA of mCherry. All constructs of HJURP truncations were generated by ligating restriction enzyme-digested PCR products and corresponding vectors. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (37.Liu D. Ding X. Du J. Cai X. Huang Y. Ward T. Shaw A. Yang Y. Hu R. Jin C. Yao X.

Briefly, the plasmids of BD-tagged protein and AD-tagged protein were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109.

Mitotic cells were lysed in 1× NEBuffer for PMP (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2, complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 0.2% Triton-X-100 on ice for 15 min. Then the cell lysate was treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. For FLAG immunoprecipitation, 293T cells transiently transfected to express FLAG fusion proteins were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 0.2% Triton X-100) on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. To prepare nuclear extract, cells were homogenized in 0.1× IP buffer. Homogenized extracts were centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min. The pellet was suspended in IP buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to produce a chromatin-free extract. Cell lysates or nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h. After washing with IP buffer three times, proteins associated with beads were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. For GFP tag immunoprecipitation, GFP-Trap_A (Chromotek) was used to incubate with cell lysate of GFP-HJURP stable cell line in 1× NEBuffer for PMP (New England Biolabs). Recombinant GST-HJURP-C1 and GST-HJUP-C1-S3A were incubated with 2 units of CDK1-cyclin B (New England Biolabs) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5) containing 100 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated proteins were detected by staining the gel by the Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain Kit (Invitrogen). Then the level of protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of the same gel. HeLa and 293T cells, from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained as subconfluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 8% CO2. To obtain the cell lines stably expressing GFP-HJURP and GFP-HJURP-S3D, respectively, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-HJURP or GFP-HJURP-S3D plasmid using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). Both cell lines were selected in complete medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 and then maintained in complete medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. For synchronization in prometaphase, HeLa cells were treated for 16 h with 50 ng/ml nocodazole. For synchronization in early G1 phase, HeLa cells were treated for 16 h with 2 mm thymidine, washed three times with PBS, and released in complete medium for 8 h and then assayed. Plasmids were transfected into HeLa and 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen: si-HJURP (SI00121674); si-Mis18α (5′-CAGAAGCUAUCCAAACGUGTT-3′); and si-Mis18β (5′-AGGCAGUACUUACAACCUUTT-3′). A scramble RNA duplex (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) was used as a control. All siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804; 1:1,000); anti-α-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich T9026; 1:5,000); human anti-centromere antibody (ACA; a gift from Dr. Don Cleveland, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA; 1:500); anti-Mis18α (Abcam; 1:1000); anti-Mis18β (Proteintech; 12142-1-AP; 1:500); anti-HJURP (Proteintech; 15283–1-AP; 1:500); anti-GFP mAb (Sigma; G6539; 1:1,000); anti-GST (Cell Signaling; 2625; 1:1,000); anti-CENP-A (Cell Signaling; 2186; 1:100); and MPM-2 (Millipore; 05-368; 1:500). HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBST (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min. After fixation, cells were blocked with BSA (1% in PBS) for 1 h. Then cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. After three washes in PBST, cells were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h, followed by DNA staining with DAPI for just 1 min. After three washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in Vecta-Shield medium. Secondary antibodies used here were rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:400), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:400), and Alexa647-conjugated goat anti-human (IgG + IgM) (Molecular Probes; 1:400). Deconvolution images were collected using a Deltavision wide field deconvolution microscope system built on an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope base. For imaging, a ×100, 1.35 numerical aperture lens was used, and optical sections were taken at intervals of 0.3 μm. Images for display were generated by projecting single optical sections as described previously (38.Zhu M. Wang F. Yan F. Yao P.Y. Du J. Gao X. Wang X. Wu Q. Ward T. Li J. Kioko S. Hu R. Xie W.

For live cell imaging, cells were cultured in MatTek glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTek) in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A z-series of three images at 0.5-μm intervals was acquired every 5 min using the same equipment. Image stacks were deconvolved and projected with SoftWorx (Applied Precision) and mounted onto figures with Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe). Quantification of the level of centromere-localizing signal was conducted as described by Liu et al. (37.Liu D. Ding X. Du J. Cai X. Huang Y. Ward T. Shaw A. Yang Y. Hu R. Jin C. Yao X. Human NUF2 interacts with centromere-associated protein E and is essential for a stable spindle microtubule-kinetochore attachment.J. Biol.

In brief, the average pixel intensities from at least 100 centromeres from 10 cells were measured, and background pixel intensities were subtracted. The pixel intensities at each centromere were then normalized against ACA pixel values to account for any variations in staining or image acquisition. The values of specific siRNA-treated cells were then plotted as a percentage of the values obtained from cells transfected with a control scramble siRNA duplex. The values of GFP-HJURP full-length and deletion mutant were expressed as arbitrary units. To determine significant differences between means, unpaired t tests assuming unequal variance were performed; differences were considered significant when p was <0.05. To identify proteins that recruit HJURP to centromeres through direct interaction, we tested the interaction between HJURP and factors that are essential for CENP-A deposition and maintenance via a yeast two-hybrid assay because most recombinant centromeric proteins are either less soluble or unstable (37.Liu D.

As shown in Fig. 1A, our assay showed that HJURP interacts with Mis18β but not Mis18α, Mis18BP1, RbAp46, RbAp48, CENP-C, and CENP-N. To confirm this interaction, a GST pull-down assay using purified GST-HJURP and His-Mis18β was performed (Fig. 1B). Indeed, HJURP directly binds to Mis18β in vitro, as judged by Western blotting of Mis18β in the GST-HJURP-bound fraction (Fig. 1B, bottom, lane 5). No Mis18β was retained on GST-Sepharose beads, suggesting that the interaction between Mis18β and HJURP is specific. To test if Mis18β and HJURP form a cognate complex, we carried out immunoprecipitation using cell lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected to express FLAG-HJURP protein. As shown in Fig. 1C, FLAG immunoprecipitation successfully pulled down FLAG-HJURP based on Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (top, lane 4). Western blotting analysis with an anti-Mis18β antibody confirmed the existence of Mis18β protein in the FLAG-HJURP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C, bottom, lane 4), confirming the existence of HJURP-Mis18β complex in cells. There are two Mis18 isoforms (α and β) in mammalian cells (19.Hayashi T. Fujita Y. Iwasaki O. Adachi Y. Takahashi K. Yanagida M.

To probe whether HJURP forms a cognate complex with Mis18 protein in an isoform-selective manner, we carried out immunoprecipitation using lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected to express FLAG-Mis18α and FLAG-Mis18β, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1D, both FLAG-Mis18α and FLAG-Mis18β proteins expressed at a comparable level in 293T cells judged by Western blotting analysis (bottom, lanes 2 and 3). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation brought down equivalent amount of FLAG-Mis18α and FLAG-Mis18β proteins (bottom, lanes 5 and 6). As predicted, HJURP protein is only present in the Mi"
https://openalex.org/W1997200288,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the world, and it is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Excess dietary fructose causes both metabolic syndrome and NAFLD in rodents and humans, but the pathogenic mechanisms of fructose-induced metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are poorly understood. GLUT8 (Slc2A8) is a facilitative glucose and fructose transporter that is highly expressed in liver, heart, and other oxidative tissues. We previously demonstrated that female mice lacking GLUT8 exhibit impaired first-pass hepatic fructose metabolism, suggesting that fructose transport into the hepatocyte, the primary site of fructose metabolism, is in part mediated by GLUT8. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GLUT8 is required for hepatocyte fructose uptake and for the development of fructose-induced NAFLD. We demonstrate that GLUT8 is a cell surface-localized transporter and that GLUT8 overexpression or GLUT8 shRNA-mediated gene silencing significantly induces and blocks radiolabeled fructose uptake in cultured hepatocytes. We further show diminished fructose uptake and de novo lipogenesis in fructose-challenged GLUT8-deficient hepatocytes. Finally, livers from long term high-fructose diet-fed GLUT8-deficient mice exhibited attenuated fructose-induced hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation without changes in hepatocyte insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. GLUT8 is thus essential for hepatocyte fructose transport and fructose-induced macrosteatosis. Fructose delivery across the hepatocyte membrane is thus a proximal, modifiable disease mechanism that may be exploited to prevent NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2067338532,"Background Approximately one-third of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, interferon (IFN) therapy, prompting a switch to other disease-modifying therapies. Clinical outcomes of switching therapy are unknown. This retrospective study assessed differences in relapse rates among patients with MS switching from IFN to fingolimod or glatiramer acetate (GA) in a real-world setting. Methods US administrative claims data from the PharMetrics Plus™ database were used to identify patients with MS who switched from IFN to fingolimod or GA between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2012. Patients were matched 1∶1 using propensity scores within strata (number of pre-index relapses) on demographic (e.g. age and gender) and disease (e.g. timing of pre-index relapse, comorbidities and symptoms) characteristics. A claims-based algorithm was used to identify relapses while patients were persistent with therapy over 360 days post-switch. Differences in both the probability of experiencing a relapse and the annualized relapse rate (ARR) while persistent with therapy were assessed. Results The matched sample population contained 264 patients (n = 132 in each cohort). Before switching, 33.3% of patients in both cohorts had experienced at least one relapse. During the post-index persistence period, the proportion of patients with at least one relapse was lower in the fingolimod cohort (12.9%) than in the GA cohort (25.0%), and ARRs were lower with fingolimod (0.19) than with GA (0.51). Patients treated with fingolimod had a 59% lower probability of relapse (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.80; p = 0.0091) and 62% fewer relapses per year (rate ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21–0.68; p = 0.0013) compared with those treated with GA. Conclusions In a real-world setting, patients with MS who switched from IFNs to fingolimod were significantly less likely to experience relapses than those who switched to GA."
https://openalex.org/W1992308629,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response that targets multiple components of the cardiovascular system including the microvasculature. Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) are central to normal microvascular function, including maintenance of the microvascular permeability barrier. Microvascular/MVEC dysfunction during sepsis is associated with barrier dysfunction, resulting in the leak of protein-rich edema fluid into organs, especially the lung. The specific role of MVEC apoptosis in septic microvascular/MVEC dysfunction in vivo remains to be determined. To examine pulmonary MVEC death in vivo under septic conditions, we used a murine cecal ligation/perforation (CLP) model of sepsis and identified non-viable pulmonary cells with propidium iodide (PI) by intravital videomicroscopy (IVVM), and confirmed this by histology. Septic pulmonary microvascular Evans blue (EB)-labeled albumin leak was associated with an increased number of PI-positive cells, which were confirmed to be predominantly MVEC based on specific labeling with three markers, anti-CD31 (PECAM), anti-CD34, and lectin binding. Furthermore, this septic death of pulmonary MVEC was markedly attenuated by cyclophosphamide-mediated depletion of neutrophils (PMN) or use of an anti-CD18 antibody developed for immunohistochemistry but shown to block CD18-dependent signaling. Additionally, septic pulmonary MVEC death was iNOS-dependent as mice lacking iNOS had markedly fewer PI-positive MVEC. Septic PI-positive pulmonary cell death was confirmed to be due to apoptosis by three independent markers: caspase activation by FLIVO, translocation of phosphatidylserine to the cell surface by Annexin V binding, and DNA fragmentation by TUNEL. Collectively, these findings indicate that septic pulmonary MVEC death, putatively apoptosis, is a result of leukocyte activation and iNOS-dependent signaling, and in turn, may contribute to pulmonary microvascular barrier dysfunction and albumin hyper-permeability during sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2058236358,"The ability to form biofilms is important for environmental survival, transmission, and infectivity of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera in humans. To form biofilms, V. cholerae produces an extracellular matrix composed of proteins, nucleic acids and a glycoconjugate, termed Vibrio exopolysaccharide (VPS). Here, we present the data on isolation and characterization of the polysaccharide part of the VPS (VPS-PS), which has the following structure: where α-D-Glc is partially (∼20%) replaced with α-D-GlcNAc. α-GulNAcAGly is an amide between 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-guluronic acid and glycine. Apparently, the polysaccharide is bound to a yet unidentified component, which gives it high viscosity and completely suppresses any NMR signals belonging to the sugar chains of the VPS. The only reliable method to remove this component at present is a treatment of the whole glycoconjugate with concentrated hydrochloric acid."
https://openalex.org/W1990769642,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small ncRNAs that repress gene expression on the post-transcriptional level by the degradation or translation inhibition of target mRNA.Three small RNA libraries from oyster haemocytes were sequenced on the Illumina platform to investigate the latent immunomodulation of miRNAs after bacteria challenge and heat stress. Totally, 10,498,663, 8,588,606 and 9,679,663 high-quality reads were obtained in the control, bacteria and bacteria+heat library, respectively, from which 199 oyster miRNAs including 71 known and 128 novel ones were identified. Among these miRNAs, 6 known and 23 novel ones were predicted to possess more than one precursor-coding region, and cgi-miR-10a, cgi-miR-184b, cgi-miR-100, cgi-miR-1984 and cgi-miR-67a were observed to be the most abundant miRNAs in the control library. The expression levels of 22 miRNAs in the bacteria library were significantly higher than those in the control library, while there were another 33 miRNAs whose expression levels were significantly lower than that in the control library. Meanwhile, the expression levels of 65 miRNAs in the bacteria+heat library changed significantly compared to those in the bacteria library. The target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs were annotated, and they fell in immune and stress-related GO terms including antioxidant, cell killing, death, immune system process, and response to stimulus. Furthermore, there were 42 differentially expressed miRNAs detected in both control/bacteria and bacteria/bacteria+heat comparisons, among which 9 miRNAs displayed the identical pattern in the two comparisons, and the expression alterations of 8 miRNAs were confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR.These results indicated collectively that immune challenge could induce the expression of immune-related miRNAs, which might modulate the immune response such as redox reaction, phagocytosis and apoptosis, and the expression of some immune-related miRNAs could be also regulated by heat stress to improve the environmental adaption of oyster."
https://openalex.org/W2020211419,"Malignant gliomas are highly invasive, proliferative, and resistant to treatment. Previously, we have shown that p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is a novel mediator of invasion of human glioma cells. However, the role of p75NTR in glioma proliferation is unknown. Here we used brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and show that BTICs express neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) and their ligands (NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin 3) and secrete NGF. Down-regulation of p75NTR significantly decreased proliferation of BTICs. Conversely, exogenouous NGF stimulated BTIC proliferation through α- and γ-secretase-mediated p75NTR cleavage and release of its intracellular domain (ICD). In contrast, overexpression of the p75NTR ICD induced proliferation. Interestingly, inhibition of Trk signaling blocked NGF-stimulated BTIC proliferation and p75NTR cleavage, indicating a role of Trk in p75NTR signaling. Further, blocking p75NTR cleavage attenuated Akt activation in BTICs, suggesting role of Akt in p75NTR-mediated proliferation. We also found that p75NTR, α-secretases, and the four subunits of the γ-secretase enzyme were elevated in glioblastoma multiformes patients. Importantly, the ICD of p75NTR was commonly found in malignant glioma patient specimens, suggesting that the receptor is activated and cleaved in patient tumors. These results suggest that p75NTR proteolysis is required for BTIC proliferation and is a novel potential clinical target."
https://openalex.org/W2021952073,"PII signaling proteins comprise one of the most versatile signaling devices in nature and have a highly conserved structure. In cyanobacteria, PipX and N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase are receptors of PII signaling, and these interactions are modulated by ADP, ATP, and 2-oxoglutarate. These effector molecules bind interdependently to three anti-cooperative binding sites on the trimeric PII protein and thereby affect its structure. Here we used the PII protein from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to reveal the structural basis of anti-cooperative ADP binding. Furthermore, we clarified the mutual influence of PII-receptor interaction and sensing of the ATP/ADP ratio. The crystal structures of two forms of trimeric PII, one with one ADP bound and the other with all three ADP-binding sites occupied, revealed significant differences in the ADP binding mode: at one site (S1) ADP is tightly bound through side-chain and main-chain interactions, whereas at the other two sites (S2 and S3) the ADP molecules are only bound by main-chain interactions. In the presence of the PII-receptor PipX, the affinity of ADP to the first binding site S1 strongly increases, whereas the affinity for ATP decreases due to PipX favoring the S1 conformation of PII-ADP. In consequence, the PII-PipX interaction is highly sensitive to subtle fluctuations in the ATP/ADP ratio. By contrast, the PII-N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase interaction, which is negatively affected by ADP, is insensitive to these fluctuations.

The 2-OG binding site is located at the base of the T-loop in direct vicinity of the β- and γ-phosphate of ATP, which ligates 2-OG through a chelated Mg2+ ion (11.Fokina O. Chellamuthu V.R.

Consequently, binding of ATP and 2-OG is synergistic (13.Forchhammer K. Hedler A.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because ADP competes with Mg2+-ATP in binding to PII, it negatively affects the binding of 2-OG and thereby interferes with the ability of PII to sense the signal of nitrogen starvation (10.Jiang P.

The three 2-OG binding sites exhibit negative cooperativity relative to each other, which is mediated through intersubunit signaling inside the trimer (9.Fokina O. Chellamuthu V.R. Zeth K. Forchhammer K. A novel signal transduction protein PII variant from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 indicates a two-step process for NAGK-PII complex formation.J. Mol.

In living cells ATP and ADP are simultaneously present, and they compete for the three nucleotide-binding sites of the PII trimer. The total concentration of these effectors in bacterial cells is in the millimolar range (16.Chapman A.G. Fall L. Atkinson D.E. Adenylate energy charge in Escherichia coli during growth and starvation.J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 1072-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Chapman A.G. Atkinson D.E.

Internal pH and ATP-ADP pools in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. during exposure to growth-inhibiting low pH.J.

A novel signal transduction protein PII variant from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 indicates a two-step process for NAGK-PII complex formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 399: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); therefore, all three binding sites of PII are presumably always occupied by either ATP or ADP. Considering that 2-OG is only able to bind to the sites occupied by Mg2+-ATP, PII proteins could theoretically adopt 20 different ligand binding states, but considering that in vivo all sites are filled with either ATP or ADP, only 10 states would be possible. If the ligand binding properties are taken into account, only 5–7 states are probable in vivo. At high ATP concentrations, all PII sites are filled with Mg-ATP (PII-ATP3) and up to three 2-OG molecules can be bound, thereby measuring this effector with the highest sensitivity. As the ADP concentration increases, the PII-ATP2-ADP1 population forms. Only when the ADP concentration exceeds that of ATP would the PII-ATP1-ADP2 population accumulate, as the binding affinity of ADP is lower than that of ATP. In general, the mixed populations (PII-ATP2-ADP1 and PII-ATP1-ADP2) have fewer 2-OG binding sites than PII-ATP3, and calorimetric titration experiments have shown that at an ATP:ADP ratio of 1:1, only one 2-OG is bound (15.Fokina O. Herrmann C. Forchhammer K. Signal-transduction protein PII from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 senses low adenylate energy charge in vitro.Biochem. J. 2011; 440: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The failure to detect two binding sites for 2-OG under these conditions indicates either that the PII-ATP2-ADP1 species can bind only one 2-OG molecule or, more unlikely, that in the presence of equimolar ADP and ATP, the PII-ATP1-ADP2 species is preferentially formed. PII proteins from oxygenic phototrophs (cyanobacteria and plants) control arginine biosynthesis through the arginine feedback-inhibited enzyme N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK) (19.Burillo S.

PII binding to NAGK enhances the activity of the enzyme and protects it from feedback inhibition by arginine (21.Maheswaran M. Urbanke C. Forchhammer K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 55202-55210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PII in the ATP-ligated state avidly binds to NAGK, whereas in the presence of ADP, complex formation is impaired, and as a consequence, NAGK activity is not enhanced (15.Fokina O. Herrmann C.

J. 2011; 440: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Likewise, the effector 2-OG strongly inhibits PII-NAGK complex formation. Thus, the inhibitory effect of 2-OG is not antagonized by ADP and is, therefore, robust against different ATP/ADP ratios (15.Fokina O. Herrmann C. Forchhammer K.

PII binds PipX in the absence of 2-OG, with ADP strongly enhancing the PII-PipX interaction and antagonizing the inhibitory 2-OG effect even at low ADP concentrations (15.Fokina O. Herrmann C.

Binding of ATP and ADP is a general property of PII proteins in living cells (5.Huergo L.F. Pedrosa F.O. Muller-Santos M. Chubatsu L.S. Monteiro R.A. Merrick M. Souza E.M.

In Escherichia coli, which has two PII paralogues, GlnB and GlnK, ADP acts as an antagonist of 2-OG in the GlnB-mediated regulation of the NRI/NRII two-component system and of the adenylyltransferase-glutamine synthetase monocycle in vitro. ADP also inhibits uridylylation of GlnB by the bifunctional enzyme uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme (UTase) (10.Jiang P. Ninfa A.J.

In the presence of ADP, the PII paralogue GlnK forms a complex and thereby blocks the ammonium transporter AmtB, a reaction that is antagonized by Mg2+/ATP/2-OG (14.Radchenko M.V. Thornton J. Merrick M. Control of AmtB-GlnK complex formation by intracellular levels of ATP, ADP, and 2-oxoglutarate.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31037-31045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, Radchenko et al. (26.Radchenko M.V. Thornton J. Merrick M.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 12948-12953Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that in the absence of 2-OG, GlnK displays intrinsic ATPase activity, slowly converting ATP-GlnK to ADP-GlnK, which then tightly binds AmtB. Sensing of the energy charge levels has also been suggested for the PII proteins from Rhodospirillum rubrum (27.Zhang Y. Pohlmann E.L. Halbleib C.M. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P.

ADP stabilizes the GlnJ-AmtB1 complex (GlnJ is a GlnK paralogue) even in the presence of complex-dissociating ATP-2-OG levels (29.Teixeira P.F. Jonsson A. Frank M. Wang H. Nordlund S.

The affinities toward ATP and ADP and the anti-cooperativity between the binding sites are key features of PII proteins that determine their ability to function as energy sensors. In this respect it is important to note that the fine-tuned ligand binding properties of PII proteins from different sources are variable (30.Maier S. Schleberger P. Lü W. Wacker T. Pflüger T.

We also analyzed the role of energy charge sensing (energy charge measured as the ATP/ADP ratio) for the PipX/NtcA-PII·NAGK interaction network. Based on our data and previously published data, we conclude that the PII signal transduction system does not work as an on/off switch governed by the intrinsic ATPase activity of PI, but rather as a multitasking signal integration device with flexible signal output dependent on its receptor protein.

https://openalex.org/W2047140120,"Triglycerides within the cytosol of cells are stored in a phylogenetically conserved organelle called the lipid droplet (LD). LDs can be formed at the endoplasmic reticulum, but mechanisms that regulate the formation of LDs are incompletely understood. Adipose tissue has a high capacity to form lipid droplets and store triglycerides. Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FITM2/FIT2) is highly expressed in adipocytes, and data indicate that FIT2 has an important role in the formation of LDs in cells, but whether FIT2 has a physiological role in triglyceride storage in adipose tissue remains unproven. Here we show that adipose-specific deficiency of FIT2 (AF2KO) in mice results in progressive lipodystrophy of white adipose depots and metabolic dysfunction. In contrast, interscapular brown adipose tissue of AF2KO mice accumulated few but large LDs without changes in cellular triglyceride levels. High fat feeding of AF2KO mice or AF2KO mice on the genetically obese ob/ob background accelerated the onset of lipodystrophy. At the cellular level, primary adipocyte precursors of white and brown adipose tissue differentiated in vitro produced fewer but larger LDs without changes in total cellular triglyceride or triglyceride biosynthesis. These data support the conclusion that FIT2 plays an essential, physiological role in fat storage in vivo."

Here we report that mammalian DISC1 endogenously expressed in oligodendroglial lineage cells negatively regulates differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into oligodendrocytes. DISC1 expression was detected in oligodendrocytes of the mouse corpus callosum at P14 and P70. DISC1 mRNA was expressed in primary cultured rat cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells and decreased when oligodendrocyte precursor cells were induced to differentiate by PDGF deprivation. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that overexpressed DISC1 was localized in the cell bodies and processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes. We show that expression of the myelin related markers, CNPase and MBP, as well as the number of cells with a matured oligodendrocyte morphology, were decreased following full length DISC1 overexpression. Conversely, both expression of CNPase and the number of oligodendrocytes with a mature morphology were increased following knockdown of endogenous DISC1 by RNA interference. Overexpression of a truncated form of DISC1 also resulted in an increase in expression of myelin related proteins and the number of mature oligodendrocytes, potentially acting via a dominant negative mechanism. We also identified involvement of Sox10 and Nkx2.2 in the DISC1 regulatory pathway of oligodendrocyte differentiation, both well-known transcription factors involved in the regulation of myelin genes."
https://openalex.org/W2011477876,"Selenoproteins are a unique family of proteins, characterized by the co-translational incorporation of selenium as selenocysteine, which play key roles in antioxidant defense. Among selenoproteins, selenoprotein P (Sepp1) is particularly distinctive due to the fact that it contains multiple selenocysteine residues and has been postulated to act in selenium transport. Within the brain, Sepp1 delivers selenium to neurons by binding to the ApoER2 receptor. Upon feeding a selenium-deficient diet, mice lacking ApoER2 or Sepp1 develop severe neurological dysfunction and exhibit widespread brainstem neurodegeneration, indicating an important role for ApoER2-mediated Sepp1 uptake in normal brain function. Selenocysteine lyase (Scly) is an enzyme that plays an important role in selenium homeostasis, in that it catalyzes the decomposition of selenocysteine and allows selenium to be recycled for additional selenoprotein synthesis. We previously reported that constitutive deletion of Scly results in neurological deficits only when mice are challenged with a low selenium diet. To gain insight into the relationship between Sepp1 and Scly in selenium metabolism, we created novel transgenic mice constitutively lacking both genes (Scly(-/-)Sepp1(-/-)) and characterized the neurobehavioral phenotype. We report that deletion of Scly in conjunction with Sepp1 further aggravates the phenotype of Sepp1(-/-) mice, as these mice needed supraphysiological selenium supplementation to survive, and surviving mice exhibited impaired motor coordination, audiogenic seizures, and brainstem neurodegeneration. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that Scly and Sepp1 work cooperatively to maintain selenoprotein function in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2031377104,"Territorial aggression influences fitness and, in monogamous pairs, the behavior of both individuals could impact reproductive success. Moreover, territorial aggression is particularly important in the context of interspecific competition. Tree swallows and eastern bluebirds are highly aggressive, secondary cavity-nesting birds that compete for limited nesting sites. We studied eastern bluebirds at a field site in the southern Appalachian Mountains that has been recently colonized (<40 yr) by tree swallows undergoing a natural range expansion. The field site is composed of distinct areas where bluebirds compete regularly with tree swallows and areas where there is little interaction between the two species. Once birds had settled, we measured how interspecific competition affects the relationship between assortative mating (paired individuals that behave similarly) and reproductive success in eastern bluebirds. We found a strong tendency toward assortative mating throughout the field site. In areas of high interspecific competition, pairs that behaved the most similarly and displayed either extremely aggressive or extremely non-aggressive phenotypes experienced higher reproductive success. Our data suggest that interspecific competition with tree swallows may select for bluebirds that express similar behavior to that of their mate. Furthermore, animal personality may be an important factor influencing the outcome of interactions between native and aggressive, invasive species."

Protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) has been shown to be up-regulated in VSMCs of injured arteries. PKCδ knock-out (Prkcd−/−) mice are resistant to inflammation as well as apoptosis in models of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, the precise mechanism by which PKCδ modulates inflammation remains incompletely understood. In this study, we identified four inflammatory chemokines (Ccl2/Mcp-1, Ccl7, Cxcl16, and Cx3cl1) of over 45 PKCδ-regulated genes associated with inflammatory response by microarray analysis. Using CCL2 as a prototype, we demonstrated that PKCδ stimulated chemokine expression at the transcriptional level. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway or siRNA knockdown of subunit p65, but not p50, eliminated the effect of PKCδ on Ccl2 expression. Overexpressing PKCδ followed by incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in an increase in p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation and enhanced DNA binding affinity without affecting IκB degradation or p65 nuclear translocation. Prkcd gene deficiency impaired p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation and DNA binding affinity in response to TNFα. Results from in situ proximity ligation analysis and co-immunoprecipitation performed on cultured VSMCs and aneurysmal aorta demonstrated physical interaction between PKCδ and p65 that took place largely outside the nucleus. Promoting nuclear translocation of PKCδ with peptide ψδRACK diminished Ccl2 production, whereas inhibition of PKCδ translocation with peptide δV1-1 enhanced Ccl2 expression. Together, these results suggest that PKCδ modulates inflammation at least in part through the NF-κB-mediated chemokines.

https://openalex.org/W1989459314,"Whereas the series of genetic events leading to colorectal cancer (CRC) have been well established, the precise functions that these alterations play in tumor progression and how they disrupt intestinal homeostasis remain poorly characterized. Activation of the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway by a mutation in the gene APC is the most common trigger for CRC, inducing benign lesions that progress to carcinomas due to the accumulation of other genetic alterations. Among those, Ras mutations drive tumour progression in CRC, as well as in most epithelial cancers. As mammalian and Drosophila's intestines share many similarities, we decided to explore the alterations induced in the Drosophila midgut by the combined activation of the Wnt signaling pathway with gain of function of Ras signaling in the intestinal stem cells. Here we show that compound Apc-Ras clones, but not clones bearing the individual mutations, expand as aggressive intestinal tumor-like outgrowths. These lesions reproduce many of the human CRC hallmarks such as increased proliferation, blockade of cell differentiation and cell polarity and disrupted organ architecture. This process is followed by expression of tumoral markers present in human lesions. Finally, a metabolic behavioral assay shows that these flies suffer a progressive deterioration in intestinal homeostasis, providing a simple readout that could be used in screens for tumor modifiers or therapeutic compounds. Taken together, our results illustrate the conservation of the mechanisms of CRC tumorigenesis in Drosophila, providing an excellent model system to unravel the events that, upon mutation in Apc and Ras, lead to CRC initiation and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2003831746,"Background The ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is a fluoro-immunoassay that allows detection of specific IgE to 112 molecular components from 51 allergenic sources. We studied the reliability of this technique intra- and inter- assay, as well as inter-batch- and inter-laboratory-assay. Methods Twenty samples were studied, nineteen sera from polysensitized allergic patients, and the technique calibrator provided by the manufacturer (CTR02). We measured the sIgE from CTR02 and three patients' sera ten times in the same and in different assays. Furthermore, all samples were tested in two laboratories and with two batches of ISAC kit. To evaluate the accuracy of ISAC 112, we contrasted the determinations of CTR02 calibrator with their expected values by T Student test. To analyse the precision, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, and to analyse the repeatability and the reproducibility, we calculated the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to each allergen. Results The results obtained for CTR02 were similar to those expected in 7 of 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, whereas in 8 allergens the results showed significant differences. The mean CV obtained in the CTR02 determinations was of 9.4%, and the variability of sera from patients was of 22.9%. The agreement in the intra- and inter-assay analysis was very good to 94 allergens and good to one. In the inter-batch analyse, we obtained a very good agreement to 82 allergens, good to 14, moderate to 5 allergens, poor to one, and bad to 1 allergen. In the inter-laboratory analyse, we obtained a very good agreement to 73 allergens, good to 22, moderate to 6 and poor to two allergens. Conclusion The allergen microarray immunoassay, ISAC 112, is a repeatable and reproducible in vitro diagnostic tool for determination of sIgE beyond the own laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2076770545,"The human gastrointestinal tract harbours a complex microbial community which exist in planktonic and sessile form. The degree to which composition and function of faecal and mucosal microbiota differ remains unclear. We describe the development and characterisation of an in vitro human gut model, which can be used to facilitate the formation and longitudinal analysis of mature mixed species biofilms. This enables the investigation of the role of biofilms in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). A well established and validated human gut model of simulated CDI was adapted to incorporate glass rods that create a solid-gaseous-liquid interface for biofilm formation. The continuous chemostat model was inoculated with a pooled human faecal emulsion and controlled to mimic colonic conditions in vivo. Planktonic and sessile bacterial populations were enumerated for up to 46 days. Biofilm consistently formed macroscopic structures on all glass rods over extended periods of time, providing a framework to sample and analyse biofilm structures independently. Whilst variation in biofilm biomass is evident between rods, populations of sessile bacterial groups (log10 cfu/g of biofilm) remain relatively consistent between rods at each sampling point. All bacterial groups enumerated within the planktonic communities were also present within biofilm structures. The planktonic mode of growth of C. difficile and gut microbiota closely reflected observations within the original gut model. However, distinct differences were observed in the behaviour of sessile and planktonic C. difficile populations, with C. difficile spores preferentially persisting within biofilm structures. The redesigned biofilm chemostat model has been validated for reproducible and consistent formation of mixed species intestinal biofilms. This model can be utilised for the analysis of sessile mixed species communities longitudinally, potentially providing information of the role of biofilms in CDI."
https://openalex.org/W2171352651,"Purpose The training response of an intensified period of high-intensity exercise is not clear. Therefore, we compared the cardiovascular adaptations of completing 24 high-intensity aerobic interval training sessions carried out for either three or eight weeks, respectively. Methods Twenty-one healthy subjects (23.0±2.1 years, 10 females) completed 24 high-intensity training sessions throughout a time-period of either eight weeks (moderate frequency, MF) or three weeks (high frequency, HF) followed by a detraining period of nine weeks without any training. In both groups, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was evaluated before training, at the 9th and 17th session and four days after the final 24th training session. In the detraining phase VO2max was evaluated after 12 days and thereafter every second week for eight weeks. Left ventricular echocardiography, carbon monoxide lung diffusion transfer factor, brachial artery flow mediated dilatation and vastus lateralis citrate maximal synthase activity was tested before and after training. Results The cardiovascular adaptation after HF training was delayed compared to training with MF. Four days after ending training the HF group showed no improvement (+3.0%, p = 0.126), whereas the MF group reached their highest VO2max with a 10.7% improvement (p<0.001: group difference p = 0.035). The HF group reached their highest VO2max (6.1% increase, p = 0.026) twelve days into the detraining period, compared to a concomitant reduction to 7.9% of VO2max (p<0.001) above baseline in the MF group (group difference p = 0.609). Conclusion Both HF and MF training of high-intensity aerobic exercise improves VO2max. The cardiovascular adaptation following a HF programme of high-intensity exercise is however delayed compared to MF training. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00733941."

Sortases have proven to be useful molecular biology tools to site-specifically attach proteins to a variety of biomolecules and are considered a potential drug target because they display virulence factors. The clinically important pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, displays surface proteins using two sortase enzymes, sortase A (SrtA) 2The abbreviations used are: SrtAS. aureus sortase ASrtBS. aureus sortase BMDmolecular dynamics. and sortase B (SrtB). srtA− strains of S. aureus are significantly attenuated in virulence, whereas srtB− strains establish less persistent infections (7.Mazmanian S.K.

SrtA plays a “housekeeping” role in the cell, covalently mounting a variety of proteins to the cell wall, whereas SrtB anchors the heme transporter IsdC, a key component of the iron-regulated surface determinant system that captures heme-iron from hemoglobin (10.Maresso A.W.

Proteins anchored by SrtA possess a C-terminal cell wall sorting signal that consists of an LPXTG motif that is processed by the enzyme, followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a positively charged C-terminal tail (13.Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Sorting of protein A to the staphylococcal cell wall.Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). SrtA operates through a ping-pong mechanism that begins when its active site cysteine residue nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of the threonine in the LPXTG motif. This results in a tetrahedral intermediate that, after cleavage of the threonine-glycine peptide bond, generates a semistable enzyme-substrate thioacyl intermediate (14.Frankel B.A. Kruger R.G.

The protein is then transferred by SrtA to the cell wall precursor, lipid II, when the amino group in this molecule nucleophilically attacks the thioacyl linkage creating a second tetrahedral intermediate that collapses to form the covalently linked protein-lipid II product (16.Perry A.M.

SrtB anchors the IsdC protein to the cell wall through a similar mechanism.

However, only a single structure of a sortase enzyme covalently bound to its sorting signal substrate has been reported (the NMR structure of SrtA bound to an LPAT substrate analog) (1.Spirig T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 24465-24477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This structure revealed that the active site in this enzyme undergoes substantial changes in its structure and dynamics that facilitate specific recognition of the sorting signal, but it did not provide an atomic level view of the positioning of atoms within the active site because their coordinates were not well defined in the NMR structure because of resonance line broadening. Thus, the structural features utilized by sortases to stabilize key tetrahedral and thioacyl reaction intermediates remain poorly understood. Here we report the 2.5 Å crystal structure of SrtB covalently bound to an analog of its NPQTN sorting signal. The structure of the complex closely resembles the thioacyl intermediate formed during catalysis, laying the groundwork for MD simulations to investigate the catalytic mechanism. The results of these simulations and in vitro transpeptidation measurements suggest that Arg233 and the backbone amide of Glu224 form an oxyanion hole that stabilizes high energy tetrahedral catalytic intermediates. Interestingly, a highly conserved threonine residue within the sorting signal actively participates in constructing the oxyanion hole by hydrogen bonding to the active site arginine residue. MD simulations of SrtA, as well as primary sequence conservation, suggest that all sortases will use a similar substrate-stabilized mechanism to anchor proteins to the cell wall or to assemble pili. DNA encoding SrtB (residues 31–244) was amplified by PCR from S. aureus genomic DNA, cloned into a pE-SUMO vector (LifeSensors) and transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to continue for 16 h at 16 °C. Protein was purified by affinity purification using HisPur cobalt resin (Thermo) per the manufacturer's instructions. The His6-SUMO tag was then cleaved by incubating the protein overnight at 4 °C with recombinant ULP1 protease and removed by reapplying the protein mixture to the HisPur cobalt resin. Cbz-NPQT* (where T* is (2R,3S)-3-amino-4-mercapto-2-butanol, and Cbz is a carbobenzyloxy protecting group) was synthesized as in Ref. 34.Jung M.E. Clemens J.J. Suree N. Liew C.K. Pilpa R.

The reaction was first reduced with 1 mm DTT for 4 h, then oxidized by addition of 10 mm CuCl2, and allowed to rock gently at room temperature for 7 days. Production of stable complex was confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Crystals of the SrtB-NPQT* complex were produced from a stock of 150 μm SrtB-NPQT* in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method in 2.8 m ammonium sulfate, 70 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0. Data were collected on Beamline 24-ID-C at 100 K at the Advanced Photon Source (λ = 0.964 Å). Three data sets were scaled, integrated, and merged using XDS and XSCALE (35.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11286) Google Scholar). Using conventional criteria, the resolution boundary for the data set might have been drawn at 2.9 Å given that I/σ in this shell (2.98–2.90 Å) is 2.0, and Rmerge is 72%, with a completeness of 95% and a multiplicity of 5.2. However, recent studies from Karplus and Diederichs (36.Karplus P.A. Diederichs K. Linking crystallographic model and data quality.Science. 2012; 336: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) have indicated that the CC1/2 statistic has superior properties as an indicator of data precision compared with Rmerge. Moreover, in their study, and in the following work (37.Diederichs K. Karplus P.A. Better models by discarding data?.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the authors show that high resolution data typically discarded because of high Rmerge values (i.e., over the conventionally acceptable threshold value of ∼60–80%), and low I/σ values (i.e., under the conventionally acceptable threshold value of 2) actually contain information that can improve the quality of the model if used in refinement. Given these results, we thought our model would improve if we used the more generous resolution cutoff (2.5 Å) indicated by the CC1/2 statistic (50.4% in the 2.5 Å shell), rather than a conventionally accepted limit (2.9 Å) indicated by the Rmerge and I/σ statistics. Thus, data extending to 2.5 Å resolution were used for the refinement process, although by conventional standards, the structure should be considered to be resolved at 2.9 Å resolution. Phases were determined by molecular replacement using the unmodified SrtB structure (28.Zhang R. Wu R. Joachimiak G. Mazmanian S.K. Missiakas D.M. Gornicki P. Schneewind O. Joachimiak A.

The reactions were quenched by adding 50 μl of 1 m HCl and injected onto a Waters XSelect HSS C18 reversed phase HPLC column. Peptides were eluted by applying a gradient from 3 to 23% acetonitrile (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution of the peptides was monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. Peak fractions were collected, and their identities were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W2086645653,"Background Bumblebees use information provided inadvertently by conspecifics when deciding between different flower foraging options. Such social learning might be explained by relatively simple associative learning mechanism: the bee may learn to associate conspecifics with nectar or pollen reward through previous experience of foraging jointly. However, in some studies, observers were guided by choices of ‘demonstrators’ viewed through a screen, so no reward was given to the observers at the time of seeing other bees’ flowers choice and no demonstrator bee was present at the moment of decision. This behaviour, referred to observational conditioning, implies an additional associative step as the positive value of conspecific is transferred to the associated flower. Here we explore the role of demonstrator movement, and the distance between observers and demonstrators that is required for observation conditioning to take place. Methodology/Principal Findings We identify the conditions under which observational conditioning occurs in the widespread European species Bombus terrestris. The presence of artificial demonstrator bees leads to a significant change in individual colour preference toward the indicated colour if demonstrators were moving and observation distance was limited (15 cm), suggesting that observational conditioning could only influence relatively short-range foraging decisions. In addition, the movement of demonstrators is a crucial factor for observational conditioning, either due to the more life-like appearance of moving artificial bees or an enhanced detectability of moving demonstrators, and an increased efficiency at directing attention to the indicated flower colour. Conclusion Bumblebees possess the capacity to learn the quality of a flower by distal observation of other foragers’ choices. This confirms that social learning in bees involves more advanced processes than simple associative learning, and indicates that observational conditioning might be widespread in pollinating insects, raising intriguing questions for the underlying mechanisms as well as the spread of social information in pollinator-plant interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2019230161,"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible structural changes of the macula in patients with unilateral amblyopia using optical coherence tomography (OCT) image segmentation. Patients and Methods 38 consecutive patients (16 male; mean age 32.4±17.6 years; range 6–67 years) with unilateral amblyopia were involved in this study. OCT examinations were performed with a time-domain OCT device, and a custom-built OCT image analysis software (OCTRIMA) was used for OCT image segmentation. The axial length (AL) was measured by a LenStar LS 900 device. Macular layer thickness, AL and manifest spherical equivalent refraction (MRSE) of the amblyopic eye were compared to that of the fellow eye. We studied if the type of amblyopia (strabismus without anisometropia, anisometropia without strabismus, strabismus with anisometropia) had any influence on macular layer thickness values. Results There was significant difference between the amblyopic and fellow eyes in MRSE and AL in all subgroups. Comparing the amblyopic and fellow eyes, we found a statistically significant difference only in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer in the central region using linear mixed model analysis keeping AL and age under control (p = 0.032). There was no significant difference in interocular difference in the thickness of any macular layers between the subgroups with one-way between-groups ANCOVA while statistically controlling for interocular difference in AL and age. Conclusions According to our results there are subtle changes in amblyopic eyes affecting the outer nuclear layer of the fovea suggesting the possible involvement of the photoreceptors. However, further studies are warranted to support this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2071329378,"Biological soil crusts are common components of desert ecosystem; they cover ground surface and interact with topsoil that contribute to desertification control and degraded land restoration in arid and semiarid regions.To distinguish the changes in topsoil affected by biological soil crusts, we compared topsoil properties across three types of successional biological soil crusts (algae, lichens, and mosses crust), as well as the referenced sandland in the Mu Us Desert, Northern China. Relationships between fractal dimensions of soil particle size distribution and selected soil properties were discussed as well. The results indicated that biological soil crusts had significant positive effects on soil physical structure (P<0.05); and soil organic carbon and nutrients showed an upward trend across the successional stages of biological soil crusts. Fractal dimensions ranged from 2.1477 to 2.3032, and significantly linear correlated with selected soil properties (R(2) = 0.494∼0.955, P<0.01).Biological soil crusts cause an important increase in soil fertility, and are beneficial to sand fixation, although the process is rather slow. Fractal dimension proves to be a sensitive and useful index for quantifying changes in soil properties that additionally implies desertification. This study will be essential to provide a firm basis for future policy-making on optimal solutions regarding desertification control and assessment, as well as degraded ecosystem restoration in arid and semiarid regions."
https://openalex.org/W2085006562,"The β-subunit associates with the α1 pore-forming subunit of high voltage-activated calcium channels and modulates several aspects of ion conduction. Four β-subunits are encoded by four different genes with multiple splice variants. Only two members of this family, β2a and β2e, associate with the plasma membrane in the absence of the α1-subunit. Palmitoylation on a di-cysteine motif located at the N terminus of β2a promotes membrane targeting and correlates with the unique ability of this protein to slow down inactivation. In contrast, the mechanism by which β2e anchors to the plasma membrane remains elusive. Here, we identified an N-terminal segment in β2e encompassing a cluster of positively charged residues, which is strictly required for membrane anchoring, and when transferred to the cytoplasmic β1b isoform it confers membrane localization to the latter. In the presence of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, this segment binds to acidic liposomes dependently on the ionic strength, and the intrinsic fluorescence emission maxima of its single tryptophan blue shifts considerably. Simultaneous substitution of more than two basic residues impairs membrane targeting. Coexpression of the fast inactivating R-type calcium channels with wild-type β2e, but not with a β2e membrane association-deficient mutant, slows down inactivation. We propose that a predicted α-helix within this domain orienting parallel to the membrane tethers the β2e-subunit to the lipid bilayer via electrostatic interactions. Penetration of the tryptophan side chain into the lipidic core stabilizes the membrane-bound conformation. This constitutes a new mechanism for membrane anchoring among the β-subunit family that also sustains slowed inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1974577226,"Recent studies of the larvae of coral-reef fishes reveal that these tiny vertebrates possess remarkable swimming capabilities, as well as the ability to orient to olfactory, auditory, and visual cues. While navigation according to reef-generated chemicals and sounds can significantly affect dispersal, the effect is limited to the vicinity of the reef. Effective long-distance navigation requires at least one other capacity–the ability to maintain a bearing using, for example, a sun compass. Directional information in the sun’s position can take the form of polarized-light related cues (i.e., e-vector orientation and percent polarization) and/or non-polarized-light related cues (i.e., the direct image of the sun, and the brightness and spectral gradients). We examined the response to both types of cues using commercially-reared post-larvae of the spine-cheeked anemonefish Premnas biaculeatus. Initial optomotor trials indicated that the post-larval stages are sensitive to linearly polarized light. Swimming directionality was then tested using a Drifting In-Situ Chamber (DISC), which allowed us to examine the response of the post-larvae to natural variation in light conditions and to manipulated levels of light polarization. Under natural light conditions, 28 of 29 post-larvae showed significant directional swimming (Rayleigh’s test p<0.05, R = 0.74±0.23), but to no particular direction. Swimming directionality was positively affected by sky clarity (absence of clouds and haze), which explained 38% of the observed variation. Moreover, post-larvae swimming under fully polarized light exhibited a distinct behavior of tracking the polarization axis, as it rotated along with the DISC. This behavior was not observed under partially-polarized illumination. We view these findings as an indication for the use of sun-related cues, and polarized light signal in specific, by orienting coral-reef fish larvae."

https://openalex.org/W2081660551,"Most diagnostic laboratories are confronted with the increasing demand for molecular diagnosis from patients and families and the ever-increasing genetic heterogeneity of visual disorders. Concerning Retinal Dystrophies (RD), almost 200 causative genes have been reported to date, and most families carry private mutations. We aimed to approach RD genetic diagnosis using all the available genetic information to prioritize candidates for mutational screening, and then restrict the number of cases to be analyzed by massive sequencing. We constructed and optimized a comprehensive cosegregation RD-chip based on SNP genotyping and haplotype analysis. The RD-chip allows to genotype 768 selected SNPs (closely linked to 100 RD causative genes) in a single cost-, time-effective step. Full diagnosis was attained in 17/36 Spanish pedigrees, yielding 12 new and 12 previously reported mutations in 9 RD genes. The most frequently mutated genes were USH2A and CRB1. Notably, RD3-up to now only associated to Leber Congenital Amaurosis- was identified as causative of Retinitis Pigmentosa. The main assets of the RD-chip are: i) the robustness of the genetic information that underscores the most probable candidates, ii) the invaluable clues in cases of shared haplotypes, which are indicative of a common founder effect, and iii) the detection of extended haplotypes over closely mapping genes, which substantiates cosegregation, although the assumptions in which the genetic analysis is based could exceptionally lead astray. The combination of the genetic approach with whole exome sequencing (WES) greatly increases the diagnosis efficiency, and revealed novel mutations in USH2A and GUCY2D. Overall, the RD-chip diagnosis efficiency ranges from 16% in dominant, to 80% in consanguineous recessive pedigrees, with an average of 47%, well within the upper range of massive sequencing approaches, highlighting the validity of this time- and cost-effective approach whilst high-throughput methodologies become amenable for routine diagnosis in medium sized labs."
https://openalex.org/W2022663539,"The structural properties of the DNA molecule are known to play a critical role in transcription. In this paper, the structural profiles of promoter regions were studied within the context of their diversity and their function for eleven prokaryotic species; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas auroginosa, Geobacter sulfurreducens Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp., Synechoccocus elongates, Bacillus anthracis, and the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus. The main anchor point for these promoter regions were transcription start sites identified through high-throughput experiments or collected within large curated databases. Prokaryotic promoter regions were found to be less stable and less flexible than the genomic mean across all studied species. However, direct comparison between species revealed differences in their structural profiles that can not solely be explained by the difference in genomic GC content. In addition, comparison with functional data revealed that there are patterns in the promoter structural profiles that can be linked to specific functional loci, such as sigma factor regulation or transcription factor binding. Interestingly, a novel structural element clearly visible near the transcription start site was found in genes associated with essential cellular functions and growth in several species. Our analyses reveals the great diversity in promoter structural profiles both between and within prokaryotic species. We observed relationships between structural diversity and functional features that are interesting prospects for further research to yet uncharacterized functional loci defined by DNA structural properties."

The effect of occupational exposure on other characteristics of COPD, especially those reflecting emphysema, has not been studied in these patients.We studied 338 patients hospitalized for a first exacerbation of COPD in 9 Spanish hospitals, obtaining full occupational history in a face-to-face interview; job codes were linked to a job exposure matrix for semi-quantitative estimation of exposure to mineral/biological dust, and gases/fumes for each job held. Patients underwent spirometry, diffusing capacity testing and analysis of gases in stable conditions. Quality of life, dyspnea and chronic bronchitis symptoms were determined with a questionnaire interview. A high- resolution CT scan was available in 133 patients.94% of the patients included were men, with a mean age of 68(8.5) years and a mean FEV1% predicted 52 (16). High exposure to gases or fumes was associated with chronic bronchitis, and exposure to mineral dust and gases/fumes was associated with higher scores for symptom perception in the St. George's questionnaire. No occupational agent was associated with a lower FEV1. High exposure to all occupational agents was associated with better lung diffusion capacity, in long-term quitters.

https://openalex.org/W2130830586,"ISWI is the catalytic subunit of several ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors that catalyse the sliding of nucleosomes along DNA and thereby endow chromatin with structural flexibility. Full activity of ISWI requires residues of a basic patch of amino acids in the N-terminal 'tail' of histone H4. Previous studies employing oligopeptides and mononucleosomes suggested that acetylation of the H4 tail at lysine 16 (H4K16) within the basic patch may inhibit the activity of ISWI. On the other hand, the acetylation of H4K16 is known to decompact chromatin fibres. Conceivably, decompaction may enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA and the H4 tail for ISWI interactions. Such an effect can only be evaluated at the level of nucleosome arrays. We probed the influence of H4K16 acetylation on the ATPase and nucleosome sliding activity of Drosophila ISWI in the context of defined, in vitro reconstituted chromatin fibres with physiological nucleosome spacing and linker histone content. Contrary to widespread expectations, the acetylation did not inhibit ISWI activity, but rather stimulated ISWI remodelling under certain conditions. Therefore, the effect of H4K16 acetylation on ISWI remodelling depends on the precise nature of the substrate."

However, the extent to which the scales are appropriate for people with a visibly different appearance has not previously been reported. Neither has the moderating effect of appearance salience (CARSAL) on the relationship between appearance valence (CARVAL) and appearance self-consciousness, previously shown in a general population sample, been replicated with people who are visibly different. Twelve hundred and sixty five participants with a visible difference in either secondary care (n = 651) or the community (n = 614) provided data. Analysis confirmed the psychometric qualities of both CARSAL and CARVAL, and the conceptual independence of each scale. The scales also demonstrated independent and interdependent relationships with social anxiety and avoidance in relation to appearance, depression and anxiety. Appearance salience moderated the relationship with valence on these psychosocial measures. In summary, this paper corroborates the use of CARSAL and CARVAL with both visibly different and general adult populations for the measurement of appearance salience and valence."

In this study, we individually mutated to alanine all the putative phosphatidylserine-interactive residues in the tissue factor ectodomain and measured their effects on tissue factor cofactor function (activation of factors IX and X by tissue factor/factor VIIa, and clotting of plasma). Some tissue factor mutants exhibited decreased activity in all three assays, with the most profound defects observed from mutations in or near the flexible loop from Lys159 to Gly164. The decreased activity of all of these tissue factor mutants could be partially or completely overcome by increasing the phosphatidylserine content of tissue factor-liposomes. Additionally, yeast surface display was used to screen a random library of tissue factor mutants for enhanced factor VIIa binding. Surprisingly, mutations at a single amino acid (Lys165) predominated, with the Lys165→Glu mutant exhibiting a 3-fold enhancement in factor VIIa binding affinity. Our studies reveal the functional contributions of residues in the C-terminal half of the tissue factor ectodomain that are implicated in interacting with phosphatidylserine headgroups to enhance tissue factor cofactor activity, possibly by allosterically modulating the conformation of the adjacent substrate-binding exosite region of tissue factor."
https://openalex.org/W2091581420,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) results in microvascular damage that if not normally repaired, may lead to fibrosis. The Id1 and 3 proteins have a critical role in promoting angiogenesis during development, tumor growth and wound repair by functioning as dominant negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors. The goal of this study was to determine if Id proteins regulate microvascular repair and remodeling and if increased Id1 expression results in decreased capillary loss following AKI. The effect of changes in Id expression in vivo was examined using Id1−/−, Id3RFP/+ (Id1/Id3 KO) and Tek (Tie2)-rtTA, TRE-lacz/TRE Id1 (TRE Id1) mice with doxycycline inducible endothelial Id1 and β-galactosidase expression. Id1 and 3 were co-localized in endothelial cells in normal adult kidneys and protein levels were increased at day 3 following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and contralateral nephrectomy. Id1/Id3 KO mice had decreased baseline capillary density and pericyte coverage and increased tubular damage following IRI but decreased interstitial cell proliferation and fibrosis compared with WT littermates. No compensatory increase in kidney size occurred in KO mice resulting in increased creatinine compared with WT and TRE Id1 mice. TRE Id1 mice had no capillary rarefaction within 1 week following IRI in comparison with WT littermates. TRE Id1 mice had increased proliferation of PDGFRβ positive interstitial cells and medullary collagen deposition and developed capillary rarefaction and albuminuria at later time points. These differences were associated with increased Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and decreased Ang2 expression in TRE Id1 mice. Examination of gene expression in microvascular cells isolated from WT, Id1/Id3 KO and TRE Id1 mice showed increased Ang1 and αSMA in Id1 overexpressing cells and decreased pericyte markers in cells from KO mice. These results suggest that increased Id levels following AKI result in microvascular remodeling associated with increased fibrosis."

In this report we provide evidence that in prostate cancer cells stimulated with activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) PDK1 phosphorylates Akt in the T-loop at Thr308 by using Raptor in the mTORC1 complex as a scaffold protein. First we demonstrate that PDK1, Raptor, and mTOR co-immunoprecipitate. Silencing the expression, not only of PDK1, but also Raptor by RNAi nearly abolished Akt phosphorylation at AktThr308 in Raptor-immunoprecipitates of α2M*-stimulated prostate cancer cells. Immunodepleting Raptor or PDK from cell lysates of cells treated with α2M* drastically reduced Akt phosphorylation at Thr308, which was recovered by adding the supernatant of Raptor- or PDK1-depleted cell lysates, respectively. Studies of insulin binding to its receptor on prostate cancer cells yielded similar results. We thus demonstrate that phosphorylating the T-loop Akt residue Thr308 by PDK1 requires Raptor of the mTORC1 complex as a platform or scaffold protein."

There are two isoforms of Pcyt2, -α and -β; however, very little is known about their specific roles in this important metabolic pathway. We previously demonstrated increased phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis subsequent to elevated activity and phosphorylation of Pcyt2α and -β in MCF-7 breast cancer cells grown under conditions of serum deficiency. Mass spectroscopy analyses of Pcyt2 provided evidence for isoform-specific as well as shared phosphorylations. Pcyt2β was specifically phosphorylated at the end of the first cytidylyltransferase domain. Pcyt2α was phosphorylated within the α-specific motif that is spliced out in Pcyt2β and on two PKC consensus serine residues, Ser-215 and Ser-223. Single and double mutations of PKC consensus sites reduced Pcyt2α phosphorylation, activity, and phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis by 50–90%. The phosphorylation and activity of endogenous Pcyt2 were dramatically increased with phorbol esters and reduced by specific PKC inhibitors. In vitro translated Pcyt2α was phosphorylated by PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII. Pcyt2α Ser-215 was also directly phosphorylated with PKCα. Mapping of the Pcyt2α- and -β-phosphorylated sites to the solved structure of a human Pcyt2β showed that they clustered within and flanking the central linker region that connects the two catalytic domains and is a novel regulatory segment not present in other cytidylyltransferases.

During co-translational translocation the translating ribosome is targeted to the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle-dependent manner. There it engages with the channel enabling the growing polypeptide chain to be inserted directly into the translocon pore (1.Park E. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms of Sec61/SecY-mediated protein translocation across membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, fully translated precursors are targeted to the translocon in a post-translational manner that requires chaperones and the membranous receptor Sec62 (1.Park E. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms of Sec61/SecY-mediated protein translocation across membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In yeast, 20% of the secretome is predicted to reach the ER independent of the signal recognition particle (2.Ast T. Cohen G. Schuldiner M.

The two translocation pathways converge at the trimeric Sec61 complex, which forms an aqueous channel as polypeptides pass through. The yeast Sec61 translocon complex (TC) consists of the pore-forming Sec61 protein, Sbh1 and Sss1, which as such can mediate co-translational translocation. However, post-translational protein import requires a heptameric complex consisting of the trimeric Sec61 complex and the tetrameric Sec63 complex (Sec63, Sec62, Sec71, Sec72) (reviewed in Ref. 1.Park E. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms of Sec61/SecY-mediated protein translocation across membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).

N-Glycosylation and O-mannosylation of secretory and membrane proteins are evolutionary conserved, essential protein modifications in fungi and animals, which underlie the pathophysiology of severe congenital disorders with diverse clinical presentations in humans (3.Lehle L.

Engl. 2006; 45: 6802-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Both, N-glycosylation of Asn residues of the sequon Asn-X-Thr/Ser and O-mannosylation of specific Ser and Thr residues are initiated at the ER where the synthesis of the polypeptide and the dolichol-linked donor saccharide, as well as the covalent coupling of glycan and polypeptide take place (reviewed in Ref. 3.Lehle L.

Engl. 2006; 45: 6802-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the absence of these types of glycosylation, ER homeostasis is severely affected (4.Arroyo J. Hutzler J. Bermejo C. Ragni E. García-Cantalejo J. Botías P. Piberger H. Schott A. Sanz A.B. Strahl S. Functional and genomic analyses of blocked protein O-mannosylation in baker's yeast.Mol.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation is initiated by a multisubunit membrane protein complex called oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). Yeast OST is composed of eight subunits (Ost1, Ost2, Ost3/Ost6, Ost4, Ost5, Stt3, Swp1, and Wbp1), which are assembled in the ER membrane in large heterooligomeric complexes alternatively containing Ost3 or Ost6 (reviewed in Ref. 6.Aebi M. N-Linked protein glycosylation in the ER.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 2430-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It is well established that N-glycosylation can be temporally coupled to the protein translocation reaction to ensure the accessibility of glycosylation sites before the acceptor protein starts to fold, and direct interactions between OST and the TC have been demonstrated (reviewed in Ref. 7.Chavan M. Lennarz W. The molecular basis of coupling of translocation and N-glycosylation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). O-Mannosylation is initiated by a conserved family of integral ER-membrane proteins, the protein O-mannosyltransferases (PMTs). PMTs catalyze the transfer of a mannose residue from dolicholmonophosphate-activated mannose (Dol-P-Man) to Ser and Thr residues of mainly Ser/Thr-rich proteins (reviewed in Ref. 8.Loibl M. Strahl S. Protein O-mannosylation: what we have learned from baker's yeast.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PMT family is subdivided into the PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4 subfamilies, and complex formation between individual subfamily members is critical for mannosyltransferase activity (9.Girrbach V. Strahl S. Members of the evolutionarily conserved PMT family of protein O-mannosyltransferases form distinct protein complexes among themselves.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12554-12562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, O-mannosylation is predominantly catalyzed by heteromeric Pmt1-Pmt2 and homomeric Pmt4-Pmt4 complexes. These complexes mannosylate distinct protein substrates in vivo, even though the molecular basis of that specificity as well as general signature sequences for O-mannosylation are still unknown. In baker's yeast, ∼250 secretory or membrane proteins contain Ser/Thr-rich clusters that can be substantially O-mannosylated and many of these proteins are modified in addition by N-linked glycans (10.González M. Brito N. Celedonio G. High abundance of serine/threonine-rich regions predicted to be hyper-O-glycosylated in the secretory proteins coded by eight fungal genomes.BMC Microbiol. 2012; 12: 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For one of these, the cell wall protein Ccw5, it has even been shown that O-mannosylation precedes N-glycosylation (11.Ecker M. Mrsa V. Hagen I. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Tanner W. O-Mannosylation precedes and potentially controls the N-glycosylation of a yeast cell wall glycoprotein.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that PMT complexes can act on protein chains while they enter the ER. These findings are consistent with the general assumption that O-mannosylation takes place on translocating polypeptide chains which, however, is based on a single study from the mid-1970s (12.Larriba G. Elorza M.V. Villanueva J.R. Sentandreu R. Participation of dolichol phosphomannose in the glycosylation of yeast wall mannoproteins at the polysomal level.FEBS Lett. 1976; 71: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The authors reported that in the presence of exogenous Dol-P-[14C]Man, regenerating yeast protoplasts incorporate nearly 20% of the radioactivity into polysomes and this material was largely released by β-elimination, a method to set free O-linked carbohydrates. However, in recent years it became clear that prolonged ER residence of fully translocated proteins allows modification of exposed O-mannosyl acceptor sites within un- and misfolded proteins by the Pmt1-Pmt2 complex (13.Harty C.

https://openalex.org/W2068742012,"Triacylglycerols (TAG) are the major molecules of energy storage in eukaryotes. TAG are packed in subcellular structures called oil bodies or lipid droplets. Oleosins (OLE) are the major proteins in plant oil bodies. Multiple isoforms of OLE are present in plants such as tung tree (Vernicia fordii), whose seeds are rich in novel TAG with a wide range of industrial applications. The objectives of this study were to identify OLE genes, classify OLE proteins and analyze OLE gene expression in tung trees. We identified five tung tree OLE genes coding for small hydrophobic proteins. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that the five tung OLE genes represented the five OLE subfamilies and all contained the ""proline knot"" motif (PX5SPX3P) shared among 65 OLE from 19 tree species, including the sequenced genomes of Prunus persica (peach), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Ricinus communis (castor bean), Theobroma cacao (cacao) and Vitis vinifera (grapevine). Tung OLE1, OLE2 and OLE3 belong to the S type and OLE4 and OLE5 belong to the SM type of Arabidopsis OLE. TaqMan and SYBR Green qPCR methods were used to study the differential expression of OLE genes in tung tree tissues. Expression results demonstrated that 1) All five OLE genes were expressed in developing tung seeds, leaves and flowers; 2) OLE mRNA levels were much higher in seeds than leaves or flowers; 3) OLE1, OLE2 and OLE3 genes were expressed in tung seeds at much higher levels than OLE4 and OLE5 genes; 4) OLE mRNA levels rapidly increased during seed development; and 5) OLE gene expression was well-coordinated with tung oil accumulation in the seeds. These results suggest that tung OLE genes 1-3 probably play major roles in tung oil accumulation and/or oil body development. Therefore, they might be preferred targets for tung oil engineering in transgenic plants."
https://openalex.org/W2076246974,"Overexpression of the ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase protein in breast and other cancers contributes to tumor malignancy and therapeutic resistance. The RBCC/TRIM family RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1 mediates the ubiquitination of ErbB3 in normal mammary epithelial cells to facilitate receptor degradation and suppress steady-state receptor levels. Post-transcriptional loss of Nrdp1 in patient breast tumors allows ErbB3 overexpression and receptor contribution to tumor progression, and elevated lability through autoubiquitination contributes to the observed loss of Nrdp1 in tumors relative to normal tissue. To begin to understand the mechanisms underlying Nrdp1 protein self-regulation through lability, we investigated the structural determinants required for efficient autoubiquitination and ErbB3 ubiquitination. Using mutagenesis, chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we demonstrate that Nrdp1 self-associates into a stable oligomeric complex in cells. Deletion of its coiled-coil domain abrogates oligomerization but does not affect Nrdp1-mediated ErbB3 ubiquitination or degradation. On the other hand, the presence of the coiled-coil domain is necessary for efficient Nrdp1 autoubiquitination via a trans mechanism, indicating that Nrdp1 ubiquitination of its various targets is functionally separable. Finally, a GFP fusion of the coiled-coil domain stabilizes Nrdp1 and potentiates ErbB3 ubiquitination and degradation. These observations point to a model whereby the coiled-coil domain plays a key role in regulating Nrdp1 lability by promoting its assembly into an oligomeric complex, and raise the possibility that inhibition of ligase oligomerization via its coiled-coil domain could be of therapeutic benefit to breast cancer patients by restoring Nrdp1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1980124628,"This study investigated the localization of critical enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism during the initial and regenerative phases of mouse femur fracture healing. Previous studies found that loss of cyclooxygenase-2 activity impairs fracture healing while loss of 5-lipoxygenase activity accelerates healing. These diametric results show that arachidonic acid metabolism has an essential function during fracture healing. To better understand the function of arachidonic acid metabolism during fracture healing, expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) was localized by immunohistochemistry in time-staged fracture callus specimens. All four enzymes were detected in leukocytes present in the bone marrow and attending inflammatory response that accompanied the fracture. In the tissues surrounding the fracture site, the proportion of leukocytes expressing COX-1, COX-2, or LTA4H decreased while those expressing 5-LO remained high at 4 and 7 days after fracture. This may indicate an inflammation resolution function for 5-LO during fracture healing. Only COX-1 was consistently detected in fracture callus osteoblasts during the later stages of healing (day 14 after fracture). In contrast, callus chondrocytes expressed all four enzymes, though 5-LO appeared to be preferentially expressed in newly differentiated chondrocytes. Most interestingly, osteoclasts consistently and strongly expressed COX-2. In addition to bone surfaces and the growth plate, COX-2 expressing osteoclasts were localized at the chondro-osseous junction of the fracture callus. These observations suggest that arachidonic acid mediated signaling from callus chondrocytes or from callus osteoclasts at the chondro-osseous junction regulate fracture healing."
https://openalex.org/W2077150306,"Evidence of a causal link between male obesity and subfertility or infertility has been demonstrated previously. However, the mechanism underlying this link is incompletely understood. Here, we report that sustained high protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity in sperm of obese donors plays an essential role in coupling male obesity and subfertility or infertility. First, PTP1B level and activity were significantly higher in sperm from ob/ob mice than in wild-type littermates. High PTP1B level and activity in sperm was also observed in obese patients compared with non-obese donors. The enhanced sperm PTP1B level and activity in ob/ob mice and obese patients correlated with a defect of the sperm acrosome reaction (AR). Second, treating sperm from male ob/ob mice or obese men with a specific PTP1B inhibitor largely restored the sperm AR. Finally, blockade of sperm AR by enhanced PTP1B activity in male ob/ob mice or obese men was due to prolonged dephosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor by PTP1B, leading to the inability to reassemble the trans-SNARE complexes, which is a critical step in sperm acrosomal exocytosis. In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time that a sustained high PTP1B level or activity in the sperm of obese donors causes a defect of sperm AR and that PTP1B is a novel potential therapeutic target for male infertility treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2140554334,"Degenerative loss of photoreceptors occurs in inherited and age-related retinal degenerative diseases. A chemical screen facilitates development of new testing routes for neuroprotection and mechanistic investigation. Herein, we conducted a mouse-derived photoreceptor (661W cell)-based high throughput screen of the Food and Drug Administration-approved Prestwick drug library to identify putative cytoprotective compounds against light-induced, synthetic visual chromophore-precipitated cell death. Different classes of hit compounds were identified, some of which target known genes or pathways pathologically associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Sulfaphenazole (SFZ), a selective inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isozyme, was identified as a novel and leading cytoprotective compound. Expression of CYP2C proteins was induced by light. Gene-targeted knockdown of CYP2C55, the homologous gene of CYP2C9, demonstrated viability rescue to light-induced cell death, whereas stable expression of functional CYP2C9-GFP fusion protein further exacerbated light-induced cell death. Mechanistically, SFZ inhibited light-induced necrosis and mitochondrial stress-initiated apoptosis. Light elicited calcium influx, which was mitigated by SFZ. Light provoked the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and production of non-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid metabolites. Administration of SFZ further stimulated the production of non-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid metabolites, suggesting a metabolic shift of arachidonic acid under inhibition of the CYP2C pathway. Together, our findings indicate that CYP2C genes play a direct causative role in photochemical stress-induced death of photoreceptors and suggest that the CYP monooxygenase system is a risk factor for retinal photodamage, especially in individuals with Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration that deposit condensation products of retinoids."
https://openalex.org/W2058974415,"Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. Fat mass is a determinant of bone strength and both phenotypes have a strong genetic component. In this study, we examined the association between obesity associated polymorphisms (SNPs) with body composition, BMD, Ultrasound (QUS), fracture and biomarkers (Homocysteine (Hcy), folate, Vitamin D and Vitamin B12) for obesity and osteoporosis. Five common variants: rs17782313 and rs1770633 (melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R); rs7566605 (insulin induced gene 2 (INSIG2); rs9939609 and rs1121980 (fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) were genotyped in 2 cohorts of Swedish women: PEAK-25 (age 25, n = 1061) and OPRA (age 75, n = 1044). Body mass index (BMI), total body fat and lean mass were strongly positively correlated with QUS and BMD in both cohorts (r(2) = 0.2-0.6). MC4R rs17782313 was associated with QUS in the OPRA cohort and individuals with the minor C-allele had higher values compared to T-allele homozygotes (TT vs. CT vs.100 vs. 103 vs. 103; p = 0.002); (SOS: 1521 vs. 1526 vs. 1524; p = 0.008); (Stiffness index: 69 vs. 73 vs. 74; p = 0.0006) after adjustment for confounders. They also had low folate (18 vs. 17 vs. 16; p = 0.03) and vitamin D (93 vs. 91 vs. 90; p = 0.03) and high Hcy levels (13.7 vs 14.4 vs. 14.5; p = 0.06). Fracture incidence was lower among women with the C-allele, (52% vs. 58%; p = 0.067). Variation in MC4R was not associated with BMD or body composition in either OPRA or PEAK-25. SNPs close to FTO and INSIG2 were not associated with any bone phenotypes in either cohort and FTO SNPs were only associated with body composition in PEAK-25 (p≤0.001). Our results suggest that genetic variation close to MC4R is associated with quantitative ultrasound and risk of fracture."
https://openalex.org/W1981255905,"Postures are known to be able to affect emotion and motivation. Much less is known about whether (affective) modulation of eye blink startle occurs following specific postures. The objective of the current study was to explore this. Participants in the present study were requested to assume three different sitting postures: with the spine flexed (slouched), neutral upright, and extended. Each posture was assumed for four minutes, and was followed by the administration of brief self-report questionnaires before proceeding to the next posture. The same series of postures and measures were repeated prior to ending the experiment. Results indicate that, relative to the other postures, the extended sitting posture was associated with an increased startle, was more unpleasant, arousing, had smaller levels of dominance, induced more discomfort, and was perceived as more difficult. The upright and flexed sitting postures differed in the level of self-reported positive affect, but not in eye blink startle amplitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1989525935,"Evidence suggests that subliminal stimuli can influence ostensibly volitional, executive processes but it is unclear whether this is highly task-specific. To address this we used a set-switching task. Volunteers saw a word pair and reported either if both words had the same number of syllables or if both were concrete. Task selection was random and instructed by a hexagon/triangle preceding the words. A subliminally-presented square or diamond reliably preceded each of these consciously perceived instruction-shapes. Significant congruency effects were observed in a subsequent Test Phase in which primes no longer reliably predicted the task (and in which high/low tones now served as conscious instructions). The Generalization Phase required novel phonological (rhyme) or semantic (category) judgments. Remarkably, unconscious priming congruency effects carried over in those participants who had shown priming in the Test Phase, the degree correlating across the two conditions. In a final phase of the study, participants were asked to discriminate between the two originally presented prime shapes. Those participants whose discriminations were more accurate showed reduced priming relative to participants with less accurate discriminations. The results suggest that, rather than being highly task specific, priming can operate at the level of a generalizable process and that greater awareness of primes may lessen their impact on behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2028006133,"Mosquito-borne diseases present some of the greatest health challenges faced by the world today. In many cases, existing control measures are compromised by insecticide resistance, pathogen tolerance to drugs and the lack of effective vaccines. In light of these difficulties, new genetic tools for disease control programmes, based on the deployment of genetically modified mosquitoes, are seen as having great promise. Transgenic strains may be used to control disease transmission either by suppressing vector populations or by replacing susceptible with refractory genotypes. In practice, the fitness of the transgenic strain relative to natural mosquitoes will be a critical determinant of success. We previously described a transgenic strain of Anopheles gambiae expressing the Vida3 peptide into the female midgut following a blood-meal, which exhibited significant protection against malaria parasites. Here, we investigated the fitness of this strain relative to non-transgenic controls through comparisons of various life history traits. Experiments were designed, as far as possible, to equalize genetic backgrounds and heterogeneity such that fitness comparisons focussed on the presence and expression of the transgene cassette. We also employed reciprocal crosses to identify any fitness disturbance associated with inheritance of the transgene from either the male or female parent. We found no evidence that the presence or expression of the effector transgene or associated fluorescence markers caused any significant fitness cost in relation to larval mortality, pupal sex ratio, fecundity, hatch rate or longevity of blood-fed females. In fact, fecundity was increased in transgenic strains. We did, however, observe some fitness disturbances associated with the route of inheritance of the transgene. Maternal inheritance delayed male pupation whilst paternal inheritance increased adult longevity for both males and unfed females. Overall, in comparison to controls, there was no evidence of significant fitness costs associated with the presence or expression of transgenes in this strain."

https://openalex.org/W2020109150,"Population regulation results from an interplay of numerous intrinsic and external factors, and for many insects cannibalism is such a factor. This study confirms a previously-reported observation that sublethal exposure to the fossilized remains of diatoms (i.e. diatomaceous earth) increases net fecundity (eggs produced minus eggs destroyed/day) of flour beetles, Tribolium confusum. The aim was to experimentally test two non-mutually-exclusive ecological mechanisms potentially responsible for the increased net fecundity: higher egg production and lower egg cannibalism. Adult T. confusum were maintained at low or high density in medium containing sublethal (0-4%) diatomaceous earth. Net fecundity increased up to 2.1× control values during diatomaceous earth exposure, and returned to control levels following removal from diatomaceous earth. Cannibalism assays on adults showed that diatomaceous earth reduced the number of eggs produced to 0.7× control values at low density and to 0.8× controls at high density, and also reduced egg cannibalism rates of adults to as little as 0.4× control values, but at high density only. Diatomaceous earth also reduced cannibalism by larvae on eggs to 0.3× control values. So, while the presence of diatomaceous earth reduced egg production, net fecundity increased as a result of strong suppression of the normal egg cannibalism by adults and larvae that occurs at high beetle density. Undisturbed cultures containing sublethal diatomaceous earth concentrations reached higher population densities than diatomaceous earth-free controls. Cohort studies on survival from egg to adult indicated that this population increase was due largely to decreased egg cannibalism by adult females. This is the first report of inhibition of egg cannibalism by diatomaceous earth on larval or adult insects. The ability of diatomaceous earth to alter cannibalism behavior without causing mortality makes it an ideal investigative tool for cannibalism studies."
https://openalex.org/W2021410470,"Antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules requires degradation of epitope source proteins in the cytosol. Although the preeminent role of the proteasome is clearly established, evidence suggesting a significant role for proteasome-independent generation of class I ligands has been reported repeatedly. However, an enzyme responsible for such a role has not been identified. Recently insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) was shown to produce an antigenic peptide derived from the tumor antigen MAGE-A3 in an entirely proteasome-independent manner, raising the question of the global impact of IDE in MHC class I antigen processing. Here we report that IDE knockdown in human cell lines, or knockout in two different mouse strains, has no effect on cell surface expression of various MHC class I molecules, including allomorphs such as HLA-A3 and HLA-B27 suggested to be loaded in an at least a partly proteasome-independent manner. Moreover, reduced or absent IDE expression does not affect presentation of five epitopes including epitopes derived from beta amyloid and proinsulin, two preferred IDE substrates. Thus, IDE does not play a major role in MHC class I antigen processing, confirming the dominant and almost exclusive role of the proteasome in cytosolic production of MHC class I ligands."
