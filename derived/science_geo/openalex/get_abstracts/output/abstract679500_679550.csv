https://openalex.org/W3196046854,"Avoiding buried voids The buried interfaces of perovskite solar cells are difficult to alter after synthesis. During manufacture, Chen et al . removed perovskite films with dimethyl sulfoxide solvent from the hole-transfer layer and observed a substantial void fraction that degraded film performance. Replacing most of the dimethyl sulfoxide with carbohydrazide, a lead-coordinating compound with a much higher boiling point, eliminated voids. Such solar cells maintained high power conversion efficiency after 550 hours of operation at 60°C. —PDS"
https://openalex.org/W3194272510,"In human-made malleable materials, microdamage such as cracking usually limits material lifetime. Some biological composites, such as bone, have hierarchical microstructures that tolerate cracks but cannot withstand high elongation. We demonstrate a directionally solidified eutectic high-entropy alloy (EHEA) that successfully reconciles crack tolerance and high elongation. The solidified alloy has a hierarchically organized herringbone structure that enables bionic-inspired hierarchical crack buffering. This effect guides stable, persistent crystallographic nucleation and growth of multiple microcracks in abundant poor-deformability microstructures. Hierarchical buffering by adjacent dynamic strain-hardened features helps the cracks to avoid catastrophic growth and percolation. Our self-buffering herringbone material yields an ultrahigh uniform tensile elongation (~50%), three times that of conventional nonbuffering EHEAs, without sacrificing strength."

https://openalex.org/W3194369044,"Eukaryotic genomes contain domesticated genes from integrating viruses and mobile genetic elements. Among these are homologs of the capsid protein (known as Gag) of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and retroviruses. We identified several mammalian Gag homologs that form virus-like particles and one LTR retrotransposon homolog, PEG10, that preferentially binds and facilitates vesicular secretion of its own messenger RNA (mRNA). We showed that the mRNA cargo of PEG10 can be reprogrammed by flanking genes of interest with Peg10's untranslated regions. Taking advantage of this reprogrammability, we developed selective endogenous encapsidation for cellular delivery (SEND) by engineering both mouse and human PEG10 to package, secrete, and deliver specific RNAs. Together, these results demonstrate that SEND is a modular platform suited for development as an efficient therapeutic delivery modality."
https://openalex.org/W3194579949,"In neuromorphic hardware, peripheral circuits and memories based on heterogeneous devices are generally physically separated. Thus, exploration of homogeneous devices for these components is key for improving module integration and resistance matching. Inspired by the ferroelectric proximity effect on two-dimensional (2D) materials, we present a tungsten diselenide–on–lithium niobate cascaded architecture as a basic device that functions as a nonlinear transistor, assisting the design of operational amplifiers for analog signal processing (ASP). This device also functions as a nonvolatile memory cell, achieving memory operating (MO) functionality. On the basis of this homogeneous architecture, we also investigated an ASP-MO integrated system for binary classification and the design of ternary content-addressable memory for potential use in neuromorphic hardware."
https://openalex.org/W3193706553,"Speech perception is thought to rely on a cortical feedforward serial transformation of acoustic into linguistic representations. Using intracranial recordings across the entire human auditory cortex, electrocortical stimulation, and surgical ablation, we show that cortical processing across areas is not consistent with a serial hierarchical organization. Instead, response latency and receptive field analyses demonstrate parallel and distinct information processing in the primary and nonprimary auditory cortices. This functional dissociation was also observed where stimulation of the primary auditory cortex evokes auditory hallucination but does not distort or interfere with speech perception. Opposite effects were observed during stimulation of nonprimary cortex in superior temporal gyrus. Ablation of the primary auditory cortex does not affect speech perception. These results establish a distributed functional organization of parallel information processing throughout the human auditory cortex and demonstrate an essential independent role for nonprimary auditory cortex in speech processing."

https://openalex.org/W3196215773,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that can regulate the translation of specific mRNAs. In this study, we developed an FXS human forebrain organoid model and observed that the loss of FMRP led to dysregulated neurogenesis, neuronal maturation and neuronal excitability. Bulk and single-cell gene expression analyses of FXS forebrain organoids revealed that the loss of FMRP altered gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner. The developmental deficits in FXS forebrain organoids could be rescued by inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway but not the metabotropic glutamate pathway disrupted in the FXS mouse model. We identified a large number of human-specific mRNAs bound by FMRP. One of these human-specific FMRP targets, CHD2, contributed to the altered gene expression in FXS organoids. Collectively, our study revealed molecular, cellular and electrophysiological abnormalities associated with the loss of FMRP during human brain development."

These small increases appeared 90 to 180 days after new wells were put in and suggest some surface water contamination. The magnitude appears small but may require that more attention be paid to monitoring near-well surface waters. —BG"

https://openalex.org/W3196277730,"During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, many health professionals used social media to promote preventative health behaviors. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of the effect of a Facebook advertising campaign consisting of short videos recorded by doctors and nurses to encourage users to stay at home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays ( NCT04644328 and AEARCTR-0006821 ). We randomly assigned counties to high intensity (n = 410 (386) at Thanksgiving (Christmas)) or low intensity (n = 410 (381)). The intervention was delivered to a large fraction of Facebook subscribers in 75% and 25% of randomly assigned zip codes in high- and low-intensity counties, respectively. In total, 6,998 (6,716) zip codes were included, and 11,954,109 (23,302,290) users were reached at Thanksgiving (Christmas). The first two primary outcomes were holiday travel and fraction leaving home, both measured using mobile phone location data of Facebook users. Average distance traveled in high-intensity counties decreased by -0.993 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.616, -0.371; P = 0.002) for the 3 days before each holiday compared to low-intensity counties. The fraction of people who left home on the holiday was not significantly affected (adjusted difference: 0.030; 95% CI: -0.361, 0.420; P = 0.881). The third primary outcome was COVID-19 infections recorded at the zip code level in the 2-week period starting 5 days after the holiday. Infections declined by 3.5% (adjusted 95% CI: -6.2%, -0.7%; P = 0.013) in intervention compared to control zip codes. Social media messages recorded by health professionals before the winter holidays in the United States led to a significant reduction in holiday travel and subsequent COVID-19 infections."

Here, we introduce Multiplexed Intermixed CRISPR Droplets (MIC-Drop), a platform combining droplet microfluidics, single-needle en masse CRISPR ribonucleoprotein injections, and DNA barcoding to enable large-scale functional genetic screens in zebrafish. The platform can efficiently identify genes responsible for morphological or behavioral phenotypes. In one application, we showed that MIC-Drop could identify small-molecule targets. Furthermore, in a MIC-Drop screen of 188 poorly characterized genes, we discovered several genes important for cardiac development and function. With the potential to scale to thousands of genes, MIC-Drop enables genome-scale reverse genetic screens in model organisms."

The avian influenza virus H7N9 rarely spills over into humans, but when it does, mortality exceeds 30%, far in excess of that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Chen et al . used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the contribution of rare mutations among poultry workers who can be exposed to high levels of H7N9. Multiple defective single-nucleotide variants in the myxovirus resistance Mx1 locus were prevalent in H7N9 patients. In vitro infection experiments and influenza polymerase activity assays showed that 14 of the 17 MxA protein variants had no antiviral activity. Thus, individuals with such genetic vulnerabilities, when exposed to high virus loads, may act as crucibles for transmission of virulent new influenza subtypes. —CA"
https://openalex.org/W3193567771,Childhood malaria Understanding how changes in community parasite prevalence alter the rate and age distribution of severe malaria is essential for optimizing control efforts. Paton et al . assessed the incidence of pediatric severe malaria admissions from 13 hospitals in East Africa from 2006 to 2020 (see the Perspective by Taylor and Slutsker). Each 25% increase in community parasite prevalence shifted hospital admissions toward younger children. Low rates of lifetime infections appeared to confer some immunity to severe malaria in very young children. Children under the age of 5 years thus need to remain a focus of disease prevention for malaria control. —CA
https://openalex.org/W3193933253,"Translation termination, which liberates a nascent polypeptide from the ribosome specifically at stop codons, must occur accurately and rapidly. We established single-molecule fluorescence assays to track the dynamics of ribosomes and two requisite release factors (eRF1 and eRF3) throughout termination using an in vitro-reconstituted yeast translation system. We found that the two eukaryotic release factors bound together to recognize stop codons rapidly and elicit termination through a tightly regulated, multistep process that resembles transfer RNA selection during translation elongation. Because the release factors are conserved from yeast to humans, the molecular events that underlie yeast translation termination are likely broadly fundamental to eukaryotic protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3193750515,"Transformation of flat membrane into round vesicles is generally thought to underlie endocytosis and produce speed-, amount-, and vesicle-size-specific endocytic modes. Visualizing depolarization-induced exocytic and endocytic membrane transformation in live neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, we found that flat membrane is transformed into Λ-shaped, Ω-shaped, and O-shaped vesicles via invagination, Λ-base constriction, and Ω-pore constriction, respectively. Surprisingly, endocytic vesicle formation is predominantly from not flat-membrane-to-round-vesicle transformation but calcium-triggered and dynamin-mediated closure of (1) Ω profiles formed before depolarization and (2) fusion pores (called kiss-and-run). Varying calcium influxes control the speed, number, and vesicle size of these pore closures, resulting in speed-specific slow (more than ∼6 s), fast (less than ∼6 s), or ultrafast (<0.6 s) endocytosis, amount-specific compensatory endocytosis (endocytosis = exocytosis) or overshoot endocytosis (endocytosis > exocytosis), and size-specific bulk endocytosis. These findings reveal major membrane transformation mechanisms underlying endocytosis, diverse endocytic modes, and exocytosis-endocytosis coupling, calling for correction of the half-a-century concept that the flat-to-round transformation predominantly mediates endocytosis after physiological stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3154021207,"The appropriate selection of passive and active defensive behaviors in threatening situations is essential for survival. Previous studies have shown that passive defensive responses depend on activity of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), whereas active ones primarily rely on the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the mechanisms underlying flexible switching between these two types of responses remain unknown. Here we show in mice that the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) mediates the selection of defensive behaviors through its interaction with the CeA and the NAc. We show that the PVT-CeA pathway drives conditioned freezing responses, whereas the PVT-NAc pathway is inhibited during freezing and, instead, signals active avoidance events. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that activity in the PVT-CeA or PVT-NAc pathway biases behavior toward the selection of passive or active defensive responses, respectively. These findings provide evidence that the PVT mediates flexible switching between opposing defensive behaviors."

The shared babbling components suggest that vocal learning may have similar specific mechanisms across a wide array of mammalian species. —SNV"
https://openalex.org/W3193543236,"Cortical circuits process both sensory and motor information in animals performing perceptual tasks. However, it is still unclear how sensory inputs are transformed into motor signals in the cortex to initiate goal-directed actions. In this study, we found that a visual-to-motor inhibitory circuit in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) triggers precise action in mice performing visual Go/No-go tasks. Three distinct features of ACC neurons-visual amplitudes of sensory neurons, suppression times of motor neurons and network activity from other neurons-predicted response times of the mice. Moreover, optogenetic activation of visual inputs in the ACC, which drives fast-spiking sensory neurons, prompted task-relevant actions in mice by suppressing ACC motor neurons and disinhibiting downstream striatal neurons. Notably, when mice terminated actions in response to stop signals, both motor neuron and network activity increased. Collectively, our data demonstrate that visual inputs to the frontal cortex trigger gated feedforward inhibition to initiate goal-directed actions."
https://openalex.org/W3194017228,"Itch is a discrete and irritating sensation tightly coupled to a drive to scratch. Acute scratching developed evolutionarily as an adaptive defense against skin irritants, pathogens, or parasites. In contrast, the itch-scratch cycle in chronic itch is harmful, inducing escalating itch and skin damage. Clinically and preclinically, scratching incidence is currently evaluated as a unidimensional motor parameter and believed to reflect itch severity. We propose that scratching, when appreciated as a complex, multidimensional motor behavior, will yield greater insight into the nature of itch and the organization of neural circuits driving repetitive motor patterns. We outline the limitations of standard measurements of scratching in rodent models and present new approaches to observe and quantify itch-evoked scratching. We argue that accurate quantitative measurements of scratching are critical for dissecting the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying itch and for preclinical development of therapeutic interventions for acute and chronic itch disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3196113850,"Stream temperature science and management is rapidly shifting from single-metric driven approaches to multi-metric, thermal regime characterizations of streamscapes. Given considerable investments in recovery of cold-water fisheries (e.g., Pacific salmon and other declining native species), understanding where cold water is likely to persist, and how cold-water thermal regimes vary, is critical for conservation. California's unique position at the southern end of cold-water ecosystems in the northern hemisphere, variable geography and hydrology, and extensive flow regulation requires a systematic approach to thermal regime classification. We used publicly available, long-term (> 8 years) stream temperature data from 77 sites across California to model their thermal regimes, calculate three temperature metrics, and use the metrics to classify each regime with an agglomerative nesting algorithm. Then, we assessed the variation in each class and considered underlying physical or anthropogenic factors that could explain differences between classes. Finally, we considered how different classes might fit existing criteria for cool- or cold-water thermal regimes, and how those differences complicate efforts to manage stream temperature through regulation. Our results demonstrate that cool- and cold-water thermal regimes vary spatially across California. Several salient findings emerge from this study. Groundwater-dominated streams are a ubiquitous, but as yet, poorly explored class of thermal regimes. Further, flow regulation below dams imposes serial discontinuities, including artificial thermal regimes on downstream ecosystems. Finally, and contrary to what is often assumed, California reservoirs do not contain sufficient cold-water storage to replicate desirable, reach-scale thermal regimes. While barriers to cold-water conservation are considerable and the trajectory of cold-water species towards extinction is dire, protecting reaches that demonstrate resilience to climate warming remains worthwhile."
https://openalex.org/W3193528462,"Among the extensive repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) have a key role in recalcitrant biomass degradation. LPMOs are copper-dependent enzymes that catalyze oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin. Several LPMOs contain carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that are known to promote LPMO efficiency. However, structural and functional properties of some CBMs remain unknown, and it is not clear why some LPMOs, like CjLPMO10A from the soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus, have multiple CBMs (CjCBM5 and CjCBM73). Here, we studied substrate binding by these two CBMs to shine light on their functional variation and determined the solution structures of both by NMR, which constitutes the first structure of a member of the CBM73 family. Chitin-binding experiments and molecular dynamics simulations showed that, while both CBMs bind crystalline chitin with Kd values in the micromolar range, CjCBM73 has higher affinity for chitin than CjCBM5. Furthermore, NMR titration experiments showed that CjCBM5 binds soluble chitohexaose, whereas no binding of CjCBM73 to this chitooligosaccharide was detected. These functional differences correlate with distinctly different arrangements of three conserved aromatic amino acids involved in substrate binding. In CjCBM5, these residues show a linear arrangement that seems compatible with the experimentally observed affinity for single chitin chains. On the other hand, the arrangement of these residues in CjCBM73 suggests a wider binding surface that may interact with several chitin chains. Taken together, these results provide insight into natural variation among related chitin-binding CBMs and the possible functional implications of such variation."

Plasmodium is a single-cell protozoan parasite that causes malaria and is transmitted to humans through the female Anopheles mosquito. The previous study showed that Sonchus arvensis L. callus has antiplasmodial activity. Several treatments are needed for callus quality improvement for antimalarial compound production. This study aimed to examine the effect of dolomite [CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 ] on growth (morpho-anatomical structure and biomass), secondary metabolite production, and in vitro antiplasmodial activity of S . arvensis L. callus. In this study, leaf explants were grown in Murashige and Skoog medium with a combination of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, one mg/L) and 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP, 0.5 mg/L) with dolomite (50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mg/L). The 21 days callus ethanolic and methanolic extract were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The antiplasmodial test was performed on a blood culture infected with Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 using the Rieckmann method. The results showed that dolomite significantly affected callus growth, metabolite profile, and in vitro antiplasmodial activity. Dolomite (150 mg/L) showed the highest biomass (0.590 ± 0.136 g fresh weight and 0.074 ± 0.008 g dry weight). GC-MS analysis detected four compounds from callus ethanolic extract. Pelargonic acid, decanoic acid, and hexadecanoic acid were major compounds. One new terpenoid compound is based on TLC analysis. S . arvensis L. callus has antiplasmodial activity with the IC 50 value of 5.037 μg/mL. It was three times lower than leaf methanolic extract and five times lower than leaf ethanolic extract."
https://openalex.org/W3194032056,"In everyday life, we group and subdivide time to understand the sensory environment surrounding us. Organizing time in units, such as diurnal rhythms, phrases, and beat patterns, is fundamental to behavior, speech, and music. When listening to music, our perceptual system extracts and nests rhythmic regularities to create a hierarchical metrical structure that enables us to predict the timing of the next events. Foot tapping and head bobbing to musical rhythms are observable evidence of this process. In the special case of polyrhythms, at least two metrical structures compete to become the reference for these temporal regularities, rendering several possible beats with which we can synchronize our movements. While there is general agreement that tempo, pitch, and loudness influence beat perception in polyrhythms, we focused on the yet neglected influence of beat subdivisions, i.e., the least common denominator of a polyrhythm ratio. In three online experiments, 300 participants listened to a range of polyrhythms and tapped their index fingers in time with the perceived beat. The polyrhythms consisted of two simultaneously presented isochronous pulse trains with different ratios (2:3, 2:5, 3:4, 3:5, 4:5, 5:6) and different tempi. For ratios 2:3 and 3:4, we additionally manipulated the pitch of the pulse trains. Results showed a highly robust influence of subdivision grouping on beat perception. This was manifested as a propensity towards beats that are subdivided into two or four equally spaced units, as opposed to beats with three or more complex groupings of subdivisions. Additionally, lower pitched pulse trains were more often perceived as the beat. Our findings suggest that subdivisions, not beats, are the basic unit of beat perception, and that the principle underlying the binary grouping of subdivisions reflects a propensity towards simplicity. This preference for simple grouping is widely applicable to human perception and cognition of time."

More specifically, we measured the duration and information (number of teammates and opponents) of the players' scanning behavior. The results showed that the players' scanning duration was influenced by the ball context and the action undertaken with the ball at the moment of scan initiation. Furthermore, fixations were found in only 2.3% of the scans. Additionally, the results revealed that the stop point is the most information-rich part of a scan and that the players had more opponents than teammates inside their video frame during scans. Practical applications and further research recommendations are presented."

A pre-structured questionnaire was used to collect the socio-demographic data and possible risk factors. The data was analyzed via SPSS 23.0 statistical software. A chi-square analysis was performed to determine the association between variables. P-value < 0.05 was set statistically significant.The overall frequency of HBV and HCV among 375 pregnant women involved in the study was 3.7% and 2.1% respectively. None of the pregnant women were co-infected with HBV and HCV. Dental extraction (P = 0.001) and blood transfusion (P = 0.0005) were significantly allied with HBV infection while surgical procedure (P = 0.0001) was significantly associated with HCV infection. Moreover the sociodemographic characteristics: residential status (P = 0.017) and educational level (P = 0.048) were found significant risk factors of HBsAg and maternal age (P = 0.033) of anti-HCV, respectively.HBV and HCV infections are intermediary endemic in the study area. A higher prevalence of HBV was detected among pregnant mothers with a history of dental extraction, history of blood transfusion, resident to the urban area and low educational level. The age and surgical procedures were the potential risk factors found significantly associated with HCV positivity among pregnant mothers in our setup. Future negotiations to control vertical transmission should include routine antenatal screening for these infections early in pregnancy and the requirement of efficient preventive tools including the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine in combination with hepatitis B immune globulins to the neonate."
https://openalex.org/W3195169093,"The single-leg heel raise test (SLHR) is commonly used in clinical settings to approximate plantar flexor strength, yet this is neither validated nor supported physiologically. The purposes of this study were to: determine (1) associations between SLHR repetitions, maximal plantar flexor strength, and reductions in strength; and (2) whether sex differences exist in performance of the SLHR.Twenty-eight young, healthy participants (14 males,14 females, 19-30 years) performed repeated single-leg heel raises to task failure. Pre- and post-task measures included maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC), and voluntary activation and contractile properties of the plantar flexor muscles, assessed using peripheral electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. Surface electromyography was recorded for the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus, and anterior tibialis muscles.The SLHR resulted in 20.5% reductions in MVIC torque (p<0.001). However, the number of SLHR repetitions was not correlated with either the baseline MVIC (maximal strength; p = 0.979) or the reduction in MVIC following the SLHR (p = 0.23). There were no sex differences in either the number of SLHR repetitions (p = 0.14), baseline MVIC torque (p = 0.198), or the reduction of MVIC (p = 0.14). MVIC decline was positively associated with the reduction in voluntary activation (r = 0.841, p<0.001), but was not associated with the change in twitch amplitude (p = 0.597).The SLHR was similar in young males and females yet was a poor predictor of maximal plantar flexor strength but evaluates performance fatigability of the lower extremity specific to dynamic contractions. The reduction in maximal strength at task failure was explained by reduced neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles in both males and females.SLHR performance is not a clinical assessment of plantar flexor strength but assesses dynamic lower extremity fatigability that is similar in males and females. Alternate clinical measures for maximal plantar flexion strength need to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3195301295,"Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is the major component of extracellular matrix microfibrils, which are required for proper development of elastic tissues, including the heart and lungs. Through protein-protein interactions with latent transforming growth factor (TGF) β-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), microfibrils regulate TGF-β signaling. Mutations within the 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of FBN1 cause autosomal dominant disorders including Marfan Syndrome, which is characterized by disrupted TGF-β signaling. We recently identified two novel protein O-glucosyltransferases, Protein O-glucosyltransferase 2 (POGLUT2) and 3 (POGLUT3), that modify a small fraction of EGF repeats on Notch. Here, using mass spectral analysis, we show that POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 also modify over half of the EGF repeats on FBN1, fibrillin-2 (FBN2), and LTBP1. While most sites are modified by both enzymes, some sites show a preference for either POGLUT2 or POGLUT3. POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 are homologs of POGLUT1, which stabilizes Notch proteins by addition of O-glucose to Notch EGF repeats. Like POGLUT1, POGLUT2 and 3 can discern a folded versus unfolded EGF repeat, suggesting POGLUT2 and 3 are involved in a protein folding pathway. In vitro secretion assays using the N-terminal portion of recombinant FBN1 revealed reduced FBN1 secretion in POGLUT2 knockout, POGLUT3 knockout, and POGLUT2 and 3 double-knockout HEK293T cells compared with wild type. These results illustrate that POGLUT2 and 3 function together to O-glucosylate protein substrates and that these modifications play a role in the secretion of substrate proteins. It will be interesting to see how disease variants in these proteins affect their O-glucosylation."

We hypothesized that mammary epithelial clocks function to regulate mammogenesis and lactogenesis, and propose the core clock transcription factor BMAL1:CLOCK regulates genes that control mammary epithelial development and milk synthesis. Our objective was to identify transcriptional targets of BMAL1 in undifferentiated (UNDIFF) and lactogen differentiated (DIFF) mammary epithelial cells (HC11) using ChIP-seq. Ensembl gene IDs with the nearest transcriptional start site to ChIP-seq peaks were explored as potential targets, and represented 846 protein coding genes common to UNDIFF and DIFF cells and 2773 unique to DIFF samples. Genes with overlapping peaks between samples (1343) enriched cell-cell adhesion, membrane transporters and lipid metabolism categories. To functionally verify targets, an HC11 line with Bmal1 gene knocked out (BMAL1-KO) using CRISPR-CAS was created. BMAL1-KO cultures had lower cell densities over an eight-day growth curve, which was associated with increased (p&lt;0.05) levels of reactive oxygen species and lower expression of superoxide dismutase 3 ( Sod3 ). RT-qPCR analysis also found lower expression of the putative targets, prolactin receptor ( Prlr ), Ppara , and beta-casein ( Csn2 ).

First, fragmented data is filtered and Deep Auto-Encoding is used to select high dimensional features. Second, a mixture of the CNN and LSTM models is used to train prominent wind features and further improve forecasting accuracy. Finally, the CNN-LSTM deep learning hybrid model is fine-tuned with various parameters for reliable forecasting of wind energy on three different offshore Windfarms. A state-of-the-art comparison against existing models is presented based on root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) respectively. The forecasting analyses indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM strategy is quite successful for offshore wind turbines by retaining the lowest RMSE and MAE along with high forecasting accuracy.

Relationships between measures of boat acceleration and velocity to inform interpretation of boat acceleration profiles in rowing were investigated here. Methods Thirteen male singles, nine female singles, eight male pairs, and seven female pairs participated (national and international level, age 18–27 y). Data from each stroke for 74 2000-m races were collected using Peach PowerLine and OptimEye S5 GPS units. General linear mixed modelling established modifying effects on velocity of two within-crew SD of boat acceleration variables for each boat class, without and with adjustment for stroke rate and power, to identify potential performance-enhancement strategies for a given stroke rate and power. Measures of acceleration magnitude at six peaks or dips, and six measures of the rate of change (jerk) between these peaks and dips were analyzed. Results were interpreted using rejection of non-substantial and substantial hypotheses with a smallest substantial change in velocity of 0.3%. Results Several boat acceleration measures had decisively substantial effects (-2.4–2.5%) before adjustment for stroke rate and power. Most effect magnitudes reduced after adjustment for stroke rate and power, although maximum negative drive acceleration, peak drive acceleration, jerk during the mid-drive phase, and jerk in the late recovery remained decisively substantial (-1.8–1.9%) in some boat classes. Conclusion Greater absolute values of maximum negative drive acceleration and jerk in the late recovery are related to improved performance, likely reflecting delayed rower centre-of-mass negative acceleration in preparation for the catch. Greater absolute values of peak drive acceleration, first peak acceleration, and jerk in the early and mid-drive are also associated with improved performance, likely reflecting propulsive force during the drive. These proposed mechanisms provide potential strategies for performance enhancement additional to increases in stroke rate and power output."

https://openalex.org/W3196004732,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) encompass a great variety of molecules of different kinds, such as microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, Piwi-associated RNA, among others. These sRNAs have a wide range of activities, which include gene regulation, protection against virus, transposable element silencing, and have been identified as a key actor in determining the development of the cell. Small RNA sequencing is thus routinely used to assess the expression of the diversity of sRNAs, usually in the context of differentially expression, where two conditions are compared. Tools that detect differentially expressed microRNAs are numerous, because microRNAs are well documented, and the associated genes are well defined. However, tools are lacking to detect other types of sRNAs, which are less studied, and whose precursor RNA is not well characterized. We present here a new method, called srnadiff, which finds all kinds of differentially expressed sRNAs. To the extent of our knowledge, srnadiff is the first tool that detects differentially expressed sRNAs without the use of external information, such as genomic annotation or additional sequences of sRNAs."

Murine hatching embryos were categorized into five groups based on initial trophectoderm projection (TEP)/ZP position corresponding to the inner cell mass center. In blastocysts (3.5 dpc) post-12 hours in vitro culture, TEP rates of A-site (44.4%) and B-site (38.6%) embryos were higher than those of C-site (12.5%) and D-site (3.1%) embryos, while the O-site (1.4%) was the lowest (P < .05). Post-ET A-site (55.6%) and B-site (65.6%) birth rates were higher than those of C-site embryos (21.3%) and controls (P < .05). Furthermore, live birth rate of B-site embryos remained higher than C-site embryos (68.8% vs 31.3%; P < .05) when both were transferred into the same recipients. Different TEP site blastocysts exhibited different implantation competences: the implantation rate of C-site embryos was lower than that of both A- and B-site groups (67.7% vs 84.3% and 83.2%, respectively; P < .05) at 2 days post-ET. C-site embryos also had a distinctly higher ratio of developmental defects (47.5%) than A- and B-site embryos (22.5% and 14.6%, respectively), with implantation failure mainly associated with poor birth rate, a finding corroborated by differential gene expression analysis such as LIF, LIFR, and S100a9. Surprisingly, acidified Tyrode's solution (AAH)-treated B-site blastocysts had a significantly increased birth rate (77.1%) than C-site (55.3%) and controls (43.4%). Site specificity and differential gene expression during embryo hatching can be applied in ART screening. More importantly, assisted hatching by AAH is effective and feasible for improving pregnancy and term development, particularly at the B-site, for humans and in animal husbandry."
https://openalex.org/W3196090214,"Vessel-based sonar systems that focus on the water column provide valuable information on the distribution of underwater marine organisms, but such data are expensive to collect and limited in their spatiotemporal coverage. Satellite data, however, are widely available across large regions and provide information on surface ocean conditions. If satellite data can be linked to subsurface sonar measurements, it may be possible to predict marine life over broader spatial regions with higher frequency using satellite observations. Here, we use random forest models to evaluate the potential for predicting a sonar-derived proxy for subsurface biomass as a function of satellite imagery in the California Current Ecosystem. We find that satellite data may be useful for prediction under some circumstances, but across a range of sonar frequencies and depths, overall model performance was low. Performance in spatial interpolation tasks exceeded performance in spatial and temporal extrapolation, suggesting that this approach is not yet reliable for forecasting or spatial extrapolation. We conclude with some potential limitations and extensions of this work."
https://openalex.org/W3157135163,"Milgram empirically showed that people knowing only connections to their friends could locate any person in the U.S. in a few steps. Later research showed that social network topology enables a node aware of its full routing to find an arbitrary target in even fewer steps. Yet, the success of people in forwarding efficiently knowing only personal connections is still not fully explained. To study this problem, we emulate it on a real location-based social network, Gowalla. It provides explicit information about friends and temporal locations of each user useful for studies of human mobility. Here, we use it to conduct a massive computational experiment to establish new necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving social search efficiency. The results demonstrate that only the distribution of friendship edges and the partial knowledge of friends of friends are essential and sufficient for the efficiency of social search. Surprisingly, the efficiency of the search using the original distribution of friendship edges is not dependent on how the nodes are distributed into space. Moreover, the effect of using a limited knowledge that each node possesses about friends of its friends is strongly nonlinear. We show that gains of such use grow statistically significantly only when this knowledge is limited to a small fraction of friends of friends."
https://openalex.org/W3193441895,"Limited literature has investigated epidemiology of sports-related fatalities during high school organizes sports in Japan. Therefore, the purposes of this study are to determine the frequency and incidence rate of sports-related fatalities in Japanese high schools by cause and sports, and to examine the type of on-site first responder. Insurance claim data of sports-related fatalities in Japanese high schools reported to Japan Sports Council Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit System between 2009 and 2018 were retrieved as the primary data source. All fatalities were classified into direct or indirect type by the reported etiology and further categorized into cardiac-related, head and neck injury, exertional heat stroke (EHS), or other. Frequency and incidence rate were calculated by cause of death and sports, and incidence rates were expressed per 100,000 athlete-years (AY) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Information regarding first responder to the incident was also retrieved and examined by frequency. A total of 63 sports-related fatalities were analyzed. The overall incidence rate was 0.45 (95%CI = 0.25-0.65) per 100,000AY. The incidence rates of direct and indirect fatalities declined from 0.36 and 0.50 per 100,000AY to 0.28 and 0.00 per 100,000AY, respectively. The leading cause of deaths was cardiac-related (n = 30/63, 47.6%), followed by head and neck injury (n = 15/63, 23.8%) and EHS (n = 14/63, 22.2%). The number of fatalities was highest in male baseball (n = 12/63, 19.0%) and the incidence rate was highest in male judo (4.79 per 100,000 AY, 95%CI: 0.68-8.15). Coach was the most frequently reported first responder onsite (n = 52/63, 82.5%). Medically trained personnel were involved in onsite care in two cases (3.2%). In conclusion, the occurrence of sports-related fatalities has declined over time from 2009 to 2018. To deliver appropriate medical care onsite for better survival, employment of medically trained personnel should be promoted in high school sports setting in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3194104165,"Nestled in a state park, the wedding was a perfect opportunity to take a break from my Ph.D. and celebrate the union of my close friends. But my mind was somewhere else. Moments earlier, as my wife and I were waiting for the ceremony to begin, I took out my phone and compulsively checked my email. I spotted an urgent message from one of my collaborators, outlining analyses they needed me to complete for a manuscript resubmission. I pocketed my phone, but the damage was done: For the rest of the weekend my mind was thrust back into research mode, anxiously trying to figure out how I was going to get the work done.



> “I began to push back on my habit of mindlessly reaching for my phone.” 

Throughout grad school, establishing a healthy work-life balance was a challenge. During a lab rotation, I listened with disbelief as the principal investigator (PI) told me he expected trainees to work 12-hour days 6 days per week. No one else appeared to be bothered by his demanding work routine. His trainees would regularly stay in the lab until midnight, only to return first thing the next morning. I started waking up as early as possible to get into the lab and demonstrate my dedication. But after 1 week, I knew that the research group, with its skewed approach to work-life balance, wasn't for me.

For another rotation, I chose a group that had more reasonable working hours. The PI and other lab members went home for dinner, made time for family, and exercised regularly. Instead of racking up hours, they focused on being efficient with the time they dedicated to research. For the first time, I didn't feel guilty for seeking a life outside the lab. Not long after, I signed on to stay in that lab for the rest of my Ph.D.

With my new PI's support, I succeeded in staying productive while keeping reasonable work hours, regularly leaving the lab by 5 p.m. Yet, I often found myself thinking about work well into the evening. Instead of unwinding and cooking dinner, I would anxiously ruminate on my experiments. While watching TV, I would scroll through newly published scientific articles during commercial breaks. My conversations with family members and friends always seemed to gravitate toward the status of my research. One evening, my wife asked whether, during dinner, we could talk about something—anything—other than my work.

A turning point came during my second year, when that single email hijacked my attention at the wedding. Frustrated, I asked myself, “Have I really achieved work-life balance if, regardless of where I am, my mind is in the lab?” I realized that my habitual email checking was key to my problem. In one instance, I opened an email containing peer-review feedback at 10:30 p.m. and instantly read through the detailed list of criticisms. No wonder I had a fitful sleep that night.

So I set a new boundary for myself: Only deal with work-related tasks—opening emails, reading journal articles—when I can give them my full attention. I began to push back on my habit of mindlessly reaching for my phone whenever I had a spare moment. Instead, I forced myself to stop and question whether the time was right. I also began to turn off my phone during some events, such as parties and family gatherings. Although it took time to develop better habits, I was pleased to find that this strategy cut down on anxious mind-whirring when I was trying to relax.

I also started to practice being mentally present during activities outside the lab. For instance, I found it helpful to go for an evening walk and try to notice the birds and flowers around me, a practice that drew me out of my thoughts and into my surroundings. It was challenging at first, but as my walk became a part of my daily rhythm, it became easier to ground myself and take these moments to recharge.

Now a postdoc, I still catch myself on occasion thinking about experiments when I'm trying to fall asleep at night. But I'm making progress toward being mentally present when I step away from my workspace. By bringing worklife balance to my inner world as well as my schedule, I hope to become a less anxious scientist, a more attentive husband, and a much happier wedding guest."
https://openalex.org/W3194206902,"Background COPD and asthma exacerbations result in many emergency department admissions. Not all treatments are successful, often leading to hospital readmissions. Aims We sought to develop predictive models for exacerbation treatment outcome in a cohort of exacerbating asthma and COPD patients presenting to the emergency department. Methods Treatment failure was defined as the need for additional systemic corticosteroids (SCS) and/or antibiotics, hospital readmissison or death within 30 days of initial emergency department visit. We performed univariate analysis comparing characteristics of patients either given or not given SCS at exacerbation and of patients who succeeded versus failed treatment. Patient demographics, medications and exacerbation symptoms, physiology and biology were available. We developed multivariate random forest models to identify predictors of SCS prescription and for predicting treatment failure. Results Data were available for 81 patients, 43 (53%) of whom failed treatment. 64 (79%) of patients were given SCS. A random forest model using presence of wheeze at exacerbation and blood eosinophil percentage predicted SCS prescription with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.69. An 11 variable random forest model (which included medication, previous exacerbations, symptoms and quality of life scores) could predict treatment failure with AUC 0.81. A random forest model using just the two best predictors of treatment failure, namely, visual analogue scale for breathlessness and sputum purulence, predicted treatment failure with AUC 0.68. Conclusion Prediction of exacerbation treatment outcome can be achieved via supervised machine learning combining different predictors at exacerbation. Validation of our predictive models in separate, larger patient cohorts is required."
https://openalex.org/W3194633995,"This paper investigated the appropriate specifications of Engel curves for non-food expenditure categories and estimated the deprivation indices of non-food needs in rural areas using a semi parametric examination of the presence of saturation points. The study used the extended partial linear model (EPLM) and adopted two estimation methods-the double residual estimator and differencing estimator-to obtain flexible shapes across different expenditure categories and estimate equivalence scales. We drew on data of the Egyptian Household Income, Expenditure, and Consumption Survey (HIEC). Our paper provides empirical evidence that the rankings of most non-food expenditure categories is of rank three at most. Rural households showed high economies of scale in non-food consumption, with child's needs accounting for only 10% of adult's non-food needs. Based on semi-parametrically estimated consumption behavior, the tendency of non-food expenditure categories to saturate did not emerge. While based on parametrically estimated consumption behavior, rural areas exhibited higher deprivation indices in terms of health and education expenditure categories, which indicates the need to design specific programs economically targeting such vulnerable households."
https://openalex.org/W3194920925,"Introduction Suicidality is a risk of a person committing suicide often characterized by suicidal ideation, intent or attempts. Despite the high burden of suicidality among individuals living with HIV and HAIDS, there is paucity of data on the impact of suicidality on clinical (such as CD4 counts and HIV disease progression) and behavioural outcomes (such as adherence to HIV Medications). Cross-sectional investigations of these associations are often complicated by bidirectional causal relationships and hence the need for longitudinal study designs. We conducted a cohort study to determine the impact of suicidality on clinical and behavioural outcomes among adults living with HIV/AIDS in Uganda. Materials and methods We conducted the study among 1099 ART naïve adults living with HIV/AIDS in Uganda. Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 6 and 12 months. Multiple regression and discrete time survival models were used to determine the relationship between suicidality and indices of HIV outcomes. Results Majority of the participants were female and the participant mean age was 35 years. Most of them (73%) had primary or no formal education. The proportion of participants with suicidality decreased from 2.9% at baseline to roughly 1% both at month 6 and month 12. Of the investigated clinical and behavioural outcomes, baseline suicidality only had a negative impact on missing a dose of ART where the odds of missing a dose of ART were 8.25 (95% CI 2.45–27.71, p&gt;0.01) times higher for participants with suicidality compared to those without suicidality. The following outcomes were not significantly impacted by baseline suicidality: HIV clinical stage, CD4 count and risky sexual behaviour. Conclusions The fact that baseline suicidality significantly negatively impacted ART adherence calls for the incorporation of psychosocial interventions to target indices of psychological distress such as suicidality to improve HIV related outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3195522777,"Introduction The concept of death is abstract, complex and has a number of meanings. Thus, its understanding and the approach taken to it depend, to a large extent, on aspects such as age, culture, training and religion. Nursing students have regular contact with the process of death and so it is of great interest to understand the attitudes they have towards it. As we live in a plural society it is even more interesting to not only understand the attitudes of Spanish students but, also, those of students coming from other countries. In the present article, we seek to identify and compare the attitudes held by nursing degree students at Hekima-Santé University (Senegal) and the University of Huelva (Spain) about end of life processes. The study identifies elements that condition attitudes and coping with death, whilst considering curricular differences with regards to specific end of life training. Method A descriptive, cross-sectional and multi-center study was conducted. The overall sample (N = 142) was divided into groups: Hekima-Santé University (Dakar, Senegal) and the University of Huelva (Huelva, Spain). The measurement instruments used were an ad-hoc questionnaire and Bugen´s Coping with Death Scale. Results Statistically significant differences (p = 0.005, 95%CI) were found in relation to overall Bugen Scale scores. We can confirm that specialized end of life training (University of Huelva, Spain) did not lead to better coping when compared with a population whose academic curriculum did not provide specific training and who engaged in more religious practices (Hekima-Santé University, Senegal). Conclusions In cultures where religion not only influences the spiritual dimension of the individual, but acts in the ethical and moral system and consequently in the economic, educational and family sphere, the accompaniment at the end of life transcends the formative plane. Considering the plural society in which we live, the training that integrates the Degree in Nursing with regard to the care of the final process, must be multidimensional in which spirituality and faith are integrated, working emotional and attentional skills, as well as cultural competence strategies in this process."
