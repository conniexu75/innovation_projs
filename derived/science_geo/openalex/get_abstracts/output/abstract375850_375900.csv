https://openalex.org/W2072170322,"Many Mixed Linkers in MOFs Crystallization can separate different molecules because different molecules cannot generally be accommodated equally well in the same crystal lattice. However, in metal-organic framework (MOF) compounds, the organic linkers do not pack closely to other parts of the lattice, so it may be possible to mix several linkers that are derivatives of a parent compound with the same end groups. Deng et al. (p. 846 ) show that zinc-based MOFs can be made that mix 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and up to eight of its derivatives in a random fashion. The effects of such mixing on porosity and absorption characteristics is nonlinear; in one case, a mixed-linker compound was four times better for selecting CO 2 versus CO compared with the best MOF bearing only one of the component linkers."
https://openalex.org/W2009573330,"The protein α-synuclein accumulates in the brain of patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), and increased gene dosage causes a severe, dominantly inherited form of PD, but we know little about the effects of synuclein that precede degeneration. α-Synuclein localizes to the nerve terminal, but the knockout has little if any effect on synaptic transmission. In contrast, we now find that the modest overexpression of α-synuclein, in the range predicted for gene multiplication and in the absence of overt toxicity, markedly inhibits neurotransmitter release. The mechanism, elucidated by direct imaging of the synaptic vesicle cycle, involves a specific reduction in size of the synaptic vesicle recycling pool. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates reduced synaptic vesicle density at the active zone, and imaging further reveals a defect in the reclustering of synaptic vesicles after endocytosis. Increased levels of α-synuclein thus produce a specific, physiological defect in synaptic vesicle recycling that precedes detectable neuropathology."

Can simple quantum mechanical rules such as quantum statistics, single scattering partial waves, and quantum threshold laws provide a clear understanding for the molecular reactivity under a vanishing collision energy? Starting with an optically trapped near quantum degenerate gas of polar $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb molecules prepared in their absolute ground state, we report experimental evidence for exothermic atom-exchange chemical reactions. When these fermionic molecules are prepared in a single quantum state at a temperature of a few hundreds of nanoKelvins, we observe p-wave-dominated quantum threshold collisions arising from tunneling through an angular momentum barrier followed by a near-unity probability short-range chemical reaction. When these molecules are prepared in two different internal states or when molecules and atoms are brought together, the reaction rates are enhanced by a factor of 10 to 100 due to s-wave scattering, which does not have a centrifugal barrier. The measured rates agree with predicted universal loss rates related to the two-body van der Waals length."
https://openalex.org/W2137289649,"Evan Eichler and colleagues identify a recurrent microdeletion on 16p12.1 associated with developmental, cognitive and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. They also show that more severe phenotypes are frequently correlated with the presence of a second large genomic rearrangement, supporting a complex model of pathogenesis that may underlie the variable expressivity typical of many microdeletion syndromes. We report the identification of a recurrent, 520-kb 16p12.1 microdeletion associated with childhood developmental delay. The microdeletion was detected in 20 of 11,873 cases compared with 2 of 8,540 controls (P = 0.0009, OR = 7.2) and replicated in a second series of 22 of 9,254 cases compared with 6 of 6,299 controls (P = 0.028, OR = 2.5). Most deletions were inherited, with carrier parents likely to manifest neuropsychiatric phenotypes compared to non-carrier parents (P = 0.037, OR = 6). Probands were more likely to carry an additional large copy-number variant when compared to matched controls (10 of 42 cases, P = 5.7 × 10−5, OR = 6.6). The clinical features of individuals with two mutations were distinct from and/or more severe than those of individuals carrying only the co-occurring mutation. Our data support a two-hit model in which the 16p12.1 microdeletion both predisposes to neuropsychiatric phenotypes as a single event and exacerbates neurodevelopmental phenotypes in association with other large deletions or duplications. Analysis of other microdeletions with variable expressivity indicates that this two-hit model might be more generally applicable to neuropsychiatric disease."
https://openalex.org/W1971956982,"From Steps to Clusters When a flat surface of a single crystal is formed by cutting or cleavage, the atoms may move little from their bulk positions, or the surface may reconstruct as the atoms move to more energetically favorable positions. The adsorption of molecules can also change the energetic landscape and cause reconstruction. Tao et al. (p. 850 ; see the Perspective by Altman ) examined “stepped” platinum surfaces, the (557) and (332) surfaces in which flat terraces are connected by atomic steps. Scanning tunneling microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a reversible breakup into nanometer-scale clusters when CO surface coverages were very high. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this new morphology increases the number of edge sites for adsorption and relieves unfavorable CO-CO repulsions."
https://openalex.org/W2096770879,"Microorganisms can switch from a planktonic, free-swimming life-style to a sessile, colonial state, called a biofilm, which confers resistance to environmental stress. Conversion between the motile and biofilm life-styles has been attributed to increased levels of the prokaryotic second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), yet the signaling mechanisms mediating such a global switch are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcriptional regulator VpsT from Vibrio cholerae directly senses c-di-GMP to inversely control extracellular matrix production and motility, which identifies VpsT as a master regulator for biofilm formation. Rather than being regulated by phosphorylation, VpsT undergoes a change in oligomerization on c-di-GMP binding."
https://openalex.org/W2158770881,"Most depressed patients don't respond to their first drug treatment, and the reasons for this treatment resistance remain enigmatic. Human studies implicate a polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene in increased susceptibility to depression and decreased treatment response. Here we develop a new strategy to manipulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors in raphe nuclei without affecting 5-HT1A heteroreceptors, generating mice with higher (1A-High) or lower (1A-Low) autoreceptor levels. We show that this robustly affects raphe firing rates, but has no effect on either basal forebrain serotonin levels or conflict-anxiety measures. However, compared to 1A-Low mice, 1A-High mice show a blunted physiological response to acute stress, increased behavioral despair, and no behavioral response to antidepressant, modeling patients with the 5-HT1A risk allele. Furthermore, reducing 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels prior to antidepressant treatment is sufficient to convert nonresponders into responders. These results establish a causal relationship between 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels, resilience under stress, and response to antidepressants."
https://openalex.org/W1992804184,"Pheochromocytomas, which are catecholamine-secreting tumors of neural crest origin, are frequently hereditary. However, the molecular basis of the majority of these tumors is unknown. We identified the transmembrane-encoding gene TMEM127 on chromosome 2q11 as a new pheochromocytoma susceptibility gene. In a cohort of 103 samples, we detected truncating germline TMEM127 mutations in approximately 30% of familial tumors and about 3% of sporadic-appearing pheochromocytomas without a known genetic cause. The wild-type allele was consistently deleted in tumor DNA, suggesting a classic mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Pheochromocytomas with mutations in TMEM127 are transcriptionally related to tumors bearing NF1 mutations and, similarly, show hyperphosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effector proteins. Accordingly, in vitro gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses indicate that TMEM127 is a negative regulator of mTOR. TMEM127 dynamically associates with the endomembrane system and colocalizes with perinuclear (activated) mTOR, suggesting a subcompartmental-specific effect. Our studies identify TMEM127 as a tumor suppressor gene and validate the power of hereditary tumors to elucidate cancer pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1988947063,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) accompanied by cellular differentiation and migration. Despite extensive transcriptomic profiling, the identification of TGF-beta-inducible, EMT-specific genes has met with limited success. Here we identify a post-transcriptional pathway by which TGF-beta modulates the expression of EMT-specific proteins and of EMT itself. We show that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP E1) binds a structural, 33-nucleotide TGF-beta-activated translation (BAT) element in the 3' untranslated region of disabled-2 (Dab2) and interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) transcripts, and represses their translation. TGF-beta activation leads to phosphorylation at Ser 43 of hnRNP E1 by protein kinase Bbeta/Akt2, inducing its release from the BAT element and translational activation of Dab2 and ILEI messenger RNAs. Modulation of hnRNP E1 expression or its post-translational modification alters the TGF-beta-mediated reversal of translational silencing of the target transcripts and EMT. These results suggest the existence of a TGF-beta-inducible post-transcriptional regulon that controls EMT during the development and metastatic progression of tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2010073791,"Pathological behaviors such as problem gambling or shopping are characterized by compulsive choice despite alternative options and negative costs. Reinforcement learning algorithms allow a computation of prediction error, a comparison of actual and expected outcomes, which updates our predictions and influences our subsequent choices. Using a reinforcement learning model, we show data consistent with the idea that dopamine agonists in susceptible individuals with Parkinson's disease increase the rate of learning from gain outcomes. Dopamine agonists also increase striatal prediction error activity, thus signifying a “better than expected” outcome. Thus, our findings are consistent with a model whereby a distorted estimation of the gain cue underpins a choice bias toward gains."
https://openalex.org/W2124777856,"During natural vision, the entire visual field is stimulated by images rich in spatiotemporal structure. Although many visual system studies restrict stimuli to the classical receptive field (CRF), it is known that costimulation of the CRF and the surrounding nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) increases neuronal response sparseness. The cellular and network mechanisms underlying increased response sparseness remain largely unexplored. Here we show that combined CRF + nCRF stimulation increases the sparseness, reliability, and precision of spiking and membrane potential responses in classical regular spiking (RSC) pyramidal neurons of cat primary visual cortex. Conversely, fast-spiking interneurons exhibit increased activity and decreased selectivity during CRF + nCRF stimulation. The increased sparseness and reliability of RSC neuron spiking is associated with increased inhibitory barrages and narrower visually evoked synaptic potentials. Our experimental observations were replicated with a simple computational model, suggesting that network interactions among neuronal subtypes ultimately sharpen recurrent excitation, producing specific and reliable visual responses."
https://openalex.org/W2127355894,"Deregulation of the phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway has been implicated in numerous pathologies including cancer, diabetes, thrombosis, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Recently, small-molecule and ATP-competitive PI(3)K inhibitors with a wide range of selectivities have entered clinical development. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the isoform selectivity of these inhibitors, we developed a new expression strategy that enabled us to determine to our knowledge the first crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of the class IA PI(3)K p110 delta. Structures of this enzyme in complex with a broad panel of isoform- and pan-selective class I PI(3)K inhibitors reveal that selectivity toward p110 delta can be achieved by exploiting its conformational flexibility and the sequence diversity of active site residues that do not contact ATP. We have used these observations to rationalize and synthesize highly selective inhibitors for p110 delta with greatly improved potencies."
https://openalex.org/W2145510016,"The density of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) at synapses regulates brain excitability, and altered inhibition may contribute to Huntington's disease, which is caused by a polyglutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin. However, the machinery that delivers GABAARs to synapses is unknown. We demonstrate that GABAARs are trafficked to synapses by the kinesin family motor protein 5 (KIF5). We identify the adaptor linking the receptors to KIF5 as the huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1). Disrupting the HAP1-KIF5 complex decreases synaptic GABAAR number and reduces the amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. When huntingtin is mutated, as in Huntington's disease, GABAAR transport and inhibitory synaptic currents are reduced. Thus, HAP1-KIF5-dependent GABAAR trafficking is a fundamental mechanism controlling the strength of synaptic inhibition in the brain. Its disruption by mutant huntingtin may explain some of the defects in brain information processing occurring in Huntington's disease and provides a molecular target for therapeutic approaches.

Importantly, the role of kinesin family (KIF) microtubule motors in regulating the strength and plasticity of GABAergic transmission is unknown, as is the identity of the adaptor molecules which link GABAARs to their trafficking motors. Alterations in protein trafficking to neuronal membranes, including altered trafficking of GABAARs, occur in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases (Jacob et al., 2008Jacob T.C. Moss S.J.

In Huntington's disease (HD), a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein (polyQ-htt) results in cell death and neurodegeneration of specific neuronal populations, leading to uncontrolled movements, personality changes, dementia, and eventually death within 10–20 years of the first symptoms. In addition to roles in regulating apoptosis and transcription, huntingtin may have a neurotoxic role in HD by altering intracellular transport of proteins, including transport of NMDA receptors (Gauthier et al., 2004Gauthier L.R.

A huntingtin-associated protein enriched in brain with implications for pathology.Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). HAP1 interacts directly with GABAARs and facilitates their recycling back to synapses after they have been internalized from the surface membrane, and so can regulate the strength of inhibitory synaptic transmission (Kittler et al., 2004Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J.

Here, using biochemical, imaging, and electrophysiological approaches, we show that HAP1 is an adaptor that links GABAARs to KIF5 motors, forming a motor protein complex for rapid delivery of GABAARs to synapses. Furthermore, mutant huntingtin containing a polyQ expansion that disrupts HAP1 function (Gauthier et al., 2004Gauthier L.R. Charrin B.C. Borrell-Pages M. Dompierre J.P. Rangone H. Cordelieres F.P.

Thus, KIF5-dependent transport is critical for delivery of GABAARs to inhibitory synapses, and disruption of this complex by mutant huntingtin may lead to altered synaptic inhibition and increased neuronal excitability in Huntington's disease. The kinesin motor protein KIF5 is a critical determinant of intracellular transport processes in neurons (Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Molecular motors and mechanisms of directional transport in neurons.Nat. Rev. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar). To investigate if KIF5 activity is important for inhibitory transmission, we carried out whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure inhibitory synaptic transmission in cortical neurons dialyzed via the electrophysiological recording pipette with an antibody demonstrated to block KIF5 motor protein activity (kinesin function blocking antibody SUK4 [Ingold et al., 1988Ingold A.L.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1909-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This was compared with neurons dialyzed with a control antibody (9E10) that does not recognize KIF5. Dialysis of SUK4 (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1F) caused a rapid reduction in mIPSC amplitude within 20 min of recording (Figure 1F: SUK4, 36.2% ± 3% reduction in mean mIPSC amplitude n = 7, p < 0.05), as can clearly be seen in representative mIPSC traces (Figure 1C) and by a leftward shift to smaller amplitudes in cumulative probability plots (Figure 1A). In contrast there was no significant decrease in mean mIPSC amplitude in control 9E10 dialyzed neurons (Figures 1D and 1F: 9E10, 5.6% ± 1.7% reduction, n = 5). Neither SUK4 nor 9E10 antibody was found to affect mIPSC interval (Figures 1B, 1E, and 1F: SUK4, 8.2% ± 4.4% reduction in mean mIPSC interval; 9E10, 5.3% ± 1.6% reduction). Dialysis of SUK4 antibody did not affect mIPSC kinetics, implying that KIF5 does not selectively transport GABAARs with particular kinetics (see Table S1 available online). Similar results were also seen with SUK4 and 9E10 FAb fragments (Figures S1A–S1E). Thus, our results support a key role for KIF5 function in maintaining inhibitory synaptic transmission. We hypothesized that the effect of SUK4 on inhibitory transmission was mediated by blocking KIF5-dependent GABAAR delivery to synapses. To test this, SUK4 or control 9E10 antibody was introduced into cultured neurons by complexing with a membrane permeant carrier peptide (Coulpier et al., 2002Coulpier M. Anders J. Ibanez C.F.

Cell surface synaptic GABAAR clusters were identified with an antibody to the extracellular domain of the GABAAR γ2 subunit, while antibodies to the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT; a marker of inhibitory presynaptic terminals [Dumoulin et al., 1999Dumoulin A. Rostaing P. Bedet C. Levi S. Isambert M.F. Henry J.P. Triller A. Gasnier B. Presence of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter in GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic terminal boutons.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 811-823PubMed Google Scholar]) were used to identify inhibitory synapses on neuronal dendrites. A mouse secondary antibody verified that SUK4 penetrated the neurons (Figure S1G). Neurons treated with SUK4 showed a significant decrease in GABAAR cluster area in dendrites compared with control mock-treated or 9E10 treated neurons (Figures 1G and 1H; SUK4 treatment reduced GABAAR cluster area by 46.5% ± 11.9% compared with 9E10 controls, n = 5, p < 0.01), but with no change in the ratio of synaptic to nonsynaptic GABAAR clusters (Figure S1F), strongly suggesting that blocking KIF5 activity decreases the delivery of GABAARs to synapses. We also compared the effect of blocking KIF5 activity on GABAAR responses with its effect on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) mediated responses, which are trafficked by a different KIF, the motor protein KIF17 (Guillaud et al., 2003Guillaud L.

Compared with control inactive (boiled) SUK4 antibody (Figures 1I and 1K), SUK4 dialysis rapidly and dramatically reduced GABAAR mediated whole-cell responses in recorded neurons (Figures 1I and 1K: 35.1% ± 7.9% reduction in GABA response within 20 min with SUK4, n = 6, p < 0.05, compared with 8.7% ± 2.2% reduction for inactive boiled SUK4, n = 7), whereas neither active nor inactive SUK4 affected NMDAR-mediated responses (Figures 1J and 1K: SUK4: 9.4% ± 1.8% reduction in NMDA response, n = 7; boiled SUK4: 8.1% ± 1.7%, n = 7), further supporting the specificity of KIF5 for selectively trafficking GABAARs to synapses. If KIF5 is important for synaptic delivery of GABAARs, then we would expect to detect localization of KIF5 and GABAARs to the same neuronal compartments. In agreement with this, immunofluorescence and CLSM with antibodies to the GABAAR γ2 subunit and antibodies specific to KIF5B (Figure 2A) or KIF5C (Figure 2B), revealed that a proportion of KIF5 staining colocalized with GABAAR clusters in the neuronal somata and dendrites of cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons (see also Figure S2 for whole images of hippocampal neurons and for labeling of cortical neurons). Furthermore, electron microscopy of in vivo hippocampus and rat ventral spinal cord, revealed that KIF5-positive deposits were consistently found in the vicinity of postsynaptic membranes and decorating the postsynaptic side of symmetrical type 2 contacts, defined as inhibitory by the pleomorphic nature of the vesicles within the presynaptic boutons and by their narrow (15–20 nm) synaptic cleft (Figures 2C–2H). With pre-embedding immunolabeling and gold-toned silver intensified nanogold particles, KIF5 staining was found associated with small subsynaptic intracellular cisternae, which were often located below or at the edge of postsynaptic differentiations that may be part of subsynaptic tubulovesicular endosomes (Figures 2C and 2E). Double detection of GAD and KIF5, with immunoperoxidase and gold toned silver-intensified nanoparticles, respectively, confirmed the inhibitory nature of the presynaptic terminals (Figures 2G and 2H). We would also expect to detect protein complexes of KIF5 and GABAARs in vivo. To investigate this we carried out glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull downs and coimmunoprecipitation assays from rat brain lysate. GST-fusion proteins of the GABAAR β1-3 subunit intracellular domains (Figure 2I), or rat brain immunoprecipitated GABAARs (Figure 2J) could readily coprecipitate KIF5 heavy chains, providing evidence that KIF5 motor proteins form complexes with GABAARs in vivo. Motor proteins often determine cargo selectivity by linking to the cargo via an adaptor protein (Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Molecular motors and mechanisms of directional transport in neurons.Nat. Rev. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar). HAP1 is involved in motor-protein-dependent transport of neuronal cargo, associating with motor protein complexes (Engelender et al., 1997Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Colomer V. Tokito M.K. Lanahan A.

Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Huntingtin-associated protein 1 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission by modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor membrane trafficking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and therefore was a good candidate adaptor to link GABAAR transport vesicles with KIF5 motors. HAP1 immunoprecipitated from solubilized brain extracts readily coprecipitated KIF5, as demonstrated with either a pan anti-KIF5 antibody (which recognizes all three KIF5 heavy chains, Figure 2K) or using anti-KIF5B and anti-KIF5C-specific antibodies (Figures 2L and 2M, respectively). In the reverse experiment, HAP1 readily coprecipitated with immunoprecipitated KIF5C or GABAAR β3 subunits, further confirming that in vivo GABAARs are found in complexes with HAP1 and KIF5 (Figure 2N). To test if the interaction between HAP1 and KIF5A-C heavy chains was direct, we performed GST fusion protein affinity purification experiments with GST-HAP1 and individual 35S-methione-labeled KIF5A-C heavy chains or the kinesin light chain (KLC), which confirmed a direct interaction of KIF5 heavy chains with HAP1 (highest for KIF5B and KIF5C isoforms; Figures 2O and 2P). Thus HAP1 is the adaptor linking KIF5 to GABAARs. To further investigate the mechanism of KIF5-dependent GABAAR trafficking we identified the molecular determinants of the HAP1-KIF5 interaction. KIF5 heavy chains comprise an N-terminal motor domain and a C-terminal nonmotor domain. Initial experiments, using coimmunoprecipitation and coexpression of epitope tagged KIF5C N-terminal motor domain or C-terminal nonmotor domain proteins, revealed that HAP1 interacts with the KIF5C nonmotor domain (Figure S3), which comprises the stalk domain, the kinesin light chain binding domain, and the cargo binding domain. Using additional GFP tagged constructs for KIF5B (or KIF5C; not shown), lacking either the stalk domain or both the stalk and light chain binding regions, we determined that the C-terminal cargo binding domain of KIF5 is the minimal region sufficient for mediating an interaction with HAP1, as shown by the fact that GST-HAP1 (Figure S3D) or GST-HAP1 fragments (Figures 3A–3C) could readily pull down the C-terminal domain of KIF5B (residues 814–963, from here on called the HAP1-binding domain, or HBD; see Figure 3A). In complementary GST pull-down experiments with GST-HAP1 deletion constructs (Figures 3A–3C), we also determined that a region containing coiled-coil domains 1 and 2 (part of the HAP N-terminal homology domain) was sufficient for interacting with the C-terminal region of the KIF5 motor (Figures 3B and 3C). We used the HAP1 binding domain of KIF5 (KIF5-HBD) as a dominant negative construct to further investigate the consequences of disrupting KIF5-dependent GABAAR trafficking to synapses. Using surface biotinylation to quantify surface GABAAR levels, we found that, compared with control GFP-transfected neurons, neurons expressing the GFPKIF5B-HBD produced a significant decrease in the cell surface number of GABAARs containing β3 subunits (68.5% ± 6.0% of control, n = 8, p < 0.005, Figures 3D–3F), whereas surface levels of either the transferrin receptor (TfR) or the NMDAR were unaffected (Figures S3E and S3F). The source of GABAARs from the internal pool that supplies fast synaptic receptor insertion remains unknown. However, GABAARs have been previously demonstrated to be rapidly reinserted into the membrane from an intracellular pool of internalized receptors (Kittler et al., 2004Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Huntingtin-associated protein 1 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission by modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor membrane trafficking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After labeling this intracellular pool of GABAARs with biotin, the loss of biotinylated internal GABAARs after a second biotin cleavage (see Experimental Procedures) provides a measure of receptor insertion rate into the membrane (Ehlers, 2000Ehlers M.D. Reinsertion or degradation of AMPA receptors determined by activity-dependent endocytic sorting.Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, Kittler et al., 2004Kittler J.T.

USA. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Internal biotinylated GABAARs remaining during the time course were then compared with those at the start of the reinsertion time course (i.e., time 0 in Figure 3G), designated as 100%. We found that expressing GFPKIF5B-HBD in neurons resulted in a significant reduction in the loss of the internal biotinylated receptor pool (i.e., more internal biotinylated receptors remained) compared with GFP controls. This gives a significant decrease in GABAAR insertion levels at 30 and 60 min upon disruption of HAP1/KIF5-dependent trafficking (Figures 3G and 3H: at 30 min 38.6% ± 2.4% receptors remained in the internal pool for GFPKIF5B-HBD transfected neurons compared with 27.1% ± 3.9% receptors remaining in the internal pool for GFP control transfected neurons; at 60 min 25.1% ± 2.1% for GFPKIF5B-HBD compared with 14.2% ± 2.9% for GFP control; n = 5, p < 0.05). In contrast GABAAR endocytosis was not affected by expressing GFPKIF5B-HBD (Figures S3G, S3H). Our results demonstrate that disrupting KIF5-dependent trafficking by expressing GFPKIF5B-HBD decreases receptor insertion into the surface membrane. Functional confirmation that this decrease in trafficking resulted in a loss of synaptic receptors was observed from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Figures 4A–4E). Neurons transfected with GFPKIF5B-HBD showed a significant decrease in mIPSC amplitudes compared with GFP-transfected neurons, (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4D; mean mIPSC amplitude in GFPKIF5B-HBD transfected neurons 17.8 ± 2.4 pA, n = 6, compared with 27.8 ± 3.7 pA, n = 5, for control GFP transfected neurons, p < 0.05), which was also indicated by a leftward shift toward lower amplitudes in the cumulative distribution plots (Figure 4A). An even greater reduction was seen upon neuronal expression of GFPKIF5C-HBD (Figures S4A and S4D; GFPKIF5C-HBD: 12.7 ± 1.2 pA, n = 8, compared with GFP: 27.4 ± 2.0 pA, n = 6, p < 0.05; equivalent to a 53.6% ± 4.4% reduction in mean amplitude for GFPKIF5C-HBD, compared with the 36.0% ± 8.6% reduction seen for GFPKIF5B-HBD). In contrast GFPKIF5B-HBD or GFPKIF5C-HBD expression caused no significant alteration in mIPSC interval (Figures 4B, 4E, S4B, and S4E; mIPSC average interval GFP: 0.21 ± 0.02 s, n = 5, GFPKIF5B-HBD: 0.22 ± 0.01 s, n = 6; GFP: 0.20 ± 0.02 s, n = 6, GFPKIF5C-HBD: 0.24 ± 0.01 s, n = 8). Further supporting the idea that HAP1-KIF5-dependent reinsertion of GABAARs plays a critical role in delivery of GABAARs to synapses, we also found that expression of KIF5-HBD decreased the size of GABAAR clusters, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and CLSM (GABAAR cluster area in KIF5B-HBD expressing neurons was 72.9% ± 10.3% of control GFP expressing neurons, n = 5, p < 0.01, see Figures 4F and 4G) without producing a change in the ratio of the number of synaptic to the number of nonsynaptic GABAAR clusters (Figure S4F). To further support the role of the HAP1/KIF5 complex for trafficking GABAARs to synapses, we also investigated the functional consequences of expressing in neurons the domain on HAP1 to which KIF5 binds (i.e., the HAP1-KIF5 binding domain; HAP1-KBD; Figure 3B). Compared with neurons expressing GFP, neurons expressing GFPHAP1-KBD showed reduced mIPSC amplitudes, (Figures 4H, 4J, and 4K; mIPSC amplitude in GFP-expressing neurons: 37.1 ± 2.4 pA, n = 8, and 22.9 ± 2.1 pA in GFPHAP-KBD-expressing neurons, n = 7, p < 0.01), while similar to expression of KIF5-HBD, mIPSC frequency remained unaffected (Figures 4I, 4J, and 4L; GFP: 5.1 ± 0.7 Hz, n = 8; HAP1-KBD: 4.4 ± 0.4 Hz, n = 7). In contrast to the effects observed on GABAAR mIPSC amplitude upon expression of KIF5-HBD or HAP1-KBD, targeting the function of the NMDAR motor KIF17, which does not interact with HAP1 (Figure S4L) and which blocks trafficking of NMDARs (Guillaud et al., 2003Guillaud L. Setou M. Hirokawa N. KIF17 dynamics and regulation of NR2B trafficking in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on inhibitory synaptic function (Figures S4G–S4K). These results further support a critical role for the HAP1/KIF5 complex in trafficking GABAARs to synapses. Our results suggest that HAP1 is a specificity adaptor for the recruitment of GABAAR containing transport vesicles to a KIF5 transport pathway for their rapid delivery to synapses. To further validate the role of the HAP1-KIF5 complex, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down HAP1 expression (Figures 5A–5C) and determined the effect on trafficking and synaptic inhibition. Similar to the effect of disrupting KIF5 function (by expressing KIF5-HBD), biotinylation experiments revealed that knocking down HAP1 (Figures 5A–5C) resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of surface GABAARs (for HAP1 RNAi-expressing neurons surface levels were 43.1% ± 8.2% of control scrambled RNAi expressing neurons, n = 6, p < 0.0005, Figures 5D and 5E) without affecting the surface levels of TfR or the NMDAR (Figures S5A and S5B). Biotinylation experiments also revealed that HAP1 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in rates of GABAAR insertion into the membrane at 30 and 60 min compared with RNAi control transfected cells (Figures 5F and 5G). At 30 min the control RNAi cells had 25.3% ± 2.6% of receptors remaining in the internal pool compared with 40.7% ± 5.5% receptors remaining for HAP1 RNAi, while at 60 min the control RNAi cells had 13.0% ± 2.2% receptors remaining in the internal pool compared with 25.2% ± 5.6% in HAP1 RNAi-expressing cells; n = 7–9; p < 0.05), but HAP1 RNAi did not alter GABAAR endocytosis (Figures S5C and S5D). In agreement with these observations, patch-clamp recordings of neurons expressing the HAP1 RNAi revealed that mIPSC amplitude, but not frequency, in neurons was dramatically reduced compared with the scrambled control RNAi (Figures 6A–6E: HAP1 RNAi mI"

The mechanisms by which cytokines engage HPA control circuitry remain unclear, though stimulated release of prostanoids from neighboring vascular cells has been implicated in this regard. How specific vascular cell types, endothelial cells (ECs) versus perivascular cells (PVCs; a subset of brain-resident macrophages), participate in this response remains unsettled. We exploited the phagocytic activity of PVCs to deplete them in rats by central injection of a liposome-encapsulated proapoptotic drug. This manipulation abrogated CNS and hormonal indices of HPA activation under immune challenge conditions (interleukin-1) that activated prostanoid synthesis only in PVCs, while enhancing these responses to stimuli (lipopolysaccharide) that engaged prostanoid production by ECs as well. Thus, PVCs provide both prostanoid-mediated drive to the HPA axis and an anti-inflammatory action that constrains endothelial and overall CNS responses to inflammatory insults.

These include a constellation of acute phase reactions, including somnolence, fever, lethargy, anorexia, and metabolic effects (Hart, 1988Hart B.L. Biological basis of the behavior of sick animals.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1988; 12: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, Konsman et al., 2002Konsman J.P. Parnet P. Dantzer R.

Such insults can also impact the brain's intrinsic immune effector mechanisms, notably microglia, to precipitate or exacerbate a host of neurodegenerative disorders (Choi et al., 2009Choi S.H. Aid S.

Clarifying the cellular-molecular mechanisms of immune-to-brain communication thus has implications not only for understanding basic central processes involved in coping with acute illness but also for identifying targets for intervention in neurological disease. Here we focus on one key acute phase response system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, an integral part of the brain's stress response machinery (Turnbull and Rivier, 1999Turnbull A.V.

Glucocorticoid mediators of HPA function exert catabolic effects that mobilize energy reserves to facilitate coping with inflammatory insults and powerfully suppress immune-inflammatory reactions. This latter effect plays a critical regulatory role in preventing excess cytokine production and immune cell proliferation (Webster et al., 2002Webster J.I. Tonelli L. Sternberg E.M. Neuroendocrine regulation of immunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of the central arm of this feedback loop is implicated in the genesis of autoimmune disorders in susceptible animal models (Harbuz et al., 1997Harbuz M.S. Conde G.L. Marti O. Lightman S.L. Jessop D.S. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in autoimmunity.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1997; 823: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and in humans (Wick et al., 1993Wick G. Hu Y. Schwarz S. Kroemer G. Immunoendocrine communication via the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in autoimmune diseases.Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 539-563PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which immune stimuli impact the brain to engage the HPA axis remain unsettled. Multiple routes of access have been supported, whose involvement may vary with the strength and nature of the insult (Dantzer and Kelley, 2007Dantzer R. Kelley K.W.

For stimuli involving intravenous administration of individual proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1]) or pathogen analogs (bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), which model systemic infection, substantial evidence indicates that circulating cytokines can be monitored by non-neuronal cells of the cerebral vasculature, which appear capable of engaging proximate afferent projections to relevant effector neurons by releasing local signaling molecules, notably prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; Elmquist et al., 1997Elmquist J.K.

In the case of HPA control circuitry, evidence supports a role for PGE2 acting on brainstem catecholaminergic neurons that project to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-expressing hypothalamic neurosecretory cells in initiating IL-1- or LPS-stimulated drive on the axis (Ericsson et al., 1994Ericsson A.

Acute stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IL-6: a dose response study.J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1996; 19: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). Questions remain as to the manner and extent to which inducible prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms within the brain contribute to HPA responses and the identity of the vascular cell type(s) involved in transducing immune signals and mounting prostanoid responses. Endothelial cells (ECs) of the cerebral vasculature are optimally positioned to record circulating immune signals, but their threshold to inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression is high (Schiltz and Sawchenko, 2002Schiltz J.C. Sawchenko P.E. Distinct brain vascular cell types manifest inducible cyclooxygenase expression as a function of the strength and natrue of immune insults.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5606-5618PubMed Google Scholar). Perivascular cells (PVCs), a subset of brain-resident macrophages, are more sensitive to COX-2 induction (Schiltz and Sawchenko, 2002Schiltz J.C. Sawchenko P.E. Distinct brain vascular cell types manifest inducible cyclooxygenase expression as a function of the strength and natrue of immune insults.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5606-5618PubMed Google Scholar), but their position in the perivascular space between the EC basement membrane and the glia limitans (Thomas, 1999Thomas W.E. Brain macrophages: on the role of pericytes and perivascular cells.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 31: 42-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2001Williams K. Alvarez X. Lackner A.A. Central nervous system perivascular cells are immunoregulatory cells that connect the CNS with the peripheral immune system.Glia. 2001; 36: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) makes them unlikely to be accessed directly by blood-borne cytokines. To address these issues, we used a method that exploits the phagocytic capabilities of PVCs to selectively deplete them by central administration of a liposome-encapsulated drug, clodronate (Polfliet et al., 2001bPolfliet M.M.J. Goede P.H. van Kesteren-Hendrikx E.M.L. van Rooijen N. Dijkstra C.D. van den Berg T.K. A method for the selective depletion of perivascular and meningeal macrophages in the central nervous system.J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 116: 188-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results support a prominent and selective involvement of brain macrophages and their capacity to mount prostanoid responses in immune challenge-induced HPA activation. They also identify a novel, anti-inflammatory influence of this cell type in restraining endothelial involvement in CNS host-defense responses to inflammatory insults. We sought first to validate a method (Polfliet et al., 2001bPolfliet M.M.J. Goede P.H. van Kesteren-Hendrikx E.M.L. van Rooijen N. Dijkstra C.D. van den Berg T.K. A method for the selective depletion of perivascular and meningeal macrophages in the central nervous system.J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 116: 188-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that exploits the phagocytic activity of PVCs and meningeal macrophages (MMs) to selectively deplete them by i.c.v. injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Clodronate is a bisphosphonate drug used to treat osteolytic disease, which can cause irreversible metabolic damage and apoptosis at high intracellular concentrations (Van Rooijen and Sanders, 1994Van Rooijen N. Sanders A. Liposome mediated depletion of macrophages: mechanism of action, preparation of liposomes and applications.J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Liposomes were labeled with the fluorophore DiI to allow visualization of cells that have incorporated them (Polfliet et al., 2001bPolfliet M.M.J. Goede P.H. van Kesteren-Hendrikx E.M.L. van Rooijen N. Dijkstra C.D. van den Berg T.K. A method for the selective depletion of perivascular and meningeal macrophages in the central nervous system.J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 116: 188-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Injection of control liposomes encapsulating PBS (PBS-Lips) resulted in selective DiI labeling of meningeal and vascular cells that expressed the ED2 macrophage differentiation antigen, a definitive PVC/MM marker (Dijkstra et al., 1985Dijkstra C.D. Dopp E.A. Joling P. Kraal G. The heterogeneity of mononuclear phagocytes in lymphoid organs: distinct macrophage subpopulations in the rat recognized by monoclonal antibodies ED1, ED2 and ED3.Immunology. 1985; 54: 589-599PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 1). Using clodronate liposomes (Clod-Lips), ED2-positive cells were frankly reduced in rats sacrificed at 2–3 days and virtually absent in animals killed 5–7 days after injection. The effectiveness of liposome-mediated targeting of brain macrophages was evaluated after each experiment by costaining series of brain sections for ED2, challenge-induced COX-2 expression, and/or the DiI fluorophore. Rats killed 5–7 days after i.c.v. injection of PBS-Lips and i.v. injection of vehicle displayed DiI labeling strictly limited to ED2-stained cells associated with the meninges and cerebral vasculature. The efficiency of labeling was high, with >95% of all ED2-positive cells colabeled for DiI in samplings from multiple brain regions (see Experimental Procedures). COX-2 was not detected in DiI- and/or ED2-stained cells of control animals. In separate series of sections prepared for concurrent localization of DiI and Iba1, a marker that labels microglia, as well as PVCs/MMs, we failed to detect DiI labeling of parenchymal microglia in any experiment (data not shown). Rats that received i.c.v. injection of control liposomes and were challenged 7 days later with IL-1 (2 μg/kg, i.v.) displayed a similar disposition of DiI/ED2 labeling, which was overlain by induced COX-2 expression. Vascular and meningeal COX-2 immunoreactivity was strictly confined to ED2-labeled cells. In contrast, Clod-Lip-treated animals challenged with IL-1 showed in most cases a complete absence of vascular and meningeal labeling for DiI, ED2, and COX-2. In these cases, reliable COX-2 labeling was seen only in neurons (mainly in cortical regions) that express the enzyme constitutively. Ancillary analyses were carried out to assess the broader impact of central liposome treatment. Electron microscopy (conventional and of ED2-immunolabeled material) of brain tissue from control and Clod-Lip-treated rats revealed no major disruption of vascular structure in the latter, save for instances of vacant areas and/or apparent cellular debris in the perivascular spaces, presumably reflecting the loss of ED2+ PVCs (Figure 1). Basal laminae and junctions (zonulae occludens) between adjoining ECs appeared unaffected, and there was no evidence of infiltration by circulating lymphocytes. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier was assessed by injecting experimental and control animals i.v. with horseradish peroxidase. Light level analysis of histochemical preparations revealed no detectable penetration of enzyme into the brain parenchyma in either group, aside from that expected at circumventricular organs. Finally, as central injection of Clod-Lips is reported to variably and transiently attenuate peripheral macrophage populations (Polfliet et al., 2001bPolfliet M.M.J. Goede P.H. van Kesteren-Hendrikx E.M.L. van Rooijen N. Dijkstra C.D. van den Berg T.K. A method for the selective depletion of perivascular and meningeal macrophages in the central nervous system.J.

Comparisons of the density of ED2-labeled cells in comparable series through the liver of control and Clod-Lip-treated rats (n = 3) revealed no significant difference (p > 0.1). These observations support the efficacy and selectivity of i.c.v. injection of Clod-Lips in depleting brain-resident vascular and MMs. Control rats sacrificed 3 hr after IL-1 injection (2 μg/kg, i.v.) displayed the expected induction of COX-2 in the cerebral vasculature and meninges; pretreatment with i.c.v. injection of Clod-Lips 5 days earlier completely eliminated detectable IL-1-induced COX-2 expression at these loci (Figure 2). LPS injections (2 μg/kg, i.v.) in PBS-Lip rats provoked the expected COX-2 induction in both multipolar and round vascular profiles shown previously by dual staining to conform to PVCs (ED2+) and ECs (RECA-1+), respectively (Schiltz and Sawchenko, 2002Schiltz J.C. Sawchenko P.E. Distinct brain vascular cell types manifest inducible cyclooxygenase expression as a function of the strength and natrue of immune insults.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5606-5618PubMed Google Scholar). Predictably, LPS challenges of Clod-Lip pretreated rats elicited COX-2 responses only in ECs, but this effect was remarkably potentiated in that COX-2-ir ECs were far greater in number (2.4-fold increase) and staining intensity in macrophage-depleted than control rats. Because ECs far outnumber PVCs, the overall density of COX-2-labeled vascular cells in Clod-Lip rats challenged with LPS more than doubled that of PBS-Lip-pretreated controls (Figure 2). Analysis of more specific indices of PGE2 production as function of treatment status yielded generally compatible findings. Thus, vascular expression of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), a terminal enzyme in PGE2 synthesis, which is commonly coupled to COX-2 activity, was not detectable under basal conditions, but was mildly upregulated in response to IL-1 and more strongly in response to LPS in control (PBS-Lip) rats (Figure S2). Concurrent dual localization of mPGES-1 mRNA and ED2-ir indicated that enzyme expression included PVCs in both challenge paradigms, though these were sparse. Clod-Lip pretreated animals displayed massively potentiated upregulation of mPGES-1 mRNA in presumed ECs following an LPS challenge, consistent with the COX-2 findings in this cell type described above, but this was also seen in IL-1-injected rats, whose endothelia failed to mount a detectable COX-2 response. To determine whether altered expression of prostaglandin biosynthetic enzymes in Clod-Lip pretreated rats is reflected in altered release of PGE2, we attempted time course analyses in which prostanoid levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay in extracts of hypothalamus or medulla. This was not feasible in IL-1-challenged animals, as basal and stimulated PGE2 were below the detection limits of the assay. With LPS, however, Clod-Lip pretreated rats displayed a more rapid, pronounced, and prolonged LPS-induced rise in brain tissue levels of PGE2 than controls (Figure 2). To overcome the lack of sensitivity in the IL-1 model, we established a protocol for immunolocalization of PGE2 itself (see Experimental Procedures) and found a clear and discrete upregulation of PGE2-ir in identified PVCs of intact rats injected with IL-1; similarly challenged Clod-Lip pretreated animals failed to display detectable prostanoid signals in brain (Figures 2 and S3). LPS challenge in control rats also gave rise to detectable PGE2 immunostaining, which was punctate in appearance and codistributed in part with an endothelial marker. This staining was enhanced in macrophage-depleted rats and, in addition, extended into the parenchyma, with some taking the form of microglial-like cellular profiles, a localization confirmed by costaining with a microglial marker (Iba-1; data not shown). Overall, the enhanced inducible PGE2 responses to LPS in the brain macrophage-depleted model indicates that PVCs exert a potent restraining influence on EC activity in transducing circulating immune signals. The starkly differential effects of liposome treatment on multiple indices of PGE2 production after IL-1 versus LPS challenges define models for evaluating the role of vascular prostanoid synthesis in acute phase responses. Differences in IL-1- and LPS-induced vascular COX-2 induction in Clod-Lip animals were mirrored in challenge effects on HPA control circuitry, assessed using Fos immunostaining as a generic marker of cellular activation (Figure 3). Projections to the hypothalamus arising from catecholamine-containing (adrenergic and noradrenergic) neurons in the caudal brainstem (nucleus of the solitary tract and ventrolateral medulla) have been specifically implicated in mediating IL-1 and LPS effects on HPA output (Ericsson et al., 1994Ericsson A.

Acute stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IL-6: a dose response study.J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1996; 19: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we confirmed that both cell groups display markedly increased Fos expression in response to standard doses of IL-1 or LPS (2 μg/kg, i.v.). Costaining for Fos and the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes dopamine-β-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase identified the overwhelming majority of responsive neurons as displaying the adrenergic or noradrenergic phenotype (Figure S4). Whereas Clod-Lip pretreatment exerted no discernible effect on Fos expression in saline-injected controls, it resulted in markedly reduced responses to IL-1, to levels that did not differ reliably from those of controls. In contrast, brain macrophage depletion yielded significant increases in the number of NTS and VLM neurons displaying activational responses to LPS, over and above that seen after similar injection in PBS-Lip pretreated animals (p < 0.01). At the level of hypothalamic effectors that control HPA output, IL-1-induced Fos expression in control rats was focused in the CRF-rich hypophysiotropic zone of the PVH, and this response was reduced (by 80%) in Clod-Lip pretreated animals to levels that did not differ from those of vehicle-injected control animals (p > 0.1). LPS provoked a similarly focused, but more robust, activation of PVH neurons in PBS-Lip rats. Clod-Lip pretreatment resulted in a reliable increase in the number of responsive PVH neurons, attributable to recruitment of cells in the magnocellular division of the nucleus, which have also been implicated as contributing to central drive on the HPA axis (Holmes et al., 1986Holmes M.C. Antoni F.A. Aguilera G. Catt K.J. Magnocellular axons in passage through the median eminence release vasopressin.Nature. 1986; 319: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This analysis was carried out in material prepared under staining conditions that optimize sensitivity of immunolocalization, and the robustness of LPS-induced Fos in the parvocellular neurosecretory zone of the PVH might impose a ceiling effect. Staining of additional series of sections from control and Clod-Lip animals challenged with LPS using higher dilutions of Fos antiserum revealed a reliable (31%) increase in the number of labeled cells in the parvocellular PVH, supporting the contention that macrophage depletion results in enhanced drive to both major functional compartments of the nucleus. This finding was further supported by comparisons of relative levels of CRF mRNA in the PVH, which revealed a reliably greater increase in the Clod-Lip (2.2-fold) than PBS-Lip group (1.6-fold) in response to LPS (p < 0.05). Together, these findings indicate that brain macrophages are required for IL-1 engagement of HPA control circuitry, which at both medullary and hypothalamic levels responds to brain macrophage depletion in a manner indicative of a positive relationship with vascular COX-2/PGE2 production. This extends to the exaggerated HPA-regulatory responses seen in the LPS model. To determine whether altered responsiveness of HPA control circuitry as a function of brain macrophage status is mirrored by changes in hormonal output, separate groups of rats (n = 5) pretreated with control or Clod-Lips were implanted with jugular catheters and challenged 2 days later with IL-1 or LPS as above, and repeated blood samples were collected for radioimmunoassay of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone. Basal titers of neither hormone varied reliably as a function of brain macrophage status (Ps > 0.1; Figure 4). An IL-1 challenge elicited rapid and reliable increases in plasma levels of both hormones that peaked at similar time points. However, both the ACTH and corticosterone secretory responses of Clod-Lip-treated rats were of significantly lesser magnitude and duration than those of control animals. Total integrated responses, as assessed by calculating areas under the curve (AUC), were reduced to 49% (ACTH) and 37% (corticosterone) of control values (Ps < 0.001). LPS also elicited significant increases in ACTH and corticosterone secretion in both groups that peaked at similar time points, and in the case of corticosterone achieved similar maxima (Figure 4). But the magnitude of peak ACTH titers and the duration of both hormonal responses were substantially greater in Clod-Lip-treated rats, as were AUC measures (2.4- and 1.5-fold increases for ACTH and corticosterone, respectively; Ps < 0.001). Thus, the differential effects of brain macrophage depletion on IL-1- and LPS-driven engagement of HPA control circuitry are predictive of alterations in stress hormone secretion. Groups of rats (n = 9) pretreated centrally with clodronate or control liposomes were implanted with telemetry transducers to allow continuous remote monitoring of body temperature and locomotor activity. Two days later, they were challenged with IL-1 or LPS 1 hr prior to the onset of the nocturnal phase of the lighting cycle, when animals are most active. In rats pretreated with control liposomes, IL-1 elicited a biphasic core temperature response, with an initial mild hypothermia preceding a more substantial fever that peaked at ∼2 hr after injection (Figure 5). Clod-Lip treated animals failed to exhibit a significant decline in core temperature, but the peak magnitude of their febrile responses did not differ reliably from those of controls. LPS provoked in both groups an early rise and decline in core temperature, whose timing and magnitude were similar. Thereafter, controls exhibited a biphasic rise in temperature with peaks at roughly 2.75 and 6 hr after injection, whereas brain macrophage-depleted rats displayed a monophasic fever that peaked at ∼6 hr and whose magnitude was significantly greater over the 3.5–4.5 hr time interval (Ps < 0.05). In contrast, activity responses were unaffected by Clod-Lip pretreatment. Both IL-1 and LPS treatments (Figure 5) gave rise to rapid and significant (Ps < 0.01) decrements in activity beginning at 0.5–1.5 hr after injection, and their magnitude did not differ reliably as a function of brain macrophage status at any time point through 6 hr after injection (Ps > 0.10; Figure 5). Repetition of this study in separate groups challenged with IL-1 or LPS during the subjective morning hours yielded compatible results (Figure S5). Differential effects of brain macrophage ablation on indices of cerebrovascular PGE2 production induced by IL-1 (reduced) versus LPS (exaggerated) were paralleled by altered responses of the HPA axis and its CNS control circuitry. Other acute phase responses were affected less profoundly (fever) or not at all (lethargy). The results support a dependence of HPA responses to proinflammatory insults on the integrity of PVCs and their capacity to mount prostanoid responses and define a novel anti-inflammatory interaction between perivascular cells and ECs in transducing circulating cytokine signals and sculpting specific CNS responses to them. A model to summarize these findings is provided in Figure 6. In response to IL-1, the circulating cytokine activates PVCs most likely indirectly, after first being bound by endothelial type 1 IL-1 receptors (Ericsson et al., 1995Ericsson A. Liu C. Hart R.P. Sawchenko P.E. Type 1 interleukin-1 receptor in the rat brain: distribution, regulation, and relationship to sites of IL-1-induced cellular activation.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 361: 681-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). ECs are responsive to this stimulus and signaling through them is required for upstream CNS effects (Ching et al., 2007Ching S.

To investigate this issue, we genetically modified intrinsic electrical properties of adult-generated neurons in the mammalian olfactory bulb. First, we observed that suppressing levels of cell-intrinsic neuronal activity via expression of ESKir2.1 potassium channels decreases, whereas enhancing activity via expression of NaChBac sodium channels increases survival of new neurons. Neither of these modulations affects synaptic formation. Furthermore, even when neurons are induced to fire dramatically altered patterns of action potentials, increased levels of cell-intrinsic activity completely blocks cell death triggered by NMDA receptor deletion.

Overall levels of cell-intrinsic activity govern survival of new neurons Precise firing patterns are not essential for integration into mature circuits A striking feature of nervous system development is that many more neurons are produced than are ultimately retained in the mature nervous system (Buss et al., 2006Buss R.R. Sun W. Oppenheim R.W. Adaptive roles of programmed cell death during nervous system development.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Neuronal addition persists throughout life in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb (OB), where there continues to be overproduction and subsequent selection of neurons (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002Petreanu L.

Unlike during embryonic development, neurons born postnatally are added to functionally mature circuits where their integration is believed to be regulated by sensory input or the behavioral state of the animal (Kee et al., 2007Kee N.

It is postulated that the addition of new neurons into the adult brain may be a mechanism for lifelong learning and behavioral adaptation (Aimone et al., 2006Aimone J.B. Wiles J. Gage F.H.

Since only half of adult-generated neurons ultimately survive and integrate, it has been hypothesized that only new neurons that form relevant connections are incorporated to achieve fine-tuning of existing neuronal circuits (Aimone et al., 2006Aimone J.B.

Nottebohm F. Experience affects recruitment of new neurons but not adult neuron number.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar). From experiments involving sensory deprivation in the OB and ablation of the NMDA receptor in the dentate gyrus, it is clear that synaptic input is a key regulator of the integration of adult-born neurons (Alonso et al., 2006Alonso M. Viollet C. Gabellec M.M. Meas-Yedid V. Olivo-Marin J.C. Lledo P.M. Olfactory discrimination learning increases the survival of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb.J.

NMDA-receptor-mediated, cell-specific integration of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus.Nature. 2006; 442: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This idea is further supported by studies showing a preferential incorporation of adult-generated neurons into active circuits in the dentate gyrus (Kee et al., 2007Kee N. Teixeira C.M. Wang A.H. Frankland P.W. Preferential incorporation of adult-generated granule cells into spatial memory networks in the dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that olfactory deprivation perturbs synaptic development of new neurons in the adult OB and that genetically increasing the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons blocks the changes in synaptic density triggered by sensory deprivation (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an interaction between sensory input and intrinsic neuronal activity in synapse formation, and possibly neuronal survival. However, it is still unclear whether the contribution of synaptic input is mainly to provide a precise pattern of neuronal activity to the new neurons or merely a minimum level of membrane depolarization necessary for their selection and integration. The elucidation of the mechanisms regulating the integration of new neurons has important implications both for understanding how neural circuits are constructed, as well as for successful implementation of stem cell-based replacement therapies for brain repair and neurodegenerative diseases. To evaluate the effect of suppressing or elevating electrical activity on the integration of young neurons into the OB, we used retroviral vectors to introduce ion channels into neuronal progenitors in the brains of adult rodents. In the current study, we found that overall levels of activity within a new neuron determined its integration into the circuit irrespective of firing patterns. Moreover, increasing intrinsic activity was sufficient to partially overcome cell death induced by sensory deprivation and completely rescued neurons deficient in the NMDA receptor. Our observations reveal a rule of neuronal integration that is reliant on overall levels of membrane depolarization rather than on a specific pattern of firing. The vast majority of new neurons in the OB of adult mammals are granule cells (GCs), inhibitory neurons whose progenitors reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994Lois C. Alvarez-Buylla A. Long-distance neuronal migration in the adult mammalian brain.Science. 1994; 264: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). Neuroblasts generated in the SVZ move along the rostral migratory stream toward the core of the OB and subsequently migrate radially into the granule cell layers. We genetically labeled adult born GCs by injecting retroviral vectors into the SVZ of adult rats. Since retroviral vectors only infect dividing cells, the progenitor cells within the SVZ are labeled but not mature neurons. We later monitored the subsequent integration of new GCs into the OB. The first arriving neuroblasts appeared in the adult rat OB as early as at 5 dpi. By 21 dpi, migrating neuroblasts still in the RMS contributed to 7.4% of the cells in the OB. By 28 dpi, the late arriving neuroblasts contributed to less than two percent of total infected cells inside the OB. The low infectivity rate of the retroviruses in vivo results in the modification of a very small proportion of GCs (less than 0.01% of all GCs), which appear randomly distributed throughout the bulb, thus negligibly perturbing the rest of the circuit (Kelsch et al., 2007Kelsch W. Mosley C.P. Lin C.W. Lois C. Distinct mammalian precursors are committed to generate neurons with defined dendritic projection patterns.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e300https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050300Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Kelsch et al., 2008Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Lois C. Sequential development of synapses in dendritic domains during adult neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 16803-16808Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To accurately assess neuronal integration, we injected approximate 1:1 titers of mixtures of a virus encoding the channel under study (tagged by GFP) and a virus encoding mCherry, so that mCherry-expressing neurons could be used as age-matched controls. We divided the number of GFP+ and doubly infected (GFP+ and mCherry+) neurons by the number of mCherry+-only neurons to derive a survival ratio and used the raw 7 dpi ratio to normalize subsequent time points. Thus, the 7 dpi ratios are 1 and ratios at other time points are relative to the 7 dpi ratio. To dampen the excitability of adult-born GCs, we expressed a nonrectifying variant of the Kir2.1 potassium channel that contains two mutations, E224S and D172N (Yang et al., 1995Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Control of rectification and permeation by residues in two distinct domains in an inward rectifier K+ channel.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), henceforth referred to as ESKir2.1. Expression of ESKir2.1 resulted in a leak current that reduced the cell's input resistance by ∼2-fold and set a more negative resting membrane potential, thereby reducing the probability of neuronal spiking by increasing the requirement for synaptic input to achieve firing threshold (Figures 1A–1D). Expression of ESKir2.1 hyperpolarized the neuroblasts in the core of the OB as early as at 7 dpi (see Figures S1A–S1H available online) and did not affect the initial stages of development of new GCs, as ESKir2.1+ GCs successfully migrated into the OB and survived as well as control neurons up till 14 dpi (Figures 1E, S2C, and S2D). This observation argues against the possibility that expression of this ion channel results in nonspecific toxic effects in the new neurons. By 28 dpi, however, the number of ESKir2.1+ neurons integrated into the OB was reduced by 57% ± 8% (∗∗∗p < 0.002; n = 4 bulbs; Figures 1E and S2E). Interestingly, this timing coincides with a critical period for integration of newly generated GCs in the postnatal OB, between 14 and 28 dpi, during which their survival is most sensitive to olfactory deprivation (Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005Yamaguchi M. Mori K. Critical period for sensory experience-dependent survival of newly generated granule cells in the adult mouse olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate an important role of neuronal activity in regulating the integration of adult-generated neurons in a cell-autonomous manner. Interestingly, spine density and the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) were indistinguishable between control and ESKir2.1+ neurons, suggesting that suppression of cell-intrinsic neuronal activity has minimal effects on synaptic development (Figures S1I–S1L). However, the amplitude of sEPSC was higher for ESKir2.1+ than controls neurons at 28 dpi (Figure S1J). This increase in sEPSC amplitude may reflect the synaptic scaling previously described in activity-deprived neurons (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Recent studies propose that adult neurogenesis serves to facilitate experience-dependent modification of neural circuits for adaptation to environmental changes (Aimone et al., 2006Aimone J.B. Wiles J. Gage F.H. Potential role for adult neurogenesis in the encoding of time in new memories.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, Wilbrecht et al., 2002Wilbrecht L. Crionas A. Nottebohm F. Experience affects recruitment of new neurons but not adult neuron number.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis suggests that the timing of synaptic inputs relative to activity in the rest of the circuit, and their source and strength would all be predicted to participate in regulating the integration of new neurons. Alternatively, integration of new neurons may simply be determined by summing overall levels of activity in a neuron during a specific critical period, regardless of its source or timing, and neurons that meet a minimum threshold are retained. To investigate these possibilities, we increased neuronal activity in individual new GCs in the OB in a manner that reduces their dependency on synaptic input for firing and evaluated the consequences of this manipulation on neuronal integration into the OB. To disrupt normal firing patterns and increase the occurrence of neuronal firing, such that neuronal spiking would occur with synaptic inputs that are insufficient to evoke action potentials in control neurons, we used the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac. Two key properties of NaChBac allow for this: first, its activation threshold is approximately 15 mV more negative than that of native sodium channels in granule neurons (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); second, it inactivates on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, compared to less than 1 ms in mammalian sodium channels (Bean, 2007Bean B.P. The action potential in mammalian central neurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, Ren et al., 2001Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. A prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel.Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that NaChBac expression in GCs triggers depolarizations approximately 600 ms long (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Such long depolarizations are not uncommon in neurons in the mammalian brain. For instance, cholinergic stimulation has been shown to trigger long depolarizations in several neuronal types (Fraser and MacVicar, 1996Fraser D.D. MacVicar B.A. Cholinergic-dependent plateau potential in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4113-4128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether this phenomenon also occurs in newly generated GCs. Application of carbachol, a muscarinic agonist mimicking cholinergic input, induced long after-depolarization-potentials (ADPs) in adult-born GCs (Figure 2A). These long depolarizations robustly occurred in adult-born GCs during the early (18 dpi) but not late (28 dpi) phases of their integration into the OB (Figures 2A and 2B). The ADP triggered by carbachol was completely blocked by preapplying atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist (Figures 2A and S2F–S2H). These findings suggest that physiological stimuli, such as cholinergic innervation, can trigger long membrane depolarizations in adult-born GCs, similar to those induced by NaChBac expression. We delivered NaChBac to GC precursors in the SVZ using the strategy described for ESKir2.1. To assess the ability of NaChBac to enhance the intrinsic excitability of new GCs, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings between 14 to 16 dpi, at the beginning of their critical period for survival. At this stage, newly generated GCs expressing NaChBac-EGFP (NaChBac+) have a slow inward current that activates at −41 ± 1.8 mV, which causes neurons to fire spontaneous action potentials significantly more frequently than control neurons and with long plateau potentials lasting on average 608 ± 68 ms (Figures 2D–2F). In addition, we have observed that the electrophysiological effects of NaChBac expression on GCs persist throughout the duration of the critical period (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, NaChBac expression is sufficient to increase overall levels of neuronal activity in newly generated GCs. We assessed the effect of increasing electrical excitability via NaChBac expression on the integration of adult-born GCs into the OB, and found that up till 14 dpi, NaChBac+ neurons migrated and integrated into the OB at similar levels to control neurons (Figures 2G, S2A, and S2B). However, beginning at 21 dpi, NaChBac+ neurons integrated into the OB at significantly higher rates than control neurons (21 dpi: 22% ± 6%; ∗∗p < 0.002; n = 4 bulbs; 28 dpi: 31% ± 4%; ∗∗∗p < 0.0001; n = 10 bulbs; Figure 2G). This increase in survival persisted for as long as 2 months after infection (56 dpi; 25% ± 3%; ∗∗p < 0.0001; n = 6 bulbs). Electrophysiological measurements of sEPSCs in NaChBac+ neurons indicate that they received similar levels of excitatory synaptic input as compared to control neurons, demonstrating that the enhanced survival of NaChBac+ neurons was accompanied by functional integration into the circuit (Figures 3A and 3B). Furthermore, NaChBac+ neurons were morphologically similar to control neurons, with no changes in the pattern of dendritic arborization or in the linear density of synaptic spines (Figures 3C–3G). This observation is consistent with our previous finding that NaChBac does not affect the density of clusters labeled with the synaptic marker PSD95-GFP in OB GCs (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These observations illustrate that NaChBac+ neurons are functional and suggest that strong perturbations of cell-intrinsic neuronal activity via either NaChBac or ESKir2.1 expression have minimal effects on the synaptic development of these neurons. Our findings suggest that increasing the overall intrinsic level of activity in an adult-born neuron is sufficient to confer a significant survival advantage to that cell but do not allow us to specify whether adult-generated neurons normally have a requirement for patterns of synaptic input specifically driven by sensory experience in order to integrate into the bulb. Multiple studies have demonstrated that sensory input is crucial for the integration of new neurons into the OB (Alonso et al., 2006Alonso M. Viollet C. Gabellec M.M. Meas-Yedid V. Olivo-Marin J.C. Lledo P.M. Olfactory discrimination learning increases the survival of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10508-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002Petreanu L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Maturation and death of adult-born olfactory bulb granule neurons: role of olfaction.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6106-6113PubMed Google Scholar), but it remains unclear whether sensory input simply provides a minimum, necessary level of synaptic drive onto new GCs to support survival or if sensory-driven patterns of synaptic input contain information relevant to the selection of the new GC for integration. To further explore these questions, we tested whether a NaChBac-mediated increase in neuronal activity can substitute for physiological sensory experience in mediating the integration of adult-born neurons into the OB. We coinjected a mixture of retroviruses bilaterally into the SVZ of animals in which we had unilaterally occluded one nostril, a procedure that eliminates sensory input to the ipsilateral bulb. Previous works have demonstrated that 50% of new neurons in the adult ultimately integrate into the normal OBs, whereas nostril occlusion further reduces this proportion to 25% (Winner et al., 2002Winner B. Cooper-Kuhn C.M. Aigner R. Winkler J. Kuhn H.G. Long-term survival and cell death of newly generated neurons in the adult rat olfactory bulb.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005Yamaguchi M. Mori K. Critical period for sensory experience-dependent survival of newly generated granule cells in the adult mouse olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The survival ratio of NaChBac+ neurons compared to control cells in the nonoccluded bulb was approximately 1.33, similar to that described above (Figures 2G and 2H); in contrast, in the occluded bulb this ratio was increased to approximately 1.76 (Figure 2H). Since olfactory deprivation results in approximately 50% decrease in the survival of new GCs, a complete rescue of sensory-dependent GC death by NaChBac in an occluded bulb would result in a survival ratio of 2; thus, a ratio of 1.76 indicates that NaChBac expression provides more than a 75% rescue of GC death resulting from sensory deprivation. This result demonstrates that increased neuronal excitability conferred by NaChBac expression is sufficient to partially substitute for the contribution of sensory-dependent synaptic input in regulating GC integration. This observation parallels our previous data showing that NaChBac expression blocks changes in synaptic density induced by sensory deprivation (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this observation suggests that experience-driven synaptic input is not the only mechanism driving the selection of adult-born neurons for integration as corroborated by the finding that 25% of new neurons still survive in sensory deprived bulbs (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002Petreanu L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Maturation and death of adult-born olfactory bulb granule neurons: role of olfaction.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6106-6113PubMed Google Scholar, Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005Yamaguchi M. Mori K. Critical period for sensory experience-dependent survival of newly generated granule cells in the adult mouse olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because NaChBac promotes neuronal integration independent of experience-driven synaptic input, it is probable that the mechanism regulating activity-dependent survival is directly tracking the levels of membrane depolarization. The membrane potential of a neuron is constantly modulated by neurotransmitters acting on synaptic receptors, and in the central nervous system, AMPA- and NMDA-receptors (NMDARs) are the major receptors mediating membrane depolarization. Previous studies have suggested that NMDAR activity regulates the survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus (Tashiro et al., 2006aTashiro A. Sandler V.M. Toni N. Zhao C. Gage F.H. NMDA-receptor-mediated, cell-specific integration of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus.Nature. 2006; 442: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The requirement of NMDAR signaling for neuronal survival may depend on the detection of coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity, such as in spike-timing dependent plasticity (Dan and Poo, 2006Dan Y. Poo M.M. Spike timing-dependent plasticity: from synapse to perception.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), or alternatively, the requirement of NMDAR function for new neuron survival may simply reflect the contribution of NMDAR activity to overall levels of neuronal depolarization in new GCs. To investigate the contribution of NMDAR to new neuron integration, we first sought to confirm the requirement for NMDAR function in the survival of new GCs in the OB. We genetically ablated the essential NR1 subunit to eliminate all NMDAR-mediated input in individual new GCs by sparsely infecting progenitor cells in the SVZ of NR1 floxed conditional mice (NR1fl/fl) with retroviral vectors encoding the Cre recombinase enzyme (Kohara et al., 2007Kohara K. Yasuda H. Huang Y. Adachi N. Sohya K. Tsumoto T. A local reduction in cortical GABAergic synapses after a loss of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as revealed by single-cell gene knock-out method.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Tashiro et al., 2006bTashiro A. Zhao C. Gage F.H. Retrovirus-mediated single-cell gene knockout technique in adult newborn neurons in vivo.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated ablation of NR1 successfully eliminated NMDAR expression since application of NMDA failed to induce any currents in Cre+ neurons in NR1fl/fl mice (Figures 4A–4C). By 28 dpi, virtually all NMDAR-deficient neurons were eliminated (Figures 4D and 4E). In comparison, no change in the survival of EGFP-Cre+ neurons was observed in NR1+/+ littermates (Figure 4D). This result demonstrates that the NMDAR, whose ablation decreases the survival of new dentate gyrus neurons by only 50% (Tashiro et al., 2006aTashiro A. Sandler V.M. Toni N. Zhao C. Gage F.H. NMDA-receptor-mediated, cell-specific integration of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus.Nature. 2006; 442: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), is absolutely required for the integration of adult-born GCs in the OB. We next determined whether increasing activity in new GCs via NaChBac expression could substitute for NMDAR function in supporting neuronal integration into the OB. NaChBac and Cre recombinase were simultaneously delivered into NR1fl/fl mice, and GC integration was assessed. We found that increasing the excitability of newly generated NMDAR-deficient GCs via NaChBac expression completely rescued their death (Figures 4D and 4E). The dendritic morphology of NaChBac+ NMDAR-deficient neurons appeared similar to that of control neurons and received AMPAR-mediated synaptic input (Figure S3), indicating that they functionally integrated into the bulb's circuit. These results demonstrate that the requirement for NMDARs in the integration of new GCs most likely reflects the contribution of NMDARs to the overall levels of neuronal activity in the neuron. Furthermore, our data support a model in which activity-dependent integration depends on overall levels of membrane depolarization, irrespective of how this depolarization is achieved. To elucidate whether synaptic input regulates survival by providing new neurons with a precise pattern of neuronal activity, or merely a minimal level of membrane depolarization, we used NaChBac, a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel, to perturb the spiking pattern of new neurons while simultaneously elevating their activity levels. Our results indicate that the integration of new neurons into the OB circuit predominantly depends on their overall levels of membrane depolarization, regardless of the pattern of action potentials generated. Interestingly, tonic cholinergic stimulation, which causes sustained depolarizations in adult-born OB neurons during their early integration (Figures 2A–2C and S2), has recently been shown to enhance the survival of new neurons both in the OB and dentate gyrus (Kaneko et al., 2006Kaneko N. Okano H. Sawamoto K. Role of the cholinergic system in regulating survival of newborn neurons in the adult mouse dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb.Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conversely, the removal of cholinergic input into the OB compromises the survival of new neurons (Cooper-Kuhn et al., 2004Cooper-Kuhn C.M. Winkler J. Kuhn H.G. Decreased neurogenesis after cholinergic forebrain lesion in the adult rat.J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Given our findings about depolarization-enhanced integration, the long depolarizations induced by cholinergic stimulation may directly contribute to the improved survival of new neurons observed in previous studies (Kaneko et al., 2006Kaneko N. Okano H. Sawamoto K. Role of the cholinergic system in regulating survival of newborn neurons in the adult mouse dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb.Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the long depolarizations induced by cholinergic stimulation occur robustly in young GCs during the critical period of survival at 18 dpi but not after maturation at 28 dpi, indicating a possible role of prolonged cholinergic-induced depolarization specifically in driving survival of new OB granule neurons. General behavioral states, such as running, stress, attentiveness, and depression affect neuronal integration of new neurons into adult brains (Gould et al., 1997Gould E. McEwen B.S. Tanapat P. Galea L.A. Fuchs E. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult tree shrew is regulated by psychosocial stress and NMDA receptor activation.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2492-2498PubMed Google Scholar, Malberg et al., 2000Malberg J.E. Eisch A.J. Nestler E.J. Duman R.S. Chronic antidepressant treatment increases neurogenesis in adult rat hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9104-9110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Mouret et al., 2008Mouret A. Gheusi G. Gabellec M.M. de Chaumont F. Olivo-Marin J.C. Lledo P.M. Learning and survival of newly generated neurons: when time matters.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11511-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, van Praag et al., 1999van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (3069) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that neuromodulators such as acetylcholine may mediate these effects by acting as significant regulators of the level of depolarization of new neurons. The notion that general membrane depolarization is a determinant of neuronal integration is further supported by our observation that although NMDAR expression is essential for new neuron integration, NaChBac-mediated depolarization is sufficient to fully rescue NMDAR-deficient neurons from death. Hence, the requirement of NMDAR in new neuron survival may be due to the extended depolarization caused by its slow gating kinetics. Interestingly, recent evidence also indicates that the contribution of NMDAR for synaptic vesicle release in GCs is not directly through the calcium entry through its pore but indirectly through the influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels, which open as a result of the long depolarization induced by NMDAR activity (Isaacson, 2001Isaacson J.S. Mechanisms governing dendritic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release in the rat olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 337-342PubMed Google Scholar, Schoppa et al., 1998Schoppa N.E. Kinzie J.M. Sahara Y. Segerson T.P. Westbrook G.L. Dendrodendritic inhibition in the olfactory bulb is driven by NMDA receptors.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6790-6802PubMed Google Scholar). Together, our data support a model in which activity-dependent integration depends on overall levels of membrane depolarization, determined, for instance, by monitoring calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (Dolmetsch et al., 2001Dolmetsch R.E. Pajvani U. Fife K. Spotts J.M. Greenberg M.E. Signaling to the nucleus by an L-type calcium channel-calmodulin complex through the MAP kinase pathway.Science. 2001; 294: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), rather than specifically on neuronal activity mediated by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. It is not yet known how activity levels could be monitored in order to determine if a particular cell achieves the minimum threshold of neuronal activity required to survive and successfully integrate into the adult brain. New adult-born neurons could act as integrators that measure and summate levels of activity over a critical period, lasting perhaps on the time scale of days, to compute this life or death decision (McCormick, 2001McCormick D.A. Brain calculus: neural integration and persistent activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This critical period spans a time period sometime between 14 to 28 days after the birth of the neuron, when sensory deprivation or ESKir2.1-mediated suppression of activity has the strongest effect on survival (Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005Yamaguchi M. Mori K. Critical period for sensory experience-dependent survival of newly generated granule cells in the adult mouse olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Alternatively, instantaneous levels of activity may be continuously evaluated such that neurons that never meet the minimum threshold of activity during the critical period are eliminated. When we introduced ESKir2.1 into GCs in the OB, we observed that although the electrical properties of these neurons were altered significantly, their dendritic structures remained unchanged. This is unexpected because overexpression of Kir2.1 in neurons has been previously shown to alter the morphology of axons, in transfected retinal neurons in zebrafish (Hua and Smith, 2004Hua J.Y. Smith S.J. Neural activity and the dynamics of central nervous system development.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), as well as dendrites, in transfected rat hippocampal neurons in vitro (Burrone et al., 2002Burrone J. O'Byrne M. Murthy V.N. Multiple forms of synaptic plasticity triggered by selective suppression of activity in individual neurons.Nature. 2002; 420: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Two non-mutually-exclusive explanations could account for our findings. First, in previous experiments, Kir2.1 channels were expressed in excitatory neurons (Burrone et al., 2002Burrone J. O'Byrne M. Murthy V.N. Multiple forms of synaptic plasticity triggered by selective suppression of activity in individual neurons.Nature. 2002; 420: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Hua and Smith, 2004Hua J.Y. Smith S.J. Neural activity and the dynamics of central nervous system development.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), whereas here we specifically target inhibitory interneurons. The plasticity responses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons differ in many respects (Bi and Poo, 1998Bi G.Q. Poo M.M. Synaptic modifications in cultured hippocampal neurons: dependence on spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10464-10472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is plausible that electrical silencing by Kir2.1 channels affects the morphology of excitatory, but not inhibitory neurons. Next, gene delivery methods used in previous work induce much higher levels of Kir2.1 expression than what we report here with oncoretroviral delivery. For instance, calcium-phosphate transfection of Kir2.1 into cultured hippocampal neurons lowers the neurons' input resistance from 166 ± 11 to 63 ± 25 MΩ, which corresponds to a 10,000 pS increase of Kir2.1 conductance (Burrone et al., 2002Burrone J. O'Byrne M. Murthy V.N. Multiple forms of synaptic plasticity triggered by selective suppression of activity in individual neurons.Nature. 2002; 420: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, our oncoretroviral vector delivery of ESKir2.1 results in expression levels that only introduces 600 pS of resting leak conductance and lowers the input resistance of GCs from 1147 ± 59 to 655 ± 76 MΩ, even though neuronal firing is largely eliminated. Thus, it is possible that the changes in neuronal morphology previously reported were not solely due to reduction of neuronal excitability by Kir2.1 activity, but to additional effects resulting from very high levels of expression. Reduction of sensory input by olfactory deprivation has been shown to modify synaptic structure of GCs (Saghatelyan et al., 2005Saghatelyan A. Roux P. Migliore M. Rochefort C. Desmaisons D. Charneau P. Shepherd G.M. Lledo P.M. Activity-dependent adjustments of the inhibitory network in the olfactory bulb following early postnatal deprivation.Neuron. 2005; 46: 103-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have recently confirmed this observation using genetic labeling of postsynaptic glutamatergic densities with the PSD95-GFP marker (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that whereas NaChBac did not affect the density of PSD95-GFP synapses in normal conditions, it blocked the synaptic changes triggered by olfactory deprivation (Kelsch et al., 2009Kelsch W. Lin C.W. Mosley C.P. Lois C. A critical period for activity-dependent synaptic development during olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11852-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an interaction between sensory input and intrinsic membrane excitability to achieve a minimal level of neuronal activity necessary for the normal development of synapses in GCs. Our current results indicate that this principle also extends to neuronal survival, since there seems to be a minimum threshold of neuronal activity required for the integration of young GCs into the OB. This threshold level of activity can similarly be provided by a combination of synaptic input and intrinsic membrane excitability. Our experiments indicate that the elevation of intrinsic excitability via NaChBac expression is sufficient to counteract the reduction of sensory input. Reaching this minimal level of activity both rescues young GCs from death and allows them to acquire normal synaptic organization in an odor-deprived OB. What drives overall activity levels, and hence survival of new adult-born neurons during the critical period? One feature of the critical period is that it coincides with the onset of synapse formation in GCs, and this has led previous studies to primarily focus on the role of phasic synaptic input, as regulated by sensory experience, in new neuron survival. In addition, during this critical period the intrinsic conductance (e.g., A-type potassium channels, voltage-gated sodium channels) of new neurons undergo major changes as the neurons mature. Our findings show that in addition to synaptic input, membrane conductance, as determined by the repertoire of ion channels expressed by new neurons, may play a pivotal role in regulating integration and survival. Variability in membrane conductance between neurons of the same type has been shown to be significant (Marder and Goaillard, 2006Marder E. Goaillard J.M. Variability, compensation and homeostasis in neuron and network function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), and fluctuations in the intrinsic excitability of young neurons could result in differing levels of synaptic input required for their survival. In addition, the intrinsic excitability of OB neurons is strongly modulated by centrifugal innervation originating from other parts of the brain. In particular, cholinergic stimulation induces long-lasting depolarizations in GCs, which facilitate persisting firing modes (Figure S2 and Pressler et al., 2007Pressler R.T. Inoue T. Strowbridge B.W. Muscarinic receptor activation modulates granule cell excitability and potentiates inhibition onto mitral cells in the rat olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10969-10981Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These phenomena could account for the observation that cells rendered hyperexcitable by NaChBac expression are able to survive with reduced levels of synaptic input resulting from olfactory deprivation or NMDAR ablation. In this manner, the overall level of activity, as determined by the combination of synaptic inputs received and intrinsic membrane properties, drives integration of new neurons into a circuit.

Synaptic activity then directs whether synapses will be stabilized, eliminated, or strengthened. Early events in synapse development include clustering of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to the presynaptic active zone, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to the postsynaptic density (PSD), whereas later events include clustering of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors that might function to stabilize nascent synapses and mediate synaptic plasticity.

Known molecules that promote AMPA receptor clustering include NARP (O'Brien et al., 1998O'Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

Intracellular and trans-synaptic regulation of glutamatergic synaptogenesis by EphB receptors.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12152-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and SALM2 (Ko et al., 2006Ko J. Kim S. Chung H.S. Kim K. Han K. Kim H. Jun H. Kaang B.K. Kim E. SALM synaptic cell adhesion-like molecules regulate the differentiation of excitatory synapses.Neuron. 2006; 50: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); however, the significance of these molecules in the targeting of AMPA receptors at developing synapses is not completely understood. For example, SALM2 overexpression did not change AMPA receptor or NMDA receptor synapse density, even though direct aggregation of SALM2 can induce clustering of AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor subunits (Ko et al., 2006Ko J. Kim S. Chung H.S. Kim K. Han K. Kim H. Jun H. Kaang B.K. Kim E. SALM synaptic cell adhesion-like molecules regulate the differentiation of excitatory synapses.Neuron. 2006; 50: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NARP's clustering activity is restricted to glutamatergic synapses forming on inhibitory interneurons (Mi et al., 2002Mi R. Tang X. Sutter R. Xu D. Worley P. O'Brien R.J. Differing mechanisms for glutamate receptor aggregation on dendritic spines and shafts in cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7606-7616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These facts suggest that other molecules must exist to direct AMPA receptor recruitment to the majority of synapses during development. A current topic of intense investigation is the identification of auxiliary subunits for AMPA receptors that influence excitatory synapse function. The transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) control AMPA receptor trafficking and channel gating properties (reviewed in Nicoll et al., 2006Nicoll R.A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Auxiliary subunits assist AMPA-type glutamate receptors.Science. 2006; 311: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). TARPs function to facilitate AMPA receptor trafficking by a two-step process. First, TARPs mediate translocation from intracellular sites to the cell surface via direct interaction with AMPA receptor subunits. Second, TARPs subsequently deliver AMPA receptors to synapses via interaction with synaptic scaffolds such as PSD95 (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Stargazin regulates synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors by two distinct mechanisms.Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study identified the cornichon family of small transmembrane proteins as auxiliary subunits for AMPA receptors with activities similar to those of TARPs (Schwenk et al., 2009Schwenk J. Harmel N. Zolles G. Bildl W. Kulik A. Heimrich B. Chisaka O. Jonas P. Schulte U. Fakler B. Klöcker N. Functional proteomics identify cornichon proteins as auxiliary subunits of AMPA receptors.Science. 2009; 323: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar); however, the precise role played by cornichons in AMPA-receptor-mediated synaptic transmission has yet to be reported. To identify genes implicated in synapse development, a DNA microarray approach was applied to expression profile the cerebellum in wild-type and mutant mouse lines with defects in neuronal differentiation (Díaz et al., 2002Díaz E. Ge Y. Yang Y.H. Loh K.C. Serafini T.A. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Speed T.P. Ngai J. Scheiffele P. Molecular analysis of gene expression in the developing pontocerebellar projection system.Neuron. 2002; 36: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One of the most highly differentially expressed genes (referred to here as Synapse Differentiation Induced Gene 1 [SynDIG1]) encodes a predicted transmembrane protein. In wild-type cerebellum, SynDIG1 mRNA is upregulated during postnatal development; in contrast, SynDIG1 upregulation is defective in Lurcher (Lc) cerebellum (Díaz et al., 2002Díaz E. Ge Y. Yang Y.H. Loh K.C. Serafini T.A. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Speed T.P. Ngai J. Scheiffele P. Molecular analysis of gene expression in the developing pontocerebellar projection system.Neuron. 2002; 36: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In Lc mice, there is massive Purkinje cell death beginning at postnatal day 12 (P12) due to a point mutation in the δ2 glutamate receptor (Zuo et al., 1997Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Neurodegeneration in Lurcher mice caused by mutation in delta2 glutamate receptor gene.Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), which is selectively expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Araki et al., 1993Araki K. Meguro H. Kushiya E. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Mishina M. Selective expression of the glutamate receptor channel delta 2 subunit in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, at P10, prior to Purkinje cell death in Lc cerebellum, the rate of parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron synaptogenesis is decreased and synaptic ultrastructure is defective (Dumesnil-Bousez and Sotelo, 1992Dumesnil-Bousez N. Sotelo C. Early development of the Lurcher cerebellum: Purkinje cell alterations and impairment of synaptogenesis.J. Neurocytol. 1992; 21: 506-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that impaired synaptic maturation is provoked by the Lc mutation. SynDIG1 expression is reduced in Lc cerebellum prior to Purkinje cell death as determined by the difference in SynDIG1's expression profile from that of Purkinje cell markers L7 or parvalbumin (Díaz et al., 2002Díaz E. Ge Y. Yang Y.H. Loh K.C. Serafini T.A. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Speed T.P. Ngai J. Scheiffele P. Molecular analysis of gene expression in the developing pontocerebellar projection system.Neuron. 2002; 36: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that SynDIG1 protein plays a role in synaptic differentiation of Purkinje neurons and potentially other neurons in which it is expressed. Here we report evidence supporting a critical role for SynDIG1 in excitatory synapse development in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons. Specifically, SynDIG1 regulates AMPA receptor content at nascent synapses. SynDIG1 colocalizes with AMPA receptors at synapses and extrasynaptic sites and interacts with AMPA receptors in heterologous cells and brain extracts. Altered levels of SynDIG1 in cultured neurons result in significant changes in number and size of AMPA-receptor-containing synapses. Intriguingly, SynDIG1 content at synapses is regulated by neuronal activity, suggesting a role for SynDIG1 in activity-dependent synapse development and possibly synaptic plasticity. Thus, SynDIG1 represents an activity-regulated, AMPA-receptor-interacting transmembrane protein that regulates development of excitatory synapses. The SynDIG1 cDNA sequence (originally identified as “Riken ZX00026N07” in Díaz et al., 2002Díaz E. Ge Y. Yang Y.H. Loh K.C. Serafini T.A. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Speed T.P. Ngai J. Scheiffele P. Molecular analysis of gene expression in the developing pontocerebellar projection system.Neuron. 2002; 36: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is predicted to encode a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 28.5 kDa. The protein is not predicted to have any known domains besides two hydrophobic segments long enough to span the membrane (Figure 1A). SynDIG1 protein is highly conserved among vertebrates (Figure 1B). Sequence similarity to SynDIG1 was observed in three gene products in the mouse genome with the highest degree of identity within the second half of the protein, including the two hydrophobic segments (Figure S1, available online). The only related protein in mouse that has been characterized is referred to as “Capucin” to reflect its predominant expression in caudate and putamen of the dorsolateral striatum (de Chaldée et al., 2006de Chaldée M. Brochier C. Van de Vel A. Caudy N. Luthi-Carter R. Gaillard M.C. Elalouf J.M. Capucin: a novel striatal marker down-regulated in rodent models of Huntington disease.Genomics. 2006; 87: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When expressed in HEK293 cells, SynDIG1 is associated with the membrane fraction (Figure 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). To test if SynDIG1 is an integral membrane protein, its extractability from membranes with high pH, high salt concentration, or detergent containing buffers was determined. SynDIG1 protein is extracted from membranes only with detergent containing buffer (Figure 1C, compare lane 6 with lanes 7 and 8), confirming that SynDIG1 is an integral membrane protein. The absence of a signal sequence predicts that the N terminus of SynDIG1 is intracellular. To test this possibility, COS cells were transfected with SynDIG1 constructs with an HA tag at the N terminus (HA-SynDIG1) or the C terminus (SynDIG1-HA) and live-labeled with anti-HA antibodies. As expected, anti-HA antibodies did not detect HA-SynDIG1 exposure to the extracellular environment (Figure S2A). In contrast, anti-HA antibodies detected SynDIG1-HA exposure to the extracellular environment (Figure S2A), suggesting that the C-terminal region of SynDIG1 is present at the outer surface of the plasma membrane. This result suggests that one hydrophobic segment spans the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane while the other segment does not. To determine more precisely the topology of SynDIG1 protein, an additional construct was generated with three sequential HA tags (to promote antigen recognition) between the two hydrophobic segments (SynDIG1-loop-HA). Live-labeling with anti-HA antibodies revealed exposure of SynDIG1-loop-HA to the extracellular environment (Figure S2A). All constructs were expressed efficiently in COS cells (Figure S2B). The topology of SynDIG1 protein is consistent with a type II transmembrane protein whereby the first hydrophobic segment spans the plasma membrane while the second hydrophobic segment is embedded in the outer region of the plasma membrane (Figure S2C). Interestingly, HA-SynDIG1 forms dimers resistant to SDS-PAGE, and formation of dimers requires SynDIG1's C-terminal extracellular hydrophobic segment (Figure S2D). Thus, an alternative possibility is that the second hydrophobic segment might be shielded from the hydrophilic environment upon SynDIG1 dimerization. Capucin localizes to the Golgi compartment in heterologous cells (de Chaldée et al., 2006de Chaldée M. Brochier C. Van de Vel A. Caudy N. Luthi-Carter R. Gaillard M.C. Elalouf J.M. Capucin: a novel striatal marker down-regulated in rodent models of Huntington disease.Genomics. 2006; 87: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine if SynDIG1 also localizes to Golgi structures, the distribution of HA-SynDIG1 was analyzed in COS cells with immunocytochemistry. In addition to the cell surface (Figure S2A), SynDIG1 is also present in intracellular structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure S2E). These structures did not overlap extensively with the Golgi marker protein GM130 (Figure S2E), suggesting that in contrast to Capucin, SynDIG1 is not localized to Golgi complexes beyond its normal trafficking through the secretory pathway expected of an integral membrane protein. Furthermore, treatment of cells with Brefeldin A (BFA) to reversibly disrupt Golgi complexes (Ulmer and Palade, 1991Ulmer J.B. Palade G.E. Effects of Brefeldin A on the Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum and viral envelope glycoproteins in murine erythroleukemia cells.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 38-54PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed that SynDIG1 is not a Golgi resident protein (Figure S2E). Rather, the intracellular structures to which SynDIG1 localizes are early endosomes, as determined by immunocychemistry with antibodies against the early endosomal autoantigen EEA1 (Figure S2F), suggesting that SynDIG1 shuttles between the cell surface and early endosomes in heterologous cells. Analysis of the UniGene EST Profile Viewer database suggested that SynDIG1 mRNA is largely restricted to neural tissues. To examine the distribution of SynDIG1 mRNA in finer detail, in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes was performed with mouse brain sections. As expected, SynDIG1 mRNA is expressed in Purkinje neurons in cerebellum (Figure 2A). SynDIG1 is also detected in the hippocampus (Figure 2A). To characterize SynDIG1 distribution in neurons, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) was raised against the N-terminal region of the molecule. To demonstrate specificity of the mAb, immunoblot analysis of extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with HA-SynDIG1 was performed and compared with those of vector-transfected cells (Figure 2B). Both anti-SynDIG1 mAb and anti-HA antibodies recognized a single immunoreactive band at ∼32 kDa (Figure 2B), consistent with the calculated molecular mass of HA-SynDIG1. A single anti-SynDIG1 immunoreactive band of slightly lower molecular mass was also recognized in mouse brain extracts and dissociated rat hippocampal neurons (Figure 2B). COS cells transfected with HA-SynDIG1 revealed identical immunostaining patterns for anti-HA antibodies and anti-SynDIG1 mAb (Figure S3A). To begin to identify the epitope recognized by anti-SynDIG1 mAb, two HA-SynDIG1 deletion constructs were generated. Deletion of 33 amino acids of the C terminus, including the second hydrophobic domain (HA-SynDIG1ΔC33), had no effect on anti-SynDIG1 mAb recognition, while deletion of 75 amino acids of the N terminus (HA-SynDIG1ΔN75) resulted in complete loss of anti-SynDIG1 mAb immunoreactivity (Figure S3B). Importantly, anti-HA immunoreactivity was similar for all constructs (Figure S3B), demonstrating the presence of HA-tagged protein. SynDIG1 protein expression peaks during the second week of postnatal development (Figure S3C), the major period of synaptogenesis in rodents. Furthermore, SynDIG1 expression is restricted to brain (Figure S3D), consistent with the distribution of SynDIG1 mRNA in UniGene database. Taking advantage of SynDIG1's expression in hippocampus (Figure 2A), expression in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons was examined with anti-SynDIG1 mAb and anti-MAP2 antibodies. In young cultures (2 DIV), SynDIG1 immunoreactivity was detected in the cell body and in neurites in a diffuse and punctate staining pattern (Figure S4A, top panels). At 8 DIV (Figure S4A, middle panels), SynDIG1 immunoreactivity continued to be apparent in the cell body and in dendrites, as demonstrated by coimmunostaining with anti-MAP2 antibodies. In mature dendrites there seemed to be two types of immunoreactivity that developed over time (Figure S4A, bottom panels): (1) diffuse and punctate staining along the shafts of dendrites, especially apparent in thick primary dendrites; and (2) staining in protrusions along the dendrites. SynDIG1 clusters are enriched at excitatory synapses as defined by overlap with postsynaptic (SAP102) and presynaptic (vGlut1) markers compared with inhibitory synapses (Figure 2C). At 7 DIV, 48% of synapses (defined as overlap of vGlut1 and SAP102 clusters) contain SynDIG1 (Figure 2D). At 10 and 15 DIV, 64% and 56% of synapses, respectively, contain SynDIG1 (Figure 2D). The amount of SynDIG1 at synapses represents 31%, 47%, and 52% of total SynDIG1 puncta at 7, 10, and 15 DIV, respectively (Figure 2E), suggesting that as development proceeds, an increasing percentage of SynDIG1 becomes localized to excitatory synapses. To determine if SynDIG1 is present at the cell surface of excitatory synapses, neurons were transfected with SynDIG1-HA, live-labeled with anti-HA antibodies to stain surface HA epitopes, and fixed and stained with anti-PSD95 and anti-vGlut1 antibodies to label presynaptic specializations. A subset of SynDIG1 clusters overlap with colocalized presynaptic and postsynaptic clusters (Figure S4B), suggesting that SynDIG1 is present at the cell surface of excitatory synapses. Furthermore, a portion of SynDIG1 protein was enriched in PSD fractions from mouse brain (Figure S4C). Thus, SynDIG1 protein is localized to the postsynaptic cell in excitatory synapses both in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons and in mouse brain. Next, the distribution of SynDIG1 and the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 (Collingridge et al., 2009Collingridge G.L. Olsen R.W. Peters J. Spedding M. A nomenclature for ligand-gated ion channels.Neuropharmacology. 2009; 56: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) at synapses was analyzed (defined as overlap of SynDIG1, GluA2, and vGlut1 puncta; Figure 2C). At 7 DIV, SynDIG1 is present at 62% of GluA2-containing synapses (Figure 2D). At 10 and 15 DIV, 77% and 73%, respectively, of GluA2-positive synapses contain SynDIG1 (Figure 2D). The amount of SynDIG1 at GluA2-containing synapses represents 25%, 34%, and 37% of total SynDIG1 puncta at 7, 10, and 15 DIV, respectively (Figure 2E). Thus, while a significant fraction of GluA2-positive synapses contain SynDIG1, a relatively smaller fraction of total SynDIG1 puncta overlap with GluA2 at synapses, suggesting that the majority of SynDIG1 clusters are found at nonsynaptic sites. To test this possibility, young neurons (6 DIV) with low synapse density were examined (Figure 3A). Indeed, while 30% of GluA2 puncta and 25% of SynDIG1 puncta were found at synapses (defined as overlap of SynDIG1, GluA2, and vGlut1 puncta), a larger fraction of GluA2 (45%) and SynDIG1 (60%) overlapped at nonsynaptic sites (defined as lack of overlap with vGlut1 puncta). Thus, the majority of SynDIG1 overlaps with GluA2 either at synapses or extrasynaptic sites, suggesting that SynDIG1 might associate with AMPA receptors. To test if SynDIG1 interacts with AMPA receptors, COS cells were transfected with HA-SynDIG1 alone or HA-SynDIG1 and HA-GluA2. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GluA2 antibodies, and precipitates, along with input samples, were immunoblotted and probed with anti-HA antibodies to detect both HA-tagged constructs, distinguished by their different electrophoretic mobility (Figure 3B). As expected, anti-GluA2 antibodies efficiently precipitate HA-GluA2 in extracts from COS cells expressing HA-GluA2 alone or coexpressing HA-GluA2 and HA-SynDIG1 (not shown). In addition, anti-GluA2 antibodies coprecipitated full-length HA-SynDIG1 or HA-SynDIG1ΔN75 (Figure 3B). In contrast, coimmunoprecipitation was not observed for HA-SynDIG1ΔC33 (Figure 3B). Input levels of all constructs were equivalent and anti-GluA2 antibodies failed to coprecipitate HA-SynDIG1 or HA-SynDIG1ΔN75 in the absence of HA-GluA2 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, anti-SynDIG1 antibodies coimmunoprecipitate GluA1 and GluA2, but not NR1, from mouse brain extracts (Figure 3C), suggesting that SynDIG1 associates with AMPA receptors in vivo. To determine if SynDIG1 could alter HA-GluA2 distribution, COS cells transfected with HA-GluA2 and HA-SynDIG1, HA-SynDIG1ΔC33, or empty vector were live-labeled with anti-HA antibodies to examine surface GluA2 (Figure 3D; Note: N-terminally HA-tagged SynDIG1 fails to yield any signal upon live-labeling with anti-HA antibodies; see Figure S2A). Subsequently, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-SynDIG1 mAb to assess distribution of SynDIG1 compared with GluA2 (Figure 3D). Full-length SynDIG1 changed the distribution of GluA2 such that the two proteins coclustered (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the size of surface-labeled HA-GluA2 clusters was increased upon coexpression of full-length SynDIG1 compared with that of control (Figure 3E). Mean GluA2 cluster intensity was also increased with full-length SynDIG1 compared with HA-GluA2 alone (Figure 3F). In contrast, coexpression of HA-SynDIG1ΔC33 failed to increase HA-GluA2 cluster size or intensity (Figures 3E and 3F), presumably due to its failure to interact with GluA2 (Figure 3B). Indeed, surface-labeled HA-GluA2 clusters (live-labeled with anti-HA antibodies) overlap exclusively with surface-labeled FLAG-tagged SynDIG1 (live-labeled with anti-FLAG antibodies; Figure S4D). SynDIG1 association with GluA2 suggested that SynDIG1 might play an active role in synapse development. This possibility was tested with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of endogenous SynDIG1 in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons. Neurons were cotransfected by electroporation at the time of plating with EGFP (to identify transfected neurons) and an shRNA construct targeted against the SynDIG1 mRNA (SynDIG1-shRNA; see Experimental Procedures). SynDIG1-shRNA inhibited HA-SynDIG1 expression in HEK293 cells, whereas a control-shRNA construct targeting the same region, but containing an internal mismatch, did not (Figure 4A). The knockdown efficiency of neurons transfected with SynDIG-shRNA versus control-shRNA was analyzed (Figure S5A). The SynDIG1-shRNA construct decreased endogenous SynDIG1 protein by 70% in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons compared with the effects of control-shRNA (Figure S5B). Altering the levels of SynDIG1 in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons did not affect total neurite length (Figure S5C) or branching (Figure S5D) compared to that of control neurons. Synapse development was examined by immunocytochemistry of 8–10 DIV neurons cotransfected at the time plating with EGFP (to identify transfected cells) and SynDIG1-shRNA or control-shRNA. To visualize synapses, cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies against vGlut1 and PSD95, GluA1, or GluA2 (Figures 4B–4D). Compared with control-shRNA transfected neurons, SynDIG1-shRNA resulted in a 27% decrease in synaptic PSD95 density (defined as overlap of PSD95 and vGlut1 puncta; Figure 4E) and a concomitant 29% decreased density of PSD95 puncta (Figure 4F). Mature AMPA-receptor-containing synapses were defined as the colocalization of surface-labeled GluA1 or GluA2 and vGlut1 puncta (Figures 4C and 4D). Neurons transfected with SynDIG1-shRNA exhibited 46% or 53% decreased density of surface-labeled GluA1- or GluA2-containing synapses, respectively, compared with control-shRNA (Figure 4E). Decreased GluA1 or GluA2 synapse density was also accompanied by a concomitant 35% decreased density of surface GluA1 or GluA2 puncta in SynDIG1-shRNA transfeced neurons (Figure 4F). To determine if decreased SynDIG1 leads to a concomitant reduction in synapse size, the area and fluorescence intensity of GluA1 and GluA2 clusters were analyzed. A small but significant decrease in size of surface-labeled GluA1 and GluA2 clusters was observed in SynDIG1-shRNA transfected neurons compared with control-shRNA cells (Figure 4G). Similarly, the fluorescence intensity of surface-labeled GluA1 and GluA2 clusters was also significantly reduced (Figure 4H). Although loss of SynDIG1 led to a 20% decrease in area of PSD95 clusters (Figure 4G), no change in fluorescence intensity was observed (Figure 4H). These findings demonstrate that reduction of SynDIG1 leads to both fewer mature synapses (as reflected in the decrease in GluA1 and GluA2 synapse density) and smaller mature synapses (as reflected in the decrease in GluA1 and GluA2 cluster area and intensity). Averaging all experiments, the density of vGlut1 puncta in axons contacting SynDIG1-shRNA transfected neurons versus control-shRNA transfected neurons was only slightly decreased (15%; p < 0.03). However, in contrast to PSD95, GluA1, and GluA2, this result was not reproduced in all individual experiments, supporting a primary role for SynDIG1 in postsynaptic development and maturation. To assess the functional effect of decreased SynDIG1 on synapses, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were analyzed. Neurons w"
https://openalex.org/W1974958660,"TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein) is a major constituent of ubiquitin-positive cytosolic aggregates present in neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ubiquitin-positive fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-U). Inherited mutations in TDP-43 have been linked to familial forms of ALS, indicating a key role for TDP-43 in disease pathogenesis. Here, we describe a Drosophila melanogaster model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Expression of wild-type human TDP-43 protein in Drosophila motor neurons led to motor dysfunction and dramatic reduction of life span. Interestingly, coexpression of ubiquilin 1, a previously identified TDP-43-interacting protein with suspected functions in autophagy and proteasome targeting, reduced steady-state TDP-43 expression but enhanced the severity of TDP-43 phenotypes. Finally, ectopically expressed TDP-43 was largely localized to motor neuron nuclei, suggesting that expression of wild-type TDP-43 alone is detrimental even in the absence of cytosolic aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that TDP-43 exerts cell-autonomous neurotoxicity in Drosophila and further imply that dose-dependent alterations of TDP-43 nuclear function may underlie motor neuron death in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2023152825,"Atg18 and Atg21 are homologous WD-40 repeat proteins that bind phosphoinositides via a novel conserved Phe-Arg-Arg-Gly motif and function in autophagy-related pathways. Atg18 is required for the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway and autophagy, whereas Atg21 is only required for the Cvt pathway. Currently, the functions of both proteins are poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationship between the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)-binding abilities of Atg18 and Atg21 and autophagy by expressing variants of these proteins that have mutations in their phosphoinositide-binding motifs. Cells expressing PtdIns(3)P-binding mutants of both these proteins showed highly reduced autophagy. Furthermore, the localization of components of two related ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems, Atg8 and Atg16, to the phagophore assembly site is affected. Consistent with the aberrant localization of the above Atg proteins, precursor Ape1, a cargo of the Cvt pathway and autophagy, is partially protease-sensitive in starvation conditions. This finding suggests a requirement for the PtdIns(3)P binding capability of Atg18 and Atg21 in efficient completion of the sequestering autophagic vesicles. Finally, using a multiple knock-out strain, we found that Atg18 and Atg21 facilitate the recruitment of Atg8–PE to the site of autophagosome formation and protect it from premature cleavage by Atg4, which represents a key aspect of post-translational autophagy regulation. Taken together, our results suggest that PtdIns(3)P binding by at least Atg18 or Atg21 is required for robust autophagic activity and that the PtdIns(3)P-binding motifs of Atg18 and Atg21 can compensate for one another in the recruitment of Atg components that are dependent on PtdIns(3)P for their phagophore assembly site association.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an intracellular trafficking pathway wherein a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome, engulfs cytoplasmic components, including proteins and organelles. The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome (or the vacuole in fungi and plants) where its cargo is degraded, and the breakdown products are recycled back into the cytosol. Autophagy plays a key role in cellular homeostasis and functions in diverse cellular processes such as development, programmed cell death, immune response, pathogenesis, tumor suppression, cardiac disorders, diabetes, and the prevention of neuronal degeneration (reviewed in Ref. 1Mizushima N.

So far in yeast, more than 30 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins have been identified, and most of them localize at least transiently to the PAS. In yeast, apart from autophagy that is primarily a nonselective, degradative pathway that occurs during starvation conditions, there is another vesicular pathway called the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, which is a selective, biosynthetic pathway that takes place during vegetative growth (4Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The Cvt pathway serves in the vacuolar transport of two hydrolases, α-mannosidase and the precursor form of aminopeptidase I (prApe1). Of the known Atg proteins, there are some that are exclusively involved in the Cvt pathway, others that are only needed for autophagy, and a subset of proteins that are required for both processes. For these pathways to function normally, various combinations of Atg proteins have to act in a concerted manner. phagophore assembly site cytoplasm to vacuole targeting phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate open reading frame 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid green fluorescent protein phosphatidylethanolamine multiple knock-out. Atg18 and Atg21 are homologous Atg proteins; Atg18 functions in both autophagy and the Cvt pathway, whereas Atg21 is only required for the latter (5Barth H. Meiling-Wesse K. Epple U.D. Thumm M.

Henke S. Tolstrup J. Thumm M. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 896-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and data not shown). Atg18, Atg21, and Ygr223c are predicted to be multiple WD-40 repeat proteins that fold to form seven bladed β-propellers (10Dove S.K. Piper R.C. McEwen R.K. Yu J.W. King M.C. Hughes D.C. Thuring J. Holmes A.B. Cooke F.T. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). WD-40 repeat proteins are relatively common in all eukaryotes and are implicated in a wide variety of functions such as signal transduction, cytoskeleton assembly, transcriptional regulation, pre-mRNA processing, cell cycle control, and apoptosis (11Denisenko O.N.

Repeated WD-40 motifs form β-propeller structures that act as sites for protein-protein interaction, and proteins containing these motifs serve as platforms for the assembly of protein complexes or as mediators of stable or transient interactions among other proteins (16Li D.

In addition to WD-40 motifs, Atg18, Atg21, and Ygr223c are able to bind both phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) and phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (8Str⊘mhaug P.E.

Both Atg18 and Atg21 bind phosphoinositides via conserved Phe-Arg-Arg-Gly (FRRG) motifs that lie within the proposed β-propellers; in the case of Atg18, these residues are 284FRRG287, and for Atg21 they are 342FRRG345. Mutations in the FRRG motif of Atg18 (FRRG to FTTG) result in a complete loss of phosphoinositide binding, whereas similar mutations in Atg21 result in highly reduced phosphoinositide binding, suggesting that this protein may have other lipid binding domains (8Str⊘mhaug P.E.

Niimi K. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Atg21FTTG mutant is completely defective in the vacuolar transport of prApe1 via the Cvt pathway, thus underscoring the importance of phosphoinositide binding for both pathways (10Dove S.K. Piper R.C. McEwen R.K. Yu J.W. King M.C. Hughes D.C. Thuring J. Holmes A.B. Cooke F.T. Michell R.H. Parker P.J.

The deletion of Fab1, an enzyme that converts PtdIns(3)P to PtdIns(3,5)P2, has no effect on either the Cvt pathway or autophagy (10Dove S.K. Piper R.C. McEwen R.K. Yu J.W. King M.C. Hughes D.C.

In addition to its roles in Cvt and autophagy, Atg18 mediates retrograde trafficking from the vacuole via the endosome to the Golgi, and this function depends on its ability to bind PtdIns(3,5)P2 (20Efe J.A. Botelho R.J. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4232-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The role of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding function of Atg21 is currently unknown. In yeast, PtdIns(3)P is generated by the specific phosphorylation of PtdIns at the D-3 position of the inositol ring by Vps34, the only PtdIns 3-kinase in this organism (21Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Vps34 plays a role in a number of vesicular membrane trafficking processes such as endocytosis, multivesicular body formation, soluble vacuolar protein sorting, and autophagy (21Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 22Katzmann D.J. Stefan C.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. J.

In growing cells, PtdIns(3)P localizes to endosomal and vacuolar membranes, whereas in starvation conditions it is enriched on autophagosomal membranes and is also transported into the vacuole by virtue of its presence on the membrane of autophagic bodies (25Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 26Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G.

Vps34 forms two distinct complexes, PtdIns 3-kinase complex I and PtdIns 3-kinase complex II, that function in autophagy and vacuolar protein sorting, respectively (23Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Both of the PtdIns 3-kinase complexes have three common subunits as follows: Vps15, Vps34, and Vps30/Atg6. In addition to these common factors, each complex also contains one specific component; for the PtdIns 3-kinase complex I, this unique factor is Atg14, whereas Vps38 is specific to complex II (23Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Atg14 mediates the localization of Vps30 and Vps34 to the PAS; however, Vps15 localizes to the PAS by an unknown mechanism that is independent of Atg14 (28Obara K. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1527-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the presence of PtdIns(3)P on the autophagosome membrane and the functional relevance of Atg protein-PtdIns(3)P interaction is not well understood. Atg18 interacts with Atg2; however, the physiological significance of this interaction is currently unknown. Recent data show that one of the functions of PtdIns(3)P on autophagic membranes is the recruitment of the Atg2-Atg18 complex to the PAS, via the PtdIns(3)P binding activity of Atg18 (19Obara K. Sekito T. Niimi K. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although the Atg18FTTG mutant is able to interact with Atg2, it is defective in the localization of the Atg2-Atg18FTTG complex to the PAS (19Obara K. Sekito T. Niimi K. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the localization of some other Atg components such as the Atg12–Atg5-Atg16 complex and Atg8 may be regulated by PtdIns(3)P, because in the absence of Atg14, the PAS localization of these proteins is abolished (29Suzuki K. Kubota Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These proteins, however, are not dependent on Atg18 for their PAS localization, suggesting an alternative and previously unidentified mechanism for their PAS recruitment. Here, we show that under nitrogen starvation conditions, the PAS localization of Atg16 and Atg8 does in fact depend on the PtdIns(3)P-binding motifs of Atg18 and Atg21; atg18Δ atg21Δ cells expressing Atg18FKKG and Atg21FKKG mutants are defective in the PAS recruitment of Atg16 and Atg8. Furthermore, as a result of the aberrant localization of these proteins, atg18Δ atg21Δ cells expressing the Atg18FKKG and Atg21FKKG mutants show a severe defect in autophagy, whereas either single mutant displays either no defect or a very negligible defect. Thus, our results suggest a model wherein the PtdIns(3)P-binding motifs of Atg18 and Atg21 can substitute for one another in the recruitment of Atg components that are dependent on PtdIns(3)P for their PAS association and in this manner allow autophagy to proceed at close to wild-type levels. Finally, to further understand the role of Atg18 and Atg21 in Atg8 localization, we made use of a modified multiple knock-out (MKO) strain. In this strain, most of the ATG genes are deleted, and a subset of Atg proteins can therefore be expressed to reconstitute in vivo a particular step of autophagy or the Cvt pathway (30Cao Y. Cheong H. Song H. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our modified MKO strain, we expressed GFP-Atg8ΔR along with the Atg3 and Atg7 proteins that conjugate Atg8ΔR with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (31Huang W.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), the Atg12–Atg5-Atg16 complex that enhances Atg8–PE formation, the PtdIns 3-kinase components Atg6 and Atg14 that are required for the PAS localization of Atg8–PE, and the Atg4 cysteine protease required for the cleavage of PE from Atg8 prior to autophagosome completion. We found that under growing conditions in the presence of these proteins, GFP-Atg8ΔR was dispersed in the cytosol. The additional presence of wild-type Atg18 and Atg21 resulted in distinct GFP-Atg8ΔR puncta. Furthermore, puncta formation occurred in a mechanism dependent on the PtdIns(3)P-binding motifs of Atg18 and Atg21, suggesting a role for these proteins in the protection of Atg8–PE from unregulated cleavage by Atg4. These data provide the first evidence for an in vivo mechanism that regulates the cleavage of Atg8–PE. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Knock-out strains were constructed using the loxP/Cre system (33Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Integration of the GFP tag at the 3′ end of the ATG16 open reading frame (ORF) was performed by a PCR-based procedure (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A.

The TRP1 marker in YCY146 was replaced with the Escherichia coli kanr marker using the marker exchange plasmid M3925 (trp1::kanMX3) digested with BamHI (35Voth W.P. Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J.

Cells were starved in synthetic medium lacking nitrogen (SD-N: 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose). For constructing pATG18-PA(314) and pATG21-PA(314) (where PA is protein A), the full-length ATG18 and ATG21 ORFs with 1 kb of endogenous promoter were amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the XhoI and XmaI sites of pNopPA(314) (36He C. Song H. Yorimitsu T. Monastyrska I. Yen W.L. Legakis J.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To clone pATG21-GFP(416), the full-length ATG21 ORF with 1 kb of 5′ sequence, including the endogenous promoter, was PCR-amplified and cloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of pATG9-GFP(416) (pAPG9GFP(416) (37Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.P. Baba M. Tokunaga C. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)). pATG18-GFP(416) was cloned by a two-step process. A silent mutation was first introduced into pATG18-PA(314) to remove an internal BamHI site in the ATG18 ORF, leading to pATG18ΔBamHI-PA(314); the full-length ATG18 ORF with 1 kb of 5′ sequence, including the endogenous promoter, was PCR-amplified from pATG18ΔBamHI-PA(314) and cloned into the same sites of pATG9-GFP(416). The full-length ATG21 ORF with 1 kb of 5′ sequence, including the endogenous promoter, and 1 kb of 3′ sequence, including the terminator, was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned as a BamHI and SalI fragment into pRS415 or pRS414 to generate pATG21(415) or pATG21(414). PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute two arginines (RR) with two lysines (KK) in the corresponding wild-type plasmids, leading to pATG18FKKG-PA(314), pATG21FKKG-PA(314), pATG21FKKG-GFP(416), pATG18FKKG-GFP(416), and pATG21FKKG(415). pATG7-ATG10-ATG5-HA-ATG12(416), pATG16(415), and pATG16-ATG4(415) were made based on plasmids pATG7(414), pATG10(414), pATG5(416), pHA-ATG12(416), pATG16(416), and pATG4(414) (30Cao Y. Cheong H. Song H. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For constructing pATG7-ATG10-ATG5-HA-ATG12(416), an ATG7 fragment from pATG7(414) was first cloned into the XmaI site of pRS416 to generate pATG7(416); ATG10, ATG5, and HA-ATG12 fragments were cloned sequentially into pATG7(416) using a single restriction enzyme each time. KpnI was used to introduce ATG10, BamHI for ATG5, and XhoI for HA-ATG12. pATG16(415) was constructed from pATG16(416) by replacing its backbone with that of pRS415 using PvuI. An ATG4 fragment digested with SacI from pATG4(414) was cloned into the pATG16(415) vector linearized with the same enzyme, resulting in pATG16-ATG4(415). To clone the multigene plasmids pATG18-ATG2(413) and pATG23-ATG27-ATG6-ATG14(414), single gene plasmids expressing an individual ATG gene with its endogenous promoter and terminator regions were first constructed and tested for functionality. XbaI and SacI sites were used to clone pATG18(413), XhoI and XmaI for pATG2(413), XhoI for pATG23(414), KpnI for pATG27(414), SacI and BamHI for pATG6(414), and SalI and PstI for pATG14(414). The promoter, ORF, and terminator inserts were then removed from the single gene plasmids and cloned sequentially to generate plasmids pATG18-ATG2(413) and pATG23-ATG27-ATG6-ATG14(414). To generate pATG6-ATG14(414), a fragment containing both the ATG6 and the ATG14 inserts was PCR-amplified from pATG23-ATG27-ATG6-ATG14(414) and cloned into the NotI site of pRS414. The same fragment was inserted into the NotI site of pATG21(414), leading to pATG21-ATG6-ATG14(414). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to exchange the arginines (RR) in the PtdIns(3)P-binding motifs of Atg18 and Atg21 with lysines (KK), in the multigene plasmids. pATG8-GFP(416) has been described previously (38Kim J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). pATG8-GFP bearing the endogenous promoter of ATG8 was digested using NotI and HindIII, and a fragment containing the promoter of ATG8 and the ATG8 ORF fused to GFP were cloned into the pRS307 vector digested with the same enzymes. pAtg8-GFP(307) was linearized with BglII and integrated into the lys2-801 locus. pATG8ΔR(414) bearing the endogenous ATG8 promoter was digested with SacI and XhoI, and cloned into the pRS307 vector digested with SacI and SalI. pATG8ΔR(307) was linearized with BglII and integrated into the lys2-801 locus. The pRS vectors have been described previously (39Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGFP-ATG8(316) was a kind gift from Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan). Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (30Cao Y. Cheong H. Song H. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD or SMD lacking the appropriate auxotrophic amino acids to mid-log phase before imaging. For starvation, cells were shifted to SD-N for 4 h. Images were captured with a ×100 objective lens for all microscopy experiments except for those to localize Atg16-GFP, in which a ×60 objective lens was used. Fluorescence signals were visualized on a fluorescence microscope (IX71; Olympus). The images were captured by a CCD camera (Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ; Roper Scientific) and deconvolved using DeltaVision software (Applied Precision). Sample preparation, image acquisition, and quantification of autophagic bodies were performed as described previously (40Xie Z. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For yeast two-hybrid screening, AD-Atg18 (pPS150) and BD-Atg21 (pPS153) plasmids were transformed into strain PJ69-4A (41James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As negative controls, the strain PJ69-4A was transformed with BD-Atg21 and empty AD vector or AD-Atg18 and empty BD vector. Interaction was assayed by streaking transformants on SD plates lacking histidine and examining growth. For affinity purification, the strain UNY82, expressing Atg18 chromosomally tagged with 3-hemagglutinin, was transformed with Atg21-PA (experimental strain) or with empty vector, pRS414 (negative control). As an additional negative control, strain SEY6210 transformed with Atg21-PA alone was used. Affinity purification was performed as described previously (42Cheong H. Nair U. Geng J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 668-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (IPVH00010; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunoblotting was performed with monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Sigma). The protein extraction, Western blotting, prApe1 maturation, GFP-Atg8 processing, and alkaline phosphatase (Pho8Δ60) and protease protection assays have been described previously (43Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 44Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev.

For the protease protection assay, spheroplasts were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2) and disrupted using a 25-mm Swin-Lok holder assembly fitted with a 3.0-μm Nucleopore Track-Etch membrane (Whatman). To investigate the physiological role of PtdIns(3)P binding by Atg18 and Atg21, we generated mutations within the FRRG motifs of these proteins (FRRG to FKKG) and examined the effects of these mutations on the Cvt pat"
https://openalex.org/W2003187423,"Aminoglycoside-class antibiotics bind directly to ribosomal RNA, imparting pleiotropic effects on ribosome function. Despite in-depth structural investigations of aminoglycoside-RNA oligonucleotide and aminoglycoside-ribosome interactions, mechanisms explaining the unique ribosome inhibition profiles of chemically similar aminoglycosides remain elusive. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) methods, we show that high-affinity aminoglycoside binding to the conserved decoding site region of the functional pre-translocation ribosome complex specifically remodels the nature of intrinsic dynamic processes within the particle. The extents of these effects, which are distinct for each member of the aminoglycoside class, strongly correlate with their inhibition of EF-G-catalyzed translocation. Neomycin, a 4,5-linked aminoglycoside, binds with lower affinity to one or more secondary binding sites, mediating distinct structural and dynamic perturbations that further enhance translocation inhibition. These new insights help explain why closely related aminoglycosides elicit pleiotropic translation activities and demonstrate the potential utility of smFRET as a tool for dissecting the mechanisms of antibiotic action."
https://openalex.org/W2086541892,"Resistance to endocrine therapies remains a major problem in the management of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER)-positive breast cancer. We show that inhibition of NF-kappaB (p65/RELA), either by overexpression of a mutant IkappaB (IkappaBSR) or a small-molecule inhibitor of NF-kappaB (parthenolide; IC(50)=500 nM in tamoxifen-resistant cells), synergistically restores sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) in resistant MCF7/RR and MCF7/LCC9 cells and further sensitizes MCF-7 and MCF7/LCC1 control cells to 4HT. These effects are independent of changes in either cell cycle distribution or in the level of autophagy measured by inhibition of p62/SQSTM1 expression and cleavage of LC3. NF-kappaB inhibition restores the ability of 4HT to decrease BCL2 expression, increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, and induce a caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in resistant cells. Each of these effects is reversed by a caspase 8 (CASP8)-specific inhibitor that blocks enzyme-substrate binding. Thus, increased activation of NF-kappaB can alter sensitivity to tamoxifen by modulating CASP8 activity, with consequent effects on BCL2 expression, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis. These data provide significant new insights into how molecular signaling affects antiestrogen responsiveness and strongly suggest that a combination of parthenolide and tamoxifen may offer a novel therapeutic approach to the management of some ER-positive breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1997603072,"Rabs constitute the largest family of monomeric GTPases, yet for the majority of Rabs relatively little is known about their activation and recruitment to vesicle-trafficking pathways. We recently identified connecdenn (DENND1A), which contains an N-terminal DENN (differentially expressed in neoplastic versus normal cells) domain, a common and evolutionarily ancient protein module. Through its DENN domain, connecdenn functions enzymatically as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab35. Here we identify two additional connecdenn family members and demonstrate that all connecdenns function as Rab35 GEFs, albeit with different levels of activity. The DENN domain of connecdenn 1 and 2 binds Rab35, whereas connecdenn 3 does not, indicating that Rab35 binding and activation are separable functions. Through their highly divergent C termini, each of the connecdenns binds to clathrin and to the clathrin adaptor AP-2. Interestingly, all three connecdenns use different mechanisms to bind AP-2. Characterization of connecdenn 2 reveals binding to the beta2-ear of AP-2 on a site that overlaps with that used by the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein and betaarrestin, although the sequence used by connecdenn 2 is unique. Loss of connecdenn 2 function through small interference RNA knockdown results in an enlargement of early endosomes, similar to what is observed upon loss of Rab35 activity. Our studies reveal connecdenn DENN domains as generalized GEFs for Rab35 and identify a new AP-2-binding motif, demonstrating a complex link between the clathrin machinery and Rab35 activation."

Measurements of focal contact/adhesion size and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation correlated with syndecan-4 status and α-smooth muscle actin organization, being reduced where syndecan-4 function was compromised by a lack of multiple heparan sulfate chains. Syndecans are an ancient group of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, with four members in every mammal examined to date (1Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 2Tkachenko E. Rhodes J.M. Simons M. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 3Couchman J.R.

Syndecans associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and syndecan-4 in particular, is known as a focal adhesion component (3Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In fibroblast adhesion studies (4Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it has been shown that the HepII domain of fibronectin will interact with the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-4 to promote a signaling response that includes binding and activation of protein kinase Cα and downstream to the Rho family of G proteins (4Woods A.

Of the syndecan family, much focus has been on syndecan-4 because of its role in adhesion, and also because key elements of its structure and signaling have been elucidated. The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 forms twisted clamp dimers, stabilized by the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2), which in turn bind to protein kinase Cα, becoming persistently activated (8Okina E. Manon-Jensen T. Whiteford J.R. Couchman J.R. Scand. J. Med. Sci. Sports. 2009; 19: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Keum E. Kim Y. Kim J. Kwon S. Lim Y. Han I.O. Oh E.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is likely that the dimer is the basal state of all syndecans, because the transmembrane domains of all syndecans form SDS-resistant homodimers by virtue of a highly conserved GXXXG motif (10Dews I.C. Mackenzie K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20782-20787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Choi S. Lee E. Kwon S. Park H. Yi J.Y. Kim S. Han I.O. Yun Y. Oh E.S. J. Biol.

One report suggests that heparan sulfate chains are not required for focal adhesion promotion (12Echtermeyer F. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in this case where syndecan-4 cDNA was transfected into a CHO cell mutant incapable of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. However, syndecan-4 does also possess a site in its external core protein, including an NXIP motif, which triggers integrin-mediated cell adhesion (13Whiteford J.R. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32156-32163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A similar principle has been demonstrated for syndecan-1, where β3 or β5 integrins are influenced directly by a portion of the ectodomain, now known as synstatin (14Beauvais D.M. Ell B.J. McWhorter A.R. Rapraeger A.C. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, most studies have indicated a need for heparan sulfate substitution on syndecan-4, and some fine structure requirements of the chains for interaction with fibronectin, have been elucidated. These include N-sulfation (but not 2-O-sulfation) and sulfated subdomains of >12 sugar residues (15Mahalingam Y. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The syndecan-4 knock-out mouse has vascular repair and cell migration defects (16Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F. Detmar M. Goetinck P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: R9-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It also has defects in skeletal muscle regeneration (17Cornelison D.D.W. Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Goetinck P.F. Rauvala H. Rapraeger A.C. Olwin B.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cell migration defects are not corrected by selected growth factors, suggesting that there are altered cell adhesion properties (16Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F.

This is consistent with in vitro studies showing a role for the proteoglycan in directionally persistent migration (18Bass M.D. Roach K.A. Morgan M.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Schoen T. Muramatsu T. Mayer U. Ballestrem C. Spatz J.P. Humphries M.J. J.

This difference in cytoskeletal organization is used here as an assay for syndecan-4 functionality. α-smooth muscle actin focal adhesion kinase hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline murine embryonic fibroblast green fluorescent protein. A continuing mystery is how ligand binding to heparan sulfate on the cell surface triggers cytoplasmic signaling events in syndecan-4. Because this proteoglycan becomes clustered into focal adhesions, an obvious possibility is that lateral association of syndecan-4 dimers is sufficient to drive the process. At the same time, all syndecans are potentially multivalent, given that each core protein has at least three Ser-Gly motifs suitable for substitution with glycosaminoglycans (3Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Bass M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Sports. 2009; 19: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Where studied, it appears that glycanation is maximal, i.e. if three sites are available, each tends to be substituted with a chain (22Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this applies to syndecan-4 on the cell surface, then up to six heparan sulfate chains per core protein dimer may be available. The question arises, however, whether multiple chains are in fact required to promote a signaling response. To address this, we prepared all possible variants of syndecan-4, ranging from the wild type with three Ser-Gly dipeptides, to two, one, and no Ser-Gly dipeptides, eight variants in total. In mutant forms, key serine residues were mutated to alanine. These cDNA constructs were introduced into syndecan-4-null cells and assessed for their ability to restore a wild-type actin cytoskeleton. The data suggest that a functional syndecan-4 dimer requires a minimum of four heparan sulfate chains, underlining the importance of valency, and suggesting that under normal circumstances, two syndecan-4 dimers must associate in the presence of ligand, to form a signaling unit. Syndecan-4-null (S4KO) and matching wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (20Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T. Muramatsu H. Tsuzuki S. Nakamura E. Kusugami K. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol.

COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO) containing 10% FBS and 2% glutamax. Syndecan-4-null fibroblast and COS7 transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Antibodies used included monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody (Clone 1A4; Sigma), anti-paxillin antibody (clone Z035; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), monoclonal anti-HA (Clone HA.11; Covance), polyclonal goat anti-α-actinin (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit antibodies against focal adhesion kinase (FAK; BD Pharmingen), and tyrosine 397-phosphorylated FAK (Cell Signaling), monoclonal mouse anti-Rac (Clone 23A8; Millipore), polyclonal rabbit anti-RhoA (119; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal goat anti-ezrin (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit anti-HA (SG. 77; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Clone TUB 2.1; Sigma). Syndecan-4 antibody was raised in chickens against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N terminus of the syndecan-4 core protein as described (15Mahalingam Y. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fibronectin was purified from fresh human plasma by adapting the protocol of Miekka et al. (23Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The enzymatic cleavage and purification of the central, integrin-binding 110-kDa fibronectin fragment was as previously (15Mahalingam Y. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged HepII (FN repeats III12–15) domain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified with His select® cobalt affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. The construct in pQE-30 was a kind gift from Dr. Jean Schwarzbauer (Princeton University). The three serine residues that serve as syndecan-4 glycosaminoglycan attachment sites were mutated using a two step overlap PCR approach as follows. During the first step 5′ and 3′ PCR products were generated from full-length rat syndecan-4 cDNA using primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions of syndecan-4 and reverse and forward primers containing point mutations so that one serine residue (44, 65, or 67) was mutated to alanine (supplemental Table S1). The resultant two PCR products were combined and used as template in a second reaction using S4for and S4rev primers to generate full-length syndecan-4 cDNA. EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were incorporated into these primer sequences, and PCR products were digested with these enzymes and ligated into the corresponding sites of pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) using standard procedures. Using the primers described in supplemental Table S1 it was not only possible to generate single Ser → Ala mutations at each position but also to generate all combinations of the three mutations (Fig. 2). A similar approach was used to fuse the HA epitope sequence between isoleucine 32 and aspartate 33 in the syndecan-4 constructs. Primers S4for and S4rev were used in conjunction with primers containing the HA coding sequence to generate 5′ and 3′ PCR products from each of the 6 mutated syndecan-4 cDNAs and the wild-type sequence. Full-length products were obtained for each cDNA, and these were digested and ligated into pIRES2-EGFP as described. The expression of each cDNA was analyzed in COS7 cells by Western blots with anti-HA antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako). In control experiments, cell layers were treated with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma Aldrich) before performing the SDS-PAGE to remove chondroitin and dermatan sulfate chains from syndecan-4 core protein. Syndecan-4 mutant cDNAs encoding truncated cytoplasmic domains were prepared as previously (24Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the HA coding sequence was inserted as described above. To create single amino acid substitution of either Tyr-184 or Tyr-192 with phenylalanine in syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (25Lim S.T. Longley R.L. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13795-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), syndecan-4 cDNAs encoding those sequences in pIRES2-EGFP were constructed using overlap PCR extension methods. The cell surface expression of recombinant syndecan-4 was confirmed in COS7 by flow cytometry. Cells expressing wild-type and recombinant syndecan-4 were harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS; then the live cells were stained using anti-HA antibody in 1% BSA and rabbit anti-mouse Alexafluor 647 IgG (Molecular Probes). Dead cells were identified by staining with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide solution (BD Bioscience). Controls were prepared by staining with Alexafluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG without primary antibodies. Samples were analyzed using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with CellQuest Pro software. Transfected syndecan-4-null mouse fibroblasts were seeded onto coverslips in growth medium for 24 h prior to serum starvation for a further 24 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min; then stained using conventional procedures using a primary antibody to αSMA and Alexafluor 568-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Samples were analyzed on a Zeiss Axioplan-2 microscope (×40 objective), and images were processed using Metamorph and Adobe Photoshop. For focal adhesion area measurement, the structures were stained with paxillin antibody, followed by Alexafluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The area of each focal adhesion was measured and calibrated using Metamorph and ImageJ imaging software. For each transfection a minimum of 100 cells was analyzed for focal adhesion area. Transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP from the bicistronic vector or by immunological detection of the HA insert in the syndecan-4. For fibronectin domain experiments, transfected syndecan-4-null fibroblasts were seeded onto coverslips coated with fibronectin (1 μg/coverslip) or FN 110 (1 μg/coverslip) in growth medium, followed by incubation for 3–4 h and HepII (1–10 μg/ml) solution was added to the medium. Cells were stained for focal adhesion components, and the percentage of cells containing these organelles was assessed, with a minimum of 100 cells per condition. For all experiments transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP or by immunological detection of the HA tag in the syndecan-4 core protein. To compare the expression of different focal adhesion proteins in wild-type and syndecan-4-null murine fibroblasts, Western blots were performed with antibodies against paxillin, α-actinin, Rac 1, Rho A, and ezrin. Syndecan-4-null MEFs were transfected with cDNAs corresponding to wild type, and glycosaminoglycan chain substitution mutants of syndecan-4 and allowed to express the protein for 36 h. The expression of FAK and the level of its phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FAK and anti-phospho-FAK (tyrosine 397) antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Western blots were calibrated by quantitation of β-tubulin as a loading control. Transfected syndecan-4-null fibroblasts were seeded on glass coverslips in the presence of serum for 24 h prior to serum starvation for a further 24 h. Syndecan-4 clustering was achieved by first incubating cells with 10 μg/ml of anti-syndecan-4 polyclonal antibody in serum-free medium (15Mahalingam Y. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to washing twice with PBS. Cells were then treated with Alexaflour 568-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY (Invitrogen; 1 μg/ml in serum-free medium) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. The cells were then conventionally stained for αSMA as described as above. COS7 cells expressing wild-type and recombinant syndecan-4 mutants were washed with PBS and DMEM was supplied without FBS. Cultures were metabolically labeled with 35S (Na2SO4; specific activity 43Ci/mg sulfur; MP Biomedicals) at a concentration of 140–150 μCi/ml. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Syndecan-4 was purified by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) using protein-A beads. Radiolabeled glycosaminoglycan chains were cleaved from syndecan-4 core protein by alkaline elimination (0.1 m NaBH4 in 0.1 m NaOH) for 24–30 h at 4 °C, followed by neutralization with 4% HCl. For gel filtration chromatography, the heparan sulfate chains (∼8000 cpm) were applied to a Superdex 200 10/300GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. The heparan sulfate chains were eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column was calibrated with blue dextran (2000 kDa), ovalbumin (42 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). Eluted fractions were collected and analyzed for radiolabel content by scintillation spectroscopy. For anion-exchange chromatography, metabolically labeled heparan sulfate chains were applied to a MonoQ10/100GL column (GE Healthcare). The column was pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.5 m NaCl. The unbound radioactivity was removed by washing column with 5 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.5 m NaCl. Bound radioactivity was eluted in a linear gradient of NaCl (0.5–2.0 M) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (10 column volumes). The eluted fractions were collected and analyzed for radiolabel content. Low pH (1.5) nitrous acid treatment of heparan sulfate chains was performed according to Shively and Conrad (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), to cleave the heparan sulfate chains at N-sulfated glucosamine residues. Immunoprecipitated syndecan-4 was also treated with 5 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, EC 4.2.2.4) in 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 60 mm sodium acetate at 37 °C for 16h. Heparinase III treatments were as described (27Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9410-9417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35S-labeled heparan sulfate chains from purified syndecan-4 were mixed with unlabeled heparan sulfate (0.01 mg/ml final) and incubated with 1.5 milliunits of heparinase III (heparinase EC 4.2.2.8, Seikagaku America) for 6 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0 containing 0.1 mm calcium acetate. Another 1.2-milliunit aliquot of the enzyme was added after 6 h, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h. The products from nitrous acid, chondroitinase ABC and heparinase III treatments were applied to Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with commercially available protein standards and disaccharide, ΔUA-GlcNS (462 Da; Iduron UK). Two independent strains of newborn and embryonic syndecan-4-null fibroblasts exhibit the same defect in organization of their actin cytoskeleton. On fibronectin substrates, these cells have β-actin containing microfilament bundles, often oriented circumferentially, and small focal contacts (Fig. 1B). These focal contacts contained several expected marker proteins including paxillin (Fig. 1B), vinculin, talin, and phosphotyrosine. In contrast, wild-type cells have more substantial stress fibers, frequently running from end-to-end, and larger focal adhesions (Fig. 1B). A key difference however, is the organization of αSMA. This is a stress fiber component of normal mouse (Fig. 1C), and rat fibroblasts but is not a component of the finer microfilament structures of the null cells (Fig. 1C). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 1D. This difference is not a result of decreased αSMA protein levels in the null cells (Fig. 1E) but its organization. Moreover it can be overcome by transfection of null cells with cDNA constructs encoding wild type syndecan-4 (Fig. 1C). These patterns of αSMA organization are the phenotypic marker for subsequent experiments where mutated forms of syndecan-4 are expressed in null cells to determine the parameters necessary for reconstitution of the wild-type phenotype. The role of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain was confirmed by transfection of a series of mutant constructs, shown in Fig. 1A. Deletion of the three C-terminal amino acids, which prevents PDZ proteins from binding, had no effect on syndecan-4 ability to restore a normal actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1C). However, a truncation to the center of the V region (terminating at Ile-191) prevented a restoration of actin cytoskeleton. Similarly, mutation of either of two tyrosine residues at proximal and distal ends of the V region rendered the syndecan-4 non-functional in these assays (Fig. 1C). Quantitation of these experiments is shown in Fig. 1D. These data suggest that signaling through the cytoplasmic domain, and/or interactions with actin-associated proteins, is critical to the α-smooth muscle phenotype promoted by syndecan-4. FACS data confirmed that all constructs were expressed on the cell surface of the fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S1) to broadly equivalent levels. Null cells transfected with wild-type syndecan-4 cDNA become essentially identical to wild-type cells within 48 h of transfection, when examining the distribution of αSMA (Fig. 2B). Correspondingly, focal adhesions were much enhanced in size and number (Fig. 3). In contrast, an empty vector control had no influence on cell morphology or cytoskeleton (Figs. 2B and 3). To directly ascertain how many glycosaminoglycan chains were required for the phenotype restoration and whether their position on the core protein was important, all possible combinations of mutations in the three serine residues of the N-terminal region of the core protein were produced (Fig. 2A). Complementary DNAs for all six mutants were transfected into COS7 and null mouse embryo fibroblasts and the cytoskeleton examined 48 h later. Glycanation of each syndecan-4 variant was examined by Western blotting of COS7 cell lysates, into which HA-tagged forms for syndecan-4 cDNA had been transfected (Fig. 2A). Where the AAA mutant was expressed, a single prominent polypeptide of ∼40 kDa was detected, consistent with an SDS-resistant dimeric core protein (9Keum E. Kim Y. Kim J. Kwon S. Lim Y. Han I.O. Oh E.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Dews I.C. Mackenzie K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20782-20787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Where a single serine was present (SAA, ASA, and AAS), glycanation was apparent, with heterodisperse populations of syndecan-4 visible. This confirmed the presence of glycosaminoglycan in all three variants of syndecan-4. Similar heterogeneous populations of syndecan-4 were detected by Western blotting of SSA, SAS, ASS, and SDC4 (wild-type) forms of syndecan-4, though all extended into higher mass regions of the gel than the “single chain” forms. The SDC4 material had the highest mass range of all, and the data are consistent with syndecan-4 being substituted on each available serine residue, as noted previously (22Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the syndecan-4 cDNA constructs were transfected into null fibroblasts, the results showed that at least two of three serine residues were required in order that αSMA became incorporated into microfilament bundles. Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 2C. However, and importantly, it did not matter which two of three serine residues were present (Figs. 2B and C). In all cases though, where only one serine residue was present, allowing only one heparan sulfate chain substitution on the core protein, no restoration of normal cytoskeletal phenotype was seen. The data therefore suggest that two or more heparan sulfate chains are required to interact with the matrix substrate for productive syndecan-4 function. In each case, focal adhesion characteristics followed that of the microfilament architecture, being larger and more numerous where αSMA was incorporated into microfilament bundles (Fig. 3). Quantitative analysis showed that focal adhesions were <5 μm2 in null cells, and where single chain variants of syndecan-4 were expressed. In contrast, focal adhesions were on average >10 μm2 in wild-type cells and those null cells expressing syndecan-4 with two or three heparan sulfate chains (Fig. 3B). In control experiments, cell surface expression of each syndecan-4 variant in terms of heparan sulfate chain composition was confirmed by FACS analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). The difference in focal adhesion size between null and wild-type cells was not related to the expression level of protein components such as α-actinin, paxillin, Rac1, RhoA, or ezrin proteins that were comparable in syndecan-4-null and wild-type cells (Fig. 3C). This suggests that organization, rather than protein expression levels, is relevant to syndecan-4 promotion of focal adhesions and large microfilament bundles containing αSMA. However, null cells reproducibly expressed ∼3"

We found that as tetracycline degrades, the competitive advantage conferred to bacteria by resistance not only diminishes but actually reverses to become a prolonged disadvantage due to the activities of more stable degradation products. Tetracycline decay can lead to net selection against resistance, which may help explain the puzzling coexistence of sensitive and resistant strains in natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W2083491718,"The abnormally folded form of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) accumulating in nervous and lymphoid tissues of prion-infected individuals can be naturally cleaved to generate a N-terminal-truncated fragment called C2. Information about the identity of the cellular proteases involved in this process and its possible role in prion biology has remained limited and controversial. We investigated PrP(Sc) N-terminal trimming in different cell lines and primary cultured nerve cells, and in the brain and spleen tissue from transgenic mice infected by ovine and mouse prions. We found the following: (i) the full-length to C2 ratio varies considerably depending on the infected cell or tissue. Thus, in primary neurons and brain tissue, PrP(Sc) accumulated predominantly as untrimmed species, whereas efficient trimming occurred in Rov and MovS cells, and in spleen tissue. (ii) Although C2 is generally considered to be the counterpart of the PrP(Sc) proteinase K-resistant core, the N termini of the fragments cleaved in vivo and in vitro can actually differ, as evidenced by a different reactivity toward the Pc248 anti-octarepeat antibody. (iii) In lysosome-impaired cells, the ratio of full-length versus C2 species dramatically increased, yet efficient prion propagation could occur. Moreover, cathepsin but not calpain inhibitors markedly inhibited C2 formation, and in vitro cleavage by cathepsins B and L produced PrP(Sc) fragments lacking the Pc248 epitope, strongly arguing for the primary involvement of acidic hydrolases of the endolysosomal compartment. These findings have implications on the molecular analysis of PrP(Sc) and cell pathogenesis of prion infection."
https://openalex.org/W2033576856,"Coronavirus membrane (M) protein can form virus-like particles (VLPs) when coexpressed with nucleocapsid (N) or envelope (E) proteins, suggesting a pivotal role for M in virion assembly. Here we demonstrate the self-assembly and release of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M protein in medium in the form of membrane-enveloped vesicles with densities lower than those of VLPs formed by M plus N. Although efficient N-N interactions require the presence of RNA, we found that M-M interactions were RNA-independent. SARS-CoV M was observed in both the Golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells. Blocking M glycosylation does not appear to significantly affect M plasma membrane labeling intensity, M-containing vesicle release, or VLP formation. Results from a genetic analysis indicate involvement of the third transmembrane domain of M in plasma membrane-targeting signal. Fusion proteins containing M amino-terminal 50 residues encompassing the first transmembrane domain were found to be sufficient for membrane binding, multimerization, and Golgi retention. Surprisingly, we found that fusion proteins lacking all three transmembrane domains were still capable of membrane binding, Golgi retention, and interacting with M. The data suggest that multiple SARS-CoV M regions are involved in M self-assembly and subcellular localization."

https://openalex.org/W2146328465,"Non-melanoma skin cancer, the most common neoplasia after solid organ transplantation, causes serious morbidity and mortality and is related to sun exposure. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been used widely to prevent rejection in organ transplantation. The mechanism of CsA action in causing cancer was thought to be well understood via immunosuppression. Here, we show that CsA promotes primary skin tumor growth in immune-deficient mice and keratinocyte growth in vitro. In addition, CsA enhances keratinocyte survival from removal of extracellular matrix or UVB radiation. At the molecular level, CsA increases AKT activation after serum treatment and UVB irradiation. Furthermore we found that expression of PTEN, the negative regulator of AKT activation, is significantly reduced post-CsA in human HaCaT and A431 cells and in mouse skin in vivo. CsA-induced PTEN down-regulation occurs at the transcription level and is epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent. Such PTEN suppression is required for increased AKT activation. Inhibition of AKT activation abolishes CsA-promoted growth and survival, indicating that AKT hyperactivation is essential for both growth and survival of CsA-treated cells. In addition, mTOR signaling as a known AKT downstream pathway is required for CsA-enhanced growth and survival. Taken together, we have identified the PTEN/AKT pathway as new molecular targets of CsA in epidermal keratinocytes, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism in CsA-enhanced skin carcinogenesis. Our findings challenge assumptions about how CsA-associated tumors arise in skin."
https://openalex.org/W2009319344,"MutSbeta (MSH2-MSH3) mediates repair of insertion-deletion heterologies but also triggers triplet repeat expansions that cause neurological diseases. Like other DNA metabolic activities, MutSbeta interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) via a conserved motif (QXX(L/I)XXFF). We demonstrate that MutSbeta-PCNA complex formation occurs with an affinity of approximately 0.1 microM and a preferred stoichiometry of 1:1. However, up to 20% of complexes are multivalent under conditions where MutSbeta is in molar excess over PCNA. Conformational studies indicate that the two proteins associate in an end-to-end fashion in solution. Surprisingly, mutation of the PCNA-binding motif of MutSbeta not only abolishes PCNA binding, but unlike MutSalpha, also dramatically attenuates MutSbeta-MutLalpha interaction, MutLalpha endonuclease activation, and bidirectional mismatch repair. As predicted by these findings, PCNA competes with MutLalpha for binding to MutSbeta, an effect that is blocked by the cell cycle regulator p21(CIP1). We propose that MutSbeta-MutLalpha interaction is mediated in part by residues ((L/I)SRFF) embedded within the MSH3 PCNA-binding motif. To our knowledge this is the first case where residues important for PCNA binding also mediate interaction with a second protein. These findings also indicate that MutSbeta- and MutSalpha-initiated repair events differ in fundamental ways."
https://openalex.org/W2002503504,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here we show for the first time that HtrA3 is a mitochondrial stress-response factor that promotes cytotoxicity to etoposide and cisplatin in lung cancer cell lines. Exogenous expression of wild type HtrA3 domain variants significantly attenuated cell survival with etoposide and cisplatin treatment in lung cancer cell lines H157 and A549 compared with expression of protease inactive mutants (S305A) or vector control. Conversely, HtrA3 suppression promoted cell survival with etoposide and cisplatin treatment in lung cancer cell lines Hop62 and HCC827. Survival was attenuated by re-expression of wild type HtrA3 variants during treatment but not by protease inactive mutants or vector control. HtrA3 also co-fractionated and co-localized with mitochondrial markers with both endogenous and exogenous expression in normal lung and lung cancer cell lines but was translocated from mitochondria following etoposide treatment. Moreover, HtrA3 translocation from mitochondria correlated with an increase in cell death that was attenuated by either HtrA3 suppression or Bcl-2 overexpression. Taken together, these results suggest that HtrA3 may be a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial cell death effector whose serine protease function may be crucial to modulating etoposide- and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in lung cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2067407021,"Kruppel-like factor (KLF) proteins are emerging as key regulators of lipid metabolism, diabetes, and the biosynthesis of immunological cytokines. However, their role in the synthesis of prostaglandins, widely known biochemical mediators that act in a myriad of cell biological processes remain poorly understood. Consequently, in this study a comprehensive investigation at the cellular, biochemical, and molecular levels reveal that KLF11 inhibits prostaglandin E(2) synthesis via transcriptional silencing of the promoter of its biosynthetic enzyme, cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha. Mechanistically, KLF11 accomplishes this function by binding to the promoter via specific GC-rich sites and recruiting the Sin3-histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling complex. Further functional characterization reveals that this function of KLF11 can be reversed by epidermal growth factor receptor-AKT-mediated post-translational modification of threonine 56, a residue within its Sin3-binding domain. This is the first evidence supporting a relevant role for any KLF protein in doing both: transcriptionally inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis and its reversibility by an epidermal growth factor receptor-AKT signaling-mediated posttranslational mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2006648036,"F(1)-ATPase (F(1)), a soluble portion of F(o)F(1)-ATP synthase (F(o)F(1)), is an ATP-driven motor in which gammaepsilon subunits rotate in the alpha(3)beta(3) cylinder. Activity of F(1) and F(o)F(1) from Bacillus PS3 is attenuated by the epsilon subunit in an inhibitory extended form. In this study we observed ATP-dependent transition of epsilon in single F(1) molecules from extended form to hairpin form by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The results justify the previous bulk experiments and ensure that fraction of F(1) with hairpin epsilon directly determines the fraction of active F(1) at any ATP concentration. Next, mechanical activation and stiffness of epsilon-inhibited F(1) were examined by the forced rotation of magnetic beads attached to gamma. Compared with ADP inhibition, which is another manner of inhibition, rotation by a larger angle was required for the activation from epsilon inhibition when the beads were forced to rotate to ATP hydrolysis direction, and more torque was required to reach the same rotation angle when beads were forced to rotate to ATP synthesis direction. The results imply that if F(o)F(1) is resting in the epsilon-inhibited state, F(o) motor must transmit to gamma a torque larger than expected from thermodynamic equilibrium to initiate ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068771177,"ATRX belongs to the family of SWI2/SNF2-like ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling molecular motor proteins. Mutations of the human ATRX gene result in a severe genetic disorder termed X-linked alpha-thalassemia mental retardation (ATR-X) syndrome. Here we perform biochemical and genetic analyses of the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of ATRX. The loss of function allele of the Drosophila ATRX/XNP gene is semilethal. Drosophila ATRX is expressed throughout development in two isoforms, p185 and p125. ATRX185 and ATRX125 form distinct multisubunit complexes in fly embryo. The ATRX185 complex comprises p185 and heterochromatin protein HP1a. Consistently, ATRX185 but not ATRX125 is highly concentrated in pericentric beta-heterochromatin of the X chromosome in larval cells. HP1a strongly stimulates biochemical activities of ATRX185 in vitro. Conversely, ATRX185 is required for HP1a deposition in pericentric beta-heterochromatin of the X chromosome. The loss of function allele of the ATRX/XNP gene and mutant allele that does not express p185 are strong suppressors of position effect variegation. These results provide evidence for essential biological functions of Drosophila ATRX in vivo and establish ATRX as a major determinant of pericentric beta-heterochromatin identity."

Another major pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in liver is catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). We have now identified 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell culture model that expresses PEMT endogenously. We have found that PEMT mRNA and protein levels increased dramatically in 3T3-L1 cells upon differentiation to adipocytes. 5'-Deletion analysis of the PEMT promoter-luciferase constructs stably expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes identified a regulatory region between -471 and -371 bp (relative to the transcriptional start site). Competitive and supershift assays demonstrated binding sites for transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 (-408 to -413), and YY1 (-417 to -420). During differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to adipocytes, the amount of Sp1 protein decreased by approximately 50% just prior to activation of PEMT. Transduction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with retrovirus containing Sp1 cDNA demonstrated that Sp1 inhibited PEMT transcriptional activity. Similarly, short hairpin RNA directed against Sp1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes enhanced PEMT transcriptional activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that Sp1 binds to the PEMT promoter, and this interaction decreases upon differentiation to adipocytes. These experiments directly link increased PEMT expression in adipocytes to decreased transcriptional expression of Sp1. In addition, our data established that Sp1 binding was required for tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of Pemt promoter activity."

https://openalex.org/W2009087042,"We shed new light on the expression and function of the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) family, associated with inflammation and hyperalgesia, in human granulocytes. Resting cells expressed constitutive levels of PAR-2 and PAR-3 mRNA but not PAR-1 or PAR-4. Based on flow cytometry, stimulation with opsonized bacteria (Bop) specifically up-regulated cell surface expression of PAR-2 in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner, independent of transcription or de novo protein synthesis. Primary granules were identified as a source of preformed PAR-2 that can readily be mobilized at the surface on fusion with the plasma membrane. Cellular response to PAR-2 activation, measured as changes in intracellular calcium concentration, was enhanced in PAR-2 up-regulated cells. Increase of cell-surface PAR-2 and of cell responsiveness were dependent specifically on the engagement of immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding receptors. Together, our results reveal that mobilization of intracellular granules, in response to Ig-receptor activation, up-regulates PAR-2 surface expression and makes neutrophils more responsive to proteinase activity. This enhanced response to PAR-2 activation indicates that molecular communication between pain and inflammation may be more important than previously believed.—St-Onge, M., Lagarde, S., Laflamme, C, Rollet-Labelle, E., Marois, L., Naccache, P.

After microinjection of Obox4 dsRNA into the cytoplasm of GV oocytes cultured in M16 medium, oocytes were arrested at metaphase I (MI, 77.7%) and metaphase II (MII, 22.3%). Surprisingly, however, 89% of Obox4 RNAitreated oocytes resumed meiosis and developed to MI and MII when cultured in medium containing 0.2 mM 3-isobutyl-1-metyl-xanthine (IBMX), in which untreated oocytes maintain intact GVs. Spindles were aberrant, and chromosomes were severely aggregated with decreased MPF and MAP kinase activities in arrested MI oocytes after exposure to Obox4 RNAi. Oocytes overexpressing Obox4 retained intact GVs when cultured in M16 medium. Taken together, for the first time to our knowledge, these findings indicate that Obox4 plays a key role in the cAMP-dependent signaling cascades that maintain GV arrest.

In this first continuous observation of a biological reaction coordinate from substrate to product, direct spectral markers for two catalytic events are measured: proton abstraction from nucleophilic water by the catalytic base and formation of the inorganic phosphate leaving group. Simultaneous examination of conformational switching in Eg5, in parallel with catalytic steps, shows structural transitions in solution consistent with published crystal structures of the prehydrolytic and ADP-bound states. In addition, we detect structural modifications in the Eg5 motor domain during bond cleavage between the beta- and gamma-phosphates of ATP.
