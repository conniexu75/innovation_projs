https://openalex.org/W2118028844,"RNA sequencing of Burkitt lymphoma tumours allows identification of mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3, its negative regulator ID3 and the cell cycle regulator CCND3; these pathways reveal new targets for potential therapeutic intervention. Although intensive chemotherapy can cure Burkitt’s lymphoma, the associated toxicity means that this treatment is not suitable for more vulnerable patients, such as the elderly or people in developing countries with the endemic form of the disease. This study identifies mutations of the transcription factor TCF3 or its negative regulator ID3 in a high percentage of sporadic cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma and suggests several novel drug targets, including PI(3) kinase and its downstream pathways, B-cell-receptor signalling and cyclin D3/CDK6. Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) can often be cured by intensive chemotherapy, but the toxicity of such therapy precludes its use in the elderly and in patients with endemic BL in developing countries, necessitating new strategies1. The normal germinal centre B cell is the presumed cell of origin for both BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), yet gene expression analysis suggests that these malignancies may use different oncogenic pathways2. BL is subdivided into a sporadic subtype that is diagnosed in developed countries, the Epstein–Barr-virus-associated endemic subtype, and an HIV-associated subtype, but it is unclear whether these subtypes use similar or divergent oncogenic mechanisms. Here we used high-throughput RNA sequencing and RNA interference screening to discover essential regulatory pathways in BL that cooperate with MYC, the defining oncogene of this cancer. In 70% of sporadic BL cases, mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A) or its negative regulator ID3 fostered TCF3 dependency. TCF3 activated the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway in BL, in part by augmenting tonic B-cell receptor signalling. In 38% of sporadic BL cases, oncogenic CCND3 mutations produced highly stable cyclin D3 isoforms that drive cell cycle progression. These findings suggest opportunities to improve therapy for patients with BL."
https://openalex.org/W2003266704,"Richard O'Connell and colleagues report the genomes and transcriptomes of two Colletotrichum plant fungal pathogens. C. higginsianum infects Arabidopsis thaliana, and C. graminicola infects maize (Zea mays); comparative genomics in both species lead to molecular insights into the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic life stages. Colletotrichum species are fungal pathogens that devastate crop plants worldwide. Host infection involves the differentiation of specialized cell types that are associated with penetration, growth inside living host cells (biotrophy) and tissue destruction (necrotrophy). We report here genome and transcriptome analyses of Colletotrichum higginsianum infecting Arabidopsis thaliana and Colletotrichum graminicola infecting maize. Comparative genomics showed that both fungi have large sets of pathogenicity-related genes, but families of genes encoding secreted effectors, pectin-degrading enzymes, secondary metabolism enzymes, transporters and peptidases are expanded in C. higginsianum. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed that these genes are transcribed in successive waves that are linked to pathogenic transitions: effectors and secondary metabolism enzymes are induced before penetration and during biotrophy, whereas most hydrolases and transporters are upregulated later, at the switch to necrotrophy. Our findings show that preinvasion perception of plant-derived signals substantially reprograms fungal gene expression and indicate previously unknown functions for particular fungal cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1998628114,"Previous imaging and postmortem studies have reported a lower brain volume and a smaller size and density of neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). These findings suggest that synapse number and function are decreased in the dlPFC of patients with MDD. However, there has been no direct evidence reported for synapse loss in MDD, and the gene expression alterations underlying these effects have not been identified. Here we use microarray gene profiling and electron microscopic stereology to reveal lower expression of synaptic-function–related genes (CALM2, SYN1, RAB3A, RAB4B and TUBB4) in the dlPFC of subjects with MDD and a corresponding lower number of synapses. We also identify a transcriptional repressor, GATA1, expression of which is higher in MDD and that, when expressed in PFC neurons, is sufficient to decrease the expression of synapse-related genes, cause loss of dendritic spines and dendrites, and produce depressive behavior in rat models of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2001704867,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited congenital malformation disorder, caused by mutations in the cohesin-loading protein NIPBL for nearly 60% of individuals with classical CdLS, and by mutations in the core cohesin components SMC1A (~5%) and SMC3 (<1%) for a smaller fraction of probands. In humans, the multisubunit complex cohesin is made up of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and a STAG protein. These form a ring structure that is proposed to encircle sister chromatids to mediate sister chromatid cohesion and also has key roles in gene regulation. SMC3 is acetylated during S-phase to establish cohesiveness of chromatin-loaded cohesin, and in yeast, the class I histone deacetylase Hos1 deacetylates SMC3 during anaphase. Here we identify HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase, as well as loss-of-function HDAC8 mutations in six CdLS probands. Loss of HDAC8 activity results in increased SMC3 acetylation and inefficient dissolution of the ‘used’ cohesin complex released from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase. SMC3 with retained acetylation is loaded onto chromatin, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites that results in a consistent pattern of altered transcription seen in CdLS cell lines with either NIPBL or HDAC8 mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2162234852,"Bacterial attachment and biofilm formation are problematic for medical devices. Hook et al. present a high-throughput method to find materials that resist bacterial attachment and colonization. Bacterial attachment and subsequent biofilm formation pose key challenges to the optimal performance of medical devices. In this study, we determined the attachment of selected bacterial species to hundreds of polymeric materials in a high-throughput microarray format. Using this method, we identified a group of structurally related materials comprising ester and cyclic hydrocarbon moieties that substantially reduced the attachment of pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli). Coating silicone with these 'hit' materials achieved up to a 30-fold (96.7%) reduction in the surface area covered by bacteria compared with a commercial silver hydrogel coating in vitro, and the same material coatings were effective at reducing bacterial attachment in vivo in a mouse implant infection model. These polymers represent a class of materials that reduce the attachment of bacteria that could not have been predicted to have this property from the current understanding of bacteria-surface interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2112159040,"The RNA-mediated disease model for myotonic dystrophy (DM) proposes that microsatellite C(C)TG expansions express toxic RNAs that disrupt splicing regulation by altering MBNL1 and CELF1 activities. While this model explains DM manifestations in muscle, less is known about the effects of C(C)UG expression on the brain. Here, we report that Mbnl2 knockout mice develop several DM-associated central nervous system (CNS) features including abnormal REM sleep propensity and deficits in spatial memory. Mbnl2 is prominently expressed in the hippocampus and Mbnl2 knockouts show a decrease in NMDA receptor (NMDAR) synaptic transmission and impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity. While Mbnl2 loss did not significantly alter target transcript levels in the hippocampus, misregulated splicing of hundreds of exons was detected using splicing microarrays, RNA-seq, and HITS-CLIP. Importantly, the majority of the Mbnl2-regulated exons examined were similarly misregulated in DM. We propose that major pathological features of the DM brain result from disruption of the MBNL2-mediated developmental splicing program."
https://openalex.org/W1972916418,"Histone ubiquitylation is a prominent response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but how these modifications are confined to DNA lesions is not understood. Here, we show that TRIP12 and UBR5, two HECT domain ubiquitin E3 ligases, control accumulation of RNF168, a rate-limiting component of a pathway that ubiquitylates histones after DNA breakage. We find that RNF168 can be saturated by increasing amounts of DSBs. Depletion of TRIP12 and UBR5 allows accumulation of RNF168 to supraphysiological levels, followed by massive spreading of ubiquitin conjugates and hyperaccumulation of ubiquitin-regulated genome caretakers such as 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, regulatory and proteolytic ubiquitylations are wired in a self-limiting circuit that promotes histone ubiquitylation near the DNA lesions but at the same time counteracts its excessive spreading to undamaged chromosomes. We provide evidence that this mechanism is vital for the homeostasis of ubiquitin-controlled events after DNA breakage and can be subverted during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2096648742,"Decision making is often considered to arise out of contributions from a model-free habitual system and a model-based goal-directed system. Here, we investigated the effect of a dopamine manipulation on the degree to which either system contributes to instrumental behavior in a two-stage Markov decision task, which has been shown to discriminate model-free from model-based control. We found increased dopamine levels promote model-based over model-free choice."

https://openalex.org/W2064790617,"A topographical relationship exists between the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex and the neocortex. However, it is not known how these anatomical connections are utilized during information exchange and behavior. We recorded theta oscillations along the entire extent of the septotemporal axis of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer. While the frequency of theta oscillation remained same along the entire long axis, the amplitude and coherence between recording sites decreased from dorsal to ventral hippocampus (VH). Theta phase shifted monotonically with distance along the longitudinal axis, reaching ∼180° between the septal and temporal poles. The majority of concurrently recorded units were phase-locked to the local field theta at all dorsoventral segments. The power of VH theta had only a weak correlation with locomotion velocity, and its amplitude varied largely independently from theta in the dorsal part. Thus, theta oscillations can temporally combine or segregate neocortical representations along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1994143270,"The prevalence of obesity in older people is the leading cause of metabolic syndromes. Central neurons serving as homeostatic sensors for body-weight control include hypothalamic neurons that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP). Here, we report an age-dependent increase of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in POMC neurons that elevates the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel activity cell-autonomously to silence POMC neurons. Systemic or intracerebral administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin causes weight loss in old mice. Intracerebral rapamycin infusion into old mice enhances the excitability and neurite projection of POMC neurons, thereby causing a reduction of food intake and body weight. Conversely, young mice lacking the mTOR-negative regulator TSC1 in POMC neurons, but not those lacking TSC1 in NPY/AgRP neurons, were obese. Our study reveals that an increase in mTOR signaling in hypothalamic POMC neurons contributes to age-dependent obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1984543978,"Altered metabolism in tumor cells is increasingly recognized as a core component of the neoplastic phenotype. Because p53 has emerged as a master metabolic regulator, we hypothesized that the presence of wild-type p53 in glioblastoma cells could confer a selective advantage to these cells under the adverse conditions of the glioma microenvironment. Here, we report on the effects of the p53-dependent effector Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) on hypoxia-induced cell death. We demonstrate that TIGAR is overexpressed in glioblastomas and that ectopic expression of TIGAR reduces cell death induced by glucose and oxygen restriction. Metabolic analyses revealed that TIGAR inhibits glycolysis and promotes respiration. Further, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was reduced whereas levels of reduced glutathione were elevated in TIGAR-expressing cells. Finally, inhibiting the transketolase isoenzyme transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) by siRNA reversed theses effects of TIGAR. These findings suggest that glioma cells benefit from TIGAR expression by (i) improving energy yield from glucose via increased respiration and (ii) enhancing defense mechanisms against ROS. Targeting metabolic regulators such as TIGAR may therefore be a valuable strategy to enhance glioma cell sensitivity toward spontaneously occurring or therapy-induced starvation conditions or ROS-inducing therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2114750701,"The heartworm Dirofilaria immitis is an important parasite of dogs. Transmitted by mosquitoes in warmer climatic zones, it is spreading across southern Europe and the Americas at an alarming pace. There is no vaccine, and chemotherapy is prone to complications. To learn more about this parasite, we have sequenced the genomes of D. immitis and its endosymbiont Wolbachia. We predict 10,179 protein coding genes in the 84.2 Mb of the nuclear genome, and 823 genes in the 0.9-Mb Wolbachia genome. The D. immitis genome harbors neither DNA transposons nor active retrotransposons, and there is very little genetic variation between two sequenced isolates from Europe and the United States. The differential presence of anabolic pathways such as heme and nucleotide biosynthesis hints at the intricate metabolic interrelationship between the heartworm and Wolbachia. Comparing the proteome of D. immitis with other nematodes and with mammalian hosts, we identify families of potential drug targets, immune modulators, and vaccine candidates. This genome sequence will support the development of new tools against dirofilariasis and aid efforts to combat related human pathogens, the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis and river blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2012579750,"The hippocampus is an integral brain region for affective disorders. TRIP8b knockout mice lacking functional HCN channels as well as both HCN1 and HCN2 knockout mice have been shown to display antidepressant-like behaviors. The mechanisms or brain regions involved in these alterations in behavior, however, are not clear. We developed a lentiviral shRNA system to examine whether knockdown of HCN1 protein in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region is sufficient to produce antidepressant-like effects. We found that knockdown of HCN1 channels increased cellular excitability and resulted in physiological changes consistent with a reduction of I(h). Rats infused with lentiviral shRNA-HCN1 in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region displayed antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like behaviors associated with widespread enhancement of hippocampal activity and upregulation of BDNF-mTOR signaling pathways. Our results suggest that HCN1 protein could be a potential target for treatment of anxiety and depression disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2050208407,"We found that, during the formation of the mouse barrel cortex, NG2 cells received glutamatergic synapses from thalamocortical fibers and preferentially accumulated along septa separating the barrels. Sensory deprivation reduced thalamocortical inputs on NG2 cells and increased their proliferation, leading to a more uniform distribution in the deprived barrels. Thus, early sensory experience regulates thalamocortical innervation on NG2 cells, as well as their proliferation and distribution during development."
https://openalex.org/W2064039937,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan present in most tissue microenvironments that can modulate many cell behaviors, including proliferation, migration, and adhesive proprieties. In contrast with other glycosaminoglycans, which are synthesized in the Golgi, HA is synthesized at the plasma membrane by one or more of the three HA synthases (HAS1–3), which use cytoplasmic UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as substrates. Previous studies revealed the importance of UDP-sugars for regulating HA synthesis. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of UDP-GlcNAc availability and protein glycosylation with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) on HA and chondroitin sulfate synthesis in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells. Glucosamine treatment, which increases UDP-GlcNAc availability and protein O-GlcNAcylation, increased synthesis of both HA and chondroitin sulfate. However, increasing O-GlcNAcylation by stimulation with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate without a concomitant increase of UDP-GlcNAc increased only HA synthesis. We found that HAS2, the main synthase in aortic smooth muscle cells, can be O-GlcNAcylated on serine 221, which strongly increased its activity and its stability (t½ >5 h versus ∼17 min without O-GlcNAcylation). S221A mutation prevented HAS2 O-GlcNAcylation, which maintained the rapid turnover rate even in the presence of GlcN and increased UDP-GlcNAc.

HA is one of the main and ubiquitous constituents of mammalian cellular microenvironments and ECMs. It is formed by the repetition of the disaccharide glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to form large polysaccharides up to 10 MDa (8Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Hyaluronan as an immune regulator in human diseases.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 221-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Although HA has a simple structure without sulfation, branching, epimerization, or a core protein, it has a plethora of effects that include the control of cell growth, migration, and survival, as well as the regulation of developmental and inflammatory processes, and therefore, it is involved in several pathologies. How these functions are orchestrated by HA remains partially unsolved although its molecular mass, its turnover, and its receptors are critical for HA biological activities (9Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Moretto P. Deleonibus S. Dreyfuss J.M. Karousou E. Viola M. Clerici M. Hascall V.C. Ramoni M.F. De Luca G. Passi A.

HA is synthesized by three different isoenzymes (HAS1–3) located in the plasma membrane, whereas HA degradation is mediated by a series of hyaluronidases that produce HA fragments that can modulate inflammation and immune responses (8Jiang D.

HASes polymerize activated sugars (i.e. UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc) onto the reducing end of the HA chain and directly extrude the growing GAG chain into the ECM. Therefore, regulation of HASes, together with HA degradation, are main control points to determine tissue HA content. HASes can be regulated by different mechanisms, including growth factor- and hormone-mediated gene expression, availability of UDP-sugar substrates (11Jokela T.A. Jauhiainen M. Auriola S. Kauhanen M.

Recently, we found that HAS2, but not HAS1 or HAS3, is strictly regulated by the ATP/AMP ratio through AMP-activated protein kinase, the principal energy sensor of the cell (15Vigetti D. Clerici M.

Moreover, as HASes are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and pass through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, their cytosolic domains are exposed to changes in UDP-sugars that can be driven by stresses such as hyperglycemia. For example, mesangial cells dividing in hyperglycemic medium activate HAS2 in intracellular compartments, which initiates ER stress, autophagy, and formation of a monocyte-adhesive HA matrix (16Wang A. de la Motte C. Lauer M. Hascall V. Hyaluronan matrices in pathobiological processes.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia induces vascular damages that are the main complications of diabetic patients. The increased glucose availability induces nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins and lipids, oxidative stress, and protein kinase C activation (17Aronson D. Rayfield E.J.

O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible post-translational modification of serines/threonines that often alternates with protein phosphorylation and is controlled by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc hydrolase (OGA), that can work as nutrient sensors (21Butkinaree C.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4448-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes, and after 6 h, SmGm2 medium was replaced with DMEM (Euroclone) supplemented with 0.2% FBS. After 48 h to induce quiescence, the medium was changed to low glucose (5 mm) DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS, and the cells were treated without or with 2 mm GlcN, 40 μm 6-diazo-5-oxo-leucine (DON), 5 mm alloxan, 100 μm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAC), or 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) for 24 h (all from Sigma) to modulate protein O-GlcNAcylation (26Raman P.

In some experiments, NIH3T3 cells were used and grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Glutamax (Lonza). After preliminary experiments, a final concentration of 4 mm GlcN, 150 μm PUGNAC, or 40 μm DON was used for 24 h. For stable transfections, human HAS2 with an N-terminal c-Myc tag in pcDNA3 (c-Myc-HAS2) was transfected in NIH3T3 cells using Exgen 500 (Fermentas), and clones were selected in 400 μg/ml G-418 (Euroclone). Expression levels were assayed by Western blots with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the HAS2 S221A mutation following the manufacturer's instruction. HA and chondroitin sulfate (CS) released into the culture medium were purified by proteinase K (Finnzymes) and ethanol precipitation. Streptococcus dysgalactiae hyaluronidase and chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) were used to obtain the unsaturated Δdisaccharides that were fluoro-tagged with 2-aminoacridone and quantified by HPLC analyses or PAGE of fluorophore-labeled saccharides (PAGEFS) (27Karousou E.G.

Western blot experiments were done with the monoclonal antibody CTD110.6 (Sigma) that detects O-GlcNAcylated proteins, with polyclonal antibody against GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with a monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma) as a control. In some experiments the anti-c-Myc antibody was also used to detect recombinant c-Myc-HAS2 fusion protein. Confluent quiescent AoSMCs were scratched by the pipette tip and then cultured in different conditions. Migrated cells were quantified after 6 h as described previously (29Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. The effects of 4-methylumbelliferone on hyaluronan synthesis, MMP2 activity, proliferation, and motility of human aortic smooth muscle cells.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Monocyte adhesive properties of AoSMCs in different conditions were tested with U937 monocyte adhesion assays. This experiment was done essentially as described previously (29Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. The effects of 4-methylumbelliferone on hyaluronan synthesis, MMP2 activity, proliferation, and motility of human aortic smooth muscle cells.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with the exception that the binding phase of monocytes with AoSMCs was done at 37 °C for 1 h. To quantify the pericellular HA coat, particle exclusion assays using paraformaldehyde-fixed human red blood cells were done on untreated and treated AoSMCs as described previously (15Vigetti D. Clerici M. Deleonibus S. Karousou E. Viola M. Moretto P. Heldin P. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A.

NIH3T3 cells were transfected by using cationic linear polyethyleneimine Exgen 500 (Fermentas), which ensured high transfection efficiency with low toxicity when used with cell lines. Primary AoSMCs were nucleofected by using Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza) to have a transfection efficiency of about 60% as described previously (5Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell migration during in vitro aging.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for 6myc-HAS2, OGT, or empty vector (pcDNA3) were used in both transfection and nucleofection experiments. The next day, cells were treated to modulate protein O-GlcNAcylation, and after 24 h of incubation, growth medium was removed, and the cells were scraped in Lysis Buffer (10 mm Tris, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The crude membrane preparations were incubated in ice for 5 min and sonicated, and protein contents were quantified by using the Bradford assay (Sigma). 100 μg of total proteins were incubated with 100 μl of WGA-conjugated agarose beads (Vector Laboratories) or, as binding control, with unconjugated agarose beads. The preparations were rotated for 20 h at 4 °C. The WGA-conjugated beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer containing 20 mm GlcNAc to remove nonspecific binding as described previously (30Noach N. Segev Y. Levi I. Segal S. Priel E. Modification of topoisomerase I activity by glucose and by O-GlcNAcylation of the enzyme protein.Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immobilized glycoproteins were then eluted by incubating with 1 m GlcN. Eluted proteins were denatured by boiling before polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blot analyses were done to identify eluted proteins. The quantification of HAS enzymatic activity was done with microsomes prepared from NIH3T3 cells, as described previously (31Vigetti D. Genasetti A. Karousou E. Viola M. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Moretto P. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. Modulation of hyaluronan synthase activity in cellular membrane fractions.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30684-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and was also done with proteins eluted from WGA-agarose beads. In some experiments, microsomes were pretreated with active jack bean N-acetylglucosaminidase (GlcNAcase) (Sigma) or with heat-inactivated GlcNAcase prior to determining HAS activity. Stably transfected clones with high expression of c-Myc-HAS2 were selected by growing transfected NIH3T3 cells in the presence of 400 μg/ml of G418 (Euroclone) as described elsewhere (32Badi I. Cinquetti R. Frascoli M. Parolini C. Chiesa G. Taramelli R. Acquati F. Intracellular ANKRD1 protein levels are regulated by 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They were then plated 24 h prior to treatment with 150 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), GlcN, PUGNAC, or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 5 μm. At different time points, Western blot analyses were done as described above to detect the time decay of c-Myc-HAS2. Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software following normalization with tubulin levels, and first order decay was assumed to calculate protein half-lives (33Belle A. Tanay A. Bitincka L. Shamir R. O'Shea E.K. Quantification of protein half-lives in the budding yeast proteome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13004-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Stable NIH3T3 cell lines overexpressing wild type or S221A c-Myc-HAS2 were grown in the presence or absence of 150 μm PUGNAC, and cells were lysed by using a Mem-PER kit (Pierce). The lysates were dialyzed with M-PER buffer (Pierce) as described previously to immunoprecipitate the Wnt receptor Frizzled-7, a multipass transmembrane protein as are HASes (34Fujii N. You L. Xu Z. Uematsu K. Shan J. He B. Mikami I. Edmondson L.R. Neale G. Zheng J. Guy R.K. Jablons D.M. An antagonist of disheveled protein-protein interaction suppresses β-catenin-dependent tumor cell growth.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). IP was done by using an anti-c-Myc IP kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The precipitate samples were analyzed by Western blot by using CDT110.6, anti-c-Myc, and anti-HAS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Statistical analysis of the data were done using analysis of variance, followed by post hoc tests (Bonferroni) using Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab). Probability values of p < 0.01 or 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Experiments were repeated three times, each time in duplicate, and data are expressed as means ± S.E. The cytosolic concentration of UDP-GlcNAc is strictly regulated, and the complex pathway (i.e. HBP) and its key points are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to synthesis of glycoconjugates, UDP-GlcNAc is a substrate for the intracellular OGT, which produces O-GlcNAcylated proteins, and this covalent post-translational modification controls several aspects of cell biology. To investigate a possible control of GAG synthesis by O-GlcNAcylation, we cultured AoSMCs in complete high glucose (25 mm) medium (i.e. SmGm2 with 5% FBS) up to 80% of confluence in 6-well plates. Quiescence was then induced by incubating the cells in DMEM and lowering the FBS concentration to 0.2%. After 48 h of incubation, AoSMCs were incubated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS in 17.5 mm of glucose and treated with 2 mm GlcN, which is known to induce protein O-GlcNAcylation in the same cells (26Raman P. Krukovets I. Marinic T.E. Bornstein P. Stenina O.I. Glycosylation mediates up-regulation of a potent antiangiogenic and proatherogenic protein, thrombospondin-1, by glucose in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5704-5714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 2), several O-GlcNAcylated proteins were detected by Western blotting after GlcN treatment by using the specific monoclonal antibody CTD110.6 that recognizes O-GlcNAcylated proteins. We were able to reduce O-GlcNAcylation by treating AoSMCs with GlcN in the presence of alloxan, which inhibits OGT (Fig. 2A, lane 5, for a schematic view of GAG synthesis reactions and inhibitors used, see Fig. 1). In contrast, O-GlcNAcylation was not reduced when GlcN was added with DON to the level for treatment with DON alone (Fig. 2A, lane 7, compared with lane 6), which acts upstream from the GlcN entry point by inhibiting glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Treatments with alloxan or DON in the absence of GlcN were similar to the untreated culture control with near absence of O-GlcNAcylated proteins (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6 compared with lane 1). Moreover, we were also able to increase O-GlcNAcylation by treating AoSMCs with PUGNAC, which inhibits OGA (Fig. 2A, lane 3) and would increase O-GlcNAcylation. The HPLC analyses of 2-amidoacridone fluoro-tagged specific lyase digests of GAGs extracted from the conditioned cell medium were quantified to measure the unsaturated disaccharides (Δ) derived from HA, chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate. Treatments with DON and alloxan added separately from GlcN did not statistically modify GAG accumulation (Fig. 2, B–D, lanes 5 and 7), but the same inhibitors with GlcN increased CS significantly and up to levels similar to GlcN alone (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 6 and 8 compared with lane 2). Although HA also increased significantly in the GlcN cultures treated with DON and alloxan, the increase for the GlcN plus alloxan was not as high as the GlcN alone culture (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 8 compared with lane 2). Treatment with PUGNAC gave distinctly different results for HA compared with CS. PUGNAC alone increased HA synthesis to the same level as treatment with GlcN with or without PUGNAC (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4). In contrast, CS synthesis in PUGNAC alone cultures was not statistically different from untreated cultures (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 3 compared with lanes 1), although CS synthesis in the PUGNAC plus GlcN increased to the level of GlcN alone (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 4 compared with lanes 2). Because PUGNAC inhibits OGA, which inhibits the hydrolysis of O-GlcNAc on proteins, these latter results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation may regulate HA synthesis without changing synthesis of CS. SMCs are involved in vascular diseases through their proliferation, intima invasion, and recruitment of immune cells, and HA has a role in this context (25Vigetti D. Viola M. Karousou E. Rizzi M. Moretto P. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. Hyaluronan-CD44-ERK1/2 regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell motility during aging.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4448-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the HA increase due to O-GlcNAcylation could regulate cell migration and adhesiveness. Fig. 3A shows the results of cell migration in scratch tests. The number of migrated AoSMCs significantly increased after treatments with GlcN, DON plus GlcN, and PUGNAC (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 4, and 9 compared with lane 1). Cell migration in AoSMC cultures treated with DON or alloxan alone was the same as migration in control cultures (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 7 compared with lane 1). Cell migration increased significantly in cultures treated with GlcN (Fig. 3A, lane 2 compared with lane 1), and the presence of DON with GlcN also increased migration (lane 4 compared with lane 3). In contrast, cell migration in cultures treated with alloxan in the presence of GlcN was not increased (Fig. 3A, lane 8 compared with lane 7). These results indicate that GlcN treatment can bypass the HBP (GFAT) bloc"
https://openalex.org/W1965651398,"The acquisition of water and nutrients by plant roots is a fundamental aspect of agriculture and strongly depends on root architecture. Root branching and expansion of the root system is achieved through the development of lateral roots and is to a large extent controlled by the plant hormone auxin. However, the pleiotropic effects of auxin or auxin-like molecules on root systems complicate the study of lateral root development. Here we describe a small-molecule screen in Arabidopsis thaliana that identified naxillin as what is to our knowledge the first non-auxin-like molecule that promotes root branching. By using naxillin as a chemical tool, we identified a new function for root cap-specific conversion of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid into the active auxin indole-3-acetic acid and uncovered the involvement of the root cap in root branching. Delivery of an auxin precursor in peripheral tissues such as the root cap might represent an important mechanism shaping root architecture."

Although implicated in controlling synaptic plasticity, their function is not well understood and their expression patterns are debated. We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify.

NMDA receptor calcium supralinearities were imaged in cortical layer 5 neuron boutons Presynaptic NMDA receptor specificity is determined by postsynaptic cell identity Presynaptic NMDA receptors control information flow in neocortical microcircuits The neocortex is strikingly uniform, with extensive repetition of a limited number of circuit motifs (Douglas and Martin, 1998Douglas R. Martin K. Neocortex.in: Shepherd G.M. The Synaptic Organization of the Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 459-509Google Scholar). But neocortical circuits are also highly diverse, consisting of a multitude of cell types with widely differing intrinsic and morphological properties (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A.

In the hippocampus, it was recently reported that postsynaptic molecular properties determine long-term plasticity in certain inhibitory cell types (Nissen et al., 2010Nissen W. Szabo A. Somogyi J.

NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are nonspecific cationic ionotropic glutamate receptors that, in the classical view, play important roles in dendritic integration (Schiller et al., 2000Schiller J. Major G.

NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons.Nature. 2000; 404: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), excitatory transmission (Lisman et al., 2008Lisman J.E. Coyle J.T.

Denk W. Dendritic spines as basic functional units of neuronal integration.Nature. 1995; 375: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Here, the characteristic dual dependence of NMDARs on presynaptically released glutamate and on postsynaptic depolarization is key to their proper functioning in these roles (Ascher and Nowak, 1988Ascher P.

NMDA-receptor activation increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration in cultured spinal cord neurones.Nature. 1986; 321: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar), which means NMDARs need to be located postsynaptically. But there is also increasing evidence for the existence of putatively presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) (Corlew et al., 2008Corlew R. Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E. Philpot B.D. Presynaptic NMDA receptors: newly appreciated roles in cortical synaptic function and plasticity.Neuroscientist. 2008; 14: 609-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), e.g., in spinal cord (Bardoni et al., 2004Bardoni R.

Their presynaptic location, however, is peculiar, as it seems to render, e.g., NMDAR-based detection of coincident activity in connected neurons impossible without additional signaling from the postsynaptic side (Duguid and Sjöström, 2006Duguid I. Sjöström P.J. Novel presynaptic mechanisms for coincidence detection in synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This suggests that preNMDARs may also serve other, presently unknown functions, pertinent to the functioning of the microcircuit. An important step toward understanding the functional roles of preNMDARs is to elucidate precisely where they are expressed, since a specific localization of presynaptic NMDARs to certain subsets of synapses in the microcircuit would indicate that these receptors are not there by chance, but because they are dedicated to a function in the local circuit. Directly visualizing preNMDARs, however, has proven complicated, resulting in contradictory results and disagreement (Christie and Jahr, 2009Christie J.M. Jahr C.E.

Electrophysiology experiments suggest that the expression of presynaptic NMDARs is pathway specific, with prominent expression at the L4-L2/3 path, but not at L4-L4 or L2/3-L2/3 connections (Brasier and Feldman, 2008Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E. Synapse-specific expression of functional presynaptic NMDA receptors in rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, internal blockade of NMDARs in recordings of monosynaptically connected L4-L2/3 pairs strongly suggest that these receptors are indeed presynaptic (Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008Rodríguez-Moreno A. Paulsen O. Spike timing-dependent long-term depression requires presynaptic NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 744-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In a recent study, however, dendritic, but not axonal, NMDAR-mediated calcium transients could be directly visualized in L5 PCs (Christie and Jahr, 2009Christie J.M. Jahr C.E. Selective expression of ligand-gated ion channels in L5 pyramidal cell axons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), perhaps suggesting that, although preNMDARs are indeed located in presynaptic neurons, they are in dendrites but not axons (Christie and Jahr, 2008Christie J.M. Jahr C.E. Dendritic NMDA receptors activate axonal calcium channels.Neuron. 2008; 60: 298-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Christie and Jahr, 2009Christie J.M. Jahr C.E. Selective expression of ligand-gated ion channels in L5 pyramidal cell axons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the detailed localization and functional role of preNMDARs in local circuits of neocortical layer 5. We employ targeted paired recordings with mouse transgenics, two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) of calcium signals and cell morphology, neurotransmitter uncaging, and computer simulations. We find that postsynaptic cell identity specifically determines whether functional preNMDARs are found in axonal compartments, which generate heterogeneity in synaptic terminals that may explain why these receptors have previously been difficult to detect. We also find that preNMDARs control short-term plasticity at some synapse types within L5. Finally, we propose that preNMDARs are ideally positioned to specifically control information flow in local neocortical circuits during high-frequency firing. Prior studies in rat neocortex indicate that blockade of preNMDARs results in a reversible reduction of excitatory neurotransmission at monosynaptic connections between L5 PCs (Sjöström et al., 2003Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), as well as at the L4-L2/3 path (Bender et al., 2006Bender V.A. Bender K.J. Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E. Two coincidence detectors for spike timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4166-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). L4-L4 and L2/3-L2/3 connections, however, do not respond to preNMDAR blockade (Brasier and Feldman, 2008Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E. Synapse-specific expression of functional presynaptic NMDA receptors in rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that preNMDAR expression may be pathway specific. To investigate whether preNMDARs are differentially expressed in L5, we examined in mouse visual cortex the effect of the NMDAR antagonist AP5 on monosynaptic connections from L5 PCs onto L5 INs targeted based on their distinct small rounded somata (Figure 1A). Although AP5 reliably suppressed 30 Hz excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) trains at PC-PC connections (Sjöström et al., 2003Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), PC-IN connections were consistently unaffected (Figures 1B and 1C). The AP5-mediated suppression at PC-PC connections significantly altered the paired-pulse ratio (ΔPPR; Figure 1D), indicative of a presynaptic locus of this effect. In agreement, analysis of the coefficient of variation (CV; Figure 1E) gave rise to data points below the diagonal, which also suggests that the effect is presynaptic (cf. Sjöström et al., 2007Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Multiple forms of long-term plasticity at unitary neocortical layer 5 synapses.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CV and PPR at PC-IN connections, however, were unaffected by AP5 (Figures 1D and 1E). Similar results were obtained with the GluN2B-specific antagonist Ro 25-6981 for EPSP trains onto PCs (see Figure S1 available online) (Sjöström et al., 2003Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In summary, we found that AP5 reversibly suppressed excitatory high-frequency neurotransmission, as previously shown (Bender et al., 2006Bender V.A. Bender K.J. Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E. Two coincidence detectors for spike timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4166-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar; Brasier and Feldman, 2008Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E.

Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, AP5 had no effect on excitatory inputs onto INs. This differential effect of AP5 was observed even when the postsynaptic PC and IN shared the same presynaptic PC (Figures 1A and 1B). Since the putative synaptic contacts of these connected pairs are interspersed along the presynaptic axon (Figure 1A), it seems unlikely that blockade of dendritic NMDARs in the presynaptic PC can explain these findings (Christie and Jahr, 2008Christie J.M. Jahr C.E. Dendritic NMDA receptors activate axonal calcium channels.Neuron. 2008; 60: 298-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Christie and Jahr, 2009Christie J.M. Jahr C.E. Selective expression of ligand-gated ion channels in L5 pyramidal cell axons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A more parsimonious explanation is that the NMDARs in question are located near PC-PC, but not PC-IN, synaptic terminals. Nonpostsynaptic NMDARs could be located close to synaptic terminals in two ways: either they are in the axon near the presynaptic terminal, or they reside in nearby compartments of a third cell type such as interneurons or glia (Dityatev and Rusakov, 2011Dityatev A. Rusakov D.A. Molecular signals of plasticity at the tetrapartite synapse.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar; Duguid and Sjöström, 2006Duguid I. Sjöström P.J. Novel presynaptic mechanisms for coincidence detection in synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the latter scenario would require transsynaptic signaling (Duguid and Sjöström, 2006Duguid I. Sjöström P.J. Novel presynaptic mechanisms for coincidence detection in synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), distal processes of mouse neocortical astrocytes do express NMDARs (Schipke et al., 2001Schipke C.G. Ohlemeyer C. Matyash M. Nolte C. Kettenmann H. Kirchhoff F. Astrocytes of the mouse neocortex express functional N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1270-1272PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we did paired recordings with internal MK801 in pre- or postsynaptic PCs (Figure 2A), as this drug blocks NMDARs from the inside (Bender et al., 2006Bender V.A. Bender K.J. Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E. Two coincidence detectors for spike timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4166-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar; Brasier and Feldman, 2008Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E.

Spike timing-dependent long-term depression requires presynaptic NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 744-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We found that with presynaptic loading of MK801 in PC-PC pairs, 30 Hz trains of EPSPs were suppressed rapidly after breakthrough. With postsynaptic loading in PC-PC pairs or with presynaptic loading in PC-IN pairs, however, there was no such rapid downregulation of neurotransmission after breakthrough (Figures 2B and 2C). The effect of presynaptic MK801 loading in PC-PC pairs had a presynaptic locus, as assessed by the change in PPR and CV (Figures 2D and 2E). To narrow down the IN cell type, we examined firing pattern, morphology, and synaptic properties (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Anderson S.A. Barrionuevo G. Benavides-Piccione R. Burkhalter A. Buzsáki G. Cauli B. Defelipe J. Fairén A. et al.Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature GroupPetilla terminology: nomenclature of features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). We found a narrow spike width, high spike threshold, and fast, nonaccommodating spiking pattern (Figure S2). PC-IN synapses were short-term depressing, and the morphology remained largely confined to L5 (Figure S2). These characteristics are consistent with the neocortical basket cell (BC) (Kozloski et al., 2001Kozloski J. Hamzei-Sichani F. Yuste R. Stereotyped position of local synaptic targets in neocortex.Science. 2001; 293: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar; Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A.

Cortex. 2002; 12: 936-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the NMDARs regulating neurotransmission are in the presynaptic cell, as previously shown for NMDARs underlying timing-dependent long-term depression (LTD) at L4-L2/3 connections (Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008Rodríguez-Moreno A. Paulsen O. Spike timing-dependent long-term depression requires presynaptic NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 744-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our findings also lend additional support to the usage of the CV and PPR analysis methods (used below and in Sjöström et al., 2003Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, Sjöström et al., 2007Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Multiple forms of long-term plasticity at unitary neocortical layer 5 synapses.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). If preNMDARs are located in synaptic terminals, it should be possible to image NMDAR-evoked bouton calcium transients with 2PLSM. NMDARs are maximally activated when simultaneously glutamate bound and depolarized (Ascher and Nowak, 1988Ascher P. Nowak L. The role of divalent cations in the N-methyl-D-aspartate responses of mouse central neurones in culture.J. Physiol. 1988; 399: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar; MacDermott et al., 1986MacDermott A.B. Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Smith S.J. Barker J.L. NMDA-receptor activation increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration in cultured spinal cord neurones.Nature. 1986; 321: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). We therefore developed an uncaging protocol relying on this key property and tested it on dendritic NMDARs of PCs. MNI-caged NMDA or glutamate was locally puffed and uncaged with brief pulses from a violet solid-state laser, while depolarization was provided by 30 Hz trains of five action potentials (APs; see Experimental Procedures). When these two stimuli were combined, we unsurprisingly obtained supralinear calcium signals in PC dendrites (Figures 3A–3F) (Yuste and Denk, 1995Yuste R. Denk W. Dendritic spines as basic functional units of neuronal integration.Nature. 1995; 375: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). As a control, the supralinearity predictably disappeared when the caged compound was removed (Figures 3D and 3E). To show specificity, we repeatedly uncaged MNI-NMDA onto cells filled with MK801 and expectedly found that supralinearities were gradually reduced (Figure S3). We next used the same uncaging protocol on PC boutons (Figures 3G–3L) but always with MNI-NMDA. We often found strong supralinearities (Figures 3G–3J), suggesting that there are indeed functional NMDARs in axonal compartments, close to synaptic terminals (Figures 3H and 3I). In many boutons, however, calcium signals summed linearly and were indistinguishable from controls, suggesting that not all boutons contain NMDARs (Figure 3K). In fact, we found pairs of boutons right next to each other, where one had supralinear responses to NMDA and depolarization, but the other one did not (Figure S4). Bouton calcium signal supralinearities seemed to fall into two classes (Figure 3K), suggesting boutons with and without preNMDARs. To independently classify boutons, we employed automated clustering (see Experimental Procedures). This resulted in two classes, one of which clustered with control experiments (i.e., absence of supralinearity), in agreement with the view that preNMDAR expression is heterogeneous in L5 PC boutons (Figure 3L), but not in L5 PC dendrites (Figure 3F). In axons, the rate of finding compartments with supralinearities was also lower than in dendrites (12 out of 22 versus 10 out of 10, χ2 test: p < 0.05). We conclude that functional NMDARs are present in L5 PC synaptic terminals but that a substantial subset of boutons does not possess preNMDARs. PreNMDARs residing in L5 PC synaptic terminals might function as glutamate autoreceptors that are activated during high-frequency firing (Duguid and Sjöström, 2006Duguid I. Sjöström P.J. Novel presynaptic mechanisms for coincidence detection in synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar; Sjöström et al., 2003Sjöström P.J.

Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we imaged bouton calcium signals while locally puffing the NMDAR antagonist AP5 (Figure 4). To account for tissue movements resulting from the puff, we used frame scans and automated image registration to realign imaging data (see Experimental Procedures). In keeping with uncaging experiments, NMDAR blockade resulted in significant suppression of bouton calcium transients (Figure 4C). As with the uncaging experiments (Figure S4), we occasionally found boutons right next to each other where one had NMDAR-mediated responses, but the other did not (Figures 4A and 4B). The rates of finding boutons with NMDARs using the AP5 puff and MNI-NMDA uncaging methods were indistinguishable (8 of 21 versus 12 out of 22, χ2 test: p = 0.28). In summary, the existence of preNMDARs in axonal compartments most parsimoniously explains our imaging results (Figures 3 and 4), as well as the effect of loading MK801 presynaptically (Figure 2). The heterogeneity of preNMDAR expression demonstrated by our 2PLSM experiments is consistent with PC-PC, but not PC-IN, connections possessing preNMDARs (Figure 1). Since all the INs that we examined appeared to be BCs (Figures 1, 2, and S2), we wanted to investigate which neocortical IN types possess preNMDARs at their excitatory inputs. To better identify INs, we used transgenic mice with genetically labeled IN classes (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Anderson S.A. Barrionuevo G. Benavides-Piccione R.

Our hypothesis was that neuronal correlates of metacognition reside in the same brain areas responsible for cognition, including frontal cortex. Recent work demonstrated that nonhuman primates are capable of metacognition, so we recorded from single neurons in the frontal eye field, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and supplementary eye field of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that performed a metacognitive visual-oculomotor task. The animals made a decision and reported it with a saccade, but received no immediate reward or feedback. Instead, they had to monitor their decision and bet whether it was correct. Activity was correlated with decisions and bets in all three brain areas, but putative metacognitive activity that linked decisions to appropriate bets occurred exclusively in the SEF. Our results offer a survey of neuronal correlates of metacognition and implicate the SEF in linking cognitive functions over short periods of time."

https://openalex.org/W1981483733,"Gradients of diverse Wnt proteins regulate development, renewal, and differentiation. Porcupine (PORCN) is a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase that is required for post-translational modification of all Wnts to enable their transport, secretion, and activity. Mutations in PORCN are associated with focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), whereas gene deletion causes embryonic lethality in mice. To study the protein in more detail, zinc finger nucleases were used to edit the PORCN genomic locus, establishing two HT1080 fibrosarcoma clones null for PORCN activity that facilitate the study of PORCN structure and function. We establish that PORCN is a key non-redundant node for the regulation of global Wnt signaling because PORCN null cells are completely incapable of autocrine Wnt signaling. The strength of Wnt signaling is exquisitely sensitive to PORCN expression, with a dynamic range of at least 3 orders of magnitude, suggesting that PORCN activity is a key modulator of all Wnt ligand activity. Consistent with this, we find that multiple FDH-associated mutants have only subtle alterations in enzyme activity yet are associated with a severe FDH phenotype. These studies support an essential regulatory role of PORCN in shaping Wnt signaling gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1987429832,"The mammalian Protocadherin (Pcdh) alpha, beta, and gamma gene clusters encode a large family of cadherin-like transmembrane proteins that are differentially expressed in individual neurons. The 22 isoforms of the Pcdhg gene cluster are diversified into A-, B-, and C-types, and the C-type isoforms differ from all other clustered Pcdhs in sequence and expression. Here, we show that mice lacking the three C-type isoforms are phenotypically indistinguishable from the Pcdhg null mutants, displaying virtually identical cellular and synaptic alterations resulting from neuronal apoptosis. By contrast, mice lacking three A-type isoforms exhibit no detectable phenotypes. Remarkably, however, genetically blocking apoptosis rescues the neonatal lethality of the C-type isoform knockouts, but not that of the Pcdhg null mutants. We conclude that the role of the Pcdhg gene cluster in neuronal survival is primarily, if not specifically, mediated by its C-type isoforms, whereas a separate role essential for postnatal development, likely in neuronal wiring, requires isoform diversity."

https://openalex.org/W2135627331,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating side effect that occurs in many patients undergoing chemotherapy. It is often irreversible and frequently leads to early termination of treatment. In this study, we have identified two compounds, lithium and ibudilast, that when administered as a single prophylactic injection prior to paclitaxel treatment, prevent the development of CIPN in mice at the sensory-motor and cellular level. The prevention of neuropathy was not observed in paclitaxel-treated mice that were only prophylactically treated with a vehicle injection. The coadministration of lithium with paclitaxel also allows for administration of higher doses of paclitaxel (survival increases by 60%), protects against paclitaxel-induced cardiac abnormalities, and, notably, does not interfere with the antitumor effects of paclitaxel. Moreover, we have determined a mechanism by which CIPN develops and have discovered that lithium and ibudilast inhibit development of peripheral neuropathy by disrupting the interaction between paclitaxel, neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1), and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) to prevent treatment-induced decreases in intracellular calcium signaling. This study shows that lithium and ibudilast are candidate therapeutics for the prevention of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy and could enable patients to tolerate more aggressive treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2033455838,"Functional maps in the cerebral cortex reorganize in response to changes in experience, but the synaptic underpinnings remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal cell synapses in mouse barrel cortex can be potentiated upon pairing of whisker-evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) with action potentials (APs). This spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (STD-LTP) was only effective for PSPs evoked by deflections of a whisker in the neuron’s receptive field center, and not its surround. Trimming of all except two whiskers rapidly opened the possibility to drive STD-LTP by the spared surround whisker. This facilitated STD-LTP was associated with a strong decrease in the surrounding whisker-evoked inhibitory conductance and partially occluded picrotoxin-mediated LTP facilitation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that sensory deprivation-mediated disinhibition facilitates STD-LTP from the sensory surround, which may promote correlation- and experience-dependent expansion of receptive fields."

To assess the potential contribution of epigenetic regulation of CRYAA genes relevant to ARC pathogenesis, we evaluated DNA methylation, a tissue-specific genetic modulation that affects gene expression. Reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the expression of CRYAA. Methylation status was analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing of the CpG islands in 15 eyes with age-related nuclear cataracts and 15 control eyes. The demethylating agent zebularine was used to investigate the relationship between hypermethylation of the CpG islands and down-expression of CRYAA. The mRNA and protein levels of CRYAA were significantly reduced in the lens epithelia of age-related nuclear cataract cases vs. age-matched controls, which corresponded to hypermethylation of the CpG island of CRYAA promoter. Treatment with a DNA-demethylating agent was associated with restoration of CRYAA expression. Comparing DNA methylation and mRNA and protein levels revealed significant differences between age-related nuclear cataract and control lenses. The evidence presented suggests that CRYAA undergoes epigenetic repression in the lens epithelia in age-related nuclear cataract.—Zhou, P., Luo, Y., Liu, X., Fan, L., Lu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2068986257,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have long been known as receptors that activate G protein-dependent cellular signaling pathways. In addition to the G protein-dependent pathways, recent reports have revealed that several ligands called ""biased ligands"" elicit G protein-independent and β-arrestin-dependent signaling through GPCRs (biased agonism). Several β-blockers are known as biased ligands. All β-blockers inhibit the binding of agonists to the β-adrenergic receptors. In addition to β-blocking action, some β-blockers are reported to induce cellular responses through G protein-independent and β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways. However, the physiological significance induced by the β-arrestin-dependent pathway remains much to be clarified in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that metoprolol, a β(1)-adrenergic receptor-selective blocker, could induce cardiac fibrosis through a G protein-independent and β-arrestin2-dependent pathway. Metoprolol, a β-blocker, increased the expression of fibrotic genes responsible for cardiac fibrosis in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, metoprolol induced the interaction between β(1)-adrenergic receptor and β-arrestin2, but not β-arrestin1. The interaction between β(1)-adrenergic receptor and β-arrestin2 by metoprolol was impaired in the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5)-knockdown cells. Metoprolol-induced cardiac fibrosis led to cardiac dysfunction. However, the metoprolol-induced fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction were not evoked in β-arrestin2- or GRK5-knock-out mice. Thus, metoprolol is a biased ligand that selectively activates a G protein-independent and GRK5/β-arrestin2-dependent pathway, and induces cardiac fibrosis. This study demonstrates the physiological importance of biased agonism, and suggests that G protein-independent and β-arrestin-dependent signaling is a reason for the diversity of the effectiveness of β-blockers."
https://openalex.org/W2109756604,"Ongoing sensory input is critical for shaping internal representations of the external world. Conversely, a lack of sensory input can profoundly perturb the formation of these representations. The olfactory system is particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, owing to the widespread prevalence of allergic, viral and chronic rhinosinusitis, but how the brain encodes and maintains odor information under such circumstances remains poorly understood. Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate (pattern-based) analyses and psychophysical approaches to show that a 7-d period of olfactory deprivation induces reversible changes in odor-evoked fMRI activity in piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Notably, multivoxel ensemble codes of odor quality in OFC became decorrelated after deprivation, and the magnitude of these changes predicted subsequent olfactory perceptual plasticity. Our findings suggest that transient changes in these key olfactory brain regions are instrumental in sustaining odor perception integrity in the wake of disrupted sensory input."

The average rate of MRSA in S. aureus infections was 52.8% and the trend was stable over the ten years (P value for trend = 0.228). MRSA ocular infections were significantly more common among the patients with healthcare exposure (P = 0.024), but 66.1% (181/274) patients with MRSA ocular infections had no healthcare exposure. The most common clinical presentation for both MRSA and MSSA ocular infections was keratitis; MRSA and MSSA caused a similar disease spectrum except for lid infections. MRSA was significantly more resistant than MSSA to clindamycin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (all P<0.001).We demonstrated a paralleled trend of ocular MRSA infection in a highly prevalent MRSA country by hospital-based survey. Except for lid disorder, MRSA shared similar spectrum of ocular pathology with MSSA. Since S. aureus is a common ocular pathogen, our results raise clinician's attention to the existence of highly prevalent MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W1985714716,"Signals in our brain are in a constant state of competition, including those that vie for motor control, sensory dominance, and awareness. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying neural competition, we exploit binocular rivalry, a phenomenon that allows us to probe the competitive process that ordinarily transpires outside of our awareness. By measuring psychometric functions under different states of rivalry, we discovered a pattern of gain changes that are consistent with a model of competition in which attention interacts with normalization processes, thereby driving the ebb and flow between states of awareness. Moreover, we reveal that attention plays a crucial role in modulating competition; without attention, rivalry suppression for high-contrast stimuli is negligible. We propose a framework whereby our visual awareness of competing sensory representations is governed by a common neural computation: normalization."

Despite extensive structural and functional studies of BAR domains, it is still unknown how exactly these domains interact with the plasma membrane containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and whether they function by a universal mechanism or by different mechanisms. Here we report that PtdIns(4,5)P2 specifically induces partial membrane penetration of the N-terminal amphiphilic α-helix (H0) of two representative N-BAR domains from Drosophila amphiphysin (dAmp-BAR) and rat endophilin A1 (EndoA1-BAR). Our quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis shows that PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent membrane penetration of H0 is important for self-association of membrane-bound dAmp-BAR and EndoA1-BAR and their membrane deformation activity. EndoA1-BAR behaves differently from dAmp-BAR because the former has an additional amphiphilic α-helix that penetrates the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-independent manner. Depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 from the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells abrogated the membrane deforming activity of EndoA1-BAR and dAmp-BAR. Collectively, these studies suggest that the local PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration in the plasma membrane may regulate the membrane interaction and deformation by N-BAR domain-containing proteins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2022347702,"Infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for the development of severe gastritis and gastric cancer (GC). CagA protein is injected into gastric epithelial cells and deregulates a variety of cellular signaling molecules. Phospholipase D (PLD) is elevated in many different types of human cancers and has been implicated as a critical factor in inflammation and carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that infection with cagA-positive H. pylori in GC cells significantly induces PLD1 expression via CagA-dependent activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB). Interestingly, the level of PLD1 protein and IκBα phosphorylation is aberrantly upregulated in H. pylori-infected human GC tissues. Infection with cagA-positive H. pylori and expression of CagA enhanced the binding of NFκB to the PLD1 promoter, and two functional NFκB-binding sites were identified within the PLD1 promoter. Rebamipide, a mucosal-protective antiulcer agent, abolished H. pylori cagA-induced PLD1 expression via inhibition of binding of NFκB to the PLD1 promoter, and also inhibited PLD activity. Moreover, rebamipide suppressed H. pylori-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9, interleukin-8 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression as well as invasion of GC cells through downregulation of PLD1. Our data suggest that H. pylori cagA targets PLD1 for invasion of GC cells, and rebamipide might contribute to the antitumorigenic effect of GC cells via inhibition of the H. pylori cagA-NFκB-PLD1 signaling pathway."

In this study, we found that CaMKII induced by Wnt5a remarkably reduced the protein stability of the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), a co-repressor of Notch signaling, through proteasomal degradation. Wnt5a was found to enhance Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) transcription activity, which could be inhibited by treatment with KN93, a CaMKII inhibitor. The kinase activity of CaMKII was essential for the activation of Notch signaling. We also determined that CaMKII could enhance the association between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk. Furthermore, the physical association between RBP-Jk and SMRT was substantially suppressed by CaMKII. We demonstrated that CaMKII directly bound and phosphorylated SMRT at Ser-1407, thereby facilitating SMRT translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and proteasome-dependent degradation.

Recent studies have emphasized the role of ubiquitination in regulating SMRT stability. The SMRT phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation is an important negative feedback regulation that specifically terminates SMRT activation. Wnt5a is a member of the Wnt family of secreted growth factor, which are 38–45 kDa secreted cysteine-rich proteins with hydrophobic signal peptides (44Nishita M. Enomoto M. Yamagata K. Minami Y.

Wnt5a is a highly conserved diffusible protein whose signal is transduced by Frizzled (Fz) receptors. In addition to Fzs, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1/2 (Ror1/2), which is a single-pass transmembrane receptor with a tyrosine kinase domain, functions as a co-receptor (44Nishita M.

However, the effect of Fzs and Ror1/2 on Wnt5a signaling has not yet been examined. Wnt can be broadly divided into three signaling pathways: the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway (46Veeman M.T.

CaMKII is important for prostate cancer cell survival and promotes their progression to an androgen-independent state (59Rokhlin O.W. Taghiyev A.F. Bayer K.U. Bumcrot D. Koteliansk V.E. Glover R.A.

Furthermore, a recent study has shown that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II regulates notch-1 signaling in prostate cancer cells (60Mamaeva O.A. Kim J. Feng G. McDonald J.M.

Wnt5a is transcribed based on multiple mechanisms, such as NF-κB, Hedgehog, TGF-β, and Notch signaling cascades (61Katoh M. Transcriptional mechanisms of WNT5A based on NF-κB, Hedgehog, TGFβ, and Notch signaling cascades.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2009; 23: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Wnt5a expression in the human cells was induced by coculture and was blocked by γ-secretase inhibition. Likewise, stimulation of Notch signaling by immobilized Jagged-1 promoted Wnt5a expression (62Koyanagi M. Bushoven P. Iwasaki M. Urbich C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Notch signaling contributes to the expression of cardiac markers in human circulating progenitor cells.Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Wnt5a acts as an essential downstream mediator of Notch-CSL signaling, which is dependent on expression in the keratinocyte compartment of FoxN1, a gene that plays a key role in hair follicle regulatory function (63Hu B. Lefort K. Qiu W. Nguyen B.C. Rajaram R.D. Castillo E. He F. Chen Y. Angel P. Brisken C. Dotto G.P. Control of hair follicle cell fate by underlying mesenchyme through a CSL-Wnt5a-FoxN1 regulatory axis.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the precise mechanisms underlying the relationship between the Notch1 and Wnt5a-CaMKII signaling pathways are still largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that Wnt-5-induced CaMKII enhances the Notch1 signaling pathway through the down-regulation of SMRT protein stability. CaMKII was shown to phosphorylate SMRT, which disrupts the SMRT-RBP-Jk transcription complex through SMRT protein degradation and polyubiquitination. In addition, the dissociation of SMRT from RBP-Jk provoked by CaMKII activates Hes1 and Hes5 transcriptional activity. The results of this study suggest that CaMKII is crucial for the regulation between Notch and Wnt signaling. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Along with the HEK293 cells, PS1/2+/+ MEF cells and PS1/2−/− MEF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. For plasmid DNA transfection, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, grown overnight, and transfected with the appropriate expression vectors in the presence of the indicated combinations of plasmid DNAs via the calcium phosphate and liposome methods (64Kim M.Y.

The GST-SMRT proteins were then purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of GST or GST-SMRT fusion proteins were incubated with the lysates of HEK293 cells, which had been transfected for 3 h with combinations of expression vectors at 4 °C, with rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and boiled with 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The precipitates were separated via SDS-PAGE, and the pull-down proteins were detected via immunoblotting with specific antibodies. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. After 20 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies coupled to protein A-agarose beads. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Laemmli sample buffer was then added to the immunoprecipitated pellets. The pellets were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was conducted with the indicated antibodies.

In pathogenic bacteria, they are frequently exploited to act as key virulence factors for human diseases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative organism of tuberculosis, secretes a low molecular weight PTP (LMW-PTP), MptpA, which is required for its survival upon infection of host macrophages. Although there is otherwise no sequence similarity of LMW-PTPs to other classes of PTPs, the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) CX(5)R and the loop containing a critical aspartic acid residue (D-loop), required for the catalytic activity, are well conserved. In most high molecular weight PTPs, ligand binding to the P-loop triggers a large conformational reorientation of the D-loop, in which it moves ∼10 Å, from an ""open"" to a ""closed"" conformation. Until now, there have been no ligand-free structures of LMW-PTPs described, and hence the dynamics of the D-loop have remained largely unknown for these PTPs. Here, we present a high resolution solution NMR structure of the free form of the MptpA LMW-PTP. In the absence of ligand and phosphate ions, the D-loop adopts an open conformation. Furthermore, we characterized the binding site of phosphate, a competitive inhibitor of LMW-PTPs, on MptpA and elucidated the involvement of both the P- and D-loop in phosphate binding. Notably, in LMW-PTPs, the phosphorylation status of two well conserved tyrosine residues, typically located in the D-loop, regulates the enzyme activity. PtkA, the kinase complementary to MptpA, phosphorylates these two tyrosine residues in MptpA. We characterized the MptpA-PtkA interaction by NMR spectroscopy to show that both the P- and D-loop form part of the binding interface."

Blo t 21 has moderate sequence identity (40.7%) to Blo t 5 and low to moderate cross-reactivity to Blo t 5. In B. tropicalis, the most prevalent and allergenic allergens are in the order of Blo t 21, Blo t 5, and Blo t 7. Here, we determined the NMR solution structure of Blo t 21, which represents the first structure of the group 21 dust mite allergen. The structure of Blo t 21 closely resembles the structures of Blo t 5 and Der p 5, comprising three anti-parallel α-helices arranged in a helical bundle. Using site-directed mutagenesis and specific IgE binding ELISA, Blo t 21 was found to contain both conserved and unique charged IgE epitope residues at the L2 loop region and on helix α3. Cross-inhibition assays confirmed that Blo t 21 has a low to moderate cross-reactivity with Blo t 5 and Der p 5 and represents a novel group of major allergen in B. tropicalis. In addition to group 5 allergens, Blo t 21 has also a low to moderate cross-reactivity with group 21 allergens from Dermatophagoides mites, confirming that B. tropicalis is a major and distinct source of dust mite allergens."
https://openalex.org/W2029204162,"Light-evoked responses of all three major classes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are mediated by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Although synaptic activity at RGC synapses is highly dynamic, synaptic plasticity has not been observed in adult RGCs. Here, using patch-clamp recordings in dark-adapted mouse retina, we report a retina-specific form of AMPAR plasticity. Both chemical and light activation of NMDARs caused the selective endocytosis of GluA2-containing, Ca(2+)-impermeable AMPARs on RGCs and replacement with GluA2-lacking, Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs. The plasticity was expressed in ON but not OFF RGCs and was restricted solely to the ON responses in ON-OFF RGCs. Finally, the plasticity resulted in a shift in the light responsiveness of ON RGCs. Thus, physiologically relevant light stimuli can induce a change in synaptic receptor composition of ON RGCs, providing a mechanism by which the sensitivity of RGC responses may be modified under scotopic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2075910346,"Phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) is a G-protein-regulated enzyme whose activity results in proliferative and mitogenic changes in the cell. We have previously found that in solution PLCβ1 binds to the RNA processing protein translin-associated factor X (TRAX) with nanomolar affinity and that this binding competes with G proteins. Here, we show that endogenous PLCβ1 and TRAX interact in SK-N-SH cells and also in HEK293 cells induced to overexpress PLCβ1. In HEK293 cells, TRAX overexpression ablates Ca(2+) signals generated by G protein-PLCβ1 activation. TRAX plays a key role in down-regulation of proteins by small, interfering RNA, and PLCβ1 overexpression completely reverses the 2- to 4-fold down-regulation of GAPDH by siRNA in HEK293 and HeLa cells as seen by an ∼4-fold recovery in both the transcript and protein levels. Also, down-regulation of endogenous PLCβ1 in HEK293 and HeLa cells allows for an ∼20% increase in siRNA(GAPDH) silencing. While PLCβ1 overexpression results in a 50% reversal of cell death caused by siRNA(LDH), it does not affect cell survival or silencing of other genes (e.g., cyclophilin, Hsp90, translin). PLCβ1 overexpression in HEK293 and HeLa cells causes a 30% reduction in the total amount of small RNAs. LDH and GAPDH are part of a complex that promotes H2B synthesis that allows cells to progress through the S phase. We find that PLCβ1 reverses the cell death and completely rescues H2B levels caused by siRNA knockdown of LDH or GAPDH. Taken together, our study shows a novel role of PLCβ1 in gene regulation through TRAX association."

Although it is well established that visual experience and neural activity are critical for the refinement of retinal circuits, whether and how LTP occurs in the retina remain unknown. Using in vivo perforated whole-cell recording and two-photon calcium imaging, we find that both repeated electrical and visual stimulations can induce LTP at excitatory synapses formed by bipolar cells on retinal ganglion cells in larval but not juvenile zebrafish. LTP induction requires the activation of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and its expression involves arachidonic acid-dependent presynaptic changes in calcium dynamics and neurotransmitter release.

Whether LTP also exists in the developing or mature retina remains unclear. However, mounting evidence has shown that both visual experience and neural activity are required for the normal development of retinal circuits (Feller, 2003Feller M.B.

For example chronic pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic neural activity in the developing cat retina prevents the stratification of ON and OFF dendrites of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs; Bodnarenko and Chalupa, 1993Bodnarenko S.R.

Visual deprivation through dark rearing also impairs both the pruning of RGC dendrites and the conversion of bistratifying ON-OFF RGCs into mono-stratifying ON or OFF RGCs in the developing mouse retina (Tian and Copenhagen, 2001Tian N.

Tian N. Retinal ganglion cell dendrites undergo a visual activity-dependent redistribution after eye opening.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 503: 244-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies further reveal that interference with synaptic transmission of bipolar cells (BCs) to RGCs not only reduces the growth of synapses formed by BC axon terminals on RGC dendrites (Kerschensteiner et al., 2009Kerschensteiner D. Morgan J.L. Parker E.D. Lewis R.M. Wong R.O.L. Neurotransmission selectively regulates synapse formation in parallel circuits in vivo.Nature. 2009; 460: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) but also impairs the specificity of these synapses (Morgan et al., 2011Morgan J.L. Soto F. Wong R.O. Kerschensteiner D. Development of cell type-specific connectivity patterns of converging excitatory axons in the retina.Neuron. 2011; 71: 1014-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that activity-dependent long-term synaptic modification exists in the developing retina and is responsible for the refinement of developing retinal circuits. Using in vivo perforated whole-cell recording and G-CaMP-based time-lapse two-photon calcium imaging, we test this hypothesis in the retina of zebrafish larvae especially at 3–6 days postfertilization (dpf), a period during which the retina undergoes rapid development (Neuhauss, 2003Neuhauss S.C. Behavioral genetic approaches to visual system development and function in zebrafish.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 2010Zhang R.W. Wei H.P. Xia Y.M. Du J.L. Development of light response and GABAergic excitation-to-inhibition switch in zebrafish retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 2557-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that theta-burst stimulation (TBS) can efficiently induce LTP at excitatory synapses formed by BCs on RGCs at 3–6 dpf, but not at 15–20 dpf. This LTP is similar to that induced in other brain regions in both the time course and the dependency on postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The expression of this LTP is accompanied by an increase in the calcium response in the BC axon terminals, and involves an increase in the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, as evidenced by an increase in the frequency but not amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in RGCs and decreases in both the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and coefficient of variation (CV) of electrically evoked EPSCs (e-EPSCs) in RGCs. Arachidonic acid (AA), a candidate retrograde signal, is necessary and sufficient for the presynaptic expression of LTP. We then found that repetitive flash stimulation (RFS) can also induce LTP at the BC-RGC synapse and that this light-induced LTP can occlude TBS-induced LTP. Furthermore, this LTP is functionally important because it causes a persistent increase in light-evoked excitatory responses of RGCs. Finally, both repetitive flash and moving bar stimulations (MBSs) can persistently enhance light responses of RGCs, suggesting that visual experience is effective in modifying the function of developing retinal circuits. Thus, our study provides evidence for the existence, mechanism, and functional importance of LTP in the retina. Perforated whole-cell recordings were made from RGCs after surgical removal of lens in intact zebrafish larvae aged between 3 and 6 dpf (Figure 1A; Zhang et al., 2010Zhang R.W. Wei H.P. Xia Y.M. Du J.L. Development of light response and GABAergic excitation-to-inhibition switch in zebrafish retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 2557-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Retinal lamination could be clearly visualized under bright-field illumination, and the morphology of individual RGCs was revealed by intracellular loading of lucifer yellow via the recording pipette (Figure 1B). By holding the cell at the reversal potential of Cl− (ECl−, −60mV), we monitored e-EPSCs of RGCs in response to extracellular stimulation at BC soma in the inner nuclear layer (INL). The stimulation was delivered through a theta glass electrode at an interval of 30 s. Consistent with the existence of two components of transmitter release at ribbon synapses formed by BCs on RGCs in the goldfish (Sakaba et al., 1997Sakaba T. Tachibana M. Matsui K. Minami N.

Submillisecond kinetics of glutamate release from a sensory synapse.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1177-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we found that e-EPSCs of zebrafish RGCs exhibited two peaks, with the appearance of the second peak at high stimulus intensity (see Figure S1A available online). The onset latency (time to peak) of the first peak (12.7 ± 0.4 ms, obtained from 316 cells) was more consistent than that of the second peak (125.5 ± 4.4 ms, obtained from 173 cells; Figure S1B). These e-EPSCs were mainly mediated by the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors (AMPARs) because they were abolished by the AMPAR antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 50 μM; Figures S1C and S1D). The existence of postsynaptic NMDARs at these BC-RGC synapses was indicated by the requirement of both CNQX and the NMDAR antagonist D-AP5 (D(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, 50 μM) to abolish the e-EPSCs when the RGC was voltage clamped at +50mV (Figure S1C). To induce LTP, we applied TBS consisting of eight trains (spaced by 200 ms) of five pulses at 100 Hz, with the RGC held in current clamp (c.c.). As shown by the example recording in Figures 1C and 1D, we found that a persistent increase in the amplitude of both peaks of e-EPSCs appeared after TBS and lasted for more than 45 min. The results from all experiments showed consistent enhancement of both peaks of e-EPSCs for as long as stable recording could be made (“TBS (c.c.)”; Figures 1E and 1F). The mean amplitude for the first and second peaks of e-EPSCs during 10–40 min after TBS was 177% ± 15% (n = 18; p = 0.002) or 150% ± 13% (n = 10; p = 0.003) of the mean control values observed before TBS, respectively. In the following analysis we focused on the first peak because the second peak did not always appear (Figure S1A). No change in the amplitude of both peaks in e-EPSCs was observed in the absence of TBS (“No TBS”; Figures 1E and 1F). To examine whether LTP can occur at relatively mature retinae, we performed similar experiments in zebrafish aged between 15 and 20 dpf, during which the zebrafish retina has matured (Neuhauss, 2003Neuhauss S.C. Behavioral genetic approaches to visual system development and function in zebrafish.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We found that TBS could not induce persistent enhancement of e-EPSCs in RGCs (94% ± 6% of the control, n = 5; p = 0.35; Figure S2A). Taken together, these results suggest that LTP is more readily induced in the immature zebrafish retina. Next, we examined whether the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs on RGCs is required for the induction of LTP at BC-RGC synapses. First, we found that preventing NMDAR channel opening during TBS by voltage clamping the RGC at a hyperpolarized potential (−90mV) prevented TBS-induced changes in the e-EPSC amplitude in all cases (“TBS (v.c.),” 99% ± 3% of the control, n = 14; Figures 2A and 2D), whereas the same TBS increased the e-EPSC amplitude when the same cell was held in c.c. (“TBS (c.c.)”; Figure 2A). To examine whether the action potential of RGCs is required for the expression of LTP, we applied the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM) and found that the induction of LTP by TBS was not prevented (160% ± 18% of the control, n = 10%; p = 0.009; Figures 2D and S3). Second, bath presence of D-AP5 (50 μM) prevented LTP induction by TBS (100% ± 5% of the control, n = 8; Figures 2B and 2D). Third, intracellular loading of MK-801 (1 mM; Du et al., 2009Du J.L. Wei H.P. Wang Z.R. Wong S.T. Poo M.M. Long-range retrograde spread of LTP and LTD from optic tectum to retina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 18890-18896Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; Humeau et al., 2003Humeau Y. Shaban H. Bissière S. Lüthi A. Presynaptic induction of heterosynaptic associative plasticity in the mammalian brain.Nature. 2003; 426: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), an open-channel blocker of NMDARs, into the RGC via the recording pipette in the breakthrough mode was effective in preventing LTP induction (“MK-801,” 86% ± 12% of the control, n = 8; p = 0.4; Figures 2C and 2D). The absence of LTP was not due to the washout effect of the breakthrough recording because robust LTP could be still induced by TBS under breakthrough recording mode in the absence of MK-801 (“No MK-801,” 149% ± 8% of the control, n = 6; p = 0.00005; Figures 2C and 2D). Therefore, the induction of LTP at BC-RGC synapses requires the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs. To examine possible presynaptic changes after the induction of LTP at BC-RGC synapses, we monitored changes in electrically evoked calcium responses of BC axon terminals after TBS by using in vivo time-lapse two-photon calcium imaging on the double-transgenic zebrafish Tg(Gal4-VP16xfz43,UAS:GCaMP1.6) larvae at 3–6 dpf, in which the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP1.6 is specifically expressed in some BCs (see Experimental Procedures). As shown by the example in Figure 3A, individual axon terminals of BCs could be recognized in both the sublaminae a and b of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). To evoke calcium responses of BC axon terminals, we applied the same extracellular stimulation protocol as that used during e-EPSCs recordings. In addition the stimulating electrode was loaded with fluorescent dextran (500 μg/ml) for visualizing its tip position (red in Figure 3A). In response to extracellular stimulation with a range of intensities used during whole-cell recordings, electrically evoked calcium responses were observed in less than ten BC axon terminals per retina (bottom panel in Figure 3B), and the responses increased in amplitude as stimulation intensity was elevated (Figure S4). Figure 3C shows calcium responses of all five responsive axon terminals in a single retina, and four of them exhibited enhanced responses after TBS. The results from all experiments performed in different retinae showed that TBS induced persistent enhancement of calcium responses of BC axon terminals for more than 30 min (Figure 3D). The mean amplitude of calcium responses during 10–30 min after TBS was 169% ± 16% (n = 20; p = 0.0001) of the mean control value observed before TBS. However, TBS could not induce significant changes in calcium responses of BC axon terminals in zebrafish at 15–20 dpf (Figure S2B), consistent with previous electrophysiological results (Figure S2A). Because presynaptic calcium changes can efficiently lead to changes in neurotransmitter release (Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), our results suggest that presynaptic changes in neurotransmitter release may be involved in the expression of LTP at BC-RGC synapses. To further examine the presynaptic involvement in the LTP expression, we first examined changes in mEPSCs of RGCs before and after LTP induction by TBS when TTX (1 μM) was bath applied. As shown by the example in Figure 4A, an increase in the frequency but not the amplitude of mEPSCs was observed after the TBS, which enhanced the e-EPSCs of the same RGC (compare the top and bottom traces in Figure 4A, right). In total the frequencies of mEPSCs were 5.3 ± 0.7 and 7.3 ± 0.9 Hz before and 10–40 min after LTP induction (n = 10; p = 0.01; Figure 4B), respectively. Meanwhile, the amplitudes of mEPSCs were 4.8 ± 0.7 and 5.1 ± 0.6 pA before and 10–40 min after LTP induction (n = 10; p = 0.1; Figure 4C), respectively. Consistently, similar observations were found for spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) (Figure S5). We then measured the PPR and CV of RGC e-EPSCs, two parameters mainly reflecting properties of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (Faber and Korn, 1991Faber D.S. Korn H.

Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), before and after LTP induction. As shown by the example in Figure 4D, we found that the development of LTP was accompanied by a significant decrease of the PPR, which was measured at an interpulse interval of 1 s (von Gersdorff et al., 1998von Gersdorff H. Sakaba T. Berglund K. Tachibana M. Submillisecond kinetics of glutamate release from a sensory synapse.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1177-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In total the PPRs of RGC e-EPSCs were 0.85 ± 0.12 and 0.62 ± 0.07 before and 10–40 min after LTP induction by TBS (n = 7; p = 0.007; Figures 4E and S6), respectively. Furthermore, the CV of RGC e-EPSCs also showed significant decrease after LTP induction (Before TBS, 0.22 ± 0.02; After TBS, 0.17 ± 0.01; n = 18; p = 0.005; Figure 4F). Taken together, these findings imply that presynaptic change in the probability of neurotransmitter release is involved in the expression of LTP at BC-RGC synapses. The induction of LTP at BC-RGC synapses requires postsynaptic NMDAR activation, whereas its expression involves presynaptic changes. This suggests that retrograde signals are necessary for LTP expression at BC-RGC synapses. AA is postulated as a postsynaptic NMDAR-dependent retrograde signal (Dumuis et al., 1988Dumuis A. Sebben M. Haynes L. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. NMDA receptors activate the arachidonic acid cascade system in striatal neurons.Nature. 1988; 336: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar; Leu and Schmidt, 2008Leu B.H. Schmidt J.T.

Bliss T.V.

Arachidonic acid induces a long-term activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.Nature. 1989; 341: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In zebrafish larvae, postsynaptically released AA can regulate developing refinement of presynaptic axon arborization at retinotectal synapses (Leu and Schmidt, 2008Leu B.H. Schmidt J.T. Arachidonic acid as a retrograde signal controlling growth and dynamics of retinotectal arbors.Dev. Neurobiol. 2008; 68: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine the role of AA in the LTP expression at BC-RGC synapses, we first bath applied arachidonic tri-fluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3, 100 μM), an inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 that is required for AA release from neurons (Leu and Schmidt, 2008Leu B.H. Schmidt J.T. Arachidonic acid as a retrograde signal controlling growth and dynamics of retinotectal arbors.Dev. Neurobiol. 2008; 68: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Sanfeliu et al., 1990Sanfeliu C. Hunt A. Patel A.J. Exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate increases release of arachidonic acid in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and not in astrocytes.Brain Res. 1990; 526: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), to suppress AA release. Pretreatment of AACOCF3 for 30 min efficiently prevented TBS-induced enhancement of RGC e-EPSCs (Figure 5A) and changes in the PPR and CV of RGC e-EPSCs (Figures 5B, 5C, and S7A). Furthermore, AACOCF3 pretreatment also abolished TBS-induced increases of calcium responses in BC axon terminals (n = 34, obtained from four different retinae; Figures 5D and 5E). These results suggest that AA is required for the presynaptic expression of LTP at BC-RGC synapses. Next, we found that perfusion of AA (100 μM) itself for 5 min led to a persistent increase in the amplitude of RGC e-EPSCs for more than 30 min (130% ± 7% of the control, n = 5; p = 0.001; Figure 5F). Similar to TBS-induced LTP, this AA-induced enhancement also involves presynaptic changes because both the PPR and CV of RGC e-EPSCs were also significantly reduced after AA perfusion (compare Figures 5G and 5H with Figures 4E and 4F). The PPR was 0.99 ± 0.09 and 0.81 ± 0.07 before and 10–30 min after AA perfusion (n = 5; p = 0.01; Figures 5G and S7B), respectively, meanwhile the CV was 0.31 ± 0.05 and 0.26 ± 0.06 before and after AA perfusion (n = 5; p = 0.03; Figure 5H), respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that AA is necessary and sufficient for the expression of LTP at BC-RGC synapses. We next examined whether natural visual stimulation can induce LTP at BC-RGC synapses. We found that RFS (100 whole-field flashes with 2 s duration at 0.33 Hz) caused a persistent increase in the efficacy of BC-RGC synapses, as assayed by the amplitude of e-EPSCs in RGCs (Figure 6A). The mean e-EPSC amplitude during 10–35 min after RFS was 140% ± 11% of the control value observed before RFS (“No MK-801,” n = 9; p = 0.005; Figure 6A). This synaptic enhancement persisted for as long as stable recording could be made. Similar to TBS-induced LTP, this RFS-induced LTP at BC-RGC synapses required the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs because intracellular loading of MK-801 (1 mM) into the RGC prevented the LTP induction by RFS (“MK-801,” 93% ± 9% of the control, n = 6; p = 0.74; Figure 6A). In addition both the PPR and CV of the e-EPSC amplitude also showed significant decrease after RFS (Figure 6B). Furthermore, following pre-exposure of the retina to prolonged RFS (Pre-RFS; 0.33 Hz for 30 min), neither TBS nor RFS further elevated the amplitude of e-EPSCs in RGCs (Figure 6C), indicating that RFS-induced synaptic enhancement occludes TBS-induced LTP. These results indicate that repeated visual inputs can induce LTP at BC-RGC synapses via mechanisms that may be shared by TBS-induced LTP. To further determine the physiological consequence of LTP at BC-RGC synapses, we investigated its effect on light-evoked responses in RGCs. In 3–6 dpf zebrafish larvae, whole-field flash (2 s duration) elicited both ON and OFF responses in 61% of RGCs (259 of 425), and only ON (83 of 425) or OFF (83 of 425) responses in the rest of RGCs. Examples of light response subtypes are shown in Figure S8A. To assay light-evoked excitatory responses, we measured light-evoked EPSCs (l-EPSCs) in RGCs at the reversal potential of light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (ECl−; Figures S8B and S8C), with a low frequency of light stimulation (0.033 Hz). The magnitude of l-EPSCs in RGCs, as determined by the total integrated charge associated with l-EPSCs within a 100 ms window after the onset of l-EPSCs (Du et al., 2009Du J.L. Wei H.P. Wang Z.R. Wong S.T. Poo M.M. Long-range retrograde spread of LTP and LTD from optic tectum to retina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 18890-18896Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), remained stable for up to 50 min under control condition (Figure 7A). However, we observed persistent enhancement of light-evoked ON responses in eight out of eight ON-OFF and one out of one ON RGCs (157% ± 17% of the control, n = 9; p = 0.005; Figure 7B) after the induction of LTP at BC-RGC synapses by TBS applied at the INL. In addition, three out of eight ON-OFF RGCs also showed a persistent increase in OFF responses after LTP induction. Thus, the LTP at BC-RGC synapses can substantially enhance light-evoked excitatory responses in RGCs, implicating its physiological relevance to retinal functions during development. To explore whether natural visual stimulation can potentiate visual responses of RGCs, we first examined the effect of RFS on light-evoked responses of RGCs in zebrafish larvae at 3–6 dpf. In nine out of ten RGCs possessing ON responses, RFS induced persistent enhancement of light-evoked ON responses (167% ± 13% of the control, n = 10; p = 0.000007; Figure 8A), whereas five out of eight RGCs possessing OFF responses also showed a persistent increase in OFF responses after RFS. In addition, repetitive MBS (width, 6 μm; speed, 0.1 μm/ms; frequency, 0.25 Hz; duration, 5 min) also induced persistent enhancement of moving bar-evoked responses in five out of five RGCs examined (194% ± 24% of the control, n = 5; p = 0.004; Figure 8B). Furthermore, 30 min pre-exposure of repetitive moving bars occluded RFS-induced potentiation of flash-evoked responses of RGCs (91% ± 5% of the control, n = 5; p = 0.14; Figure 8C). Thus, different patterns of natural visual stimulation can enhance visual responses of RGCs, suggesting that visual experience is effective in modifying the function of developing retinal circuits. In this study we have performed in vivo perforated whole-cell recording and GCaMP-based two-photon calcium imaging in the developing zebrafish retina and demonstrated that both electrical and natural visual stimulations can induce postsynaptic NMDAR-dependent LTP at synapses formed by BCs on RGCs. The expression of this LTP involves presynaptic changes and requires AA signaling. Here, we demonstrate that excitatory synapses in the retina can undergo activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity. The absence of evidence for LTP in the retina had previously led to the idea that the lack of long-term synaptic plasticity helps the stability of visual processing in the retina. In recent years there are scattered studies showing that synapses in both adult and developing retinae are capable of undergoing long-lasting functional changes in response to intensive stimulation. In the adult goldfish retina, the transmission of reciprocal inhibitory synapses formed by amacrine cells on BCs exhibits depolarization-induced enhancement for up to 10 min (Vigh et al., 2005Vigh J.

CD74, the cell surface isoform of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain, is one such molecule; its role remains poorly defined. To address this, we have employed a high-resolution single-particle imaging method for quantifying the colocalization of CD74 with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules on human fibroblast cells known for their capacity to function as antigen-presenting cells. We have also examined whether the colocalization induces internalization of HLA-DR using HA307-319, a “universal” peptide that binds specifically to the peptide-binding groove of all HLA-DR molecules, irrespective of their alleles. We have determined that 25 ± 1.3% of CD74 and 17 ± 0.3% of HLA-DR are colocalized, and the association of CD74 with HLA-DR and the internalization of HLA-DR are both inhibited by HA307-319. A similar inhibition of HLA-DR internalization was observed in freshly isolated monocyte-derived dendritic cells. A key role of CD74 is to translocate HLA-DR molecules to early endosomes for reloading with peptides prior to recycling to the cell surface. We conclude that CD74 regulates the balance of peptide-occupied and peptide-free forms of MHC class II at the cell surface.—Karakikes, I., Morrison, I. E.

https://openalex.org/W1505926437,"Integrin α1β1 binding to collagen IV, which is mediated by the α1-inserted (I) domain, down-regulates collagen synthesis. When unligated, a salt bridge between Arg(287) and Glu(317) is thought to keep this domain in a low affinity conformation. Ligand binding opens the salt bridge leading to a high-affinity conformation. How modulating integrin α1β1 affinity alters collagen homeostasis is unknown. To address this question, we utilized a thermolysin-derived product of the α1α2α1 network of collagen IV (α1α2α1(IV) truncated protomer) that selectively binds integrin α1β1. We show that an E317A substitution enhanced binding to the truncated protomer, consistent with a previous finding that this substitution eliminates the salt bridge. Surprisingly, we show that an R287A substitution did not alter binding, whereas R287E/E317R substitutions enhanced binding to the truncated protomer. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling suggested that eliminating the Glu(317) negative charge is sufficient to induce a conformational change toward the open state. Thus, the role played by Glu(317) is largely independent of the salt bridge. We further show that cells expressing E317A or R287E/E317R substitutions have enhanced down-regulation of collagen IV synthesis, which is mediated by the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that modulating the affinity of the extracellular α1 I domain to collagen IV enhances outside-in signaling by potentiating ERK activation and enhancing the down-regulation of collagen synthesis."

By applying chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR we found that at G(1)/S arrest, all three DNA polymerases were enriched with DNA containing the early firing lamin B2 origin of replication and, 2 h after release from the block, with DNA containing the origin at the upstream promoter region of the MCM4 gene. Pol α, δ, and ε were released from these origins upon firing. All three DNA polymerases, Mcm3 and Cdc45, but not Orc2, still formed complexes in late S phase. Reciprocal ChIP of the three DNA polymerases revealed that at G(1)/S arrest and early in S phase, Pol α, δ, and ε were associated with the same nucleoprotein complexes, whereas in late S phase Pol ε and Pol α/δ were largely associated with distinct complexes. At G(1)/S arrest, the replicative DNA polymerases were associated with lamins, but in late S phase only Pol ε, not Pol α/δ, remained associated with lamins. Consistently, Pol ε, but not Pol δ, was found in nuclear matrix fraction throughout the cell cycle. Therefore, Pol ε and Pol α/δ seem to pursue their functions at least in part independently in late S phase, either by physical uncoupling of lagging strand maturation from the fork progression, or by recruitment of Pol δ, but not Pol ε, to post-replicative processes such as translesion synthesis or post-replicative repair."

We have proposed that Gcn2 is activated by uncharged tRNA bound to the ribosomal decoding (A) site, in a manner facilitated by ribosome-bound Gcn1. Protein synthesis requires cyclical association of eukaryotic elongation factors (eEFs) with the ribosome. Gcn1 and Gcn2 are large proteins, raising the question of whether translation and monitoring amino acid availability can occur on the same ribosome. Part of the ribosome-binding domain in Gcn1 has homology to one of the ribosome-binding domains in eEF3, suggesting that these proteins utilize overlapping binding sites on the ribosome and consequently cannot function simultaneously on the same ribosome. Supporting this idea, we found that eEF3 overexpression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae diminished growth on amino acid starvation medium (Gcn− phenotype) and decreased eIF2α phosphorylation, and that the growth defect associated with constitutively active Gcn2 was diminished by eEF3 overexpression. Overexpression of the eEF3 HEAT domain, or C terminus, was sufficient to confer a Gcn− phenotype, and both fragments have ribosome affinity. eEF3 overexpression did not significantly affect Gcn1-ribosome association, but it exacerbated the Gcn− phenotype of Gcn1-M7A that has reduced ribosome affinity. Together, this suggests that eEF3 blocks Gcn1 regulatory function on the ribosome.

https://openalex.org/W2075453882,"The methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase I (AOXI) promoter of the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, is used widely for the production of recombinant proteins. AOXI transcription is regulated by the zinc finger protein Mxr1p (methanol expression regulator 1). ROP (repressor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, PEPCK) is a methanol- and biotin starvation-inducible zinc finger protein that acts as a negative regulator of PEPCK in P. pastoris cultured in biotin-deficient, glucose-ammonium medium. The function of ROP during methanol metabolism is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that ROP represses methanol-inducible expression of AOXI when P. pastoris is cultured in a nutrient-rich medium containing yeast extract, peptone, and methanol (YPM). Deletion of the gene encoding ROP results in enhanced expression of AOXI and growth promotion whereas overexpression of ROP results in repression of AOXI and growth retardation of P. pastoris cultured in YPM medium. Surprisingly, deletion or overexpression of ROP has no effect on AOXI gene expression and growth of P. pastoris cultured in a minimal medium containing yeast nitrogen base and methanol (YNBM). Subcellular localization studies indicate that ROP translocates from cytosol to nucleus of cells cultured in YPM but not YNBM. In vitro DNA binding studies indicate that AOXI promoter sequences containing 5' CYCCNY 3' motifs serve as binding sites for Mxr1p as well as ROP. Thus, Mxr1p and ROP exhibit the same DNA binding specificity but regulate methanol metabolism antagonistically in P. pastoris. This is the first report on the identification of a transcriptional repressor of methanol metabolism in any yeast species."
https://openalex.org/W2141391981,"Trisomy for chromosome 7 is frequently observed as an initiating event in sporadic colorectal cancer. Although unstable chromosome numbers and recurrent aneuploidies drive a large fraction of human cancers, targeted therapies selective to pre-neoplastic trisomic cells are non-existent. We have previously characterized a trisomy 7 cell line (1CT+7) spontaneously derived from normal diploid human colonic epithelial cells that aberrantly expresses the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, chromosome 7p11). Recent studies identified AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside) as a pharmacological inhibitor of aneuploid murine fibroblast proliferation. Here, we report that AICAR induces profound cytostatic and metabolic effects on 1CT+7 cells, but not on their isogenic diploid counterpart. Dose-response experiments indicate that 1CT+7 cells are fourfold preferentially sensitive to AICAR compared to diploid cells. Unexpectedly, treatment of 1CT+7 cells with AICAR led to a reversible 3.5-fold reduction (P=0.0025) in EGFR overexpression. AICAR-induced depletion of EGFR protein can be abrogated through inhibition of the proteasome with MG132. AICAR also heavily promoted EGFR ubiquitination in cell-based immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting enhanced degradation of EGFR protein mediated by the proteasome. Moreover, treatment with AICAR reduced EGFR protein levels in a panel of human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. Our data collectively support the pharmacological compound AICAR as a novel inhibitor of EGFR protein abundance and as a potential anticancer agent for aneuploidy-driven colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2082987331,"Bacteriophage T7 expresses two forms of gene 4 protein (gp4). The 63-kDa full-length gp4 contains both the helicase and primase domains. T7 phage also express a 56-kDa truncated gp4 lacking the zinc binding domain of the primase; the protein has helicase activity but no DNA-dependent primase activity. Although T7 phage grow better when both forms are present, the role of the 56-kDa gp4 is unknown. The two molecular weight forms oligomerize by virtue of the helicase domain to form heterohexamers. The 56-kDa gp4 and any mixture of 56- and 63-kDa gp4 show higher helicase activity in DNA unwinding and strand-displacement DNA synthesis than that observed for the 63-kDa gp4. However, single-molecule measurements show that heterohexamers have helicase activity similar to the 63-kDa gp4 hexamers. In oligomerization assays the 56-kDa gp4 and any mixture of the 56- and 63-kDa gp4 oligomerize to form more hexamers than does the 63-kDa gp4. The zinc binding domain of the 63-kDa gp4 interferes with hexamer formation, an inhibition that is relieved by the insertion of the 56-kDa species. Compared with the 63-kDa gp4, heterohexamers synthesize a reduced amount of oligoribonucleotides, mediated predominately by the 63-kDa subunits via a cis mode. During coordinated DNA synthesis 7% of the tetraribonucleotides synthesized are used as primers by both heterohexamers and hexamers of the 63-kDa gp4. Overall, an equimolar mixture of the two forms of gp4 shows the highest rate of DNA synthesis during coordinated DNA synthesis. Bacteriophage T7 expresses two forms of gene 4 protein (gp4).

Although T7 phage grow better when both forms are present, the role of the 56-kDa gp4 is unknown. The two molecular weight forms oligomerize by virtue of the helicase domain to form heterohexamers. The 56-kDa gp4 and any mixture of 56- and 63-kDa gp4 show higher helicase activity in DNA unwinding and strand-displacement DNA synthesis than that observed for the 63-kDa gp4. However, single-molecule measurements show that heterohexamers have helicase activity similar to the 63-kDa gp4 hexamers. In oligomerization assays the 56-kDa gp4 and any mixture of the 56- and 63-kDa gp4 oligomerize to form more hexamers than does the 63-kDa gp4. The zinc binding domain of the 63-kDa gp4 interferes with hexamer formation, an inhibition that is relieved by the insertion of the 56-kDa species. Compared with the 63-kDa gp4, heterohexamers synthesize a reduced amount of oligoribonucleotides, mediated predominately by the 63-kDa subunits via a cis mode. During coordinated DNA synthesis 7% of the tetraribonucleotides synthesized are used as primers by both heterohexamers and hexamers of the 63-kDa gp4. Overall, an equimolar mixture of the two forms of gp4 shows the highest rate of DNA synthesis during coordinated DNA synthesis."
