https://openalex.org/W2041753380,"Generation of Swine Flu As the newly emerged influenza virus starts its journey to infect the world's human population, the genetic secrets of the 2009 outbreak of swine influenza A(H1N1) are being revealed. In extensive phylogenetic analyses, Garten et al. (p. 197 , published online 22 May) confirm that of the eight elements of the virus, the basic components encoded by the hemagglutinin, nucleoprotein, and nonstructural genes originated in birds and transferred to pigs in 1918. Subsequently, these formed a triple reassortant with the RNA polymerase PB1 that transferred from birds in 1968 to humans and then to pigs in 1998, coupled with RNA polymerases PA and PB2 that transferred from birds to pigs in 1998. The neuraminidase and matrix protein genes that complete the virus came from birds and entered pigs in 1979. The analysis offers insights into drug susceptibility and virulence, as well as raising the possibility of hitherto unknown factors determining host specificity. A significant question is, what is the potential for the H1 component of the current seasonal flu vaccine to act as a booster? Apart from the need for ongoing sequencing to monitor for the emergence of new reassortants, future pig populations need to be closely monitored for emerging influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2169540909,"Candida species are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection worldwide. Here we report the genome sequences of six Candida species and compare these and related pathogens and non-pathogens. There are significant expansions of cell wall, secreted and transporter gene families in pathogenic species, suggesting adaptations associated with virulence. Large genomic tracts are homozygous in three diploid species, possibly resulting from recent recombination events. Surprisingly, key components of the mating and meiosis pathways are missing from several species. These include major differences at the mating-type loci (MTL); Lodderomyces elongisporus lacks MTL, and components of the a1/2 cell identity determinant were lost in other species, raising questions about how mating and cell types are controlled. Analysis of the CUG leucine-to-serine genetic-code change reveals that 99% of ancestral CUG codons were erased and new ones arose elsewhere. Lastly, we revise the Candida albicans gene catalogue, identifying many new genes."

TDP-43 function is uncertain, but it likely plays important roles in pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional repression (2Ayala Y.M. Misteli T. Baralle F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In ALS and FTLD-U, TDP-43 is depleted from the nucleus and accumulates in ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions (4Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J.

These and other situations of TDP-43 pathology, including some forms of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, are now known as TDP-43 proteinopathies (5Forman M.S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Curr. Opin.

Importantly, mutations in the TDP-43 gene (TARDBP) are linked to sporadic and non-SOD1 familial ALS, implying that TDP-43 abnormalities are likely one cause of disease (6Kabashi E. Valdmanis P.N.

However, despite this synthesis of pathology and genetics, the mechanisms by which TDP-43 might contribute to disease remain unknown and controversial (12Banks G.T. Kuta A. Isaacs A.M. Fisher E.M.

A key unresolved question is whether TDP-43 is inherently aggregation-prone or whether TDP-43 is sequestered by other aggregated components and is merely a marker of disease (13Rothstein J.D. Ann.

Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D. Tsuchiya K. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Oda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Moreover, deconvolution imaging reveals that TDP-43 appears to be excluded from some regions of the ubiquitinated inclusions in ALS (15Sanelli T. Xiao S. Horne P. Bilbao J. Zinman L. Robertson J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2007; 66: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we assess TDP-43 aggregation in the absence of other components. We then define which domains of TDP-43 are important for this process and determine the direct effects of several ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations on TDP-43 misfolding and toxicity. Our findings bring to light several intrinsic properties of TDP-43 and ALS-linked TDP-43 mutants that likely play important roles in the aberrant TDP-43 proteostasis (17Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar) that contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS, FTLD-U, and other TDP-43 proteinopathies. Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (YPD; yeast/peptone/dextrose) or in synthetic media lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose (SD/-Ura), raffinose (SRaf/-Ura), or galactose (SGal/-Ura). A TDP-43 Gateway entry clone was obtained from Invitrogen, containing full-length human TDP-43 in the vector pDONR221. To generate C-terminally YFP-tagged TDP-43 constructs, we used PCR to amplify TDP-43 without a stop codon and incorporate SpeI and HindIII restriction sites along with a Kozak consensus sequence. The resulting PCR product was cloned into SpeI/HindIII-digested pRS416GAL-YFP to generate the CEN TDP-43YFP fusion construct. Each ALS-linked TDP-43 mutant construct was generated by using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) with pRS416GAL-TDP-43-YFP as template. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. CEN plasmid constructs (e.g. pRS416GAL-TDP-43-YFP) were transformed into BY4741 (MATa his3 leu2 met15 ura3). Yeast procedures were performed according to standard protocols. We used the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method to transform yeast with plasmid DNA. For spotting assays, yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in liquid media containing SRaf/-Ura until they reached log or mid-long phase. Cultures were then normalized for A600 nm, serially diluted and spotted with a Frogger (V&P Scientific) onto synthetic solid media containing glucose (SD/-Ura) or galactose (SGal/-Ura) lacking uracil and were grown at 30 °C for 2–3 days. We performed survivorship assays as described previously (18Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J. Bhullar B. Liu K. Xu K. Strathearn K.E. Liu F. Cao S. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Marsischky G. Kolodner R.D. Labaer J. Rochet J.C. Bonini N.M. Lindquist S. Science. 2006; 313: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Briefly, after induction of empty vector, wild-type (WT) or mutant TDP-43 in 2% galactose, survivorship was determined at the indicated time points by harvesting cells at an A600 nm of 1, diluting them 1:1000, and plating 300 μl of these cells on synthetic media containing 2% glucose (represses TDP-43 expression). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Colony forming units were then determined. Yeast lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient, Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody incubations were performed at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Proteins were detected with Immobilon Western HRP Chemiluminescent Substrate (Millipore). The anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at 1:10,000, and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:500. The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at 1:5000. For immunocytochemistry experiments, yeast cells expressing untagged TDP-43 constructs were grown to a final A600 of 0.2–0.8 and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and washed in PBS. The cells were diluted and washed once before resuspending in 1 ml of Solution A (0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 m Sorbitol, 40 mm K3PO4, pH 6.5). Cells were incubated with 10 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and 25 μl of 10 mg/ml lyticase for 15 min at 37 °C. Spheroplasted cells were collected at 4000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice with Solution A and once with PBS, and resuspended in PBS+BSA (1× PBS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Spheroplasts were diluted 1:5 and incubated on Teflon-covered slides treated with 1 mg/ml polylysine. Wells were blocked with PBS+BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations using 1:200 anti-TDP-43 mouse polyclonal antibody (Novus) were performed for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS+BSA, wells were incubated with 1:2000 Alexa 488 nm donkey anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS+BSA, wells were incubated with Vectashield mounting medium containing 1.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs) for 5 min before visualization using fluorescence microscopy. We performed sedimentation analysis as described in a previous study (19Kaganovich D. Kopito R. Frydman J. Nature. 2008; 454: 1088-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Cells expressing either YFP-tagged TDP-43 constructs or CFP-tagged polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin constructs for 4 or 6 h were lysed in 1× native yeast lysis buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were disrupted in a bead beater for 3 min at 4 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The yeast lysate was separated into a total fraction and a pellet fraction. After the pellet fraction was spun at either 16,000 × g or 85,000 rpm in a TLA 100.1 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C the supernatant was recovered and designated the soluble fraction. The pellet fraction was resolubilized by boiling in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. The total and soluble fractions were boiled in equal volumes of 4× SDS sample buffer. 20% of the pellet fraction and 10% of soluble and total fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. For fluorescence microscopy experiments, single colony isolates of the yeast strains were grown to mid-log phase in SRaf/-Ura media at 30 °C. Cultures were spun down and resuspended in the same volume of SGal/-Ura to induce expression of the TDP-43-YFP constructs. Cultures were induced with galactose for 6 h before being fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) to visualize nuclei. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan Upright Microscope and a Zeiss AxioCam HRm high resolution monochrome charge-coupled device camera. The images were deblurred using a nearest neighbor algorithm in the AxioVision 4.5 software, and representative cells were chosen for figures. To assess differences in aggregation between wild-type and mutant TDP-43, yeast cultures were grown, induced, and processed as described above after having normalized all yeast cultures to A600 nm = 0.2 prior to galactose induction. After 6 h of induction, the identities of the samples were blinded to the observer before being examined. Several fields of cells were randomly chosen using the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter to prevent any bias toward populations of cells with increased amounts of aggregation in addition to obtaining the total number of cells in any given field. At least 200 cells per sample were counted for each replicate. Only cells with >3 foci under the YFP channel were considered as cells with aggregating TDP-43. TDP-43 and various missense (G294A, M337V, or Q331K) or deletion mutants (1–275 or 188–414) were expressed and purified from E. coli as either His-tagged or GST-tagged proteins. For His-tagged preparations, TDP-43 was cloned into pCOLD I (Takara) and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(RIL). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The proteins were purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). For GST-tagged preparations, TDP-43 was cloned into GV13 to yield a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavable GST-TDP-43 fusion protein, GST-TEV-TDP-43, and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL or Rosetta2 (Novagen). Protein was purified over a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST was then removed by cleavage with TEV protease (Invitrogen), and protease and GST were removed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and glutathione-Sepharose. His-tagged and untagged TDP-43 proteins were ∼95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. His-tagged and untagged proteins aggregated with identical kinetics and formed aggregates with very similar morphologies. After purification, proteins were buffer exchanged into assembly buffer (AB): 40 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. After filtration, the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were used immediately for aggregation reactions. For size-exclusion chromatography, a Superdex-200 10/300 GL analytical gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) was calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), β-lactoglobulin (35 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). TDP-43 was incubated in AB at 25 °C with agitation for 5 min, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 5 min. Protein was loaded onto the calibrated Superdex-200 10/300 GL column equilibrated in AB and eluted at 0.4 ml/min. Oligomeric fractions were pooled and processed for electron microscopy (see below). Filtered, purified TDP-43 was used immediately for aggregation assays. TDP-43 or missense mutant TDP-43 or deletion mutants (3 μm) were incubated at 25 °C in AB for 0–120 min with agitation at 1400 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer. Turbidity was used to assess aggregation by measuring absorbance at 395 nm. For sedimentation analysis, reactions were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the amount in either fraction was determined by densitometry in comparison to known quantities of TDP-43. Alternatively, reactions were processed for Congo Red binding or Thioflavin-T fluorescence as described before (20Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy (EM) of in vitro aggregation reactions, TDP-43 protein samples (10 μl of a 3 μm solution) were adsorbed onto glow-discharged 300-mesh Formvar/carbon-coated copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate. Excess liquid was removed, and grids were allowed to air dry. Samples were viewed using a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu digital camera using AMT acquisition software. Conventional EM was performed as previously described (21Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Köhrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde contained in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% sucrose for 1 h at 25 °C with gentle agitation; spheroplasted; embedded in 2% ultra low temperature agarose (prepared in water); cooled; and subsequently cut into small pieces (∼1 mm3). The cells are then post-fixed in 1% OsO4/1% potassium ferrocyanide contained in 0.1 m cacodylate/5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. The blocks are washed thoroughly 4× with ddH2O, 10 min total; transferred to 1% thiocarbohydrazide at room temperature for 3 min; washed in ddH2O (4×, 1 min each); and transferred to 1% OsO4/1% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for an additional 3 min at room temperature. The cells are then washed 4× with ddH2O (15 min total); en bloc stained in Kellenberger's uranyl acetate for 2 h to overnight; dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol; and subsequently embedded in Spurr resin. Sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut T ultramicrotome; post stained with Kellenberger's uranyl acetate and lead citrate; and observed on a Philips TEM 420 at 80 kV. Images were recorded with a Soft Imaging System Megaview III digital camera, and figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop 10.0. To test whether TDP-43 is inherently aggregation-prone, bacterially expressed recombinant TDP-43 was purified as a soluble protein under native conditions. Upon incubation at 25 °C with agitation, TDP-43 rapidly aggregated after a lag phase of ∼5–10 min, as determined by an increase in turbidity (Fig. 1B) and by the amount that entered the pellet fraction after centrifugation (Fig. 1C). Several control proteins, including BSA, soybean trypsin inhibitor, creatine kinase, and GFP, did not aggregate under identical conditions. After 30 min, no further TDP-43 aggregation occurred (Fig. 1, B and C). This timeframe for TDP-43 aggregation is extended to several hours if we omit agitation during incubation (data not shown). Thus, TDP-43 is an inherently aggregation-prone protein. It is likely that sophisticated cellular proteostasis mechanisms (17Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar, 22Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), not reconstituted here, prevent such rapid TDP-43 aggregation in vivo. However, age-associated decline in proteostatic control in concert with environmental factors might enable TDP-43 to aggregate in disease. Regardless of the triggers of TDP-43 aggregation in disease, in vitro assays similar to the one we report here have been tremendously powerful tools in exploring basic mechanisms underpinning the aggregation events in Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease (23Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 24Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 2003; 332: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Aggregates formed by pure TDP-43 did not react with the amyloid-diagnostic dyes Congo Red and Thioflavin-T, in contrast to those formed by Sup35-NM, the prion domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35 (26Shorter J. Lindquist S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, pure TDP-43 aggregates are likely to be non-amyloid just like aggregated species of TDP-43 in ALS and FTLD-U patients (27Kwong L.K. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neurosignals. 2008; 16: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In ALS and FTLD-U, TDP-43 is ubiquitinated, phosphorylated, and proteolytically cleaved (4Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A. Trojanowski J.Q.

Our in vitro aggregation assays will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at determining the effects of TDP-43 post-translational modification and processing on aggregation. Next, we determined which regions of TDP-43 are critical for aggregation in vitro. We purified TDP-43 fragments: 1–275, which comprises the N-terminal domain, RRM1 and RRM2, and 188–414, which comprises RRM2 and the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). 1–275 is soluble, whereas 188–414 is the minimal fragment able to confer toxicity and aggregation in a yeast model of TDP-43 proteinopathies (28Johnson B.S. McCaffery J.M. Lindquist S. Gitler A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Importantly, pure 1–275 did not aggregate, whereas 188–414 aggregated with similar kinetics to full-length TDP-43 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the C-terminal domain plays an important role in TDP-43 aggregation, which is striking because of the >25 recently reported ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations, all but one are within this domain (Fig. 2A) (12Banks G.T. Kuta A. Isaacs A.M. Fisher E.M. Mamm. Genome. 2008; 19: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar aggregated C-terminal fragments accumulate in ALS and FTLD-U (4Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M.

Therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting this region, which we have defined as responsible for driving aggregation, may be efficacious. Having established that TDP-43 is inherently aggregation-prone, we next asked if ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations affect aggregation in vivo. We have developed a yeast TDP-43 proteinopathy model to investigate mechanisms of TDP-43 aggregation and toxicity (28Johnson B.S. McCaffery J.M. Lindquist S. Gitler A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This model recapitulates several important features seen in human disease. In yeast, TDP-43 is initially localized to the nucleus but eventually forms cytoplasmic inclusions (28Johnson B.S. McCaffery J.M. Lindquist S. Gitler A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These experimental findings, and the implication of these TH subsets in human diseases, suggest the need for pharmacological measures to manipulate these TH subsets. Here we show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) acting on its receptor EP4 on T cells and dendritic cells not only facilitates TH1 cell differentiation but also amplifies interleukin-23-mediated TH17 cell expansion in vitro. Administration of an EP4-selective antagonist in vivo decreases accumulation of both TH1 and TH17 cells in regional lymph nodes and suppresses the disease progression in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or contact hypersensitivity. Thus, PGE2-EP4 signaling promotes immune inflammation through TH1 differentiation and TH17 expansion, and EP4 antagonism may be therapeutically useful for various immune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2120821369,"Mir-138, identified in a screen for microRNAs associated with synapses, regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis through APT-1, a depalmitoylation enzyme that modulates the membrane localization of the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit. The microRNA pathway has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis and ultimately in dendritic spine morphogenesis, a phenomenon associated with long-lasting forms of memory. However, the particular microRNAs (miRNAs) involved are largely unknown. Here we identify specific miRNAs that function at synapses to control dendritic spine structure by performing a functional screen. One of the identified miRNAs, miR-138, is highly enriched in the brain, localized within dendrites and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines in rat hippocampal neurons. miR-138 controls the expression of acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), an enzyme regulating the palmitoylation status of proteins that are known to function at the synapse, including the α13 subunits of G proteins (Gα13). RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of APT1 and the expression of membrane-localized Gα13 both suppress spine enlargement caused by inhibition of miR-138, suggesting that APT1-regulated depalmitoylation of Gα13 might be an important downstream event of miR-138 function. Our results uncover a previously unknown miRNA-dependent mechanism in neurons and demonstrate a previously unrecognized complexity of miRNA-dependent control of dendritic spine morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2020469175,"Transfection of small RNAs (such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)) into cells typically lowers expression of many genes. Unexpectedly, increased expression of genes also occurs. We investigated whether this upregulation results from a saturation effect--that is, competition among the transfected small RNAs and the endogenous pool of miRNAs for the intracellular machinery that processes small RNAs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genome-wide transcript responses from 151 published transfection experiments in seven different human cell types. We show that targets of endogenous miRNAs are expressed at significantly higher levels after transfection, consistent with impaired effectiveness of endogenous miRNA repression. This effect exhibited concentration and temporal dependence. Notably, the profile of endogenous miRNAs can be largely inferred by correlating miRNA sites with gene expression changes after transfections. The competition and saturation effects have practical implications for miRNA target prediction, the design of siRNA and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) genomic screens and siRNA therapeutics."

They provide guidance for design of GWAS in African populations, and demonstrate the usefulness of multipoint imputation based on population-specific sequencing data. We report a genome-wide association (GWA) study of severe malaria in The Gambia. The initial GWA scan included 2,500 children genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K GeneChip, and a replication study included 3,400 children. We used this to examine the performance of GWA methods in Africa. We found considerable population stratification, and also that signals of association at known malaria resistance loci were greatly attenuated owing to weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). To investigate possible solutions to the problem of low LD, we focused on the HbS locus, sequencing this region of the genome in 62 Gambian individuals and then using these data to conduct multipoint imputation in the GWA samples. This increased the signal of association, from P = 4 × 10−7 to P = 4 × 10−14, with the peak of the signal located precisely at the HbS causal variant. Our findings provide proof of principle that fine-resolution multipoint imputation, based on population-specific sequencing data, can substantially boost authentic GWA signals and enable fine mapping of causal variants in African populations."
https://openalex.org/W2091407133,"Jamel Chelly and colleagues report that de novo mutations in TUBB2B, encoding a β-tubulin, are associated with asymmetrical polymicrogyria and other brain malformations. They also show that in utero knockdown of Tubb2b in rat results in defective neuronal migration. Polymicrogyria is a relatively common but poorly understood defect of cortical development characterized by numerous small gyri and a thick disorganized cortical plate lacking normal lamination. Here we report de novo mutations in a β-tubulin gene, TUBB2B, in four individuals and a 27-gestational-week fetus with bilateral asymmetrical polymicrogyria. Neuropathological examination of the fetus revealed an absence of cortical lamination associated with the presence of ectopic neuronal cells in the white matter and in the leptomeningeal spaces due to breaches in the pial basement membrane. In utero RNAi-based inactivation demonstrates that TUBB2B is required for neuronal migration. We also show that two disease-associated mutations lead to impaired formation of tubulin heterodimers. These observations, together with previous data, show that disruption of microtubule-based processes underlies a large spectrum of neuronal migration disorders that includes not only lissencephaly and pachygyria, but also polymicrogyria malformations."

A-443654 is an ATP-competitive Akt inhibitor. Unexpectedly, treatment of cells with A-443654 causes paradoxical hyperphosphorylation of Akt at its two regulatory sites (Thr308 and Ser473). We explored whether inhibitor-induced hyperphosphorylation of Akt by A-443654 is a consequence of disrupted feedback regulation at a pathway level or whether it is a direct consequence of inhibitor binding to the ATP binding site of Akt. Catalytically inactive mutants of Akt revealed that binding of an inhibitor to the ATP site of Akt is sufficient to directly cause hyperphosphorylation of the kinase in the absence of any pathway feedback effects. We conclude that ATP-competitive Akt inhibitors impart regulatory phosphorylation of their target kinase Akt. These results provide new insights into both natural regulation of Akt activation and Akt inhibitors entering the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2039329578,"Background Economic games observe social decision making in the laboratory that involves real money payoffs. Previously we have shown that allocation of funds in the Dictator Game (DG), a paradigm that illustrates costly altruistic behavior, is partially determined by promoter-region repeat region variants in the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor gene (AVPR1a). In the current investigation, the gene encoding the related oxytocin receptor (OXTR) was tested for association with the DG and a related paradigm, the Social Values Orientation (SVO) task. Methodology/Principal Findings Association (101 male and 102 female students) using a robust-family based test between 15 single tagging SNPs (htSNPs) across the OXTR was demonstrated with both the DG and SVO. Three htSNPs across the gene region showed significant association with both of the two games. The most significant association was observed with rs1042778 (p = 0.001). Haplotype analysis also showed significant associations for both DG and SVO. Following permutation test adjustment, significance was observed for 2–5 locus haplotypes (p<0.05). A second sample of 98 female subjects was subsequently and independently recruited to play the dictator game and was genotyped for the three significant SNPs found in the first sample. The rs1042778 SNP was shown to be significant for the second sample as well (p = 0.004, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions The demonstration that genetic polymorphisms for the OXTR are associated with human prosocial decision making converges with a large body of animal research showing that oxytocin is an important social hormone across vertebrates including Homo sapiens. Individual differences in prosocial behavior have been shown by twin studies to have a substantial genetic basis and the current investigation demonstrates that common variants in the oxytocin receptor gene, an important element of mammalian social circuitry, underlie such individual differences."
https://openalex.org/W2028832882,"The new interleukin (IL)-1 family cytokine IL-33 is synthesized as a 30-kDa precursor. Like pro-IL-1beta, human pro-IL-33 was reported to be cleaved by caspase-1 to generate an 18-kDa fragment, which is sufficient to activate signaling by the IL-33 receptor T1/ST2. However, the proposed caspase-1 cleavage site is poorly conserved between species. In addition, it is not clear whether caspase-1 cleavage of pro-IL-33 occurs in vivo and whether, as for IL-1beta, this cleavage is a prerequisite for IL-33 secretion and bioactivity. In this study, we further investigated caspase-1 cleavage of mouse and human pro-IL-33 and assessed the potential bioactivity of the IL-33 precursor. We observed the generation of a 20-kDa IL-33 fragment in cell lysates, which was enhanced by incubation with caspase-1. However, in vitro assays of mouse and human pro-IL-33 indicated that IL-33 is not a direct substrate for this enzyme. Consistently, caspase-1 activation in THP-1 cells induced cleavage of pro-IL-1beta but not of pro-IL-33, and activated THP-1 cells released full-length pro-IL-33 into culture supernatants. Finally, addition of full-length pro-IL-33 induced T1/ST2-dependent IL-6 secretion in mast cells. However, we observed in situ processing of pro-IL-33 in mast cell cultures, and it remains to be determined whether full-length pro-IL-33 itself indeed represents the bioactive species. In conclusion, our data indicate that pro-IL-33 is not a direct substrate for caspase-1. In addition, our results clearly show that caspase-1 cleavage is not required for pro-IL-33 secretion and bioactivity, highlighting major differences between IL-1beta and IL-33."

https://openalex.org/W2068223241,"One major defining characteristic of the basal keratinocytes of the stratified epithelium is the expression of the keratin genes K5 and K14. The temporal and spatial expression of these two genes is usually tightly and coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level. This ensures the obligate pairing of K5 and K14 proteins to generate an intermediate filament (IF) network that is essential for the structure and function of the proliferative keratinocytes. Our previous studies have shown that the basal-keratinocyte restricted transcription factor p63 is a direct regulator of K14 gene.Here we provide evidence that p63, specifically the DeltaN isoform also regulates the expression of the K5 gene by binding to a conserved enhancer within the 5' upstream region. By using specific antibodies against DeltaNp63, we show a concordance in the expression between basal keratins and DeltaNp63 proteins but not the TAp63 isoforms during early embryonic skin development. We demonstrate, that contrary to a previous report, transgenic mice expressing DeltaNp63 in lung epithelium exhibit squamous metaplasia with de novo induction of K5 and K14 as well as transdifferentiation to the epidermal cell lineage. Interestingly, the in vivo epidermal inductive properties of DeltaNp63 do not require the C-terminal SAM domain. Finally, we show that DeltaNp63 alone can restore the expression of the basal keratins and reinitiate the failed epidermal differentiation program in the skin of p63 null animals.DeltaNp63 is a critical mediator of keratinocyte stratification program and directly regulates the basal keratin genes."

Collectively, cigarette smoke and sunlight have been estimated to account for 40% of all human cancers, and not only smoke but also, surprisingly, UV light induced genomic and postgenomic alterations in mouse lung. Here we evaluated by microarray the expression of 484 microRNAs in the lungs of CD-1 mice, including new-borns, postweanling males and females, and their dams, either untreated or exposed to environmental cigarette smoke and/or UV-containing light. The results obtained highlighted age-related variations in microRNA profiles, especially during the weanling period, due to perinatal stress and postnatal maturation of the lung. UV light alone did not affect pulmonary microRNAs, whereas smoke produced dramatic changes, mostly in the sense of down-regulation, reflecting both adaptive mechanisms and activation of pathways involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases.

Methodology/Principal Findings To better characterize the genetic determinants of antibiotic susceptibility, we exposed a transposon-mutagenized library of Escherichia coli to each of 17 antibiotics that encompass a wide range of drug classes and mechanisms of action. Propagating the library for multiple generations with drug concentrations that moderately inhibited the growth of the isogenic parental strain caused the abundance of strains with even minor fitness advantages or disadvantages to change measurably and reproducibly. Using a microarray-based genetic footprinting strategy, we then determined the quantitative contribution of each gene to E. coli's intrinsic antibiotic susceptibility. We found both loci whose removal increased general antibiotic tolerance as well as pathways whose down-regulation increased tolerance to specific drugs and drug classes. The beneficial mutations identified span multiple pathways, and we identified pairs of mutations that individually provide only minor decreases in antibiotic susceptibility but that combine to provide higher tolerance. Conclusions/Significance Our results illustrate that a wide-range of mutations can modulate the activity of many cellular resistance processes and demonstrate that E. coli has a large mutational target size for increasing antibiotic tolerance. Furthermore, the work suggests that clinical levels of antibiotic resistance might develop through the sequential accumulation of chromosomal mutations of small individual effect."
https://openalex.org/W2000992130,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and its main receptor, Patched (Ptc), are implicated in both neural development and tumorigenesis. Besides its classic morphogenic activity, Shh is also a survival factor. Along this line, Ptc has been shown to function as a dependence receptor; it induces apoptosis in the absence of Shh, whereas its pro-apoptotic activity is blocked in the presence of Shh. Here we show that, in the absence of its ligand, Ptc interacts with the adaptor protein DRAL (downregulated in rhabdomyosarcoma LIM-domain protein; also known as FHL2). DRAL is required for the pro-apoptotic activity of Ptc both in immortalized cells and during neural tube development in chick embryos. We demonstrate that, in the absence of Shh, Ptc recruits a protein complex that includes DRAL, one of the caspase recruitment (CARD)-domain containing proteins TUCAN (family member, 8) or NALP1 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 1) and apical caspase-9. Ptc triggers caspase-9 activation and enhances cell death through a caspase-9-dependent mechanism. Thus, we propose that in the absence of its ligand Shh the dependence receptor Ptc serves as the anchor for a caspase-activating complex that includes DRAL, and caspase-9."

Yet, whether this enhancement confers advantages in everyday life remains unknown, as deaf individuals have been shown to be more distracted by irrelevant information in the periphery than their hearing peers. Here, we show that, in a complex attentional task, a performance advantage results for deaf individuals.We employed the Useful Field of View (UFOV) which requires central target identification concurrent with peripheral target localization in the presence of distractors - a divided, selective attention task. First, the comparison of deaf and hearing adults with or without sign language skills establishes that deafness and not sign language use drives UFOV enhancement.

https://openalex.org/W2065437731,"Background The INK4/ARF locus encodes three tumor suppressor genes (p15Ink4b, Arf and p16Ink4a) and is frequently inactivated in a large number of human cancers. Mechanisms regulating INK4/ARF expression are not fully characterized. Principal Findings Here we show that in young proliferating embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2 together with PRC1 members BMI1 and M33 are strongly expressed and localized at the INK4/ARF regulatory domain (RD) identified as a DNA replication origin. When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This loss is accompanied with an increased expression of the histone demethylase Jmjd3 and with the recruitment of the MLL1 protein, and correlates with the expression of the Ink4a/Arf genes. Moreover, we show that the Polycomb protein BMI1 interacts with CDC6, an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Polycomb proteins and associated epigenetic marks are crucial for the control of the replication timing of the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence. Conclusions We identified the replication licencing factor CDC6 as a new partner of the Polycomb group member BMI1. Our results suggest that in young cells Polycomb proteins are recruited to the INK4/ARF locus through CDC6 and the resulting silent locus is replicated during late S-phase. Upon senescence, Jmjd3 is overexpressed and the MLL1 protein is recruited to the locus provoking the dissociation of Polycomb from the INK4/ARF locus, its transcriptional activation and its replication during early S-phase. Together, these results provide a unified model that integrates replication, transcription and epigenetics at the INK4/ARF locus."
https://openalex.org/W2076649881,"Background Mammalian germ cells progress through a unique developmental program that encompasses proliferation and migration of the nascent primordial germ cell (PGC) population, reprogramming of nuclear DNA to reset imprinted gene expression, and differentiation of mature gametes. Little is known of the genes that regulate quantitative and qualitative aspects of early mammalian germ cell development both in vivo, and during differentiation of germ cells from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in vitro. Methodology and Principal Findings We used a transgenic mouse system that enabled isolation of small numbers of Oct4ΔPE:GFP-positive germ cells in vivo, and following differentiation from mESCs in vitro, to uncover quantitate and qualitative phenotypes associated with the disruption of a single translational regulator, Dazl. We demonstrate that disruption of Dazl results in a post-migratory, pre-meiotic reduction in PGC number accompanied by aberrant expression of pluripotency genes and failure to erase and re-establish genomic imprints in isolated male and female PGCs, as well as subsequent defect in progression through meiosis. Moreover, the phenotypes observed in vivo were mirrored by those in vitro, with inability of isolated mutant PGCs to establish pluripotent EG (embryonic germ) cell lines and few residual Oct-4-expressing cells remaining after somatic differentiation of mESCs carrying a Dazl null mutation. Finally, we observed that even within undifferentiated mESCs, a nascent germ cell subpopulation exists that was effectively eliminated with ablation of Dazl. Conclusions and Significance This report establishes the translational regulator Dazl as a component of pluripotency, genetic, and epigenetic programs at multiple time points of germ cell development in vivo and in vitro, and validates use of the ESC system to model and explore germ cell biology."

Adaptive action suggests that the brain of the receiver has co-evolved to efficiently decode expression signals. Here, we review and integrate the evidence for this hypothesis. With a computational approach, we co-examined facial expressions as signals for data transmission and the brain as receiver and decoder of these signals. First, we show in a model observer that facial expressions form a lowly correlated signal set. Second, using time-resolved EEG data, we show how the brain uses spatial frequency information impinging on the retina to decorrelate expression categories. Between 140 to 200 ms following stimulus onset, independently in the left and right hemispheres, an information processing mechanism starts locally with encoding the eye, irrespective of expression, followed by a zooming out to processing the entire face, followed by a zooming back in to diagnostic features (e.g. the opened eyes in “fear”, the mouth in “happy”). A model categorizer demonstrates that at 200 ms, the left and right brain have represented enough information to predict behavioral categorization performance."

To identify genes regulating the behavioral effects of ethanol, we conducted a genetic screen in Drosophila and identified a mutant, happyhour (hppy), due to its increased resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. Hppy protein shows strong homology to mammalian Ste20 family kinases of the GCK-1 subfamily. Genetic and biochemical experiments revealed that the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-signaling pathway regulates ethanol sensitivity in Drosophila and that Hppy functions as an inhibitor of the pathway. Acute pharmacological inhibition of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in adult animals altered acute ethanol sensitivity in both flies and mice and reduced ethanol consumption in a preclinical rat model of alcoholism. Inhibitors of the EGFR or components of its signaling pathway are thus potential pharmacotherapies for AUDs."
https://openalex.org/W2089518047,"Mutations in the MIP phosphatase MTMR14 are associated with human autosomal centronuclear myopathy. Mice that lack MIP have impaired muscle performance and enhanced fatigue due to the accumulation of MIP substrates PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, which cause alterations in intracellular Ca2+ levels. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in skeletal muscles must be rapidly regulated during the excitation-contraction-relaxation process1. However, the signalling components involved in such rapid Ca2+ movement are not fully understood. Here we report that mice deficient in the newly identified PtdInsP (phosphatidylinositol phosphate) phosphatase MIP/MTMR14 (muscle-specific inositol phosphatase) show muscle weakness and fatigue. Muscles isolated from MIP/MTMR14−/− mice produced less contractile force, had markedly prolonged relaxation and showed exacerbated fatigue relative to normal muscles. Further analyses revealed that MIP/MTMR14 deficiency resulted in spontaneous Ca2+ leakage from the internal store — the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This was attributed to decreased metabolism (dephosphorylation) and the subsequent accumulation of MIP/MTMR14 substrates, especially PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns (3,4)P2. Furthermore, we found that PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 bound to, and directly activated, the Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor 1, RyR1) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These studies provide the first evidence that finely controlled PtdInsP levels in muscle cells are essential for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis and muscle performance."

Here, we report a complementary approach using gene expression profiling in a naturally occurring endothelial sarcoma of dogs (hemangiosarcoma). Naturally occurring hemangiosarcomas of Golden Retrievers clustered separately from those of non-Golden Retrievers, with contributions from transcription factors, survival factors, and from pro-inflammatory and angiogenic genes, and which were exclusively present in hemangiosarcoma and not in other tumors or normal cells (i.e., they were not due simply to variation in these genes among breeds). Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1) was among genes preferentially enriched within known pathways derived from gene set enrichment analysis when characterizing tumors from Golden Retrievers versus other breeds. Heightened VEGFR1 expression in these tumors also was apparent at the protein level and targeted inhibition of VEGFR1 increased proliferation of hemangiosarcoma cells derived from tumors of Golden Retrievers, but not from other breeds. Our results suggest heritable factors mold gene expression phenotypes, and consequently biological behavior in sporadic, naturally occurring tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2092237014,"Background The neural mechanisms of panic disorder (PD) are only incompletely understood. Higher sensitivity of patients to unspecific fear cues and similarities to conditioned fear suggest involvement of lower limbic and brainstem structures. We investigated if emotion perception is altered in remitted PD as a trait feature. Methodology/Principal Findings We used blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study neural and behavioural responses of 18 remitted PD patients and 18 healthy subjects to the emotional conflict paradigm that is based on the presentation of emotionally congruent and incongruent face/word pairs. We observed that patients showed stronger behavioural interference and lower adaptation to interference conflict. Overall performance in patients was slower but not less accurate. In the context of preceding congruence, stronger dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during conflict detection was found in patients. In the context of preceding incongruence, controls expanded dACC activity and succeeded in reducing behavioural interference. In contrast, patients demonstrated a dropout of dACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) recruitment but activation of the lower limbic areas (including right amygdala) and brainstem. Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence that stimulus order in the presentation of emotional stimuli has a markedly larger influence on the brain's response in remitted PD than in controls, leading to abnormal responses of the dACC/dmPFC and lower limbic structures (including the amygdala) and brainstem. Processing of non-panic related emotional stimuli is disturbed in PD patients despite clinical remission."
https://openalex.org/W1978448113,"Amongst all the internal gene segments (PB2. PB1, PA, NP, M and NS), the avian PB1 segment is the only one which was reassorted into the human H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains. This suggests that the reassortment of polymerase subunit genes between mammalian and avian influenza viruses might play roles for interspecies transmission. To test this hypothesis, we tested the compatibility between PB2, PB1, PA and NP derived from a H5N1 virus and a mammalian H1N1 virus. All 16 possible combinations of avian-mammalian chimeric viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) were characterized. We showed that recombinant vRNPs with a mammalian PB2 and an avian PB1 had the strongest polymerase activities in human cells at all studied temperature. In addition, viruses with this specific PB2-PB1 combination could grow efficiently in cell cultures, especially at a high incubation temperature. These viruses were potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human macrophages and pneumocytes. Viruses with this specific PB2-PB1 combination were also found to be more capable to generate adaptive mutations under a new selection pressure. These results suggested that the viral polymerase activity might be relevant for the genesis of influenza viruses of human health concern."
https://openalex.org/W2004126676,"Scavenger receptors are innate immune molecules recognizing and inducing the clearance of non-host as well as modified host molecules. To recognize a wide pattern of invading microbes, many scavenger receptors bind to common pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids. Similarly, the gp340/DMBT1 protein, a member of the human scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family, displays a wide ligand repertoire. The peptide motif VEVLXXXXW derived from its scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains is involved in some of these interactions, but most of the recognition mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we used mass spectrometry sequencing, gene inactivation, and recombinant proteins to identify Streptococcus pyogenes protein Spy0843 as a recognition receptor of gp340. Antibodies against Spy0843 are shown to protect against S. pyogenes infection, but no function or host receptor have been identified for the protein. Spy0843 belongs to the leucine-rich repeat (Lrr) family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. Experiments with truncated forms of the recombinant proteins confirmed that the Lrr region is needed in the binding of Spy0843 to gp340. The same motif of two other Lrr proteins, LrrG from the Gram-positive S. agalactiae and BspA from the Gram-negative Tannerella forsythia, also mediated binding to gp340. Moreover, inhibition of Spy0843 binding occurred with peptides containing the VEVLXXXXW motif, but also peptides devoid of the XXXXW motif inhibited binding of Lrr proteins. These results thus suggest that the conserved Lrr motif in bacterial proteins serves as a novel pattern recognition motif for unique core peptides of human scavenger receptor gp340."
https://openalex.org/W2082264965,"In previous studies, we characterized a new hormonal pathway involving a mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) acting as a mitochondrial transcription factor. In in vitro and in vivo studies, we have shown that p43 increases mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, p43 overexpression in skeletal muscle stimulates mitochondrial respiration and induces a shift in metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers which became more oxidative.Here we have studied the influence of p43 overexpression in skeletal muscle of mice during aging. We report that p43 overexpression initially increased mitochondrial mass. However, after the early rise in mitochondrial DNA occurring at 2 months of age in transgenic mice, we observed a progressive decrease of mitochondrial DNA content which became 2-fold lower at 23 months of age relatively to control animals. Moreover, p43 overexpression induced an oxidative stress characterized by a strong increase of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in quadriceps muscle, although antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were stimulated. In addition, muscle atrophy became detectable at 6 months of age, probably through a stimulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway via two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases E3, Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1.Taken together, these results demonstrate that a prolonged stimulation of mitochondrial activity induces muscle atrophy. In addition, these data underline the importance of a tight control of p43 expression and suggest that a deregulation of the direct T3 mitochondrial pathway could be one of the parameters involved in the occurrence of sarcopenia."

Here, the expression of the HIV-neutralizing mAb b12 in transgenic plants is described. The plant-derived mAb b12 was shown to have gp120 binding activity and HIV-neutralizing activity in vitro. However, it is likely that a protein-based microbicide will need to comprise a combination of two or more products, in order to provide long-lasting and cross-clade protection. Building on the expression of mAb b12 and to address the need for a combinational agent, the expression of a fusion protein of mAb b12 with cyanovirin-N, another protein microbicide, has been explored. This fusion protein molecule is predicted to have four binding sites for HIV gp120 with two different specificities. The fusion protein was assembled and expressed in planta, and functionality was confirmed by gp120 binding and HIV neutralization in vitro. Each moiety of the fusion protein retained its binding ability to gp120. In addition, this fusion protein demonstrated increased anti-HIV potency compared to b12 or CV-N alone. This fusion protein addresses the requirement to combine microbicide products, and the production in plants is a step toward resolving the issues of manufacturing scalability and cost for developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W1987973095,"The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It was identified through a search for genes encoding proteins related to estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). An endogenous ligand has not been found. Novel ERRalpha antagonists that are highly specific for binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ERRalpha have been recently reported. Research suggests that ERRalpha may be a novel drug target to treat breast cancer and/or metabolic disorders and this has led to an effort to characterize the mechanisms of action of N-[(2Z)-3-(4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-1,3-thiazolidin-2-yl idene]-5H dibenzo[a,d][7]annulen-5-amine, a novel ERRalpha specific antagonist.We demonstrate this ERRalpha ligand inhibits ERRalpha transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells by luciferase assay but does not affect mRNA levels measured by real-time RT-PCR. Also, ERalpha (ESR1) mRNA levels were not affected upon treatment with the ERRalpha antagonist, but other ERRalpha (ESRRA) target genes such as pS2 (TFF1), osteopontin (SPP1), and aromatase (CYP19A1) mRNA levels decreased. In vitro, the ERRalpha antagonist prevents the constitutive interaction between ERRalpha and nuclear receptor coactivators. Furthermore, we use Western blots to demonstrate ERRalpha protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is increased by the ERRalpha-subtype specific antagonist. We demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that the interaction between ACADM, ESRRA, and TFF1 endogenous gene promoters and ERRalpha protein is decreased when cells are treated with the ligand. Knocking-down ERRalpha (shRNA) led to similar genomic effects seen when MCF-7 cells were treated with our ERRalpha antagonist.We report the mechanism of action of a novel ERRalpha specific antagonist that inhibits transcriptional activity of ERRalpha, disrupts the constitutive interaction between ERRalpha and nuclear coactivators, and induces proteasome-dependent ERRalpha protein degradation. Additionally, we confirmed that knocking-down ERRalpha lead to similar genomic effects demonstrated in vitro when treated with the ERRalpha specific antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1977978709,"The binding and structural studies of bovine lactoperoxidase with three aromatic ligands, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylhydoxamic acid (SHA), and benzylhydroxamic acid (BHA) show that all the three compounds bind to lactoperoxidase at the substrate binding site on the distal heme side. The binding of ASA occurs without perturbing the position of conserved heme water molecule W-1, whereas both SHA and BHA displace it by the hydroxyl group of their hydroxamic acid moieties. The acetyl group carbonyl oxygen atom of ASA forms a hydrogen bond with W-1, which in turn makes three other hydrogen-bonds, one each with heme iron, His-109 N(epsilon2), and Gln-105 N(epsilon2). In contrast, in the complexes of SHA and BHA, the OH group of hydroxamic acid moiety in both complexes interacts with heme iron directly with Fe-OH distances of 3.0 and 3.2A respectively. The OH is also hydrogen bonded to His-109 N(epsilon2) and Gln-105N(epsilon2). The plane of benzene ring of ASA is inclined at 70.7 degrees from the plane of heme moiety, whereas the aromatic planes of SHA and BHA are nearly parallel to the heme plane with inclinations of 15.7 and 6.2 degrees , respectively. The mode of ASA binding provides the information about the mechanism of action of aromatic substrates, whereas the binding characteristics of SHA and BHA indicate the mode of inhibitor binding."

The venomous, predatory marine gastropod Conus miliaris has undergone ecological release and exhibits increased dietary breadth at Easter Island. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the extent of genetic differentiation of two genes expressed in the venom of C. miliaris among samples from Easter Island, American Samoa and Guam. The population from Easter Island exhibits unique frequencies of alleles that encode distinct peptides at both loci. Levels of divergence at these loci exceed observed levels of divergence observed at a mitochondrial gene region at Easter Island. Conclusions/Significance Patterns of genetic variation at two genes expressed in the venom of this C. miliaris suggest that selection has operated at these genes and contributed to the divergence of venom composition at Easter Island. These results show that ecological release is associated with strong selection pressures that promote the evolution of new phenotypes."

In the absence of protein misfolding, hydrolysis by ER α-mannosidase I plus α-glucosidase I and II results in the transfer of glycoproteins dominated by the D1,D3 isomer of Man8GlcNAc2 glycans to the Golgi apparatus (4Parodi A.J.

In the absence of the GnT III-mediated addition of bisecting GlcNAc, the two terminal α-mannose residues of the 6-antenna of hybrid-type glycans are cleaved by Golgi α-mannosidase II, forming mono-antennary complex-type glycans. These may then be processed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, generating multiantennary complex-type glycans of enormous potential heterogeneity following the sequential transfer of monosaccharides such as galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (8Schachter H.

The importance of this carbohydrate diversity in metazoan biology is illustrated by the disease phenotypes that manifest when the biosynthesis of particular glycoforms is disrupted. In humans, about 12 congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) have been identified with defects in the biosynthesis of N-linked glycans (9Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One disorder characterized by changes in glycosylation is congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with a positive acidified serum lysis test (HEMPAS)) (10Fukuda M.N.

Although the precise molecular basis of HEMPAS remains to be determined, it is characterized by either a reduction in Β1→4-galactosyltransferase, GnT II, or, in some patients, Golgi α-mannosidase II activity (11Fukuda M.N.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the increase in cell surface terminal mannose in mice deficient in Golgi α-mannosidase II leads to autoimmunity through chronic activation of the innate immune system (13Green R.S.

Lectin-resistant (Lec) cell lines harboring loss- or gain-of-function mutations affecting the biosynthesis of N-glycans have emerged as powerful tools for the investigation of these disorders (15Patnaik S.K. Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 416: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For example, genetic complementation using Lec2, containing a mutation in the cytosine monophosphate sialic acid transporter, was used to identify a novel CDG, type IIf (16Martinez-Duncker I. Dupré T. Piller V. Piller F. Candelier J.J. Trichet C. Tchernia G. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Blood. 2005; 105: 2671-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Lectin-resistant cell lines can also be used as hosts to study naturally occurring mutations, as in the case of CHO Lec23 cells used to screen α-glucosidase I mutations in CDG, type IIb (17Hong Y. Sundaram S. Shin D.J. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49894-49901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other applications of lectin-resistant cell lines include the expression of specific glycoforms of therapeutic glycoproteins. Manipulating the structure of their carbohydrate moieties modulates the pharmacological properties of glycoproteins by altering their bioactivity, serum half-life, and/or tissue tropism (18Sethuraman N. Stadheim T.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2006; 17: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For example, Β-glucocerebrosidase expressed in CHO Lec1 cells (deficient in GnT I activity) exhibits mannosylation and improved macrophage uptake for the treatment of Gaucher disease (19Hoppe H. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 76: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Lectin-resistant CHO cell lines have also been used to improve the crystallizability of glycoproteins for structural determination by x-ray crystallography (20Davis S.J. Puklavec M.J. Ashford D.A.

The expression of therapeutic glycoproteins as one or more defined “glycoforms” is essential for their optimization and may even be necessary to obtain regulatory approval (25Dwek R.A. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1998; 96: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, eukaryotic expression systems have been developed that allow glycosylation to be controlled. Recently, Pichia pastoris-based strains with human glycosyltransferases have been established, allowing the expression of glycoforms with oligomannose-, hybrid-, and some complex-type glycans (26Hamilton S.R.

However, mammalian expression remains the dominant technology in industrial settings, presumably because of its reliability for the expression of human secreted glycoproteins. Although the majority of lectin-resistant cell lines have been generated using CHO cells, no Golgi α-mannosidase II-deficient CHO cell line has been generated thus far (15Patnaik S.K. Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 416: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only one human lectin-resistant cell line, i.e. GnT I-deficient (Lec1) HEK 293S cells (29Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), has been produced. Hybrid-type glycosylation has been reported to accumulate in ricin-resistant baby hamster kidney cells (30Gleeson P.A. Feeney J. Hughes R.C.

Feeney J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hybrids from one of these lines contain a trimannosyl rather than pentamannosyl core and appear to be heavily influenced by GnT II deficiency, resulting in the formation of what are now commonly called monoantennary complex-type glycans (32Hughes R.C.

We now describe the isolation of an HEK 293T cell line mutated at the MAN2A1 locus and deficient in Golgi α-mannosidase II activity via selection with ricin. HEK 293T cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured adherently in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Sigma). Cells were plated out at a density of 4 × 106 cells/75-cm2 T-flasks. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 h (5% CO2), the medium was replaced with fresh medium (20 ml) containing 200 μg/ml ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; Sigma). Cells were grown in the presence of EMS for 20 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized. The survival rate after EMS treatment was ∼50%. One aliquot of frozen mutagenized cells was thawed and plated out at 2 × 105 cells/75-cm2 T-flask and left to expand for 5 days (∼80% confluence). These cells were then split 1:10 and grown for a further 2 days. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either 1 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml ricin (laboratory stocks, J. Michael Lord, University of Warwick). Cells were refed with this medium every 4 days (six treatments in total) until colonies formed. No cells survived multiple treatments with 10 ng/ml ricin. Seventy colonies surviving treatment with 1 ng/ml ricin were expanded to confluence in 6-well plates in medium containing ricin. The colonies were then expanded and maintained in medium with no ricin, and two vials of each of these colonies were stored in FBS, 10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen. Cytotoxicity was measured as the ability of cells to incorporate [35S]methionine into acid-precipitable material after ricin or Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PEx) treatment. Ricin-resistant cell lines were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. For initial screens, after overnight growth and washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 4 h with 100 μl of fresh DMEM/FBS (control, untreated cells) or with 100 μl of DMEM/FBS containing ricin graded in 2-fold dilutions from 10.0 to 0.156 ng/ml. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After the cells were washed twice with PBS, labeled proteins were precipitated with three washes in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (Sigma). Then the wells were washed twice with PBS, and the amount of radiolabel incorporated was determined after the addition of 200 μl of Optiphase SuperMix scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by scintillation counting in a Wallac Micro-Beta 1450 Trilux counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sensitivity to ricin is defined as the concentration (IC50) of ricin required to reduce protein synthesis to 50% of that in untreated cells. With approximate IC50 values established, assays on selected cell lines were repeated using 2-fold dilutions of ricin from 640 to 0.16 ng/ml. Accurate sensitivity values (IC50) were determined using a median effect plot (35Aghi M. Kramm C.M. Chou T.C. Breakefield X.O. Chiocca E.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cell lines were also screened for nonselected sensitivity to PEx by incubating them for 4 h with PEx in DMEM/FBS, graded in 2-fold dilutions from 5000 to 2.44 ng/ml. Ricin B chain (RTB) was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) and labeled with Alexa Fluor-647 dye using an Alexa Fluor protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The labeled RTB (RTB-Alexa 647) was divided into small aliquots, protected from light, and stored at −20 °C. 3 × 105 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 100 μl of PBS/2 mm NaN3 with a final concentration of 10 μg/ml RTB-Alexa 647 on ice for 30 min. After being washed twice with 2 ml of PBS/2 mm NaN3, cells were resuspended in PBS/2 mm NaN3 and kept on ice until being subjected to flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences immunocytometry system. 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in residual medium after centrifugation. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was added (1 ml), and cells were immediately lysed by repetitive pipetting. The homogenized samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After extraction with 0.2 ml of chloroform and precipitation with 0.5 ml of isopropanol, the pellet was washed in 75% ethanol and dissolved in 100 μl of RNase-free water (Sigma). For the generation of cDNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 10 μl of RNA (500 ng/μl) was transferred into an RNase-free 0.6-ml Microfuge tube with 0.5 ng of Oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen). The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 10 min. An RT-PCR master mix was generated using SuperScriptTM II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) and RNasin® RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). The RNA/Oligo(dT) mix was cooled at room temperature for 5 min before the addition of 9 μl of RT-PCR master mix and incubation at 42 °C for 40 min followed by 10 min at 90 °C and 5 min on ice. The cDNA product was diluted 1 in 5 using deionized water and stored at −20 °C. For a comparison of the sequences of the MAN2A1 (Golgi α-mannosidase II) and MAN2A2 (Golgi α-mannosidase IIx) genes of HEK 293T and HEK 293T Lec36 cells, the following primers were used to amplify the coding regions of the two genes: MAN2A1, forward (5′-ATGAAGTTAAGCCGCCAGTTCACCG-3′; nucleotides 1–25 of Swiss-Prot entry Q16706) and reverse (5′-TCACCTCAACTGGATTCGGAATGTGC-3′; nucleotides 3435-3410 of Q16706); and MAN2A2, forward (5′-ATGAAGCTGAAAAAGCAGGTGACAGTGTGTG-3′; nucleotides 1–31 of Swiss-Prot entry P49641) and reverse (5′-CTAACCCAAGCGGAGGCGAAAGGTAG-3′; nucleotides 3420-3395 of P49641). The PCR product pools were then sequenced directly, and the experiment was repeated to confirm the sequence traces. MAN2A1 from the cDNA of Lec36 cells was also cloned into pCR®4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen) to obtain the sequences of the two MAN2A1 alleles separately. Thirty clones were picked and sequenced to confirm the mutations found in each allele. To compare the relative mRNA expression levels of MAN2A1 and MAN2A2 in HEK 293T cells, PCR analysis was performed using serial dilutions (neat, 1:4, 1:16, 1:64, and 1:256) of cDNA prepared from HEK 293T cells. The coding regions of the two genes were amplified using the primers described above. A cDNA fragment encoding the human soluble (s) 19A extracellular region (residues 1–222) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pEE14 vector (36Bebbington C. Hentschell C. Glover D.M.

For the complementation experiments involving the co-expression of wild-type or mutant Golgi α-mannosidase II with s19A, the wild-type MAN2A1 sequence from HEK 293T cells, and the mutant alleles from HEK 293T Lec36 cells cloned into the TOPO TA vector as described above were each transferred to the pLEXm expression vector (38Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In the process, a Kozak sequence (gccacc) was inserted at the 5′- end of the cDNA adjacent to the start codon (atg) of the Golgi α-mannosidase II gene. The sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. HEK 293T and HEK 293T Lec36 cells were grown to 90% confluence and transiently transfected with pEE14/s19A using polyethyleneimine (39Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), and the medium was replaced immediately with DMEM, 2% FBS. When used, swainsonine (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada) was added immediately after transfection to a final concentration of 20 μm. Conditioned media, containing the secreted fusion protein, were collected 4 days post-transfection, centrifuged, sterile-filtered, and diluted with two volumes of PBS. The pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl. The His-tagged protein was incubated with Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 16 °C for 4 h. The beads were then packed in Bio-Rad Econo columns and washed with 20 bed volumes of PBS/10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 followed by 20 bed volumes of PBS/10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Bound proteins were eluted in 500 mm imidazole/PBS, pH 8, and concentrated to ∼300 μl for Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the target protein at >95% purity (assessed by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, quantified, and stored at 4 °C. HEK 293T Lec36 cells were co-transfected at about 40% confluence using Novagen GeneJuice® (Merck Chemicals Ltd.) with an 8:1 molar ratio of s19A and either the wild type, allele 1, or allele 2 of mutant Golgi α-mannosidase II. Twelve hours post-transfection the medium was replenished, and 2 days post-transfection the conditioned growth medium was harvested by centrifugation (6300 × g, 15 min). s19A was purified from the supernatant using Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose as described above. The activities of the wild-type and mutant forms of Golgi α-mannosidase II were evaluated by testing the endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity of purified, co-expressed s19A and by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the sugars released from s19A. The purified proteins were treated with Endo H (New England Biolabs). Seven micrograms of each protein was digested at 37 °C with 1000 units of Endo H in a final volume of 25 μl of 0.1 m NaOAc at pH 5.2. For comparison, proteins were also treated with protein N-glycanase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs). Five micrograms of proteins was digested at 37 °C with 500 units of PNGase F, pH 7.4. The extent of digestion was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis. Sampling after 1.5 and 3 h of digestion confirmed that it had gone to completion within 1.5 h. Oligosaccharides were released from bands containing ∼10 μg of s19A excised from Coomassie Blue-stained reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were washed with 20 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.0, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge before rehydration with 30 μl of 30 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.0, containing 100 units/ml PNGase F (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) and incubation for 12 h at 37 °C (40Küster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The enzymatically released N-linked glycans were eluted with water. Salts were removed by incubation at ∼24 °C (5 min) with 200 μl of acid-activated AG-50W (200–400 mesh) slurry (Bio-Rad), which was removed by filtration with a 0.45-μl pore size filter (Millex-LH, hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene). Aqueous solutions of the glycans were cleaned with a Nafion 117 membrane (41Börnsen K.O. Mohr M.D. Widmer H.M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1031-1034Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Positive ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded with a Waters-Micromass TofSpec reflectron-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass MS Technologies Ltd., Manchester, UK) fitted with delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The acceleration voltage was 20 kV, the pulse voltage was 3200 V, and the delay for the delayed extraction ion source was 500 ns. The spectra in Fig. 7 were recorded with a Waters MALDI Micro MS mass spectrometer with an extraction voltage of 12 kV. Samples were prepared by adding 0.5 μl of an aqueous solution of the sample to the matrix solution (0.3 μl of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile) on the stainless steel target plate and allowing it to dry at room temperature. The sample/matrix mixture was then recrystallized from ethanol. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with a Waters-Micromass quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-Tof) Ultima Global instrument in negative ion mode. Samples in 1:1 (v:v) methanol:water were infused through Protana (Odense, Denmark) borosilicate nanospray capillaries. Ion source conditions were the following: temperature 120 °C, nitrogen flow 50 liters/h, infusion needle potential 1.2 kV, cone voltage 100 V, RF-1 voltage 150 V. Spectra (2-s scans) were acquired with a digitization rate of 4 GHz and accumulated until a satisfactory signal:noise ratio had been obtained. The ions were observed as [M+H2PO4]− adducts, the phosphate arising from residual phosphate in the solution. For MS/MS data acquisition, the parent ion was selected at low resolution (∼5 m/z mass window) to allow transmission of isotope peaks and fragmented with argon at a pressure (recorded on the instrument’s pressure gauge) of 0.5 mbar. The voltage on the collision cell was adjusted with mass and charge to give an even distribution of fragment ions across the mass scale (typically 80–120 V). Other voltages were as recommended by the manufacturer. Instrument control and data acquisition and processing were performed with MassLynx software, version 4.0 (Waters-Micromass MS Technolog"
https://openalex.org/W2008639621,"Our previous studies have implicated CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) as a co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase whose activities yield protection against stress-induced apoptotic events. In this report, we demonstrate a stress-dependent interaction between CHIP and Daxx (death domain-associated protein). This interaction interferes with the stress-dependent association of HIPK2 with Daxx, blocking phosphorylation of serine 46 in p53 and inhibiting the p53-dependent apoptotic program. Microarray analysis confirmed suppression of the p53-dependent transcriptional portrait in CHIP(+/+) but not in CHIP(-/-) heat shocked mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The interaction between CHIP and Daxx results in ubiquitination of Daxx, which is then partitioned to an insoluble compartment of the cell. In vitro ubiquitination of Daxx by CHIP revealed that ubiquitin chain formation utilizes non-canonical lysine linkages associated with resistance to proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitination of Daxx by CHIP utilizes lysines 630 and 631 and competes with the sumoylation machinery of the cell at these residues. These studies implicate CHIP as a stress-dependent regulator of Daxx that counters the pro-apoptotic influence of Daxx in the cell. By abrogating p53-dependent apoptotic pathways and by ubiquitination competitive with Daxx sumoylation, CHIP integrates the proteotoxic stress response of the cell with cell cycle pathways that influence cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2168029148,"Visual detection of aircraft by human observers is an important element of aviation safety. To assess and ensure safety, it would be useful to be able to be able to predict the visibility, to a human observer, of an aircraft of specified size, shape, distance, and coloration. Examples include assuring safe separation among aircraft and between aircraft and unmanned vehicles, design of airport control towers, and efforts to enhance or suppress the visibility of military and rescue vehicles. We have recently developed a simple metric of pattern visibility, the Spatial Standard Observer (SSO). In this report we examine whether the SSO can predict visibility of simulated aircraft images. We constructed a set of aircraft images from three-dimensional computer graphic models, and measured the luminance contrast threshold for each image from three human observers. The data were well predicted by the SSO. Finally, we show how to use the SSO to predict visibility range for aircraft of arbitrary size, shape, distance, and coloration."
https://openalex.org/W2033070686,"Gyrase, an essential bacterial topoisomerase, is the target of several antibiotics (e.g. quinolones) as well as of bacterial toxin CcdB. This toxin, encoded by Escherichia coli toxin-antitoxin module ccd, poisons gyrase by causing inhibition of both transcription and replication. Because the molecular driving forces of gyrase unfolding and CcdB-gyrase binding were unknown, the nature of the CcdB-gyrase recognition remained elusive. Therefore, we performed a detailed thermodynamic analysis of CcdB binding to several fragments of gyrase A subunit (GyrA) that contain the CcdB-binding site. Binding of CcdB to the shorter fragments was studied directly by isothermal titration calorimetry. Its binding to the longer GyrA59 fragment in solution is kinetically limited and was therefore investigated via urea induced unfolding of the GyrA59-CcdB complex and unbound GyrA59 and CcdB, monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Model analysis of experimental data, in combination with the relevant structural information, indicates that CcdB binding to gyrase is an enthalpic process driven mainly by specific interactions between CcdB and the highly stable dimerization domain of the GyrA. The dissection of binding energetics indicates that CcdB-gyrase recognition is accompanied by opening of the tower and catalytic domain of GyrA. Such extensive structural rearrangements appear to be crucial driving forces for the functioning of the ccd toxin-antitoxin module.

Such extensive structural rearrangements appear to be crucial driving forces for the functioning of the ccd toxin-antitoxin module. DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, is one of the enzymes essential for the modulation of the topological state of DNA in bacteria (1Nöllmann M. Crisona N.J. Arimondo P.B. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Schoeffler A.J. Berger J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1465-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli gyrase exists as a heterotetramer consisting of two GyrA and two GyrB subunits. The GyrA subunit contains the catalytic domain (DNA breaking-resealing activity), whereas the ATP hydrolysis site is located on the GyrB subunit (3Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Gyrase is a well validated target of several antibacterial agents (e.g. quinolones) (4Maxwell A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In recent years resistance to these antibiotics has become a major health concern, and therefore fundamental research on alternative antibiotic leads is necessary. Certain bacterial toxins also target gyrase. One of them is the CcdB toxin encoded by the ccd operon from E. coli plasmid F (5Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 6Miki T. Park J.A. Nagao K. Murayama N. Horiuchi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CcdB bound to the dimerization domain of the GyrA subunit of gyrase suggests that CcdB can bind only to the open conformation of GyrA (7Dao-Thi M.H. Van Melderen L. De Genst E. Afif H. Buts L. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This structural information sets the basis for understanding gyrase poisoning at the molecular level. However, the key question as to the nature of the forces that drive the binding of CcdB to GyrA and how they are connected to the structural alterations of these proteins and to the function of the ccd toxin-antitoxin module (8Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) remains unanswered. An attempt to answer it requires combination of the structural information with the detailed thermodynamic analysis of CcdB binding to various GyrA fragments and unfolding of proteins involved in the binding process. Therefore, we studied binding of CcdB to the fragments GyrA59, GyrA14, and GyrA12 (Fig. 1). GyrA59 is the functionally relevant fragment because it is, in the presence of GyrB, able to relax negative supercoils of DNA (9Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the binding of CcdB to GyrA59 in solution cannot be followed directly, presumably because of the kinetically limited step of opening of tower and catalytic domains of GyrA59 (Fig. 1), which enables CcdB to access the binding site located on the GyrA59 dimerization domain (7Dao-Thi M.H. Van Melderen L. De Genst E. Afif H. Buts L. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the thermal denaturation of GyrA59, CcdB, and their complex GyrA59-CcdB is irreversible and because it is known that efficient CcdB binding to GyrA59 at relatively low temperatures necessitates chemical denaturation and renaturation of GyrA59 (11Bahassi E.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10936-10944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we attempted to investigate the CcdB binding to GyrA59 via the reversible urea denaturation of GyrA59-CcdB, GyrA59, and CcdB monitored by CD spectroscopy. Using these data, the thermodynamics of CcdB binding to GyrA59 was successfully described from the thermodynamic cycle in which the thermodynamic functions characterizing the GyrA59-CcdB denatured state were assumed to be equal to the sum of the corresponding functions characterizing the denatured states of free GyrA59 and CcdB. By contrast, binding of CcdB to the shorter GyrA fragments GyrA12 and GyrA14 (Fig. 1) can be followed directly by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), 2The abbreviation used is: ITCisothermal titration calorimetry. which appears to be the most appropriate method for investigating binding energetics (12Ladbury J.E.

The thermodynamic parameters of binding and unfolding obtained by global analysis of CD and ITC data were dissected into enthalpic and entropic contributions that were further discussed in terms of structural features of the bound (unbound) and folded (unfolded) states of CcdB and GyrA59 and functioning of the ccd toxin-antitoxin module. isothermal titration calorimetry. The preparation and purification of CcdB and gyrase fragments GyrA12, GyrA14, and GyrA59 has been described elsewhere (19Buts L. De Jonge N. Loris R. Wyns L. Dao-Thi M.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F.

Their structure and the corresponding amino acid sequences are given in Fig. 1. The GyrA59-CcdB complex was formed by (urea) denaturation/renaturation and purified as described previously (11Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N. Messens J. Gellert M. Couturier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10936-10944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CcdB and all gyrase fragments are dimers in solution at nondenaturing conditions. Therefore, molar concentrations of these proteins are expressed in moldimer liter−1. Prior to calorimetric and spectroscopic measurements, solutions of purified proteins were dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffer (0.02 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.5). All of the samples for the urea denaturation experiments were prepared by mixing 10 m urea and protein stock solutions to a final urea concentration between 0 and 8 m. The pH level of all solutions was checked and adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of NaOH. The concentrations of protein solutions were determined spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m GdmHCl at 25 °C. using extinction coefficients obtained from the method introduced by Gill and von Hippel (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5083) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopy measurements were performed with an AVIV Model 62A DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates) at different temperatures lower than the one at which the proteins start to denature irreversibly. Changes in secondary structure at increasing urea concentrations (0–8 m) were followed by measuring the ellipticity at 225 nm in a 1-cm cuvette at a protein concentration of ∼0.7 μm (see Fig. 2). The reversibility of the urea-induced transitions was checked by diluting the protein solutions from the post-transition urea concentrations to the pretransition urea concentrations. By comparing the CD spectra measured for these diluted solutions with those obtained for the same solutions prepared directly from urea and buffer solutions, we estimated the extent of reversibility of the observed transitions to be higher than 80%. Experiments were performed between 15 and 40 °C in a VP-ITC calorimeter from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA). Before each experiment the protein solutions were degassed for ∼20 min. A solution of GyrA12 or GyrA14 (c = ∼40 μm) was titrated into a solution of CcdB (c = ∼2 μm). The enthalpy of interaction (ΔHT) was obtained by integration of the raw signal, corrected for the corresponding heat of dilution, and expressed per mole of added GyrA12 or GyrA14 per injection (see Fig. 4, a and b). In addition we performed a competition titration of the GyrA59-CcdB complex (c = ∼2 μm) with GyrA14 (c = ∼80 μm) at 25 °C (see Fig. 4c). Urea denaturation of GyrA59, CcdB, and the GyrA59-CcdB complex can be successfully described in terms of a two-state or three-state model. The models can be defined as follows, View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where A2, B2, and A2B2 represent GyrA59 dimer, CcdB dimer and GyrA59-CcdB heterotetramer in their native (N) sates, respectively, whereas superscript D denotes the proteins in their denatured (D) states. The transition to the intermediate state (I) accompanying the denaturation of A2B2 complex is assumed to be monomolecular. The apparent equilibrium constants in Models 1–3 are functions of temperature (T) and urea concentration (u) and can be defined as: KA(T,u) = [A2D]/[A2], KB(T,u) = [BD]2/[B2], KI(T,u) = [I]/[A2,B2], and KID(T,u) = [A2D][BD]2/[I]. The quantities in the square brackets represent the corresponding equilibrium molar concentrations that are dependent on T and u. According to the models the measured ellipticity (θ(T,u)) at a given wavelength, T and u can be expressed in terms of the corresponding contributions θN(T,u), θI(T,u), and θD(T,u) that characterize pure states N, I, and D as follows,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where αN(T,u), αI(T,u), and αD(T,u) represent fractions of proteins in states N, I, and D, respectively, at given T and u. In the case of A2 denaturation, the fractions are defined as αN(T,u) = αA2(T,u) = [A2]/[A2]t and αD(T,u) = αA2D(T,u) = [A2D]/[A2]t, in the case of B2 as αN(T,u) = αB2(T,u) = [B2]/[B2]t and αD(T,u) = αBD(T,u) = 1/2[BD]/[B2]t, and in the case of A2B2 denaturation αN(T,u) = αA2B2(T,u) = [A2B2]/[A2]t, whereas αD(T,u) and θD(T,u) are defined as αD(T,u) = αA2D(T,u) = αBD(T,u) and θD(T,u) = θA2D(T,u) + 2θBD(T,u), respectively ([A2]t and [B2]t represent total GyrA59 dimer and CcdB dimer concentrations that are in the case of A2B2 denaturation equal to the total concentration of the complex [A2B2]t). Because θN(T,u) and θD(T,u) can be estimated at any measured T as linear functions of u (pre- and post-transitional base lines; see Fig. 2b), one can, by taking into account that αN(T,u) + αI(T,u) + αD(T,u) = 1, express the measured ellipticity in the terms of a normalized signal (see Figs. 2C and 3) as follows,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where (θ(T,u) − θN(T,u))/(θD(T,u) − θN(T,u)) is obtained directly from the experiment, whereas the expression FIαI(T,u) + αD(T,u) can be, as shown below, calculated from the model. For two-state denaturation of A2 and B2, the first term in Equation 2 is equal to zero (FIαI = 0). For A2B2 denaturation the quantity FI can be assumed to be temperature-independent and was set as a global model (adjustable) parameter. On the other hand, Δθ(T,u)/ΔθD(T,u) can be connected to the thermodynamics of unfolding through the proposed models (Models 1–3) according to which the linear dependence of the standard Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔGi(T,u)o) on u for the i-th transition (i = A, B, I, or ID) can be at any T expressed as follows,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where mi is an empirical parameter correlated strongly to the amount of protein (A2, B2, A2B2, or I) surface area-exposed to the solvent upon denaturation (23Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz M.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) and assumed to be temperature-independent. ΔGi(T)o is the standard Gibbs free energy of unfolding in the absence of urea (u = 0) that may be expressed in terms of the corresponding standard Gibbs free energy (ΔGi(To)o) and standard enthalpy of unfolding (ΔHi(To)o) at a reference temperature To = 25 °C and standard heat capacity of unfolding (ΔCP,io) (assumed to be temperature-independent) through the Gibbs-Helmholtz relation (integrated form).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It follows from Equations 3 and 4 that the model (adjustable) parameters ΔGi(To)o, ΔHi(To)o, ΔCP,io, and mi define ΔGi(T,u)o and thus the corresponding Ki(T,u) (Ki(T,u) = exp(−ΔGi(T,u)o/RT)). Consequently, they specify the populations of species in solution (Ki(T,u) = f(αj(T,u); j = N, I, or D), Σjαj(T,u) = 1 ⇒ αj(T,u)) and the model function (Equation 2) at any u and T (see Fig. 3).

The corresponding standard Gibbs free energy ΔGi(To)o and standard enthalpy ΔHi(To)o at To = 25 °C and standard heat capacity of binding ΔCP,io (assumed to be temperature-independent) define ΔGi(T)o and ΔHi(T)o at any T by Equations 4 and 5. Thus, the values of adjustable parameters ΔGi(To)o, ΔHi(To)o, and ΔCP,io completely define the temperature dependence of the binding constant [Ki(T) = exp(−ΔGi(T)o/RT)], the model function (Equation 6) at any T and consequently the corresponding thermodynamic profiles (see Fig. 6). The best fit values of the adjustable parameters (Table 1) were obtained using the nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt regression procedure (24Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Oxford, UK1992: 650-694Google Scholar). The competition titration of the GyrA59-CcdB complex with GyrA14 (see Fig. 4c) can be interpreted in terms of a displacement reaction: GyrA59-CcdB + GyrA14 ↔ GyrA14-CcdB + GyrA59. The general form of the model function for its description is the same as for 1:1 binding (Equation 6), where i represents the formed GyrA14-CcdB complex. In contrast to 1:1 model the derivative in Equation 6 for the displacement model can be expressed as [(Ki(T)/(2Ki(T) − 2)][1 − (Ki(T)(r − 1) + 2)/(Ki(T)2(r − 1)2 + 4Ki(T)r)0.5], where Ki(T) is the corresponding apparent displacement constant, and r is the GyrA14/CcdB molar ratio.

Here we report that BH3 peptides corresponding to the death domain of BH3-only proteins, which bind all the pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, induce cell death in the absence of BAX and BAK. The BH3 peptides did not cause the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria or from mitochondria in cells. However, the BH3 peptides did cause a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential but did not induce the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Interestingly, the BH3 peptides induced mitochondria to undergo fission in the absence of BAX and BAK. The binding of BCL-XL with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a GTPase known to regulate mitochondrial fission, increased in the presence of BH3 peptides. These results suggest that pro-survival BCL-2 proteins regulate mitochondrial fission and cell death in the absence of BAX and BAK."
https://openalex.org/W2043467374,"Background While the estimated prevalence of HIV in India experienced a downward revision in 2007, the patterning and distribution of HIV in the population remains unclear. We examined the individual and state-level socioeconomic patterning of individual HIV status among adult men and women in India as well as the patterning of other individual demographic and behavioral determinants of HIV status. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted logistic regression models accounting for the survey design using nationally representative, cross-sectional data on 100,030 women and men from the 2005–2006 India National Family Health survey which, for the first time, provided objective assessments of HIV seroprevalence. Although there was a weak relationship between household wealth and risk of being HIV-positive, there was a clear negative relationship between individual education attainment and risk of being HIV-positive among both men and women. A 1000 Rupee change in the per capita net state domestic product was associated with a 4% and 5% increase in the risk for positive HIV status among men and women, respectively. State-level income inequality was associated with increased risk of HIV for men. Marital status and selected sexual behavior indicators were significant predictors of HIV status among women whereas the age effect was the most dominant predictor of HIV infection among men. Conclusions/Significance Although the prevalence of HIV in India is low, the lack of strong wealth patterning in the risk of HIV suggests a more generalized distribution of HIV risk than some of India's high-risk group HIV prevention policies have assumed. The positive association between state economic development and individual risk for HIV is intriguing and requires further scrutiny."
https://openalex.org/W2013637862,"The Amphiumidae contains three species of elongate, permanently aquatic salamanders with four diminutive limbs that append one, two, or three toes. Two of the species, Amphiuma means and A. tridactylum, are among the largest salamanders in the world, reaching lengths of more than one meter, whereas the third species (A. pholeter), extinct amphiumids, and closely related salamander families are relatively small. Amphiuma means and A. tridactylum are widespread species and live in a wide range of lowland aquatic habitats on the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States, whereas A. pholeter is restricted to very specialized organic muck habitats and is syntopic with A. means. Here we present analyses of sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear loci from across the distribution of the three taxa to assess lineage diversity, relationships, and relative timing of divergence in amphiumid salamanders. In addition we analyze the evolution of gigantism in the clade. Our analyses indicate three lineages that have diverged since the late Miocene, that correspond to the three currently recognized species, but the two gigantic species are not each other's closest relatives. Given that the most closely related salamander families and fossil amphiumids from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene are relatively small, our results suggest at least two extreme changes in body size within the Amphuimidae. Gigantic body size either evolved once as the ancestral condition of modern amphiumas, with a subsequent strong size reduction in A. pholeter, or gigantism independently evolved twice in the modern species, A. means and A. tridactylum. These patterns are concordant with differences in habitat breadth and range size among lineages, and have implications for reproductive isolation and diversification of amphiumid salamanders."

Experiments were performed with chemically modified cAMP analogues that preferentially target regulatory subunit (R) I or RII holoenzymes, respectively, in hepatocytes. The data suggest that the dissociation of RI- but not RII-containing holoenzymes, as well as catalytic activity of PKA, is required for apical lumen development in response to elevated levels of cAMP and oncostatin M.

Hepatocytes perform most of the metabolic functions of the liver. For this, their asymmetric or polarized architecture is crucial. Thus, a sinusoidal or basolateral surface domain faces the space of Disse and allows the uptake/secretion of proteins and lipids from/into the blood, whereas a bile canalicular or apical surface domain faces the bile canaliculi and is equipped with proteins and lipids that facilitate bile secretion and protect the hepatocytes from the detergent-like action of biliary components. Loss of functional and/or structural hepatocyte polarity leads to hepatocyte dedifferentiation and liver disease. Understanding the cell biological and molecular principles that underlie hepatocyte polarity establishment and maintenance is important for the following reasons: (i) for developing therapeutic strategies to combat liver disease, and (ii) for the development of culture conditions that preserve hepatocyte differentiation in cell culture, e.g. for their application in bioartificial liver systems.In vitro hepatocyte models have long suffered from limited or inefficient polarization.

At the morphological level, HepG2 cells readily and reproducibly develop apical surface domains and bile canalicular lumens between neighboring cells as a function of time in culture (10Chiu J.H.

Moreover, following the deposition of extracellular matrix components, HepG2 cells spatially reorganize and display bile canalicular lumen morphogenesis that resembles the early organizational pattern during liver development (3Herrema H. Czajkowska D. Théard D. van der Wouden J.M. Kalicharan D. Zolghadr B. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3291-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells therefore provide a suitable cell culture model for the study of hepatocyte polarity and bile canalicular lumen development (14Kelly J.H. Darlington G.J. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate hepatocyte morphogenesis and the formation of the apical surface and bile canalicular lumens are not well understood, but they include among others the interleukin 6 family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) (15Kamiya A.

OSM influences a variety of cellular events that contribute to hepatocyte differentiation during liver development, which include the transcription of HNF4α-regulated genes (16Kamiya A. Inoue Y.

The transcriptional regulation of protein expression and the establishment of proper cell-cell adhesions allow bile canalicular lumen development.The first steps in the structural and functional development of apical bile canalicular plasma membrane domains and lumens are believed to involve the local remodeling of the lateral plasma membrane and cytoskeleton, the establishment of intercellular adhesion junctions, and the targeted supply of bulk membrane, fluid, and specific proteins and lipids that confer apical identity to the newly formed surface domain (reviewed in Ref. 23Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Van Ijzendoorn S.C. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of cAMP play an important role in this process. Indeed, extracellular agents that stimulate cAMP production in the cells via adenylyl cyclase promote membrane trafficking to the apical plasma membrane domain and apical surface development (23Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Van Ijzendoorn S.C. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) stimulate several apical surface-directed trafficking pathways in hepatic cells, including those originating from the Golgi apparatus (24Zegers M.M. Hoekstra D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), from the basolateral surface (transcytosis) (24Zegers M.M. Hoekstra D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Roelofsen H. Soroka C.J. Keppler D. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and from the subapical compartment/common endosome (13van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3449-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cAMP/PKA-stimulated trafficking from the subapical compartment/common endosome was demonstrated to be necessary for apical surface development (13van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3449-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Little is known about the downstream effectors of cAMP in the development of apical lumens. Although some effects of cAMP can be mediated by the Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac (27de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 28Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), the primary intracellular target of cAMP is PKA. Following binding of cAMP to the regulatory (R) subunits of PKA holoenzymes, these dissociate from and allow the activation of the catalytic (C) subunits. Inhibition of PKA catalytic activity inhibits (cAMP-stimulated) apical membrane-directed trafficking and prevents apical lumen development (29Van IJzendoorn S.C. Van Der Wouden J.M. Liebisch G. Schmitz G. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the process of PKA-controlled membrane trafficking and apical lumen development is activated by the extracellular cytokine OSM (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, exposure of HepG2 cells to OSM activates PKA-dependent membrane trafficking to the apical plasma membrane domain and ensuing apical surface development, whereas the inhibition of apically directed trafficking by H89 prevents the stimulatory effect of OSM on cell polarity (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, how OSM and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways connect in the cell is not clear.Cells express different PKA isoforms that are composed of distinct regulatory and catalytic subunits. It is not known whether cAMP and OSM require the enzymatic activity of the same PKA holoenzyme(s) to stimulate apical cell surface and lumen development. For instance, we have recently shown that OSM, but not cAMP analogues, stimulates the association of the PKA R subunit IIα with centrosomes (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that OSM and cAMP utilize PKA signaling differently. The purpose of this study was to identify the specific PKA holoenzyme(s) that mediates the cell polarity-stimulating effects of OSM and cAMP in HepG2 cells.DISCUSSIONcAMP and PKA have been implicated in the dynamics of functional apical cell surface domains and apical lumens in various epithelial cell types, including hepatocytes (reviewed in Ref. 23Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Van Ijzendoorn S.C. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PKA is a holoenzyme complex composed of regulatory and catalytic subunits, distinguishing type I (RI/C) and type II (RII/C) isoforms. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether specific PKA holoenzymes are involved in the development of the apical bile canalicular surface and lumen in human HepG2 cells. For this, we employed chemically modified pairs of cAMP analogues that have been reported to preferentially bind to RI or RII subunits in in vitro assays with purified PKA subunits. Using the recently developed BRET-based biosensor (30Prinz A. Diskar M. Erlbruch A. Herberg F.W. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1616-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that specific combinations of modified cAMP pairs can also be used in living cells to selectively dissociate either RI or RII holoenzymes. Furthermore, our assay showed that FSK/IBMX and Bt2cAMP cause the dissociation of both RI and RII holoenzymes, whereas isoproterenol causes the selective dissociation of RII holoenzymes in HepG2 cells. Finally, our assay demonstrated that the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-8-Cl-cAMPS preferentially prevented the dissociation of RI/C holoenzymes following treatment of the cells with Bt2cAMP. Chemically modified cAMP analogues are therefore a useful tool to determine the selective involvement of PKA holoenzymes in processes occurring in living cell systems.Our combined data with the site-selective cAMP analogues (PKA agonists and antagonists) and inhibitors of the ATP site of the catalytic subunits indicate that [cAMP]i stimulates cell polarity development in a manner that requires the dissociation of type I PKA holoenzymes and subsequent catalytic activity.We have recently demonstrated that OSM signaling stimulates apical lumen development in a p42/44 MAPK- and also PKA-dependent manner (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of OSM on apical lumen development requires the enzymatic activity of PKA downstream of MAPK phosphorylation and does not require de novo cAMP production, suggesting that OSM and PKA signaling join at the level of the PKA holoenzyme. Experiments with (Rp)-8-Cl-cAMPS, a cAMP antagonist that preferentially binds to RI subunits but without causing holoenzyme dissociation, suggest that, similar to cAMP, the stimulatory effect of OSM-MAPK signaling on apical lumen development requires type I PKA holoenzymes. However, in contrast to cAMP, OSM signaling does not stimulate the dissociation of type I (or type II) PKA holoenzymes. It thus appears that OSM stimulates apical lumen development through MEK/MAPK and requires a base level of PKA activity that is under control of RI regulatory subunits. Taken together, we conclude that RI-controlled PKA activity is essential for cAMP- and OSM-mediated apical lumen development in HepG2 cells.In a previous study, we showed that treatment of HepG2 cells with OSM, but not Bt2cAMP, stimulated the association of RIIα with centrosomes (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol.

This required MAPK phosphorylation but not the enzymatic activity of PKA. The recruitment of RIIα at centrosomes, but not the enzymatic activity of PKA, was shown to be required for the polarized subapical positioning of the centrosome (22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, displacing RIIα from centrosomes effectively prevented the stimulatory effect of OSM, but not that of cAMP, on apical lumen development (21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By combining these data with the data presented in this study, it is suggested that the OSM effect on apical lumen development, mediated via PKA, includes a mobilization of RIIα to a target site in the subapical area (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, in addition, includes a requirement for the base level of PKA type I activity (this study) downstream of or parallel to OSM-stimulated RIIα association with centrosomes. Our current working model is depicted in Fig. 6.Interestingly, the ERM proteins radixin and ezrin predominantly associate with the bile canalicular surface (39Fouassier L. Duan C.Y. Feranchak A.P. Yun C.H. Sutherland E. Simon F. Fitz J.G. Doctor R.B. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where they act as scaffolding proteins and control apical cytoskeleton dynamics and apical membrane structure. Radixin and ezrin function as protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) and recruit both PKA RI and RII subunits (40Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Loss of radixin, the predominant ERM protein in hepatocytes, inhibits bile canalicular membrane structure and function (41Wang W. Soroka C.J. Mennone A. Rahner C. Harry K. Pypaert M. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 878-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and causes hyperbilirubinemia (42Kikuchi S. Hata M. Fukumoto K. Yamane Y. Matsui T. Tamura A. Yonemura S. Yamagishi H. Keppler D. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to investigate in future studies the involvement of ERM proteins in PKA signaling-dependent apical bile canalicular surface and lumen development, and to unravel the specific contributions of type I and type II PKA in this process.The study of the PKA RI subunit and its involvement in liver development in model organisms is difficult. The targeted disruption of RIα and subsequent unregulated PKA activity in mice leads to failure of embryos at the earliest stages of development. Interestingly, one of the most prominent features of these mice is the absence of a definitive heart tube (43Amieux P.S. Howe D.G. Knickerbocker H. Lee D.C. Su T. Laszlo G.S. Idzerda R.L.

It will be of interest to investigate whether RI-controlled PKA regulates common cellular processes in different organs such as the heart and liver that are important for the development of apical lumens in general. Hepatocytes perform most of the metabolic functions of the liver. For this, their asymmetric or polarized architecture is crucial. Thus, a sinusoidal or basolateral surface domain faces the space of Disse and allows the uptake/secretion of proteins and lipids from/into the blood, whereas a bile canalicular or apical surface domain faces the bile canaliculi and is equipped with proteins and lipids that facilitate bile secretion and protect the hepatocytes from the detergent-like action of biliary components. Loss of functional and/or structural hepatocyte polarity leads to hepatocyte dedifferentiation and liver disease. Understanding the cell biological and molecular principles that underlie hepatocyte polarity establishment and maintenance is important for the following reasons: (i) for developing therapeutic strategies to combat liver disease, and (ii) for the development of culture conditions that preserve hepatocyte differentiation in cell culture, e.g. for their application in bioartificial liver systems. In vitro hepatocyte models have long suffered from limited or inefficient polarization. However, various cell models such as WIF-B (1Ihrke G. Neufeld E.B. Meads T. Shanks M.R. Cassio D. Laurent M.

The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate hepatocyte morphogenesis and the formation of the apical surface and bile canalicular lumens are not well understood, but they include among others the interleukin 6 family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) (15Kamiya A.

OSM influences a variety of cellular events that contribute to hepatocyte differentiation during liver development, which include the transcription of HNF4α-regulated genes (16Kamiya A. Inoue Y. Gonzalez F.J. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), metabolic functions (17Dong J. Mandenius C.F. Lübberstedt M. Urbaniak T. Nüssler A.K. Knobeloch D.

Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1951-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and the development of apical-basal polarity (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol.

The transcriptional regulation of protein expression and the establishment of proper cell-cell adhesions allow bile canalicular lumen development. The first steps in the structural and functional development of apical bile canalicular plasma membrane domains and lumens are believed to involve the local remodeling of the lateral plasma membrane and cytoskeleton, the establishment of intercellular adhesion junctions, and the targeted supply of bulk membrane, fluid, and specific proteins and lipids that confer apical identity to the newly formed surface domain (reviewed in Ref. 23Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Van Ijzendoorn S.C. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of cAMP play an important role in this process. Indeed, extracellular agents that stimulate cAMP production in the cells via adenylyl cyclase promote membrane trafficking to the apical plasma membrane domain and apical surface development (23Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Van Ijzendoorn S.C. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) stimulate several apical surface-directed trafficking pathways in hepatic cells, including those originating from the Golgi apparatus (24Zegers M.M. Hoekstra D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), from the basolateral surface (transcytosis) (24Zegers M.M. Hoekstra D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Roelofsen H. Soroka C.J. Keppler D. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and from the subapical compartment/common endosome (13van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3449-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cAMP/PKA-stimulated trafficking from the subapical compartment/common endosome was demonstrated to be necessary for apical surface development (13van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3449-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Little is known about the downstream effectors of cAMP in the development of apical lumens. Although some effects of cAMP can be mediated by the Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac (27de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 28Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), the primary intracellular target of cAMP is PKA. Following binding of cAMP to the regulatory (R) subunits of PKA holoenzymes, these dissociate from and allow the activation of the catalytic (C) subunits. Inhibition of PKA catalytic activity inhibits (cAMP-stimulated) apical membrane-directed trafficking and prevents apical lumen development (29Van IJzendoorn S.C. Van Der Wouden J.M. Liebisch G. Schmitz G. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the process of PKA-controlled membrane trafficking and apical lumen development is activated by the extracellular cytokine OSM (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, exposure of HepG2 cells to OSM activates PKA-dependent membrane trafficking to the apical plasma membrane domain and ensuing apical surface development, whereas the inhibition of apically directed trafficking by H89 prevents the stimulatory effect of OSM on cell polarity (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, how OSM and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways connect in the cell is not clear. Cells express different PKA isoforms that are composed of distinct regulatory and catalytic subunits. It is not known whether cAMP and OSM require the enzymatic activity of the same PKA holoenzyme(s) to stimulate apical cell surface and lumen development. For instance, we have recently shown that OSM, but not cAMP analogues, stimulates the association of the PKA R subunit IIα with centrosomes (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that OSM and cAMP utilize PKA signaling differently. The purpose of this study was to identify the specific PKA holoenzyme(s) that mediates the cell polarity-stimulating effects of OSM and cAMP in HepG2 cells. DISCUSSIONcAMP and PKA have been implicated in the dynamics of functional apical cell surface domains and apical lumens in various epithelial cell types, including hepatocytes (reviewed in Ref. 23Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Van Ijzendoorn S.C. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PKA is a holoenzyme complex composed of regulatory and catalytic subunits, distinguishing type I (RI/C) and type II (RII/C) isoforms. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether specific PKA holoenzymes are involved in the development of the apical bile canalicular surface and lumen in human HepG2 cells. For this, we employed chemically modified pairs of cAMP analogues that have been reported to preferentially bind to RI or RII subunits in in vitro assays with purified PKA subunits. Using the recently developed BRET-based biosensor (30Prinz A. Diskar M. Erlbruch A. Herberg F.W. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1616-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that specific combinations of modified cAMP pairs can also be used in living cells to selectively dissociate either RI or RII holoenzymes. Furthermore, our assay showed that FSK/IBMX and Bt2cAMP cause the dissociation of both RI and RII holoenzymes, whereas isoproterenol causes the selective dissociation of RII holoenzymes in HepG2 cells. Finally, our assay demonstrated that the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-8-Cl-cAMPS preferentially prevented the dissociation of RI/C holoenzymes following treatment of the cells with Bt2cAMP. Chemically modified cAMP analogues are therefore a useful tool to determine the selective involvement of PKA holoenzymes in processes occurring in living cell systems.Our combined data with the site-selective cAMP analogues (PKA agonists and antagonists) and inhibitors of the ATP site of the catalytic subunits indicate that [cAMP]i stimulates cell polarity development in a manner that requires the dissociation of type I PKA holoenzymes and subsequent catalytic activity.We have recently demonstrated that OSM signaling stimulates apical lumen development in a p42/44 MAPK- and also PKA-dependent manner (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of OSM on apical lumen development requires the enzymatic activity of PKA downstream of MAPK phosphorylation and does not require de novo cAMP production, suggesting that OSM and PKA signaling join at the level of the PKA holoenzyme. Experiments with (Rp)-8-Cl-cAMPS, a cAMP antagonist that preferentially binds to RI subunits but without causing holoenzyme dissociation, suggest that, similar to cAMP, the stimulatory effect of OSM-MAPK signaling on apical lumen development requires type I PKA holoenzymes. However, in contrast to cAMP, OSM signaling does not stimulate the dissociation of type I (or type II) PKA holoenzymes. It thus appears that OSM stimulates apical lumen development through MEK/MAPK and requires a base level of PKA activity that is under control of RI regulatory subunits. Taken together, we conclude that RI-controlled PKA activity is essential for cAMP- and OSM-mediated apical lumen development in HepG2 cells.In a previous study, we showed that treatment of HepG2 cells with OSM, but not Bt2cAMP, stimulated the association of RIIα with centrosomes (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol.

This required MAPK phosphorylation but not the enzymatic activity of PKA. The recruitment of RIIα at centrosomes, but not the enzymatic activity of PKA, was shown to be required for the polarized subapical positioning of the centrosome (22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, displacing RIIα from centrosomes effectively prevented the stimulatory effect of OSM, but not that of cAMP, on apical lumen development (21Van IJzendoorn S.C. Théard D. Van Der Wouden J.M. Visser W. Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By combining these data with the data presented in this study, it is suggested that the OSM effect on apical lumen development, mediated via PKA, includes a mobilization of RIIα to a target site in the subapical area (20van der Wouden J.M. van IJzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wojtal K.A. Hoekstra D. van Ijzendoorn S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, in addition, includes a requirement for the base level of PKA type I activity (this study) downstream of or parallel to OSM-stimulated RIIα association with centrosomes. Our current working model is depicted in Fig. 6.Interestingly, the ERM proteins radixin and ezrin predominantly associate with the bile canalicular surface (39Fouassier L. Duan C.Y. Feranchak A.P. Yun C.H. Sutherland E. Simon F. Fitz J.G. Doctor R.B. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where they act as scaffolding proteins and control apical cytoskeleton dynamics and apical membrane structure. Radixin and ezrin function as protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) and recruit both PKA RI and RII subunits (40Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Loss of radixin, the predominant ERM protein in hepatocytes, inhibits bile canalicular membrane structure and function (41Wang W. Soroka C.J. Mennone A. Rahner C. Harry K. Pypaert M. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 878-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and causes hyperbilirubinemia (42Kikuchi S. Hata M. Fukumoto K. Yamane Y. Matsui T. Tamura A.

It will be of interest to investigate in future studies the involvement of ERM proteins in PKA signaling-dependent apical bile canalicular surface and lumen development, and to unravel the specific contributions of type I and type II PKA in this process.The study of the PKA RI subunit and its involvement in liver development in model organisms is difficult. The targeted disruption of RIα and subsequent unregulated PKA activity in mice leads to failure of embryos at the earliest stages of development. Interestingly, one of the most prominent features of these mice is the absence of a definitive heart tube (43Amieux P.S. Howe D.G. Knickerbocker H. Lee D.C. Su T. Laszlo G.S. Idzerda R.L.
