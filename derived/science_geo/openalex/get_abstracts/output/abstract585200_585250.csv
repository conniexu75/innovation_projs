https://openalex.org/W2608899726,"Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate in many vertebrate tissues with age and contribute to age-related pathologies, presumably through their secretion of factors contributing to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Removal of SnCs delays several pathologies and increases healthy lifespan. Aging and trauma are risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage leading to pain and physical disability. Senescent chondrocytes are found in cartilage tissue isolated from patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, yet their role in disease pathogenesis is unknown. To test the idea that SnCs might play a causative role in OA, we used the p16-3MR transgenic mouse, which harbors a p16INK4a (Cdkn2a) promoter driving the expression of a fusion protein containing synthetic Renilla luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein domains, as well as a truncated form of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). This mouse strain allowed us to selectively follow and remove SnCs after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). We found that SnCs accumulated in the articular cartilage and synovium after ACLT, and selective elimination of these cells attenuated the development of post-traumatic OA, reduced pain and increased cartilage development. Intra-articular injection of a senolytic molecule that selectively killed SnCs validated these results in transgenic, non-transgenic and aged mice. Selective removal of the SnCs from in vitro cultures of chondrocytes isolated from patients with OA undergoing total knee replacement decreased expression of senescent and inflammatory markers while also increasing expression of cartilage tissue extracellular matrix proteins. Collectively, these findings support the use of SnCs as a therapeutic target for treating degenerative joint disease."

Here, we show that cardiac macrophages facilitate electrical conduction through the distal atrioventricular node, where conducting cells densely intersperse with elongated macrophages expressing connexin 43. When coupled to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes via connexin-43-containing gap junctions, cardiac macrophages have a negative resting membrane potential and depolarize in synchrony with cardiomyocytes. Conversely, macrophages render the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes more positive and, according to computational modeling, accelerate their repolarization. Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing macrophages improves atrioventricular conduction, whereas conditional deletion of connexin 43 in macrophages and congenital lack of macrophages delay atrioventricular conduction. In the Cd11bDTR mouse, macrophage ablation induces progressive atrioventricular block. These observations implicate macrophages in normal and aberrant cardiac conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2608932173,"Hypoxia plays a critical role during the evolution of malignant cells and tumour microenvironment (TME).Tumour-derived exosomes contain informative microRNAs involved in the interaction of cancer and stromal cells, thus contributing to tissue remodelling of tumour microenvironment. This study aims to clarify how hypoxia affects tumour angiogenesis through exosomes shed from lung cancer cells. Lung cancer cells produce more exosomes under hypoxic conditions than do parental cells under normoxic conditions. miR-23a was significantly upregulated in exosomes from lung cancer under hypoxic conditions. Exosomal miR-23a directly suppressed its target prolyl hydroxylase 1 and 2 (PHD1 and 2), leading to the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α) in endothelial cells. Consequently, hypoxic lung cancer cells enhanced angiogenesis by exosomes derived from hypoxic cancer under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, exosomal miR-23a also inhibits tight junction protein ZO-1, thereby increasing vascular permeability and cancer transendothelial migration. Inhibition of miR-23a by inhibitor administration decreased angiogenesis and tumour growth in a mouse model. Furthermore, elevated levels of circulating miR-23a are found in the sera of lung cancer patients, and miR-23a levels are positively correlated with proangiogenic activities. Taken together, our study reveals the clinical relevance and prognostic value of cancer-derived exosomal miR-23a under hypoxic conditions, and investigates a unique intercellular communication, mediated by cancer-derived exosomes, which modulates tumour vasculature."

Inactivation occurs so rapidly that relatively little K+ current is observed immediately following membrane depolarization, during the early phase of the AP. As the membrane repolarizes, however, hERG reopens as it recovers from inactivation, facilitating rapid AP termination. When hERG is defective, the cardiac AP is prolonged, resulting in a hallmark lengthening of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) (Curran et al., 1995Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W.

This clinical condition, known as Long QT syndrome (LQT), is a harbinger of the lethal arrhythmia torsade de pointes (Viskin, 1999Viskin S.

Murawsky M.K. Grau J. Lewis E.W. The antipsychotic agent sertindole is a high affinity antagonist of the human cardiac potassium channel HERG.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 788-793PubMed Google Scholar]). These compounds are chemically diverse, and yet, they all inhibit hERG. The question naturally arises: why is hERG so susceptible to such a wide array of compounds? In this study, we determined the structure of hERG using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The voltage sensors are depolarized, and the inner helical gate is open. An unusual geometry of the “central cavity” within hERG’s ion conduction pathway offers a likely explanation for this channel’s extreme susceptibility to a wide range of drugs. Furthermore, hERG contains a subtle difference in the structure of its selectivity filter compared to all other K+ channels so far analyzed. This difference appears to be correlated with its unusually rapid inactivation rate. The wild-type hERG (hERGWT) channel aggregates during purification. To overcome this limitation, we deleted segments of the amino acid sequence that are predicted to be disordered (Buchan et al., 2013Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W349-W357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) while monitoring biochemical and electrophysiological behavior. We identified a construct, hERGT, with functional properties very similar to the wild-type channel, in which two segments (141–350 and 871–1,005) were deleted (Figure 1A). The truncated construct contains 814 amino acid residues, while the full-length hERG contains 1,159. Under voltage clamp, hERGWT and hERGT both produce relatively small outward currents during membrane depolarization and large inward “tail currents” during subsequent repolarization (Figure 1B and 1C). These well-known properties of hERG reflect rapid inactivation during depolarization and quick recovery from inactivation but slow deactivation (closing) during repolarization (Smith et al., 1996Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. The inward rectification mechanism of the HERG cardiac potassium channel.Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, Trudeau et al., 1995Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. HERG, a human inward rectifier in the voltage-gated potassium channel family.Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The voltage-dependent activation curve (Figure 1D) and pharmacological properties (Figure 1E) of hERGT are also similar to hERGWT (Snyders and Chaudhary, 1996Snyders D.J. Chaudhary A. High affinity open channel block by dofetilide of HERG expressed in a human cell line.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 949-955PubMed Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 1999Zhou Z. Vorperian V.R. Gong Q. Zhang S. January C.T. Block of HERG potassium channels by the antihistamine astemizole and its metabolites desmethylastemizole and norastemizole.J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, the deleted segments in hERGT do not appear to alter the major functional properties of the hERG channel that we wish to understand. Milligram quantities of hERGT were expressed and purified. Single-particle cryo-EM method was used to obtain a density map with a resolution of 3.8 Å (Figure S1) (∼144,000 particles in the final reconstruction). We also determined the structures of two additional mutations, hERGTs and hERGTs S631A, at 3.7 Å and 4.0 Å, respectively. The details of these structure determinations are given in STAR Methods. Local resolution was estimated with program “blocres” (Heymann and Belnap, 2007Heymann J.B. Belnap D.M. Bsoft: image processing and molecular modeling for electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) cutoff of 0.5 was selected for local resolution estimation so that the maximum and minimum local resolutions are above and below the global resolution of the map. Estimated local resolution range from ∼3.2 Å in the central core of the transmembrane domain to ∼5.6 Å in peripheral (especially cytoplasmic) domains (Figures 2A, S2, and S6). For hERGTs, a new model with side chains (using the structure of EAG1 as a starting point [Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016Whicher J.R. MacKinnon R. Structure of the voltage-gated K+ channel Eag1 reveals an alternative voltage sensing mechanism.Science. 2016; 353: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar]) was built for the transmembrane region and the central portion of the cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (CNBHD). The Per Arnt Sim (PAS) domain was modeled by docking the crystal structure (PDB: 1BYW, Morais Cabral et al., 1998Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. Mackinnon R. Crystal structure and functional analysis of the HERG potassium channel N terminus: a eukaryotic PAS domain.Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the density, with minor adjustment where side chain differences were apparent. These differences were small and mostly occurred in regions where the PAS domain contacted the CNBHD, which was not present in the crystal structure. hERGT and hERGTs S631A models were built starting from the hERGTs model. The final model excludes the first two N-terminal amino acids, residues 132–397 linking the PAS domain to the first transmembrane helix (predicted to be unstructured [Buchan et al., 2013Buchan D.W.

We note that all mechanistic points addressed in this study concern regions of the channel (transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic cavity, and selectivity filter) in which side-chain density was well defined.Figure 2Overall Architecture of the hERG ChannelShow full caption(A) Local resolution of reconstructed density map as estimated using software “blocres” (Heymann and Belnap, 2007Heymann J.B.

Atomic model is represented as sticks with carbon atoms colored according to Figure 1A (orange: PAS domain, magenta: voltage sensor domain, green: pore domain, red: C-linker domain, cyan: CNBHD). The three-dimensional domain organization of the hERG channel is shown in Figures 2B and 2C. Each subunit of the 4-fold symmetric tetramer contains a voltage sensor (helices S1-S4) and pore-forming region (S5-S6) inside the membrane bilayer and a PAS domain, C-linker helices, and a CNBHD projecting into the cytoplasm (Figures 1A, 2B, and 2C). hERG and its molecular cousin, the EAG1 K+ channel, share these same structural domains (Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016Whicher J.R. MacKinnon R. Structure of the voltage-gated K+ channel Eag1 reveals an alternative voltage sensing mechanism.Science. 2016; 353: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). EAG1, however, is regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in addition to membrane voltage. This distinction has resulted in a substantial conformational difference in the cryo-EM structures of these two channels, which lends insight into the activation gating mechanism in this class of K+ channels. The pore of the hERG channel is open (Figure 3A and 3B). The closely related EAG1 channel is closed, owing to the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, which lock its pore shut (Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016Whicher J.R. MacKinnon R. Structure of the voltage-gated K+ channel Eag1 reveals an alternative voltage sensing mechanism.Science. 2016; 353: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The hERG-EAG1 comparison provides an informative picture of the conformational changes that seem to occur in this class of K+ channels. At its narrowest point, the gated region of the pore in EAG1 (Q476 on the S6 helix) is closed to a radius < 1 Å (Figure 3B). At the corresponding location in the hERG channel (Q664), the pore’s radius is almost 6 Å (for reference, the smallest radius of the ion conduction pore in the open structure of Kv1.2-2.1 paddle chimera [KvChim] is around 5 Å) (Figure 3B). Superposition of the two structures shows that the large conformational difference in the S6 helices is enabled by a glycine gating hinge (G648 in hERG, G460 in EAG1) (Jiang et al., 2002Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. The open pore conformation of potassium channels.Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C). The voltage sensor in the hERG structure, as it was observed in EAG1, is not domain-swapped, meaning it is packed against its own (i.e., same polypeptide chain) pore subunit (Figure 2C and Figure 3C). The hERG S4 helix contains five positively charged amino acids. The first three—K1, R2, and R3—are located above (i.e., on the extracellular side of) the gating charge transfer center, with R4 and R5 below (Figure 4) (Tao et al., 2010Tao X. Lee A. Limapichat W. Dougherty D.A. MacKinnon R. A gating charge transfer center in voltage sensors.Science. 2010; 328: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies of wild-type and mutant hERG channels showed that K1, R2, and R3 all influence voltage-dependent gating, while R4 and R5 do not (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang M. Liu J. Tseng G.N. Gating charges in the activation and inactivation processes of the HERG channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These functional measurements, therefore, suggest that hERG’s voltage sensor is in a depolarized conformation in the structure because K1, R2, and R3 are closer to the extracellular side of the membrane. An electric field within the membrane, displacing these residues toward the inside during pore closure, would account for their contribution to gating charge. If the closed pore in EAG1 (produced by the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin) is representative of hERG’s closed pore, then we can ask what kind of voltage sensor movement could bring about the same conformational change in the pore (Figure 3C). To be clear, the voltage sensors in both hERG and EAG1 are depolarized: in hERG, this conformation is compatible with the open state of the pore; in EAG1, it is not (calmodulin has an overriding effect). It would appear that an inward (toward the cytoplasm) and centric (toward the pore axis) displacement of S4 (driven by a membrane electric field) could produce similar pore closure. The large body of work on voltage sensing has focused mainly on Shaker-like (i.e., Kv1) channels, which have domain-swapped voltage sensors. Domain swapping occurs because an α-helical linker connects each voltage sensor to a neighboring subunit (i.e., the polypeptide chain of an adjacent subunit). In such channels, α-helical linkers (one for each of four voltage sensors) form a cuff around the S6 helices, which form the pore’s gate. Conformational changes within the voltage sensors therefore can be transmitted to the gate through the linkers (Long et al., 2005aLong S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R.

Ion conduction pore is conserved among potassium channels.Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of the non-domain-swapped architecture in EAG1 and observed again in hERG implies a very different mechanism of voltage sensor coupling because α-helical S4-S5 linkers do not exist. How might the voltage sensors exert force on the pore in hERG and EAG1? Figure 3C suggests a possible answer. In the superposition of the closed EAG1 channel (mediated by Ca2+ and calmodulin) with the open hERG channel, there is no translation of S4 across the membrane. However, S5 maintains an extensive anti-parallel contact with S6 in both structures. This observation leads us to propose that voltage sensors in hERG and EAG1 channels transmit force through the S5-S6 interface. An inward and centric displacement of S4 would thus close the S6 helical gate by compressing the S5 helices. This transmission of force would be somewhat different than the lever mechanism proposed for Shaker-like Kv channels (Long et al., 2005aLong S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R.

Functional measurements also point to a substantial difference in the conformational changes within hERG and Shaker-like Kv voltage sensors. In Shaker, the total gating charge is between 12 and 16 elementary charge units (Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996Aggarwal S.K. MacKinnon R.

These functional measurements imply that voltage sensor conformational changes are smaller in the hERG K+ channel. Mutagenesis studies have identified amino acids that appear to form the high-affinity drug-binding site in hERG (Chen et al., 2002Chen J. Seebohm G. Sanguinetti M.C.

In the structure, they are located near the central cavity and in the selectivity filter adjacent to the central cavity (Figures 5B–5D). Some drug-important amino acids are unique to the EAG family of K+ channels, and some are not (Figure 5A). The structure offers an explanation as to why these particular amino acids are important: they line the surfaces of elongated, relatively hydrophobic pockets that extend from the central cavity (Figure 5D). The pockets are not present in other K+ channels, including Kv1 (Figure 5E), Slo1, and Kir (Figure S3). They exist in hERG because the S6 inner helix is displaced to create a separation between the pore helix (PH) and S6 helix (Figures 5C and 5D). The hydrophobic pockets are roughly cylindrical in shape with a diameter of about 8 Å and a depth about 11 Å (measurements between atomic centers). The longest dimensions of astemizole and dofetilide are more than 20 Å and the narrowest dimension around 3–5 Å. Thus, we propose that one part of a blocking drug fits into a pocket. We note that the substituted aromatic rings of astemizole and dofetilide fit snugly into the pockets. If this occurs, these drugs occupy the center of the cavity and insert a functional group into one of the hydrophic pockets.Figure S3Molecular Surface around the Central Cavities, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Molecular surface of Slo1 (PDB ID 5TJ6) channel.(B) Molecular surface of Kir3.2 (PDB ID 3SYO) channel.

To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we studied protective factors for DN using proteomics on glomeruli from individuals with extreme duration of diabetes (ł50 years) without DN and those with histologic signs of DN. Enzymes in the glycolytic, sorbitol, methylglyoxal and mitochondrial pathways were elevated in individuals without DN. In particular, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression and activity were upregulated. Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased PKM2 tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and cultured podocytes. Pkm-knockdown immortalized mouse podocytes had higher levels of toxic glucose metabolites, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse albuminuria and glomerular pathology. Conversely, we found that pharmacological activation of PKM2 by a small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1α mRNA in cultured podocytes. In intervention studies using DBA2/J and Nos3 (eNos) KO mouse models of diabetes, TEPP-46 treatment reversed metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney pathology. Thus, PKM2 activation may protect against DN by increasing glucose metabolic flux, inhibiting the production of toxic glucose metabolites and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis to restore mitochondrial function."

Here, we investigate such a phenomenon in skin, where during homeostasis, stem cells of the epidermis and hair follicle fuel their respective tissues. We find that breakdown of stem cell lineage confinement-granting privileges associated with both fates-is not only hallmark but also functional in cancer development. We show that lineage plasticity is critical in wound repair, where it operates transiently to redirect fates. Investigating mechanism, we discover that irrespective of cellular origin, lineage infidelity occurs in wounding when stress-responsive enhancers become activated and override homeostatic enhancers that govern lineage specificity. In cancer, stress-responsive transcription factor levels rise, causing lineage commanders to reach excess. When lineage and stress factors collaborate, they activate oncogenic enhancers that distinguish cancers from wounds."

The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) and prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex have been implicated in reward-seeking and fear-related responses, but how information flows between these reciprocally connected structures to coordinate behavior is unknown. We recorded neuronal activity from the BLA and PL while rats performed a task wherein competing shock- and sucrose-predictive cues were simultaneously presented. The correlated firing primarily displayed a BLA→PL directionality during the shock-associated cue. Furthermore, BLA neurons optogenetically identified as projecting to PL more accurately predicted behavioral responses during competition than unidentified BLA neurons. Finally photostimulation of the BLA→PL projection increased freezing, whereas both chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition reduced freezing. Therefore, the BLA→PL circuit is critical in governing the selection of behavioral responses in the face of competing signals."

Our study provides a blueprint for characterizing the role of bacteria in the host response to chemotherapeutics. The microorganisms that inhabit our intestine, known as our gut microbiota, greatly influence our development, health, and propensity to get sick (Brennan and Garrett, 2016Brennan C.A. Garrett W.S. Gut microbiota, inflammation, and colorectal cancer.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 70: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, Sommer and Bäckhed, 2013Sommer F. Bäckhed F. The gut microbiota--masters of host development and physiology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become clear that the gut microbiota can also affect the response to anticancer immunotherapy (Sivan et al., 2015Sivan A. Corrales L. Hubert N. Williams J.B. Aquino-Michaels K. Earley Z.M. Benyamin F.W. Lei Y.M. Jabri B.

However, the involvement of the microbiota in the response to chemotherapeutics and the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. Chemotherapeutics have been used for decades to treat a variety of human tumors. Some cancers, such as colorectal cancer, occur in physical proximity to the gut microbiota. Therefore, we reasoned that the efficacy of anti-colorectal cancer drugs, such as the anti-pyrimidine drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUDR), and the topoisomerase I (topo-I) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) may be affected by the microbiota. These drugs have different reported mechanisms of action, but are all thought to confer cytotoxicity through DNA damage (Figure S1). CPT directly inhibits the topo-I-DNA complex, which leads to single-stranded DNA breaks and cell death (Pommier, 2006Pommier Y. Topoisomerase I inhibitors: camptothecins and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), while 5-FU and FUDR produce FdUMP, which directly inhibits thymidylate synthase thereby causing thymineless cell death. In addition, products of 5-FU and FUDR may be converted into FUTP or FdUTP, leading to RNA or DNA damage, respectively (Longley et al., 2003Longley D.B. Harkin D.P. Johnston P.G. 5-fluorouracil: mechanisms of action and clinical strategies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar). It is extremely challenging to systematically delineate which anticancer drug efficacies are affected by the microbiota using patient data or mammalian model systems, such as mice, and to dissect the mechanisms involved. This is not only because of limitations in scale and cost, but also because of heterogeneity in human genotype, diet, and microbiota. The nematode C. elegans and its bacterial diet have recently become a powerful interspecies model system to study the effects of diet and the microbiota on animal life history traits (Watson and Walhout, 2014Watson E.

C. elegans has a short life cycle, is amenable to high-throughput screens, and is easily maintained in the laboratory. In the wild, C. elegans has been found associated with different bacteria, which function not only as diet but also as a microbiota (Berg et al., 2016Berg M. Stenuit B. Ho J. Wang A. Parke C.

For instance, we previously found that, when fed a diet of Comamonas aquatica DA1877 (Comamonas), C. elegans develop faster, have reduced fecundity, and live shorter than animals fed the standard laboratory diet of Escherichia coli OP50 (E. coli) (MacNeil et al., 2013MacNeil L.T.

Diet-induced developmental acceleration independent of TOR and insulin in C. elegans.Cell. 2013; 153: 240-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By high-throughput forward and reverse genetics, in both the animal and these bacteria, we found that the Comamonas effects on C. elegans development and fecundity can be explained, in a large part, by the fact that this bacterial species can synthesize vitamin B12, whereas E. coli cannot (Watson et al., 2013Watson E. MacNeil L.T. Arda H.E. Zhu L.J. Walhout A.J.M.

Metabolic network rewiring of propionate flux compensates vitamin B12 deficiency in C. elegans.eLife. 2016; 5: e17670Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we used the interspecies system of C. elegans and its bacterial diet to ask whether different bacteria have different effects on the host response to chemotherapeutics. We exposed C. elegans to 11 drugs while feeding them either E. coli or Comamonas and found that four chemotherapeutics cause abnormal phenotypes in C. elegans at the administered dose. We tested the effects of three drugs, 5-FU, FUDR, and CPT, at a range of concentrations and used progeny production—no progeny (sterile), dead progeny (dead embryos), or live progeny—as a proxy for drug efficacy. We found that E. coli and Comamonas oppositely affect the C. elegans response to FUDR and CPT. By performing genetic screens in both bacterial species, we identified numerous bacterial genes that modulate 5-FU, FUDR, and/or CPT efficacy in C. elegans. Altogether, we found that bacterial nucleotide metabolism networks modulate drug efficacy in C. elegans. Mutations in E. coli or Comamonas upp, which generates 5-fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) from 5-FU, reduce the efficacy of 5-FU and FUDR. However, mutations in bacterial tdk, tmk, or thyA, which are involved in dTMP synthesis, do not. These observations suggest that these drugs elicit their effects on C. elegans fecundity through bacterial production of FUMP and RNA metabolism and not through the generation of FdUMP, DNA metabolism, or thymineless death. Indeed, uracil rescues 5-FU and FUDR toxicity in C. elegans while thymine had no effect. Altogether, these results demonstrate that bacterial metabolism can greatly affect chemotherapeutic drug efficacy in the host. We selected drugs from major classes of chemotherapeutics: alkylating agents (temozolomide), antimetabolites (5-FU; FUDR; methotrexate), antitumor antibiotics (doxorubicin; neocarzinostatin), a mitotic inhibitor (paclitaxel), topoisomerase inhibitors (CPT; etoposide), a hormone receptor antagonist (tamoxifen), and a receptor tyrosine kinase small-molecule inhibitor (sunitinib). For bacterial diets, we used E. coli and Comamonas, because large mutant collections are available for each species, enabling genetic screens to identify bacterial genes that may modulate drug efficacy in the nematode (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection.Mol. Syst.

Interspecies systems biology uncovers metabolites affecting C. elegans gene expression and life history traits.Cell. 2014; 156: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We tested each drug at a single dose of 10 μM in animals fed each bacteria. Briefly, bacteria were seeded onto solid drug-containing media and incubated overnight. The next morning, five to ten L4 larvae were transferred to drug or control plates, and phenotypic differences between drug-exposed and control animals were assayed after 72 hr of growth at 20°C. Four of the 11 drugs tested caused abnormal phenotypes in C. elegans. CPT, 5-FU, and FUDR all result in impaired fecundity, from sterility (5-FU) to the production of few dead embryos (CPT) (Figure 1A). Paclitaxel did not affect fecundity but rather resulted in a developmental delay (Figure 1A). Interestingly, the C. elegans response to FUDR was different between animals fed the two bacteria: on E. coli the animals were completely sterile, while on Comamonas they produced live progeny (Figure 1A). This observation indicates that bacteria can affect chemotherapeutic drug efficacy in C. elegans. Next, we titrated the three drugs that impaired C. elegans fecundity—CPT, 5-FU, and FUDR—to determine if, and to what extent, animals display a difference in the response to these drugs on either bacterial diet. We compared fecundity of L4 animals fed each bacteria and drug combination after 72 hr and scored viable progeny, dead embryos, and sterility (Figure 1B). For 5-FU, we did not observe any differences in drug efficacy between animals fed E. coli OP50 or Comamonas (Figure 1B). In agreement with the initial screen (Figure 1A), animals fed Comamonas fared much better on FUDR than animals fed E. coli OP50. On E. coli, animals laid dead embryos when grown on 50 nM FUDR and were sterile when grown on 2.5 μM FUDR. By contrast, dead embryos were laid by animals grown on the highest concentration of FUDR tested (50 μM) when fed Comamonas (Figure 1B). Therefore, we observed a large difference in FUDR efficacy in animals fed E. coli OP50 versus those fed Comamonas. Remarkably, we observed an opposite, albeit milder, difference in the C. elegans response to CPT: dead embryos were laid by animals exposed to 2.5 μM CPT on the E. coli OP50 diet and by animals exposed to 250 nM on Comamonas. Taken together, by testing two bacteria and three chemotherapeutic drugs, we observed that the same bacteria can lead to increased efficacy of one drug but decreased efficacy of a different drug. An important question is whether differential drug efficacy is due to one bacterial species increasing it, the other one reducing it, or both. To start addressing this question, we mixed the two bacterial species in different ratios and compared the drug response in C. elegans. We found that the increase in drug efficacy elicited by Comamonas for CPT and by E. coli OP50 for FUDR is “dominant,” because even when either species was greatly diluted into the other, we observed enhanced drug efficacy in C. elegans (Figure 2A). This result suggests that E. coli OP50 actively increases drug efficacy of FUDR, while Comamonas increases drug efficacy of CPT. There are two possible mechanisms by which bacteria can increase drug efficacy. The first is a passive mechanism by which bacteria supplement metabolites that, when ingested by the host, increase drug efficacy. The second is an active mechanism in which bacteria metabolize the drug, or convert a metabolite in response to drug exposure, thereby affecting drug efficacy in the animal. We tested whether we could discriminate between these possibilities by comparing drug efficacy between C. elegans fed live bacteria (active metabolism) and dead bacteria (no active metabolism). We reasoned that the traditional method of UV-killing of bacteria may not be most suitable because, even though bacteria cannot proliferate after high doses of UV they may remain metabolically active, and because UV causes DNA damage, which is related to the reported mechanism of action of these drugs (Figure S1). Instead, we generated bacterial powder from each species by disrupting the cells at high-pressure followed by lyophilization. To quantify drug efficacy in C. elegans fed live bacteria versus bacterial powder, we adopted the term minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is commonly used to describe antimicrobials (Andrews, 2001Andrews J.M. The development of the BSAC standardized method of disc diffusion testing.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 48: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, MIC refers to the minimum concentration of the chemotherapeutic drug at which we observed no live C. elegans progeny. Instead of examining phenotypes after 72 hr as described above, we did so after 96 hr of placing L4 animals on each bacteria and drug combination to avoid differences caused by potential egg-hatching delays. For CPT, we did not observe a significant difference between animals fed live bacteria versus those fed bacterial powder (Figure 2B, left). This result indicates that bacteria mostly modulate CPT efficacy through a passive mechanism. In contrast, the bacterial influence on drug efficacy of FUDR is completely dependent on active bacterial metabolism. First, we found no difference in drug efficacy between C. elegans fed the two bacterial species when fed as metabolically inactive powder (Figure 2B, right). Second, we observed both a decrease in drug efficacy (higher MIC) with E. coli OP50 powder and an increase in drug efficacy with Comamonas powder (lower MIC), relative to either live bacteria. From this finding, we conclude that at least two mechanisms are involved: E. coli metabolism increases FUDR efficacy in C. elegans, while Comamonas metabolism reduces it. The latter effect indicates that bacterial metabolism not only increases drug efficacy but that it can also be protective. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms by which bacteria modulate the C. elegans response to chemotherapeutics, we performed genetic screens in both E. coli and Comamonas using all three drugs: CPT, 5-FU, and FUDR. First, we used the E. coli Keio collection that comprises 3,985 strains, each with a deletion in a single, non-essential gene (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M.

We found that the parental strain of this collection, E. coli K-12 BW25113, modulates drug efficacy in a similar manner as E. coli OP50, although there was a relatively small difference between animals fed E. coli OP50 and E. coli K-12 BW25113 with 5-FU (Figure S2). Second, we used a collection of 5,760 Comamonas mutants we generated previously (Watson et al., 2014Watson E. MacNeil L.T. Ritter A.D. Yilmaz L.S. Rosebrock A.P. Caudy A.A. Walhout A.J.M. Interspecies systems biology uncovers metabolites affecting C. elegans gene expression and life history traits.Cell. 2014; 156: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each of these mutant strains harbors a single transposon insertion into its genome. For each of the six genetic screens, we used a single dose of drug where animals fed the parental strain produced dead embryos. This dose allowed us to simultaneously screen for bacterial mutants that increased drug efficacy (when we observe sterility) or decreased drug efficacy (when we observe live progeny) (Figure 3A, top). In each of the primary screens, between 2% and 20% of the bacterial mutants tested scored positively, either increasing or decreasing drug efficacy in C. elegans. These mutants were retested in a secondary screen with three doses of the drug (Figure 3A, middle), and only those mutants that scored in at least two of the three doses were tested in a tertiary screen (triplicate and with six concentrations of each drug, Figure 3A, bottom). This process resulted in a final set of mutants that range between a single Comamonas mutant that increases FUDR efficacy to 16 E. coli mutants that reduce the efficacy of CPT (Figure 3A, bottom). The identity of the disrupted genes in the Comamonas mutants was determined by sequencing (Watson et al., 2014Watson E. MacNeil L.T. Ritter A.D. Yilmaz L.S. Rosebrock A.P. Caudy A.A. Walhout A.J.M. Interspecies systems biology uncovers metabolites affecting C. elegans gene expression and life history traits.Cell. 2014; 156: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The E. coli gene deletions were identified according to their coordinate in the collection and all were confirmed by sequencing. Several observations support the high quality of the different screens. First, we found bacterial mutants for each drug/bacteria combination and, for each combination, except for Comamonas and 5-FU, we identified strains that increased or decreased drug efficacy in C. elegans. Second, two genes were each found twice in the Comamonas screens, including two independent mutations in upp found in the 5-FU and FUDR screens and three independent mutations in purH found in the FUDR screen (Table S1). Third, a mutant in Comamonas purA was found in both the 5-FU and FUDR screens, while E. coli mutations in glnA were found in both the CPT and 5-FU screens. Strikingly, E. coli mutations in pdxH were also found with both CPT and 5-FU, but a deletion in this gene increased efficacy of CPT and decreased efficacy of 5-FU (Figure 3B). Finally, one gene was found with both bacterial species and with multiple drugs: mutations in upp decreased the efficacy of 5-FU in Comamonas and FUDR in both bacteria (Figure 3B). Altogether, we identified 44 unique bacterial genes that can be grouped into several broad functional categories, including different types of metabolism, most notably amino acid and nucleotide metabolism (Figure 3B). Due to the stringency of the six bacterial genetic screens, it is unlikely that we uncovered all genes that contribute to the C. elegans response to each of the three drugs, i.e., we expect a considerable rate of false negatives. Therefore, we next performed a matrix experiment in which we tested animals fed each of the mutants that scored positively in the second retest (n = 98, Figure 3A) against six concentrations of each of the three drugs in quadruplicate (Figure S3). We reasoned that this experiment would enable us to define different classes of genes, including those genes that specifically affect the response to a single drug, and other genes that may elicit a more general change in drug response. Indeed, this experiment uncovered additional gene/drug interactions with the same set of mutants. In total, we identified 98 interactions involving 44 bacterial mutants, including 48 interactions that were observed previously (Figure 3A) and 50 additional interactions. Bacterial mutants can be grouped into four broad classes according to their effect on drug efficacy (Figure 4A). Class I mutants (13 genes) have drug-specific effects on chemotherapeutic efficacy. Most of these (n = 11) specifically affect the response to CPT, which may not be surprising given that 5-FU and FUDR are thought to function through the same pathway (Figure S1) (Longley et al., 2003Longley D.B. Harkin D.P. Johnston P.G. 5-fluorouracil: mechanisms of action and clinical strategies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar). Of these 11 genes, eight increase CPT efficacy and three decrease it. Class II mutants involve eight genes that affect the response to two of the three drugs. These genes affect the response to both anti-pyrimidine drugs: five increase their efficacy, while three reduce it. Class III involves six genes that decreased the efficacy of all three drugs. Finally, class IV genes (n = 17) affect all three drugs but in an opposite way between the anti-pyrimidine drugs, 5-FU and FUDR, and the topo-I inhibitor CPT. Most of these mutants increase the efficacy of the anti-pyrimidine drugs and decrease the C. elegans response to CPT. One explanation for the effects of bacterial mutants on drug efficacy in C. elegans could be that growth of the microbes is affected by the mutation and that this in turn affects drug response in the animal. To test this, we compared growth of all 98 bacterial mutants that passed the second round of screening (Figure 3A) in the presence or absence of drug. Overall, we did not find a strong relationship between bacterial growth in the presence of drug and an increase in drug efficacy in C. elegans. We did observe several mutants decrease drug efficacy and are slow growing, but their growth is generally not affected by the presence of the drug (Figure 4B). The set of bacterial mutants we identified contains numerous genes involved in nucleotide metabolism (Figure 5A). Given the considerable level of false negatives in our screens, we selected all available E. coli mutants representing the genes in these pathways (e.g., including those mutants that were not recovered in the primary screen) and systematically tested them in triplicate as described for the matrix experiment (Figure 4A). We tested two independent copies for each gene from the E. coli mutant collection (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 2006.0008Crossref PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). Altogether, we tested 37 duplicate mutant strains against CPT, 5-FU, and FUDR. The interactions are summarized in Figure 5A and include 42 that were not observed before. Several observations can be gleaned from this experiment. First, we observed striking differences between the three drugs: the upper branch of the network shown in Figure 5A, which depicts the final biosynthetic reactions of purine metabolism, is relatively specific for CPT, with most mutants increasing the efficacy of this drug in C. elegans. An exception is guaA, which encodes guanine monophosphate (GMP) synthase that catalyzes the final step in GMP synthesis. A deletion in guaA results in slow bacterial growth (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 2006.0008Crossref PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar) and decreases the efficacy of all three drugs. Second, the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis branch of nucleotide metabolism, which converts L-glutamine into uridine monophosphate (UMP, Figure 5A), increases the efficacy of all three drugs. Third, a deletion in the E. coli pyrimidine salvage pathway gene upp, which encodes uracil phosphoribosyltransferase that generates UMP from uracil, decreases drug efficacy for 5-FU and FUDR, but increases the efficacy of CPT (Figure 5A). Next, we quantitatively compared the modulation of 5-FU and FUDR efficacy by each pyrimidine synthesis pathway. The dose-response curves show an ∼10-fold increase in drug efficacy upon mutation of genes in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and an ∼10-fold decrease in efficacy upon deletion of upp (Figures 5B and S4). These observations suggest that the bacterial conversion of 5-FU and FUDR into FUMP, an analog of UMP, by upp, is critical for the cytotoxic effects of both anti-pyrimidine drugs in C. elegans. When upp is deleted, this conversion is blocked or reduced, and the bacteria depend on the de novo UMP biosynthesis pathway. When the latter pathway is perturbed, however, flux through the salvage pathway may be increased leading to higher levels of FUMP. Remarkably, deletions in either E. coli upp or udk decreases anti-pyrimidine drug efficacy, while deletions in tdk, tmk, or thyA have no effect (Figure 5A). This observation suggests that 5-FU and FUDR predominantly affect C. elegans fecundity via bacterial ribonucleotide"

Our data suggest a two-way bacterial mediation of fluoropyrimidine effects on host metabolism, which contributes to drug efficacy. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic power of manipulating intestinal microbiota to ensure host metabolic health and treat disease. Fluoropyrimidines are antimetabolite drugs primarily used to treat cancer. The archetype fluoropyrimidine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is the principal therapy for colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer worldwide (Midgley and Kerr, 1999Midgley R. Kerr D. Colorectal cancer.Lancet. 1999; 353: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). 5-FU and its prodrugs, such as capecitabine, are uracil analogs that impede nucleotide biosynthesis, and hence cell division, by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS). Despite the widespread use of 5-FU-based chemotherapy, there is no universally accepted dose, and significant pharmacokinetic variations exist between individuals. As a result, adverse effects are frequent (diarrhea, nausea) and response rates sub-optimal (10% as monotherapy, 50% with combination therapies) (Longley et al., 2003Longley D.B. Harkin D.P. Johnston P.G. 5-fluorouracil: Mechanisms of action and clinical strategies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3513) Google Scholar). The observed inter-patient variation in 5-FU efficacy/toxicity has been attributed to several factors, including genetic polymorphisms in TS, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, methylene THF reductase, and cytidine deaminase (Offer and Diasio, 2016Offer S.M. Diasio R.B. Is It Finally Time for a Personalized Medicine Approach for Fluorouracil-Based Therapies?.J. Clin. Oncol. 2016; 34: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, genetics alone does not explain differences in 5-FU tolerance between different continents suggesting environmental factors as key determinants in 5-FU action (O’Donnell and Dolan, 2009O’Donnell P.H. Dolan M.E. Cancer pharmacoethnicity: Ethnic differences in susceptibility to the effects of chemotherapy.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 4806-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The influence of gut microbiota on 5-FU activity has not been explored. Gut microbes play an integral role in animal physiology, contributing to metabolism, influencing immunity, and modulating gut function. The thousands of species that make up the human microbiome surpass the host in terms of raw cell numbers, genomic diversity, and metabolic capability (Nicholson et al., 2012Nicholson J.K. Holmes E. Kinross J. Burcelin R. Gibson G. Jia W. Pettersson S. Host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions.Science. 2012; 336: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Together, the host and its symbiotic microbiota (holobiont) act as a single evolutionary unit against environmental pressures (Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2011Rosenberg E. Zilber-Rosenberg I. Symbiosis and development: The hologenome concept.Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2011; 93: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Despite great advances in understanding the microbiome’s contribution to human health, one facet of the host-microbe relationship that remains undefined is the influence of microbiota on host-targeted drugs and the resulting contribution to host fitness. The consequences of not exploring these interactions at the holobiont level can be severe, as illustrated by the patient deaths due to the unanticipated microbial metabolism of the antiviral sorivudine to (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)uracil, a suicide inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, a key host enzyme responsible for the detoxification of 5-FU (Okuda et al., 1997Okuda H. Nishiyama T. Ogura K. Nagayama S. Ikeda K. Yamaguchi S. Nakamura Y. Kawaguchi Y. Watabe T. Lethal drug interactions of sorivudine, a new antiviral drug, with oral 5-fluorouracil prodrugs.Drug Metab. Dispos. 1997; 25: 270-273Google Scholar). A significant barrier to exploring the host-microbiota relationship has been the complexity and diversity of the mammalian microbiome. The nematode C. elegans offers a simplified animal model with evolutionarily conserved features important for studying host-microbe interactions. Like humans, C. elegans have a symbiotic relationship with microbes, requiring them for nutrition, optimal development (Watson et al., 2014Watson E. MacNeil L.T. Ritter A.D. Yilmaz L.S. Rosebrock A.P. Caudy A.A. Walhout A.J. Interspecies systems biology uncovers metabolites affecting C. elegans gene expression and life history traits.Cell. 2014; 156: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and drug metabolism (Cabreiro et al., 2013Cabreiro F. Au C. Leung K.Y. Vergara-Irigaray N. Cochemé H.M. Noori T. Weinkove D. Schuster E. Greene N.D. Gems D. Metformin retards aging in C. elegans by altering microbial folate and methionine metabolism.Cell. 2013; 153: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Here, we employ an innovative host-microbe-drug model and high-throughput screening approaches to explore the role of microbes in modulating the effect of 5-FU and other fluoropyrimidines on C. elegans. We extensively define the microbial metabolic, genetic, and nutritional contributions to fluoropyrimidine activity on the host, revealing two distinct mechanisms by which bacteria modulate the efficacy of this class of anti-cancer drugs in vivo: (1) drug activation by bacterial ribonucleotide metabolism; and (2) influence of bacterial deoxynucleotide pools on the host response. We present a model that will be valuable for further probing host-microbe-drug interactions, highlighting how microbial metabolism can impact host fitness and survival in the context of pharmacotherapy. We reasoned that gut microbes may contribute to the activity of 5-FU in the context of the holobiont. Fluoropyrimidines impede cell division and interfere with nematode fertility and development, allowing simple and robust readouts of drug activity on the host, such as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for egg hatching (SenGupta et al., 2013SenGupta T. Torgersen M.L. Kassahun H. Vellai T. Simonsen A. Nilsen H. Base excision repair AP endonucleases and mismatch repair act together to induce checkpoint-mediated autophagy.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). First, we compared 5-FU activity on worms fed five Escherichia coli laboratory strains commonly used in worm studies (Figure 1A) and observed up to 80-fold differences in 5-FU MICs (HB101, MIC = 8 μM versus BL21G, MIC = 0.1 μM, p < 0.001). The differences in host drug activity were independent of the bacterial strain serotype, as 5-FU efficacy was similarly variable between B strains (OP50 versus BL21G; 20-fold, p < 0.001) and within K-12 strains (BW25113 versus HT115; 8-fold, p < 0.001). This suggested that specific genotypic differences between the E. coli strains could be responsible for the observed variability in drug efficacy. We further explored other bacterial strains including the wild-type gut gammaproteobacteria E. coli B and K-12 strains (W3110 and MG1655), Enterobacter cloacae (LMG2783) and the soil betaproteobacterium Comamonas aquatica (DA1877) (Figure 1B). Again, large variations of 5-FU efficacy in worms were observed, with a 40-fold difference in egg hatching MIC between worms fed C. aquatica (0.1 μM) and E. coli B (4 μM, p < 0.001). Interventions modifying bacterial metabolic activity can influence the effect of host-targeted drugs in C. elegans (Cabreiro et al., 2013Cabreiro F. Au C. Leung K.Y. Vergara-Irigaray N. Cochemé H.M. Noori T. Weinkove D. Schuster E. Greene N.D. Gems D. Metformin retards aging in C. elegans by altering microbial folate and methionine metabolism.Cell. 2013; 153: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we cultured nematodes on bacteria killed by heat or UV treatment. 5-FU efficacy was greatly decreased in nematodes fed dead BW25113 (128-fold, Figure 1C) or OP50 (Figure S1A). Thus, bacterial enhancement of 5-FU activity on C. elegans requires live bacteria. Next, we explored the microbial modulation of other clinically used fluoropyrimidines, including floxuridine (FUdR), flucytosine (5-FC), capecitabine (CAP), and 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FO). Fluoropyrimidine efficacy in C. elegans increased in the order CAP < 5-FC < 5-FU = FUdR = 5-FO. Within each drug treatment, the efficacy was highly dependent on the bacterial strain fed to the worms (e.g., 5-FU OP50 = 2 μM versus C. aquatica = 0.1 μM, p < 0.001; FUdR OP50 = 2 μM versus C. aquatica = 8 μM, p < 0.001) (Figures 1D and S1B–S1E). Therefore, as for 5-FU, the pharmacodynamics of these drugs in the host are bacteria dependent and drug specific. A possible confounding factor for the differential effects of bacteria on worm MIC could be the absolute number of bacterial cells available and their digestion. To test whether there was a link between bacterial growth phenotype and modulation of drug efficacy in C. elegans, we quantified bacterial growth in the absence (Figure 1E) and presence (Figures 1F, S1F, and S1G) of 5-FU, and found no link with drug efficacy in C. elegans. Experiments with other fluoropyrimidines confirmed these observations (Figures S1H and S1I). Similarly, rates of bacterial consumption by worms do not explain 5-FU efficacy (Figure S1J). The type of bacteria fed to C. elegans has a significant impact on host biology, including gene expression and metabolism (Watson et al., 2014Watson E. MacNeil L.T. Ritter A.D. Yilmaz L.S. Rosebrock A.P. Caudy A.A. Walhout A.J. Interspecies systems biology uncovers metabolites affecting C. elegans gene expression and life history traits.Cell. 2014; 156: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Expression of worm genes associated with pyrimidine metabolism, required for potential 5-FU conversion, was largely unaffected by the bacterial strain (Figure S1K). Therefore, bacterial modulation of 5-FU efficacy in C. elegans occurs by means other than bacterial regulation of nematode gene expression. Given that 5-FU disrupts pyrimidine metabolism homeostasis (Ser et al., 2016Ser Z. Gao X. Johnson C. Mehrmohamadi M. Liu X. Li S. Locasale J.W. Targeting one carbon metabolism with an antimetabolite disrupts pyrimidine homeostasis and induces nucleotide overflow.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 2367-2376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether drug treatment induces metabolic changes in E. coli, which could contribute to the observed effects in the worm. Targeted metabolomics in worms or E. coli exposed to 1 μM 5-FU (the full inhibitory concentration for worm hatching) revealed that 5-FU did not affect bacterial metabolism as shown by principal component analysis (PCA), while inducing a significant metabolic shift in the worms (Figures 1G and S1L–S1M). These data imply distinct sensitivities to 5-FU action between host and microbe and support a regulatory effect of bacteria on drug efficacy in the host that is independent of altered bacterial metabolism caused by drug treatment. Overall, we found that bacteria are key determinants of fluoropyrimidine efficacy on host metabolism and embryonic survival. We hypothesized that the bacterial uracil phosphoribosyltransferase upp mutant (Δupp), a gene previously used for cancer therapy (Koyama et al., 2000Koyama F. Sawada H. Hirao T. Fujii H. Hamada H. Nakano H. Combined suicide gene therapy for human colon cancer cells using adenovirus-mediated transfer of escherichia coli cytosine deaminase gene and Escherichia coli uracil phosphoribosyltransferase gene with 5-fluorocytosine.Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and capable of metabolizing 5-FU in vitro, could influence the response of the host to treatment. As predicted, worms fed Δupp bacteria developed fully at concentrations of 5-FU that completely inhibited worms fed the control strain (Figure 2A), further suggesting an interspecies mediation of drug effects. Therefore, to investigate how E. coli impacts 5-FU action in C. elegans, we developed a three-way high-throughput host-microbe-drug screen using the E. coli non-essential gene knockout Keio library (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: The Keio collection.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 (2006.0008)Crossref Scopus (5382) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). The developmental response of C. elegans to 5-FU is dose dependent when fed control BW25113 (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, the worm response to the drug in the presence of each E. coli mutant was estimated as the MIC that arrests development at L1 larvae stage, allowing us to determine the relative contribution of each E. coli gene in mediating 5-FU effects in the host. 96 mutants were excluded from further investigation due to poor growth on nematode growth medium (NGM), undisrupted target gene, or impaired worm development in the absence of drug (Figure 2C; Table S2). A primary screen within a narrow range of drug concentrations (1–5 μM) revealed that ∼80% of the total 3,813 E. coli mutants screened did not alter 5-FU effects in C. elegans (Figures 2C and S2C). 574 (15%) of the mutant strains allowed full development at 5 μM and were investigated further at a higher range of concentrations (5–100 μM). This secondary screen (Figures S2C) revealed that the top 5% (124 mutants) increased C. elegans resistance to drug to MICs >30 μM and the top 1% (35 mutants) to MICs >43 μM. Thus, we identified the subset of bacterial genes most significantly affecting 5-FU efficacy in the host.Figure S2Chemical Genomic Bacterial Screens and Chemical Genomic Bacterial Host Screens, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) 5-FU inhibits development of worms fed control E. coli BW25113 but not Δupp mutants.

For statistics, see Table S2. Chemical perturbations in bacteria have been used to associate genes with phenotypes and function (Nichols et al., 2011Nichols R.J. Sen S. Choo Y.J. Beltrao P. Zietek M. Chaba R. Lee S. Kazmierczak K.M. Lee K.J. Wong A. et al.Phenotypic landscape of a bacterial cell.Cell. 2011; 144: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether we could infer drug action on the host by evaluating the effect of 5-FU on bacteria alone. First, we investigated how gene deletions affect E. coli response to 5-FU, using changes in growth, measured by optical density (OD), as a readout of drug effects on the bacteria (Figures S2D and S2E). As expected, most deletions did not affect response to 5-FU treatment (r2 = 0.33, p < 2 × 10−16; Figure S2D). One of the most significant resistant hits was Δupp (p < 0.001, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0, Figures 2D, S2E, and S2G). These findings validate our bacterial screening approach (see STAR Methods for details). Next, we asked whether the effects observed for bacterial growth matched the effects of 5-FU in the worms. Worm MIC values (colored circles) were plotted relative to the bacterial growth OD values with (y axis) and without (x axis) 5-FU treatment for each E. coli knockout strain (Figures 2D, S2F, and S2G). Strikingly, bacterial growth in control (r2 = 0.02, p = 0.0007; Figure S2F) or 5-FU treatment alone (r2 = 0.007, p = 0.05; Figure S2G) cannot predict 5-FU effects on host physiology. Moreover, when the three datasets are combined together (Figure 2D), this can be further inferred visually by the lack of a gradient in color top to bottom (correlation with 5-FU effects on bacterial growth) or left to right (correlation with bacterial growth alone). Indeed, the 5% of bacterial knockouts that conferred the greatest MIC values in worms contained equal proportions of mutants with sensitive (e.g., ΔgcvA) and resistant (e.g., Δupp) growth interactions with 5-FU (Figure 2E). Altogether, bacterial growth or 5-FU effects on E. coli growth are not key determinants or predictors of 5-FU effects on host physiology. To determine which bacterial processes contribute to the effects of 5-FU on host physiology, we performed enrichment analysis of KEGG and EcoCyc pathways on the genes with strong 5-FU effects on C. elegans development (MIC >5 μM) (Figure 2F, see STAR Methods for details). Out of the significantly enriched pathways, 3 (pyridoxal-5-phosphate [PLP], chorismate, and folate biosynthesis) were involved in the production of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF), a cofactor for TS (thyA/TS; Figure 2G), the canonical target of 5-FU (Longley et al., 2003Longley D.B. Harkin D.P. Johnston P.G. 5-fluorouracil: Mechanisms of action and clinical strategies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3513) Google Scholar). Enrichment for pathways involved in energy production (e.g., TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation) is consistent with the observation that disruption of metabolic activity by UV/heat treatment decreases 5-FU efficacy (Figures 1C and S1A). Surprisingly, pyrimidine metabolism was not significantly over-represented, suggesting that only key genes (e.g., Δupp) belonging to this pathway contribute to the observed effects. Overall, our three-way screen reveals that host-microbe-drug interactions are inherently complex, and that drug efficacy at the holobiont level can only be fully understood if evaluating biological readouts in the host. Given the link between vitamin B6, chorismate-folate, and pyrimidine metabolism, we next investigated how these bacterial pathways regulate 5-FU action in the host. Vitamin B6 is a key cofactor involved in numerous enzyme-catalyzed reactions in all living systems. Unlike eukaryotes, E. coli is capable of synthesizing PLP, the active form of B6, via both de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways (Fitzpatrick et al., 2007Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Kappes B. Macheroux P. Tews I. Raschle T. Two independent routes of de novo vitamin B6 biosynthesis: Not that different after all.Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). We therefore tested the impact of these two B6 pathways in regulating 5-FU efficacy in the host. We found that impairing de novo PLP synthesis decreased 5-FU efficacy in the worm by 8- to 16-fold (p < 0.001; Figure 3B). By contrast, deletion of pdxY from the salvage pathway had no effect (Figure 3C). Knockout of pdxH, a gene at the intersection of both pathways, decreased 5-FU efficacy by 8-fold (p < 0.001; Figure 3C). Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that ΔpdxH mutants were also deficient in PLP (–96%, p = 0.0001) while accumulating pyridoxine 5-P (PNP; +315%, p = 0.0001) (Figure S3A). Interestingly, knockout of pdxK, a key kinase in the salvage pathway, improved 5-FU efficacy (ΔpdxK = 0.1 μM versus BW25113 = 0.25 μM, p < 0.001; Figure 3C), possibly due to positive feedback into de novo synthesis of PLP. Indeed, when we blocked de novo PLP synthesis in the ΔpdxK by knocking out pdxJ, 5-FU efficacy dropped to that conferred by ΔpdxJ and ΔpdxH mutants alone (Figure 3C). Altogether, our data imply a key role of bacterial PLP in the mediation of 5-FU effects on host physiology.Figure S3Effects of Bacterial Vitamin B6 Metabolism on 5-FU Efficacy, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Vitamin B6 pools are altered in ΔpdxH mutant E. coli measured by LC-MS/MS.

Data are represented as mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. For statistics, see Table S3. Vitamins are important regulators of microbial metabolism but can also influence host metabolism. Therefore, we tested whether PLP affects bacterial or host metabolism to regulate 5-FU efficacy. Supplementation with 1 mM pyridoxal (PL), a precursor of PLP through conversion by pyridoxal kinase (bacterial = pdxK or worm = F57C9.1; Figure 3A), fully rescued the effect of the ΔpdxJ mutant and improved 5-FU efficacy (BW + PL = 0.1 μM versus BW = 0.25 μM, p = 0.006, Figure 3D). Similar effects were observed at 10 μM PL (Figure S3B). Also, supplementation with PL fully rescued PLP and pyridoxine (PN) levels in ΔpdxJ vitamin B6-deficient bacteria (Figure 3E). In contrast, worms fed ΔpdxKΔpdxJ double mutants were not rescued by supplementation with various B6 precursors at 1 mM, consistent with the role of pdxK in the utilization of B6 vitamers (Figure S3C). In addition, the hatching inhibition caused by 5-FU in C. elegans treated with RNAi for pyridoxal kinase (F57C9.1) (Figures 3A and S3D), with reduced capacity to utilize B6 vitamers, was similar to wild-type (WT) worms when fed ΔpdxJ and supplemented with PL (Figures S3E and S3D), suggesting that PL rescue is not mediated by worm metabolism. Consistent with this idea, worms grown on the PLP-deficient mutant ΔpdxJ failed to show significant gene expression changes for enzymes involved in vitamin B6, folate metabolism, the glycine cleavage system, and nucleotide metabolism, which mediate the effects of 5-FU in eukaryotic cells (Ser et al., 2016Ser Z.

Taken together, these results support a role for bacterial PLP in the modulation of drug efficacy in the host via effects on microbial metabolism rather than direct effects on the host. One-carbon metabolism (OCM) plays an essential role in a myriad of biochemical processes. Out of the 43 enzymes in E. coli that require PLP as a cofactor, ten were found in our screen as regulating the effects of 5-FU on host physiology, with five belonging to OCM (Figures 2G). In particular, PLP is essential for reactions involved in th"
https://openalex.org/W2610143972,"Our recent perplexing findings that polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) acquired embryonic-like stemness and were capable of tumor initiation raised two important unanswered questions: how do PGCCs acquire such stemness, and to which stage of normal development do PGCCs correspond. Intriguingly, formation of giant cells due to failed mitosis/cytokinesis is common in the blastomere stage of the preimplantation embryo. However, the relationship between PGCCs and giant blastomeres has never been studied. Here, we tracked the fate of single PGCCs following paclitaxel-induced mitotic failure. Morphologically, early spheroids derived from PGCCs were indistinguishable from human embryos at the blastomere, polyploid blastomere, compaction, morula and blastocyst-like stages by light, scanning electron or three-dimensional confocal scanning microscopy. Formation of PGCCs was associated with activation of senescence, while budding of daughter cells was associated with senescence escape. PGCCs showed time- and space-dependent activation of expression of the embryonic stem cell markers OCT4, NANOG, SOX2 and SSEA1 and lacked expression of Xist. PGCCs acquired mesenchymal phenotype and were capable of differentiation into all three germ layers in vitro. The embryonic-like stemness of PGCCs was associated with nuclear accumulation of YAP, a key mediator of the Hippo pathway. Spheroids derived from single PGCCs grew into a wide spectrum of human neoplasms, including germ cell tumors, high-grade and low-grade carcinomas and benign tissues. Daughter cells derived from PGCCs showed attenuated capacity for invasion and increased resistance to paclitaxel. We also observed formation of PGCCs and dedifferentiation in ovarian cancer specimens from patients treated with chemotherapy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PGCCs represent somatic equivalents of blastomeres, the most primitive cancer stem cells reported to date. Thus, our studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved archaic embryonic program in somatic cells that can be de-repressed for oncogenesis. Our work offers a new paradigm for cancer origin and disease relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2607724497,"Memory-guided behavior requires maintenance of task-relevant information without sensory input, but the underlying circuit mechanism remains unclear. Calcium imaging in mice performing a delayed Go or No-Go task revealed robust delay activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, with different pyramidal neurons signaling Go and No-Go action plans. Inhibiting pyramidal neurons by optogenetically activating somatostatin- or parvalbumin-positive interneurons, even transiently during the delay, impaired task performance, primarily by increasing inappropriate Go responses. In contrast, activating vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive interneurons enhanced behavioral performance and neuronal action plan representation. Furthermore, while endogenous activity of somatostatin and parvalbumin neurons was strongly biased toward Go trials, VIP neurons were similarly active in Go and No-Go trials. Somatostatin or VIP neuron activation also impaired or enhanced performance, respectively, in a delayed two-alternative forced-choice task. Thus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is a crucial component of the short-term memory network, and activation of its VIP neurons improves memory retention."

We apply these tools to examining differences in localization between an established and an incoming isogenic Bacteroides strain, which reveals the incoming strain that fails to entrench is excluded from the colonic crypts. We adapted the NBU2 integration plasmid (Wang et al., 2000Wang J. Shoemaker N.B. Wang G. Salyers A.A. Wang J.U.N.

These modifications allow for basic DNA parts to be assembled into expression cassettes on Bacteroides integration plasmids in a one-pot reaction (Figure S1). We also developed a conjugation protocol that can be executed with 96-well-compatible liquid handling steps to improve throughput of genetic modification. When combined with Golden Gate cloning, the entire process of going from basic DNA parts to colonies of Bacteroides with genomically integrated constructs can be performed in 3 days with high-throughput liquid handling (Figure 1). To assess the accuracy of this protocol, we performed 40 different 4-piece assemblies and genomically integrated these constructs into 4 different species of Bacteroides: B. thetaiotaomicron (Bt), B. vulgatus (Bv), B. ovatus (Bo), and B. uniformis (Bu). A success rate of more than 99% was achieved using our new pipeline, with similar success rates for each species (Table S1).Figure 1Schematic of the High-Throughput Cloning and Genomic Integration Pipeline for Bacteroides Using 96-Well-Compatible Liquid Handling StepsShow full captionThe pipeline was applied to 54 specifically designed genomically integrated cassettes across four Bacteroides species, resulting in > 99% correct plasmid assembly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pipeline was applied to 54 specifically designed genomically integrated cassettes across four Bacteroides species, resulting in > 99% correct plasmid assembly. Expression of heterologous proteins in Bacteroides at levels sufficient for detection in vivo has been a substantial challenge.

In an attempt to identify a strong RBS sequence and maximize protein production via translation, we designed three different RBS libraries: an AG-rich degenerate sequence resembling the reported consensus sequence (Tribble et al., 1999Tribble G.D.

When tested with PrRNA and a fructose inducible promoter, PBT1763, we found that our AT-rich library sequence, N9W3A3W2TWANAATAATG, produced substantially stronger expression sequences than the other two libraries, while the AG-rich library produced even weaker expression than the unbiased degenerate sequence (Figures 2A , S2A, and S2B). Our phage-based RBS library sequence is similar to the AT-rich RBSs of highly expressed native Bacteroides genes (Wegmann et al., 2013Wegmann U. Horn N. Carding S.R.

Despite the improvements in translation, our highest expression strain produced fluorescence only 40% above background, leading us to search for stronger promoters.Figure S2Comparison of Three GFP Expression Distributions across Strains Generated Using Different RBS Libraries or Different-Sized Phage Promoter Sequences, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Bt strains with GFP expression driven by PrRNA with RBS sequences from one of three different RBS libraries: an AG-rich degenerate sequence, N11R7N2CGTAAATG (red), an unbiased degenerate sequence, N20CGTAAATG (black), and an AT-rich sequence N9W3A3W2TWANAATAATG (green). For each library 192 colonies were screened for GFP fluorescence. Most readings were close to background autofluorescence, 1 au. The fluorescence readings from the strains of the AT-rich RBS library were significantly higher than from the strains of the AG-rich or unbiased degenerate RBS libraries, (p = 2 × 10−14 and 4 × 10−9, respectively, Student’s t test). When repeated in triplicate, the highest expression strain from the AT-rich library produced fluorescence at 1.4 au.(B) RBS libraries were generated similarly for PBT1763-driven GFP expression and at least 72 colonies for each library were screened. Similar to PrRNA, the AT-rich libraries produce a population with higher fluorescent expression than the other two libraries (p < 2 × 10−6).

For each library 192 colonies were screened for GFP fluorescence. Most readings were close to background autofluorescence, 1 au. The fluorescence readings from the strains of the AT-rich RBS library were significantly higher than from the strains of the AG-rich or unbiased degenerate RBS libraries, (p = 2 × 10−14 and 4 × 10−9, respectively, Student’s t test). When repeated in triplicate, the highest expression strain from the AT-rich library produced fluorescence at 1.4 au. (B) RBS libraries were generated similarly for PBT1763-driven GFP expression and at least 72 colonies for each library were screened. Similar to PrRNA, the AT-rich libraries produce a population with higher fluorescent expression than the other two libraries (p < 2 × 10−6).

This phage promoter, here termed PBfP1E6, was compared to PrRNA, the two strongest native Bt promoters (PBT1830 and PBT4615) we identified from available transcriptional profiling data (Sonnenburg et al., 2005Sonnenburg J.L.

For each promoter tested, an AT-rich RBS library of 192 RBSs was screened, and the strongest RBS constructs for each promoter were compared. Strains with PBfP1E6-driven expression produce fluorescence approximately 10-fold higher than the next highest promoter, PBT4615, 40-fold higher than PBT1311, and 70-fold higher than PrRNA (Figure 2B, black bars). Replacing the individually optimized RBSs with the RBS optimized for the phage promoter produced similar results (Figure 2B, gray bars). Recent attempts to express detectable levels of GFP in Bacteroides have been unsuccessful (Mimee et al., 2015Mimee M. Tucker A.C. Voigt C.A. Lu T.K.

We next assessed whether high protein expression results in a loss of Bt fitness. In culture, a 50:50 mix of the high-GFP-expression (PBfP1E6) Bt strain and a non-expressing control Bt strain maintained at ∼50% relative abundance of each strain after > 100 generations of growth (Figures S3A and S3B). Next, a 50:50 mix of the two strains was inoculated into germ-free mice (n = 5) to assess the fitness burden of high, constitutive protein expression in vivo. No significant difference in abundance between the strains was observed over the course of 14 days, tested by assessing single-colony fluorescence from plated fecal samples, with a small reduction from 50%–35% of the GFP-expressing strain during the next 8 weeks (Figure 3A). Imaging of the distal colon at day 71 post-colonization revealed a strong endogenous GFP fluorescence signal in ∼37% of the Bt (Figures 3B and S3C–S3G), consistent with data from plating (Figure 3A).Figure 3Determining the Impact of High Protein Expression on In Vivo FitnessShow full caption(A) Fitness of the high expression Bt strain, with PBfP1E6-driven GFP, is tested in competition against a non-expressing strain showing only a minor fitness defect and stable colonization over a 10-week period in gnotobiotic mice.(B) The bi-colonized mouse from (A) with the median ratio of expressing and non-expressing strains was selected.

Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval for groups of at least 4 mice. Considering the possibility that the fitness burden of high protein expression would be greater in a complex community than in culture or gnotobiotic mice, we inoculated Bt with either PBfP1E6-driven GFP expression or without GFP expression into conventional mice harboring a complex microbiota and monitored abundance by selective plating over 30 days. After introduction of Bt, both the control and the GFP expressing strain maintained a stable colonization level at ∼4% of the total culturable anaerobes for the 30-day duration of the experiment, with no statistically significant difference between the two strains (Figure 3C). Therefore, high expression of GFP driven by PBfP1E6 does not impose a detectable fitness burden in a complex community in the mouse gut, illustrating that an engineered prominent gut microbe is compatible with long-term colonization in vivo. To characterize the variability of the phage promoter under different in vivo and in vitro conditions, we measured transcript levels at different growth phases in culture and from different locations in gnotobiotic mice. Transcripts, measured via qRT-PCR, from PBfP1E6 were relatively similar in all gut locations and culture conditions tested with less than a 4-fold maximum difference, while PrRNA transcripts decreased more than 40-fold between mid-log and late-log growth phases (Figure S3H). Achieving high, reliable expression with this minimal fitness burden enables a wide range of novel applications, including genetically labeling strains such that very similar or isogenic strains can be distinguished in vivo over multiple weeks, which is not possible with any current imaging methods. To characterize how changes in the phage promoter sequence influence expression levels, we constructed 214 Bt strains, each with a single mutation in the promoter driving GFP for 94% of all possible mutations in the 76 residues upstream of the transcription start site (Figure 4A and Table S2). No single mutation significantly increases expression, suggesting that native sequence achieves a local optimum for expression. Based on previous literature (Bayley et al., 2000Bayley D.P. Rocha E.R. Smith C.J. Analysis of cepA and other Bacteroides fragilis genes reveals a unique promoter structure.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 193: 149-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expected promoter activity to be most influenced by mutations in the residues between −4 and −54, particularly in the −7 and −33 regions (Figure 4A, highlighted in blue). However, we found that the −33 position is far less important than expected, while mutations in previously uncharacterized sequences at −49 to −53 and −60 to −64 (Figure 4A, highlighted in red) decreased promoter activity. Consistent with these data, the −51 region is more highly conserved in native Bt promoters than the −33 region (Figure S4A). The region upstream of the −33 is expected to contain the UP element (Bayley et al., 2000Bayley D.P. Rocha E.R. Smith C.J.

Here the authors have genetically identified a population of spinal excitatory neurons that contribute to this form of pain. These cells process information from low-threshold Aβ mechanoreceptors and are part of a morphine-resistant pathway. Mechanical hypersensitivity is a debilitating symptom for millions of chronic pain patients. It exists in distinct forms, including brush-evoked dynamic and filament-evoked punctate hypersensitivities. We reduced dynamic mechanical hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury or inflammation in mice by ablating a group of adult spinal neurons defined by developmental co-expression of VGLUT3 and Lbx1 (VT3Lbx1 neurons): the mice lost brush-evoked nocifensive responses and conditional place aversion. Electrophysiological recordings show that VT3Lbx1 neurons form morphine-resistant polysynaptic pathways relaying inputs from low-threshold Aβ mechanoreceptors to lamina I output neurons. The subset of somatostatin-lineage neurons preserved in VT3Lbx1-neuron-ablated mice is largely sufficient to mediate morphine-sensitive and morphine-resistant forms of von Frey filament-evoked punctate mechanical hypersensitivity. Furthermore, acute silencing of VT3Lbx1 neurons attenuated pre-established dynamic mechanical hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury, suggesting that these neurons may be a cellular target for treating this form of neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2607283788,"Netrin1 has been proposed to act from the floor plate (FP) as a long-range diffusible chemoattractant for commissural axons in the embryonic spinal cord. However, netrin1 mRNA and protein are also present in neural progenitors within the ventricular zone (VZ), raising the question of which source of netrin1 promotes ventrally directed axon growth. Here, we use genetic approaches in mice to selectively remove netrin from different regions of the spinal cord. Our analyses show that the FP is not the source of netrin1 directing axons to the ventral midline, while local VZ-supplied netrin1 is required for this step. Furthermore, rather than being present in a gradient, netrin1 protein accumulates on the pial surface adjacent to the path of commissural axon extension. Thus, netrin1 does not act as a long-range secreted chemoattractant for commissural spinal axons but instead promotes ventrally directed axon outgrowth by haptotaxis, i.e., directed growth along an adhesive surface."
https://openalex.org/W2605474968,"The gut microbiota is implicated in numerous aspects of health and disease, but dissecting these connections is challenging because genetic tools for gut anaerobes are limited. Inducible promoters are particularly valuable tools because these platforms allow real-time analysis of the contribution of microbiome gene products to community assembly, host physiology, and disease. We developed a panel of tunable expression platforms for the prominent genus Bacteroides in which gene expression is controlled by a synthetic inducer. In the absence of inducer, promoter activity is fully repressed; addition of inducer rapidly increases gene expression by four to five orders of magnitude. Because the inducer is absent in mice and their diets, Bacteroides gene expression inside the gut can be modulated by providing the inducer in drinking water. We use this system to measure the dynamic relationship between commensal sialidase activity and liberation of mucosal sialic acid, a receptor and nutrient for pathogens.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwMTViMGIzYmExNmI2NTk1MzViMjFiNjk4ZmVlY2JmNSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDg1MDkwfQ.QOJPpF-q8WplAdDY5mDoOgaJ8KBUMB74relBUqSJM_FzuVpjfVFtxlzsjKZXiQkLatfnBP2-AnJZWChpjP0pif2b-lpv-0doFafARh10BnRuQqvp5pbu-cKZ8Qk2_u66nHsMlI5GAwziQOXHnC5MW5yQaZwgBfTJDs9LcUJ77ZWULBYs7C_zpAX2Ni4Z3VE8wNnUi7Qgq-Mq6IfhkGLFMoZMaJfxqC_Xz7_sGvVMqiiFGKW5hk9eCtNp7qKFXfd3CNjr5-prbFgQaTuig6v45Su1ibMILMTzsxQWCbjz_yRhcdenqwYqRhER_I-nnUJJAZmrsvbU-4Emqbnh0k2hNg(mp4, (33.73 MB) Download video"

We used a comprehensive integrated approach of cross-linking, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (MS), electron microscopy, mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and computational docking to analyze GRK5 interaction with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). These studies revealed a dynamic mechanism of complex formation that involves large conformational changes in the GRK5 RH/catalytic domain interface upon receptor binding. These changes facilitate contacts between intracellular loops 2 and 3 and the C terminus of the β2AR with the GRK5 RH bundle subdomain, membrane-binding surface, and kinase catalytic cleft, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2605381357,"Aging is attended by a progressive decline in protein homeostasis (proteostasis), aggravating the risk for protein aggregation diseases. To understand the coordination between proteome imbalance and longevity, we addressed the mechanistic role of the quality-control ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which is a key regulator of proteostasis. We observed that CHIP deficiency leads to increased levels of the insulin receptor (INSR) and reduced lifespan of worms and flies. The membrane-bound INSR regulates the insulin and IGF1 signaling (IIS) pathway and thereby defines metabolism and aging. INSR is a direct target of CHIP, which triggers receptor monoubiquitylation and endocytic-lysosomal turnover to promote longevity. However, upon proteotoxic stress conditions and during aging, CHIP is recruited toward disposal of misfolded proteins, reducing its capacity to degrade the INSR. Our study indicates a competitive relationship between proteostasis and longevity regulation through CHIP-assisted proteolysis, providing a mechanistic concept for understanding the impact of proteome imbalance on aging."

However, it is currently unknown whether these temporal firing patterns critically rely on upstream cortical input. Here we employ an optogenetic approach to explore the effect of large-scale inactivation of the medial entorhinal cortex on temporal, as well as spatial and object, coding by hippocampal CA1 neurons. Medial entorhinal inactivation produced a specific deficit in temporal coding in CA1 and resulted in significant impairment in memory across a temporal delay. In striking contrast, spatial and object coding remained intact. Further, we extended the scope of hippocampal phase precession to include object information relevant to memory and behavior. Overall, our work demonstrates that medial entorhinal activity plays an especially important role for CA1 in temporal coding and memory across time."

Although vertebrates express active chitinases from evolutionarily conserved loci, their role in mammalian physiology is unclear. We show that distinct lung epithelial cells secrete acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), which is required for airway chitinase activity. AMCase-deficient mice exhibit premature morbidity and mortality, concomitant with accumulation of environmentally derived chitin polymers in the airways and expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines. Over time, these mice develop spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, which is ameliorated by restoration of lung chitinase activity by genetic or therapeutic approaches. AMCase-deficient epithelial cells express fibrosis-associated gene sets linked with cell stress pathways. Mice with lung fibrosis due to telomere dysfunction and humans with interstitial lung disease also accumulate excess chitin polymers in their airways. These data suggest that altered chitin clearance could exacerbate fibrogenic pathways in the setting of lung diseases characterized by epithelial cell dysfunction."

Merkel-cell associated afferents are thought to play a major role in form perception by encoding surface features of touched objects. However, activity of Merkel afferents during active touch has not been directly measured. Here, we show that Merkel and unidentified slowly adapting afferents in the whisker system of behaving mice respond to both self-motion and active touch. Touch responses were dominated by sensitivity to bending moment (torque) at the base of the whisker and its rate of change and largely explained by a simple mechanical model. Self-motion responses encoded whisker position within a whisk cycle (phase), not absolute whisker angle, and arose from stresses reflecting whisker inertia and activity of specific muscles. Thus, Merkel afferents send to the brain multiplexed information about whisker position and surface features, suggesting that proprioception and touch converge at the earliest neural level."
https://openalex.org/W2609799650,"Microorganisms and their hosts share the same environment, and microbial metabolic molecules (metabolites) exert crucial effects on host physiology. Environmental factors not only shape the composition of the host's resident microorganisms, but also modulate their metabolism. However, the exact molecular relationship among the environment, microbial metabolites and host metabolism remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered that environmental methionine tunes bacterial methyl metabolism to regulate host mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans through an endocrine crosstalk involving NR5A nuclear receptor and Hedgehog signalling. We discovered that methionine deficiency in bacterial medium decreases the production of bacterial metabolites that are essential for phosphatidylcholine synthesis in C. elegans. Reductions of diundecanoyl and dilauroyl phosphatidylcholines attenuate NHR-25, a NR5A nuclear receptor, and release its transcriptional suppression of GRL-21, a Hedgehog-like protein. The induction of GRL-21 consequently inhibits the PTR-24 Patched receptor cell non-autonomously, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation and lipid accumulation. Together, our work reveals an environment-microorganism-host metabolic axis regulating host mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism, and discovers NR5A-Hedgehog intercellular signalling that controls these metabolic responses with critical consequences for host health and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2605998708,"Methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS) have become increasingly recognised as opportunistic pathogens that limit therapeutic options in companion animals. The frequency of methicillin resistance amongst clinical isolates on an Australia-wide level is unknown. This study determined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for CoPS isolated from clinical infections in companion animals (dogs, cats and horses) as part of the first nation-wide survey on antimicrobial resistance in animal pathogens in Australia for a one-year period (January 2013 to January 2014). Clinical Staphylococcus spp. isolates (n = 888) obtained from 22 veterinary diagnostic laboratories were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing for 16 antimicrobials, representing 12 antimicrobial classes. Potential risk factors associated with methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from dogs were analysed based on demographic factors and clinical history, including gender, age, previous antimicrobial treatment, chronic and/or recurrent diseases and site of infections. The most commonly identified CoPS were S. pseudintermedius (70.8%; dogs n = 616, cats n = 13) and S. aureus (13.2%, horses n = 53, dogs n = 47 and cats n = 17). Overall, the frequency of methicillin resistance among S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and S. aureus (MRSA) was 11.8% and 12.8%, respectively. MRSP isolates were strongly associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones (OR 287; 95%CI 91.2–1144.8) and clindamycin (OR 105.2, 95%CI 48.5–231.9). MRSA isolates from dogs and cats were also more likely to be resistant to fluoroquinolones (OR 5.4, 95%CI 0.6–252.1), whereas MRSA from horses were more likely to be resistant to rifampicin. In multivariate analysis, MRSP-positive status was significantly associated with particular infection sites, including surgical (OR 8.8; 95%CI 3.74–20.7), and skin and soft tissue (OR 3.9; 95%CI 1.97–7.51). S. pseudintermedius isolated from dogs with surgical site infections were three times more likely to be methicillin-resistant if cases had received prior antimicrobial treatment. Whilst the survey results indicate the proportion of CoPS obtained from Australian companion animals that are methicillin-resistant is currently moderate, the identified risk factors suggest that it could rapidly increase without adequate biosecurity and infection control procedures in veterinary practice."
https://openalex.org/W2607429927,"During the austral summer of 2014, an oceanographic cruise was conducted in the Ross Sea in the framework of the RoME (Ross Sea Mesoscale Experiment) Project. Forty-three hydrological stations were sampled within three different areas: the northern Ross Sea (RoME 1), Terra Nova Bay (RoME 2), and the southern Ross Sea (RoME 3). The ecological and photophysiological characteristics of the phytoplankton were investigated (i.e., size structure, functional groups, PSII maximum quantum efficiency, photoprotective pigments), as related to hydrographic and chemical features. The aim was to identify the mechanisms that modulate phytoplankton blooms, and consequently, the fate of organic materials produced by the blooms. The observed biomass standing stocks were very high (e.g., integrated chlorophyll-a up to 371 mg m-2 in the top 100 m). Large differences in phytoplankton community composition, relative contribution of functional groups and photosynthetic parameters were observed among the three subsystems. The diatoms (in different physiological status) were the dominant taxa in RoME 1 and RoME 3; in RoME 1, a post-bloom phase was identified, whereas in RoME 3, an active phytoplankton bloom occurred. In RoME 2, diatoms co-occurred with Phaeocystis antarctica, but were vertically segregated by the upper mixed layer, with senescent diatoms dominating in the upper layer, and P. antarctica blooming in the deeper layer. The dominance of the phytoplankton micro-fraction over the whole area and the high Chl-a suggested the prevalence of non-grazed large cells, independent of the distribution of the two functional groups. These data emphasise the occurrence of significant temporal changes in the phytoplankton biomass in the Ross Sea during austral summer. The mechanisms that drive such changes and the fate of the carbon production are probably related to the variations in the limiting factors induced by the concurrent hydrological modifications to the Ross Sea, and they remain to be fully clarified. The comparison of conditions observed during summer 2014 and those reported for previous years reveal considerably different ecological assets that might be the result of current climate change. This suggests that further changes can be expected in the future, even at larger oceanic scales."

We demonstrate that the sense and antisense strand DNA mutagenesis at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and some other regions of the B cell genome depends upon localized RNA processing protein complex formation in the nucleus. Both the physical proximity and coupled activities of RNA helicase Mtr4 (and senataxin) with the noncoding RNA processing function of RNA exosome determine the strand-specific distribution of DNA mutations.

Five isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (45% crude protein and 14% crude lipid) were formulated to contain graded DHA/EPA ratios of 0.65, 1.16, 1.60, 2.03 and 2.67. There were no differences in growth performance and feed utilization among treatments. Fish fed higher DHA/EPA ratios had higher malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum than lower ratios. Serum triacylglycerol (TAG) content was significantly higher in fish fed the lowest DHA/EPA ratio. Tissue fatty acid profiles reflected the diets despite down-regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis genes, fatty acyl desaturase 2 (fads2) and elongase of very long-chain fatty acids 5 (elovl5), by high DHA/EPA ratios. Expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (accα) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (cpt1a) were up-regulated by high DHA/EPA ratio, whereas sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp-1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (hsl) were down-regulated. Fatty acid synthase (fas), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgd) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (pparα) showed highest expression in fish fed intermediate (1.16) DHA/EPA ratio. Overall, this study indicated that dietary DHA/EPA ratio affected fatty acid profiles and significantly influenced lipid metabolism including LC-PUFA biosynthesis and other anabolic and catabolic pathways, and also had impacts on antioxidant capacity and hematological characteristics."

NCX inactivation occurs in the absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and is facilitated by palmitoylation of a single cysteine at position 739 within the large intracellular loop of NCX. The aim of this investigation was to identify the structural determinants of NCX1 palmitoylation. Full-length NCX1 (FL-NCX1) and a YFP fusion protein of the NCX1 large intracellular loop (YFP-NCX1) were expressed in HEK cells. Single amino acid changes around Cys-739 in FL-NCX1 and deletions on the N-terminal side of Cys-739 in YFP-NCX1 did not affect NCX1 palmitoylation, with the exception of the rare human polymorphism S738F, which enhanced FL-NCX1 palmitoylation, and D741A, which modestly reduced it. In contrast, deletion of a 21-amino acid segment enriched in aromatic amino acids on the C-terminal side of Cys-739 abolished YFP-NCX1 palmitoylation. We hypothesized that this segment forms an amphipathic α-helix whose properties facilitate Cys-739 palmitoylation. Introduction of negatively charged amino acids to the hydrophobic face or of helix-breaking prolines impaired palmitoylation of both YFP-NCX1 and FL-NCX1. Alanine mutations on the hydrophilic face of the helix significantly reduced FL-NCX1 palmitoylation. Of note, when the helix-containing segment was introduced adjacent to cysteines that are not normally palmitoylated, they became palmitoylation sites. In conclusion, we have identified an amphipathic α-helix in the NCX1 large intracellular loop that controls NCX1 palmitoylation. NCX1 palmitoylation is governed by a distal secondary structure element rather than by local primary sequence. The electrogenic sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) mediates bidirectional calcium transport controlled by the transmembrane sodium gradient. NCX inactivation occurs in the absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and is facilitated by palmitoylation of a single cysteine at position 739 within the large intracellular loop of NCX. The aim of this investigation was to identify the structural determinants of NCX1 palmitoylation. Full-length NCX1 (FL-NCX1) and a YFP fusion protein of the NCX1 large intracellular loop (YFP-NCX1) were expressed in HEK cells. Single amino acid changes around Cys-739 in FL-NCX1 and deletions on the N-terminal side of Cys-739 in YFP-NCX1 did not affect NCX1 palmitoylation, with the exception of the rare human polymorphism S738F, which enhanced FL-NCX1 palmitoylation, and D741A, which modestly reduced it. In contrast, deletion of a 21-amino acid segment enriched in aromatic amino acids on the C-terminal side of Cys-739 abolished YFP-NCX1 palmitoylation. We hypothesized that this segment forms an amphipathic α-helix whose properties facilitate Cys-739 palmitoylation. Introduction of negatively charged amino acids to the hydrophobic face or of helix-breaking prolines impaired palmitoylation of both YFP-NCX1 and FL-NCX1. Alanine mutations on the hydrophilic face of the helix significantly reduced FL-NCX1 palmitoylation. Of note, when the helix-containing segment was introduced adjacent to cysteines that are not normally palmitoylated, they became palmitoylation sites. In conclusion, we have identified an amphipathic α-helix in the NCX1 large intracellular loop that controls NCX1 palmitoylation. NCX1 palmitoylation is governed by a distal secondary structure element rather than by local primary sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2610095895,"The MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex is essential for repair of DNA double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks. Mutations of the MRN complex subunit MRE11 cause the hereditary cancer-susceptibility disease ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). Here we show that MRE11 directly interacts with PIH1D1, a subunit of heat-shock protein 90 cochaperone R2TP complex, which is required for the assembly of large protein complexes, such as RNA polymerase II, small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. The MRE11-PIH1D1 interaction is dependent on casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation of two acidic sequences within the MRE11 C terminus containing serines 558/561 and 688/689. Conversely, the PIH1D1 phospho-binding domain PIH-N is required for association with MRE11 phosphorylated by CK2. Consistent with these findings, depletion of PIH1D1 resulted in MRE11 destabilization and affected DNA-damage repair processes dependent on MRE11. Additionally, mutations of serines 688/689, which abolish PIH1D1 binding, also resulted in decreased MRE11 stability. As depletion of R2TP frequently leads to instability of its substrates and as truncation mutation of MRE11 lacking serines 688/689 leads to decreased levels of the MRN complex both in ATLD patients and an ATLD mouse model, our results suggest that the MRN complex is a novel R2TP complex substrate and that their interaction is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation."

Myc inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In this work, we utilized one of these transgenic HCC models in which tumor initiation and sustained growth are solely dependent on the expression of a doxycycline-regulated Myc transgene (22Shachaf C.M. Kopelman A.M. Arvanitis C. Karlsson A. Beer S. Mandl S. Bachmann M.H. Borowsky A.D. Ruebner B. Cardiff R.D. Yang Q. Bishop J.M. Contag C.H. Felsher D.W. Myc inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The model permits an examination of the nature and timing of other molecular, biochemical, and metabolic drivers and modifiers that accumulate during and impact tumorigenesis. It also allows a determination of how these factors respond during tumor regression following Myc silencing and tumor recurrence following Myc re-expression. This approach therefore provides insight into the evolutionary processes that accompany primary and relapsed tumorigenesis in response to the precisely regulated overexpression of a single well defined oncogenic stimulus. In contrast to a previous report (22Shachaf C.M. Kopelman A.M. Arvanitis C. Karlsson A. Beer S. Mandl S. Bachmann M.H. Borowsky A.D. Ruebner B. Cardiff R.D. Yang Q. Bishop J.M. Contag C.H. Felsher D.W. Myc inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), liver weights remained unchanged for at least 1 week following Myc induction. Tumors also appeared earlier than previously reported, reaching maximal size within 3–4 weeks. Tumors then regressed by ˜50–75% within a week of resuming doxycycline and disappeared over the ensuing 1–2 weeks (supplemental Fig. S1A). Upon re-inducing Myc 2–3 months later, tumors recurred more rapidly than initial tumors, attaining sizes approximating those of the original neoplasms within 11–15 days. We refer to these hereafter as “initial tumors” (or “tumors”) and “recurrent tumors,” respectively. Cell cycle analyses performed on nuclei isolated from initial and recurrent tumors showed distinctly different patterns compared with livers and with one another (supplemental Fig. S1B). For example, nuclei isolated from normal livers, although primarily diploid, also contained the expected subpopulations of tetraploid and octaploid nuclei (23Duncan A.W. Aneuploidy, polyploidy and ploidy reversal in the liver.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 24: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The paucity of S-phase populations was consistent with these cells being uniformly quiescent. In contrast, nuclei from initial tumors were diploid (or pseudo-diploid) with a significant S-phase population. Recurrent tumors showed a greater fraction of S-phase cells and a more disperse DNA distribution, suggesting that many of the nuclei were aneuploid, despite the known clonal derivation of these from the initial tumors (22Shachaf C.M. Kopelman A.M. Arvanitis C. Karlsson A. Beer S. Mandl S. Bachmann M.H. Borowsky A.D. Ruebner B. Cardiff R.D. Yang Q. Bishop J.M. Contag C.H. Felsher D.W. Myc inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Both initial and recurrent tumors expressed high but otherwise equivalent levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna). Thus, the faster growth of recurrent tumors correlated with a higher S-phase population and aneuploidy (supplemental Fig. S1C). Histologically, all tumors resembled moderately differentiated HCCs with numerous mitotic cells observed in most high-power fields (supplemental Fig. S1D) (22Shachaf C.M. Kopelman A.M. Arvanitis C. Karlsson A. Beer S. Mandl S. Bachmann M.H. Borowsky A.D. Ruebner B. Cardiff R.D. Yang Q. Bishop J.M. Contag C.H. Felsher D.W. Myc inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Both initial and recurrent tumors expressed high Myc levels (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2A). Much lower levels were detected in livers prior to the appearance of tumors (D3 and D7), and virtually none was detected in regressing tumors (R3 and R7). Thus, in response to doxycycline removal, and as reported previously (24Hu S. Balakrishnan A. Bok R.A. Anderton B. Larson P.E. Nelson S.J. Kurhanewicz J. Vigneron D.B. Goga A. 13C-pyruvate imaging reveals alterations in glycolysis that precede c-myc-induced tumor formation and regression.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 131-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), Myc accumulated gradually, achieved maximal expression only in fully developed tumors, and disappeared rapidly following return to the “Myc off” state. Many HCCs co-express β-catenin, YAP, and Myc, and the MYC gene is a target for both the β-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways (14Tao J. Calvisi D.F. Ranganathan S. Cigliano A. Zhou L. Singh S. Jiang L.

Whether Myc in turn influences the expression of the other two oncoproteins is unknown as is the order in which these proteins appear during disease progression. β-Catenin expression was detected at low levels in liver, accumulated gradually following Myc induction, and was maximally expressed in initial tumors or R3 tumors. It then tended to decline by R7 and did not reappear in recurrent tumors (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2A). In contrast, YAP was highly up-regulated in and remained confined to initial and recurrent tumors, although expression in the latter group was lower. This suggested that, at least in initial tumors, the deregulation of YAP and β-catenin was more dependent on sustained Myc expression than on the actual tumor environment. It further indicated distinct biochemical differences between initial and recurrent tumors with regard to the expression of these two critical oncoproteins. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme complex that links glycolysis and the TCA cycle by catalyzing pyruvate's irreversible conversion to acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) (ΔG0 = −7.5 kcal) (27Patel M.S.

Med. 2001; 33: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Reduced PDH activity in some cancers may allow the accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates that serve as anabolic precursors while simultaneously diverting pyruvate away from the TCA cycle in cells that are heavily reliant on the Warburg effect (28Chiu J.H.

In experimental murine hepatoblastomas (HBs), however, we previously showed PDH to be highly up-regulated and to correlate with decreased expression of the inhibitory kinase Pdk1 and increased expression of the stimulatory phosphatase Pdp2 (Fig. 1B) (27Patel M.S.

To determine whether this was also true in HCCs, we measured total and phosphorylated (Ser293) PDH E1 subunit (pPDH), with the latter indicating a less active form of the enzyme (27Patel M.S.

Fromherz M. Beer-Stolz D. Uppala R. Bharathi S. Monga S.P. Goetzman E.S. Prochownik E.V.

Chem. 2016; 291: 26241-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), both initial and recurrent HCCs showed significantly reduced E1 subunit phosphorylation as well as decreased Pdk1 and increased Pdp2, with changes in the latter being seen as early as D3–D7 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2B). Consistent with these findings, PDH enzymatic activity was also markedly increased at these times (Fig. 1D). Despite similarly appearing pPDH/Pdk1/Pdp2 profiles (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2B), recurrent tumors had lower PDH activity than even control livers (Fig. 1D), perhaps because of an overall lower level of total PDH. In keeping with the notion that high PDH activity might maximize ATP generation in the face of limiting amounts of pyruvate, initial tumors but not recurrent tumors contained significantly more ATP than livers (Fig. 1E). Indeed, recurrent tumors contained even less PDH activity than livers. Collectively, these results showed that PDH activity was highly sensitive to initial fluctuations in Myc levels but that this response was lost in recurrent tumors in a manner that correlated with ATP levels. To identify additional metabolic changes, we next evaluated certain mitochondrial properties and functions, including mass, oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos), electron transport chain (ETC) function, and fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), that are deregulated in HBs (30Wang H.

Similarly, an ˜30–40% reduction in mitochondrial mass was noted in initial tumors and persisted during regression and recurrence (Fig. 2A). Complex I activity of livers remained unchanged in the immediate D3–D7 period but increased significantly in initial tumors as described previously for HBs (Fig. 2B) (30Wang H. Lu J. Edmunds L.R.

These results indicate that, relative to livers, initial tumors altered their Oxphos profile so as to favor complex I over complex II as a source of electrons for complex III. In contrast, the overall mitochondrial function in recurrent tumors more closely resembled that of normal livers.

In contrast, complex II activity was increased nearly 4-fold in initial tumors and somewhat less so in recurrent tumors. These results, together with the lower complex II activity of initial tumors as measured by respirometry (Fig. 2B), indicated that the electron transport function of complex II, as measured by OCR (Fig. 2B), was uncoupled from its succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, which oxidizes succinate to fumarate using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the electron donor (34Tretter L.

The profoundly reduced FAO activity in HBs has suggested that, rather than being metabolized to AcCoA and re-synthesized into lipids, de novo, free fatty acids are instead preferentially incorporated directly into new lipids to support rapid tumor growth, thus presumably increasing tumor reliance on glucose as an energy source (30Wang H.

These findings, including a similar role of ACS-4 in a male/female species, uncover a likely conserved mechanism by which FA, an environmental factor, regulates sex determination and reproductive development. Reproductive development is critically regulated by sex determination that is controlled by karyotype. Sex determination has been shown in various animals to also be regulated by environmental cues, such as temperature and food availability, to maximize reproductive fitness under specific conditions (Crews and Bull, 2009Crews D.

However, the role of specific nutrients such as fatty acids (FAs) in environmental sex determination (ESD) has not been explored, and the molecular mechanisms underlying ESD remain to be understood. Fat storage, a reflection of food availability over a period of time and a flexible resource of necessary nutrients for reproduction, has been regarded as a reproductive adaption (Ballinger, 1977Ballinger R.E.

The interaction between fat metabolism/energy balance and reproductive development has been extensively studied in human and various animal models (Burt Solorzano and McCartney, 2010Burt Solorzano C.M.

However, the specific cellular processes and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of fat metabolism on reproductive development remain to be explored. Although C. elegans hermaphrodites make both oocytes and sperm, the differentiation of germ cells is partitioned, functioning as only “male” or “female” at a given time. At the third larval stage (L3), the germ cells transiently commit to spermatogenesis and then switch to oogenesis in L4 for the rest of the life (Ellis and Schedl, 2007Ellis, R., and Schedl, T. (2007). Sex determination in the germ line. WormBook. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.82.1, 1–13. WormBook.Google Scholar). Therefore, from L4 until reproductive senescence, the germline sex-determination pathway promotes oocyte fate. The key regulators controlling sex determination have been well characterized (Ellis and Schedl, 2007Ellis, R., and Schedl, T. (2007). Sex determination in the germ line. WormBook. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.82.1, 1–13. WormBook.Google Scholar, Meyer, 2005Meyer, B.J. (2005). X-Chromosome dosage compensation. WormBook. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook, http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.8.1, 1–14. WormBook.Google Scholar) (see Figure S1A for the prevailing model). Influences of environmental cues on C. elegans sex determination have been previously reported (Doniach, 1986Doniach T. Activity of the sex-determining gene tra-2 is modulated to allow spermatogenesis in the C. elegans hermaphrodite.Genetics. 1986; 114: 53-76PubMed Google Scholar, Hodgkin, 2002Hodgkin J. Exploring the envelope. Systematic alteration in the sex-determination system of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2002; 162: 767-780PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, C. elegans presents an excellent model to study the impact of fat metabolism on sex determination and reproductive development. Given the known impact of fat on reproductivity in various animals mentioned above, we hypothesized that a signaling mechanism perceives and interprets lipid cues to regulate the germ cell fate. We set out to investigate whether FA metabolism impacts the specification of germ cell fate. Since domesticated wild-type C. elegans strains are less sensitive to environmental changes (Félix and Braendle, 2010Félix M.A. Braendle C. The natural history of Caenorhabditis elegans.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: R965-R969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, McGrath et al., 2011McGrath P.T. Xu Y. Ailion M. Garrison J.L. Butcher R.A. Bargmann C.I. Parallel evolution of domesticated Caenorhabditis species targets pheromone receptor genes.Nature. 2011; 477: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we analyzed a tra-2 mutant that is likely more sensitive to nutrient availability regarding germ cell fate choice. tra-2, encoding a membrane-bound receptor, acts in the germline sex-determination pathway to promote oocyte fate (Figure S1A). In wild-type males, tra-2 activity is inhibited to repress oocyte fate. A gain-of-function (gf) mutation, e2020, elevates tra-2 activity, but the increase is not sufficient to cause males to generate oocytes under well-fed condition (Doniach, 1986Doniach T. Activity of the sex-determining gene tra-2 is modulated to allow spermatogenesis in the C. elegans hermaphrodite.Genetics. 1986; 114: 53-76PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). This elevation is expected to render tra-2(gf) males more sensitive to environmental influences that promote the oocyte fate, which is supported by the previous report that tra-2(gf) males that experienced starvation and were then re-fed produced oocytes (Doniach, 1986Doniach T. Activity of the sex-determining gene tra-2 is modulated to allow spermatogenesis in the C. elegans hermaphrodite.Genetics. 1986; 114: 53-76PubMed Google Scholar). Starvation and then re-feeding presents a condition that induces global changes in gene expression in response to the dramatic changes in food availability (Maxwell et al., 2012Maxwell C.S. Antoshechkin I. Kurhanewicz N. Belsky J.A. Baugh L.R. Nutritional control of mRNA isoform expression during developmental arrest and recovery in C. elegans.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1920-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). FA levels are reduced in starvation condition (Van Gilst et al., 2005Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. A Caenorhabditis elegans nutrient response system partially dependent on nuclear receptor NHR-49.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and FA levels are likely increased in response to re-feeding. To investigate the role of FA metabolism in oogenesis in tra-2(gf) males induced by starvation and then re-feeding, we first analyzed the FA metabolic status in these oocyte-producing tra-2(gf) males. We observed that the levels of multiple FAs were prominently increased (Figures 1H and S1B), and the increase was at least partly due to increased intestinal fat (Figures S1C–S1E). These results suggest that there is fat metabolism re-programing in these starvation-experienced animals. We then found that RNAi knockdown of FA synthesis genes, fasn-1 (Lee et al., 2010Lee K.Z. Kniazeva M. Han M. Pujol N. Ewbank J.J. The fatty acid synthase fasn-1 acts upstream of WNK and Ste20/GCK-VI kinases to modulate antimicrobial peptide expression in C. elegans epidermis.Virulence. 2010; 1: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or pod-2 (Rappleye et al., 2003Rappleye C.A. Tagawa A. Le Bot N. Ahringer J. Aroian R.V. Involvement of fatty acid pathways and cortical interaction of the pronuclear complex in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic polarity.BMC Dev. Biol. 2003; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suppressed oogenesis in tra-2(e2020) males re-fed after starvation (Figures 1A–1C and 1G). This suppression is likely achieved by preventing the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch since sperm were continuously made in these males and oocytes were still present in tra-2(gf) hermaphrodites (Table S1). These results suggest that high FA levels promote oocyte fate after recovery from starvation. In addition to biosynthesis, FAs can also be released (mobilized) from fat by lipolysis, through the activity of lipases (Zimmermann et al., 2004Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Fat mobilization in adipose tissue is promoted by adipose triglyceride lipase.Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of lipolysis in germ cell fate in the tra-2(e2020) animals by knocking down several putative lipases (O’Rourke and Ruvkun, 2013O’Rourke E.J. Ruvkun G. MXL-3 and HLH-30 transcriptionally link lipolysis and autophagy to nutrient availability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We found that RNAi of lipl-2, lipl-5, or lipl-6 could suppress oogenesis in more than 50% of the tra-2(e2020) males recovered after starvation (Figures 1D–1G; Table S1). This result suggests that release of FAs from fat is required for oocyte-fate change promoted by starvation experience. Further analysis from tissue-specific RNAi suggests that the synthesis and mobilization of FA in the intestine, but not the germline, affect the germ cell fate (Table S1), consistent with the increased fat in the intestine (Figures S1C–S1E). Therefore, the level of free FA in the somatic tissue critically regulates germ cell fate. A free FA must be esterified to coenzyme A by an acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) to form the activated intermediate fatty acyl-CoA (FA-CoA) (Ellis et al., 2010Ellis J.M. Frahm J.L. Li L.O. Coleman R.A. Acyl-coenzyme A synthetases in metabolic control.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2010; 21: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Activity of a given ACS may also be coupled with subsequent enzymatic reactions that channel FAs to specific metabolic fates (Kniazeva et al., 2012Kniazeva M. Shen H. Euler T. Wang C. Han M. Regulation of maternal phospholipid composition and IP(3)-dependent embryonic membrane dynamics by a specific fatty acid metabolic event in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 554-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To explore the roles of ACSs in the impact on germ cell fate by FA, we used RNAi or mutations to knock down each of the 22 genes encoding putative ACSs in C. elegans and found that loss-of-function (lf) of acs-4 suppressed oogenesis in tra-2(e2020) males recovered after starvation (Figure 2B). More strikingly, acs-4(lf) single-mutant hermaphrodites made neither oocytes nor sperm, and the majority of them produced excess arrested spermatocytes (Figures 2C–2F). Additionally, an early oocyte-specific marker, LIN-41::GFP (Spike et al., 2014Spike C.A. Coetzee D. Eichten C. Wang X. Hansen D. Greenstein D. The TRIM-NHL protein LIN-41 and the OMA RNA-binding proteins antagonistically control the prophase-to-metaphase transition and growth of Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes.Genetics. 2014; 198: 1535-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was not visible in acs-4(lf) germline (Figure 2C). These results indicate that the germline in well-fed acs-4(lf) hermaphrodites fails to switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis and fails to complete spermatocyte division. Additional characterization of the nuclear morphology and marker expression of germ cells at different stages supported that the germline of acs-4(lf) fails to switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis (Figures S2A–S2K). In addition, the smaller mitotic region of the acs-4(lf) germline (Figure 2D) suggests that acs-4 may also have a role in mitotic proliferation. Since we observed that FA synthesis and mobilization in the somatic tissues are required to promote oocyte fate, and acs-4 has been found in lipid droplets in the intestine and skin (Vrablik et al., 2015Vrablik T.L. Petyuk V.A. Larson E.M. Smith R.D. Watts J.L. Lipidomic and proteomic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans lipid droplets and identification of ACS-4 as a lipid droplet-associated protein.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1851: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we asked where ACS-4 acts to mediate the impact of fat metabolism in the intestine on germ cell fate. We first determined that acs-4 activity in the germline is essential for its function in driving oocyte fate (Figures 2D–2F, S2L, and S2M). We then tested the sufficiency of acs-4 expression in the germline for this role by expressing a functional acs-4::GFP specifically in the germline (driven by the pie-1 promoter [Merritt et al., 2008Merritt C. Rasoloson D. Ko D. Seydoux G. 3′ UTRs are the primary regulators of gene expression in the C. elegans germline.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1476-1482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar]). This transgene was sufficient to recover oocyte and sperm production in acs-4(lf) mutants (Figure 2G). Additionally, a small fraction of the transgenic worms displayed obvious overexpression of acs-4::gfp, and all of them produced only oocytes (Figure 2H). Thus, a high level of ACS-4 in the germline promotes oogenesis and inhibits spermatogenesis. Taken together, acs-4 acts in the germline to critically promote the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch, suggesting that free FAs produced in the soma, which can be transported between different cells/tissues (Hamilton and Kamp, 1999Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. How are free fatty acids transported in membranes? Is it by proteins or by free diffusion through the lipids?.Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), serve as substrates of germline-expressed ACS-4 for the germ cell fate decision. Given that ACS-4 is a putative acyl-coA synthetase, we hypothesized that deficiency of FA-CoA in the germline causes the oogenesis defect in acs-4(lf) (Figure 2A). In C. elegans, spermatocytes and oocytes are generated from a common pool of germ-cell precursors, and the distal germline is a syncytium (Hubbard and Greenstein, 2005Hubbard, E.J.A., and Greenstein, D. (2005). Introduction to the germ line. WormBook. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook, http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.18.1, 1–4. WormBook.Google Scholar). We directly injected commercially obtained FA-CoAs, which were significantly increased in the tra-2(e2020) males recovered from starvation (Figure 1H), into acs-4(lf) germline to test for rescue of oogenesis. Oocytes were recovered in more than 90% of the germline arms injected with myristoyl-CoA but not with the vehicle or the other FA-CoAs (Figure 2I–2K). Only one of the two gonad arms of each worm was injected, and the recovery of oogenesis was only observed in the arm injected with myristoyl-CoA, indicating that myristoyl-CoA supplementation is sufficient to rescue acs-4(lf) oogenesis defects and that FA-CoA only functions in local cells. We next used a published yeast model (Johnson et al., 1994Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains four fatty acid activation (FAA) genes: an assessment of their role in regulating protein N-myristoylation and cellular lipid metabolism.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to test the FA esterification activity of ACS-4 and found that acs-4 was able to complement the function of the yeast faa1 and faa4 in activating myristic acid (C14:0) (Figure 2L), indicating that the worm ACS-4 is capable of converting myristic acid to myristoyl-CoA. Together with the above injection data, myristoyl-CoA produced by ACS-4 in the germline critically promotes the oocyte fate in hermaphrodites. FA-CoAs made by ACSs have many different metabolic fates (Figure 2A). To identify the fate of ACS-4-involved myristoyl-CoA for its role in germ cell fate, we first examined the relative levels of FA and found no obvious change in acs-4(lf) (Figure S3A), suggesting that ACS-4 is not critical in overall FA biosynthesis and degradation. We then screened a collection of ∼400 lipid metabolism-related genes by RNAi for an effect on germ cell fate (Table S2) and observed roles only for enzymes involved in protein myristoylation (see below). We then determined a role of ACS-4 in protein myristoylation by observing that the total abundance of myristoylated proteins were reduced in acs-4(lf) (Figures 3A and S3B). Myristoylation is an essential modification needed for normal function of many proteins involved in various cellular processes (Johnson et al., 1994Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains four fatty acid activation (FAA) genes: an assessment of their role in regulating protein N-myristoylation and cellular lipid metabolism.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Resh, 1994Resh M.D. Myristylation and palmitylation of Src family members: the fats of the matter.Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Myristoylated proteins were not totally missing in the acs-4(lf) mutant, which is consistent with the observation that acs-4(lf) causes sterility but not lethality and suggests other ACS enzymes may function redundantly with ACS-4 in somatic tissues for myristoylation. Thus we performed an RNAi enhancer screen and found that knockout of both acs-4 and acs-17 caused synthetic larval lethality (Figure S3D) as reported previously (Tischler et al., 2006Tischler J. Lehner B. Chen N. Fraser A.G. Combinatorial RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals that redundancy between gene duplicates can be maintained for more than 80 million years of evolution.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R69Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and ACS-17 also activates myristic acid in yeast (Figure 2L). The abundance of myristoylated proteins in the acs-4(lf);acs-17(lf) double mutants was dramatically decreased (Figure 3A), indicating acs-4 and acs-17 are collectively essential for myristoylation. Given that the acs-17(lf) mutant is superficially wild-type and that the acs-4(lf) mutant displays a robust sterile phenotype, acs-4 is likely the major contributor of myristoylation in the germline. We tested this idea by examining myristoylation of the PPM-2 phosphatase that is expressed in the germline (http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp) and has been shown to be myristoylated for a role in neuronal development (Baker et al., 2014Baker S.T. Opperman K.J. Tulgren E.D. Turgeon S.M. Bienvenut W. Grill B. RPM-1 uses both ubiquitin ligase and phosphatase-based mechanisms to regulate DLK-1 during neuronal development.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004297Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We constructed a germline-specific ppm-2:gfp reporter and used a biochemical procedure to label and enrich for myristoylated PPM-2::GFP (Figure S3C). The level of myristoylated PPM-2::GFP was drastically lower in acs-4(lf) (Figure 3B), confirming the requirement of ACS-4 in protein myristoylation in the germline. We then asked if myristoylation mediates the role of ACS-4 on germ cell fate specification. The starter methionine of nascent proteins must be removed by methionine amino-peptidase before N-myristoyltransferase catalyzes the addition of myristoyl-CoA, produced by ACS, to protein. Germline-specific RNAi of the only putative N-myristoyltransferase gene, nmt-1, or one of the two methionine amino-peptidase genes, map-2, caused sterility in 57.8% and 63.9% of the animals, respectively. 100% of these sterile animals displayed no significant expression of LIN-41::GFP (Figures 3C–3F). Among these LIN-41::GFP-negative animals, 34.6% (nmt-1[RNAi]) and 16.4% (map-2[RNAi]) had complete germlines, indicating that the germline in these animals failed to commit to oocyte fate. The rest of the sterile animals showed defective germlines without obvious mitotic and meiotic zones (Table S3; Figures S3E and S3F). Analyses using a sperm/spermatocyte-specific marker also showed that when treated with germline-specific nmt-1(RNAi) or map-2(RNAi), the germline displayed masculinization with continuous spermatogenesis (Figures 3G–3N and S3G–S3J; Table S3), indicating myristoylation in the germline drives oocyte fate as acs-4 does. Additional tests confirmed that NMT-1 has N-myristoyltransferase activity and that myristoylation is essential for worm development (Figures S3D and S3K). To further observe the role of myristoylation in nutrient-dependent germ cell fate determination, we tested the impact of perturbing FA metabolism on myristoylation in the tra-2(e2020) males where the germ cell fate is highly sensitive to nutrient changes (Figures 1 and S1A). Compared to well-fed animals, myristoylation of PPM-2 in the germline, as well as overall myristoylation, was increased in the oocyte-producing tra-2(e2020) males recovered from starvation (Figure 4A), which had increased FA level (Figure 1H). This increase of PPM-2 myristoylation was suppressed by fasn-1(RNAi) or lipl-5(RNAi) (Figure 4A), both of which reduce free FA and suppress oocyte fate under the same condition (Figures 1B and 1E). Therefore, protein myristoylation in the germline responds to changes in cellular FA levels that impact germ cell fate. We then tested if protein myristoylation also responds to FA level change in wild-type worms. We observed that reducing free FAs by knocking down fasn-1 or lipl-5 caused a decrease in germline PPM-2 myristoylation as well as overall myristoylation (Figure 4B). When worms were supplemented with exogenous C14:0 free FA or a mix of 37 different FAs including C14:0, a significant increase in germline PPM-2 myristoylation was observed, but this increase was not seen in the worms supplemented with C16:0 free FA (Figure 4C). This increase in protein myristoylation was concentration-dependent (Figure 4D). In addition, a decreased sperm number was observed in the wild-type worms supplemented with a high level of the 37 FAs mix (Figure S4A), which corresponds to the highest level of PPM-2 myristoylation (Figures 4C and 4D). In these wild-type worms with less sperm, the germline size was not affected, and early oogenesis was observed (Figure S4B), suggesting that an earlier spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch was responsible for the reduced sperm number observed with the 37 FA supplementation. Consistent with the observation made in the tra-2(e2020) mutant males, these results support that protein myristoylation plays a critical role in mediating the impact of FA levels on germ cell fate specification. Since germ cell fate is specified by the germline sex-determination pathway (Ellis and Schedl, 2007Ellis, R., and Schedl, T. (2007). Sex determination in the germ line. WormBook. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.82.1, 1–13. WormBook.Google Scholar) (Figure 5A), acs-4 may regulate germ cell fate choice by altering the activity of this pathway. In the germline sex-determination pathway, tra-2 and tra-1 promote oocyte fate through repressing fem-1/2/3 and fog-1/3, respectively, each encoding a conserved protein (Figure 5A). We found that single lf mutations of any of fem-1/2/3 or fog-1/2/3 genes, or a gf allele of tra-2 could recover oocytes in 100% of the acs-4(lf) homozygous hermaphrodites (Figures 5B and S5A–S5H ). The recovered oocytes resulted in viable progeny when the hermaphrodites were crossed with wild-type males, further supporting that acs-4(lf) alters germ cell fate specification instead of structurally damaging the germ cells. These epistasis data suggest that acs-4 may act upstream or in parallel to the gene being tested.Figure S5Epistasis Analyses Indicate ACS-4-Dependent Myristoylation Likely Functions Upstream of fem-3 in the Germline Sex-Determination Pathway, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A–H) DIC images of the germline of adult animals with indicated genotypes. acs-4(lf);fem-3(lf) mutants were grown at 25°C to score the presence of oocytes.

Quantitative data are presented in Figure 5B.(I) qPCR analysis indicating that the fog-3 mRNA level is significantly increased in nmt-1(RNAi) or map-2(RNAi) treated animals that showed germline masculinization. The RNAi treatments were executed in the rrf-1(lf) background for germline specific knockdown of nmt-1 and map-2.(J–L) DIC images showing the result of a genetic test regarding the functional relationships of acs-4 with fem-3 and tra-2. Oogenesis occurred in transformed XX males of tra-1(e1781, lf), as shown in (K) (95%, n = 77) (Schedl et al., 1989Schedl T. Graham P.L. Barton M.K. Kimble J. Analysis of the role of tra-1 in germline sex determination in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1989; 123: 755-769PubMed Google Scholar). The oocyte production phenotype of tra-1(e1781) is suppressed by acs-4(lf) (L) (99%, n = 91).TRA-2 is a membrane bound receptor, whereas FEM-3 is a subunit of the CUL-2 based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and the relative levels of TRA-2 and FEM-3 have been shown to be critical to the expression of fog-3 and the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch (Ahringer and Kimble, 1991Ahringer J.

Therefore, acs-4 may potentially function to promote the expression of tra-2 or repress the expression of fem-3. Since oogenesis occurring in transformed XX males of tra-1(lf, e1781) can be suppressed by fem-3(gf, q20) but not tra-2(lf) (Schedl et al., 1989Schedl T. Graham P.L. Barton M.K. Kimble J.

Folate contributes to a 1-carbon metabolism, which is essential for purine biosynthesis and methionine recycling and affects methylation of DNA, histones, and nonhistone proteins. Herein, we used animal models and cultured mammalian cells to demonstrate that disruption of the methylation pathway mediated by folate compromises normal neural tube closure (NTC) and ciliogenesis. We demonstrate that the embryos with NTD failed to adequately methylate septin2, a key regulator of cilium structure and function. We report that methylation of septin2 affected its GTP binding activity and formation of the septin2–6-7 complex. We propose that folic acid promotes normal NTC in some embryos by regulating the methylation of septin2, which is critical for normal cilium formation during early embryonic development.—Toriyama, M., Toriyama, M., Wallingford, J.

https://openalex.org/W2606995344,"Animal studies have shown that the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) cyclosporine and tacrolimus can activate the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC). A common side effect of CNIs is hypertension. Renal salt transporters such as NCC are excreted in urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) after internalization into multivesicular bodies. Human studies indicate that CNIs also increase NCC abundance in uEVs, but results are conflicting and no relationship with NCC function has been shown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CsA and Tac on the abundance of both total NCC (tNCC) and phosphorylated NCC at Thr60 phosphorylation site (pNCC) in uEVs, and assessed whether NCC abundance in uEVs predicts the blood pressure response to thiazide diuretics. Our results show that in kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine (n = 9) or tacrolimus (n = 23), the abundance of both tNCC and pNCC in uEVs is 4-5 fold higher than in CNI-free kidney transplant recipients (n = 13) or healthy volunteers (n = 6). In hypertensive kidney transplant recipients, higher abundances of tNCC and pNCC prior to treatment with thiazides predicted the blood pressure response to thiazides. During thiazide treatment, the abundance of pNCC in uEVs increased in responders (n = 10), but markedly decreased in non-responders (n = 8). Thus, our results show that CNIs increase the abundance of both tNCC and pNCC in uEVs, and these increases correlate with the blood pressure response to thiazides. This implies that assessment of NCC in uEVs could represent an alternate method to guide anti-hypertensive therapy in kidney transplant recipients."

Although to date the majority of studies on ARF have focused on its anti-proliferative role, few studies have addressed whether ARF may also have pro-survival functions. Here we show for the first time that during the process of adhesion and spreading ARF re-localizes to sites of active actin polymerization and to focal adhesion points where it interacts with the phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase. In line with its recruitment to focal adhesions, we observe that hampering ARF function in cancer cells leads to gross defects in cytoskeleton organization resulting in apoptosis through a mechanism dependent on the Death-Associated Protein Kinase. Our data uncover a novel function for p14ARF in protecting cells from anoikis that may reflect its role in anchorage independence, a hallmark of malignant tumor cells."

High levels of these biomarkers are found in Japanese people, whose CHD mortality is lowest among developed countries. We analyzed the association of these biomarkers with cardiovascular disease risk in the Japanese to know their health effects within one ethnic population. First, to compare the Japanese intake of I and T with international intakes, the ratios of 24UI and 24UT to creatinine from the WHO Study were divided into quintiles for analysis. The ratio for the Japanese was the highest in the highest quintiles for both I and T, reaching 88.1%, far higher than the average ratio for the Japanese (26.3%) in the total study population. Second, 553 inhabitants of Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, aged 30 to 79 years underwent 24-U collection and blood analyses. The 24UT and 24UI were divided into tertiles and adjusted for age and sex. The highest T tertile, compared with the lowest tertile, showed significantly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, 24U sodium (Na) and potassium (K). The highest I tertile showed significantly higher folate, 24UNa and 24UK compared with the lowest tertile. The highest tertile of both T and I showed significantly higher HDL-C, folate, and 24UNa and 24UK compared with the lowest tertile. Thus, greater consumption of fish and soy were significantly associated with higher HDL-C and folate levels, possibly a contributor to Japan having the lowest CHD mortality and longest life expectancy among developed countries. As these intakes were also associated with a high intake of salt, a low-salt intake of fish and soy should be recommended for healthy life expectancy."

Materials and methods 138 interproximal dental surfaces were divided into six groups: 1) Intact enamel; 2) Intact enamel + demineralization cycles (DC); 3) Interproximal Reduction (IR); 4) IR + DC; 5) IR + Profluorid + DC; 6) IR + Clinpro White + DC. IR was performed with a 0.5 mm cylindrical diamond bur. The weight percentage of calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P) and fluoride (F) were quantified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). Samples were examined under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results The weight percentage of Ca was significantly higher (p<0.05) in Groups 1, 2 and 5 than Groups 4 and 6. No significant differences were detected in the weight percentage of Ca between Group 3 and the other groups (p>0.05). The weight percentage of P was similar among all six groups (p>0.05). F was detected on 65% of Group 6 surfaces. SEM images of Groups 4 and 6 showed signs of demineralization, while Group 5 did not. Conclusions Profluorid application acts as a barrier against the demineralization of interproximally reduced enamel."

However, how the ovules get enclosed in angiosperms remains a mystery, especially for Magnoliaceae. The only key to this mystery is finding a series of carpels transitional from fully closed with enclosed ovules to open with naked ovules. We use routine paraffin section technology, LM, SEM to document the morphology and anatomy of carpel variation in Michelia figo (Magnoliaceae). A series of carpel variations within a single flower of Michelia figo (Magnoliaceae) are documented, in which the ovules are exposed in atypical carpels. These atypical and typical carpels for the first time demonstrate clearly how the naked ovule get enclosed. Each atypical carpel, with naked ovules, clearly comprises two parts, namely, subtending foliar part and branches bearing ovules, suggesting that a typical carpel is actually an end-product of the fusion between the ovuliferous branches and subtending foliar parts. The only difference among these carpels is the extent of fusion between these two parts. This generalization is in full agreement with the molecular genetic studies on angiosperm flowers."

In this study, the origin of an important Dark Red Meranti wood, Shorea platyclados, was studied by using the combination of seven chloroplast DNA and 15 short tandem repeats (STRs) markers. A total of 27 natural populations of S. platyclados were sampled throughout Malaysia to establish population level and individual level identification databases. A haplotype map was generated from chloroplast DNA sequencing for population identification, resulting in 29 multilocus haplotypes, based on 39 informative intraspecific variable sites. Subsequently, a DNA profiling database was developed from 15 STRs allowing for individual identification in Malaysia. Cluster analysis divided the 27 populations into two genetic clusters, corresponding to the region of Eastern and Western Malaysia. The conservativeness tests showed that the Malaysia database is conservative after removal of bias from population subdivision and sampling effects. Independent self-assignment tests correctly assigned individuals to the database in an overall 60.60-94.95% of cases for identified populations, and in 98.99-99.23% of cases for identified regions. Both the chloroplast DNA database and the STRs appear to be useful for tracking timber originating in Malaysia. Hence, this DNA-based method could serve as an effective addition tool to the existing forensic timber identification system for ensuring the sustainably management of this species into the future."

This study was designed to examine whether ""insulin resistance"" is involved in ACS and to clarify other potential intrinsic compensatory mechanisms for GIK tolerance through highly statistical procedure.We compared the degree of insulin resistance during ACS attack and remission phase after treatment in individual patients (n = 104). During ACS, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were significantly increased (P<0.001), while serum potassium levels were transiently decreased (degree of which was indicated by ΔK) (P<0.001). This finding provides a renewed paradox, as ΔK, a surrogate marker of intrinsic GIK cascade activation, probably reflects the validated glucose metabolism during ischemic attack. Indeed, multiple regression analysis revealed that plasma glucose level during ACS was positively correlated with ΔK (P = 0.026), whereas HOMA-IR had no impact on ΔK. This positive correlation between ΔK and glucose was confirmed by covariance structure analysis with a strong impact (β: 0.398, P = 0.015). Intriguingly, a higher incidence of myocardial infarction relative to unstable angina pectoris, as well as a longer hospitalization period were observed in patients with larger ΔK, indicating that ΔK also reflects disease severity of ACS.Insulin resistance most likely increases during ACS; however, ΔK was positively correlated with plasma glucose level, which overwhelmed insulin resistance condition. The present study with covariance structure analysis suggests that there are potential endogenous glucose-coupled potassium lowering mechanisms, other than insulin, regulating glucose metabolism during ACS."

A systematic review was conducted to select a set of 45 genes involved in hypoxia signaling pathways and breast tumor progression. Gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR in a retrospective series of 32 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Data were analyzed in relation to classical clinicopathological criteria and relapse occurrence. Coordinated overexpression of selected genes was observed in high-grade and HER2+ tumors. Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression significantly segregated relapsed patients (p = 0.008, Chi2 test). All genes (except one) were up-regulated and six markers were significantly expressed in tumors from recurrent patients. The expression of this 6-gene set was used to develop a basic algorithm for identifying recurrent patients according to a risk score of relapse. Analysis of Kaplan-Meier relapse-free survival curves allowed the definition of a threshold score of 2 (p = 0.021, Mantel-Haenszel test). The risk of recurrence was increased by 40% in patients with a high score. In addition to classical prognostic factors, we showed that hypoxic markers have potential prognostic value for outcome and late recurrence prediction, leading to improved treatment decision-making for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer. It will be necessary to validate the clinical relevance of this prognostic approach through independent studies including larger prospective patient cohorts."

Immunotoxins derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin are antibody-toxin fusion proteins that inhibit protein synthesis of mammalian cells via ADP-ribosylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor-2. Here we investigate the role of the Bcl-2 family proteins in the response of cancer cells to immunotoxin challenge. Besides the well-known reduction of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, following inhibition of protein synthesis, we show for the first time that immunotoxins also reduce the levels of selected proapoptotic BH-3-only proteins. Among these, only Bim protein levels correlated with the ability of immunotoxins to induce an apoptotic response. To support our findings, we verified that a Bim knockout completely abolished immunotoxin-mediated apoptosis. Further, mice bearing either wild-type or Bid knockout tumors responded to immunotoxin treatment with a decrease in growth kinetics, whereas mice engrafted with Bim knockout tumors showed no reduction in tumor size or prolongation of survival following immunotoxin treatment. From these results, we conclude that Bim expression is a major susceptibility factor for tumor cell death and, as such, constitutes a potential biomarker that could be evaluated before immunotoxin treatment. In support of this hypothesis, clinically, we analyzed patient cells before immunotoxin treatment and report that samples of hairy cell leukemia with high levels of Bim protein responded with a greater decrease in leukemic cell count compared with those samples expressing a low level of Bim."

However, information about its mechanism of action and specific biochemical roles for the two domains has been lacking. Here, using genetic, chemical, and enzymatic analyses of multiple mouse cell lines as well as primary mouse fibroblasts from salivary gland and lung, we demonstrate that MCK-2 binds glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with affinities in the following order: heparin > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate = dermatan sulfate. Both MCK-2 domains bound these GAGs independently, and computational analysis together with site-directed mutagenesis identified five basic residues distributed across the N terminus and the 30s and 50s loops of the chemokine domain that are important GAG binding determinants. Both domains were required for GAG-dependent oligomerization of full-length MCK-2. Thus, MCK-2 is an atypical viral chemokine consisting of a CC chemokine domain and a unique non-chemokine domain, both of which bind GAGs and are critical for GAG-dependent oligomerization of the full-length protein."
https://openalex.org/W2606089791,"Tuberculosis (TB), a global disease mainly infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains leading public health problem worldwide. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCSs) play important roles in the protection against microbial infection. However, the relationship between members of the SOCS family and tuberculosis infection remains unclear. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we investigated the mRNA expression profiles of SOCS subfamilies among active TB, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and healthy individuals. Our results showed that active tuberculosis subjects had higher levels of SOCS-3 mRNA, lower expressions of SOCS-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein-1 (CIS-1) mRNAs, but not SOCS-1 mRNA than healthy and LTBI subjects. In men, LTBI patients had lower SOCS-3 than healthy subjects, and active TB patients had lower levels of SOCS-4, -5, and CIS-1 mRNAs but higher levels of SOCS-3 mRNA than healthy subjects. In women, LTBI patients had lower SOCS-3 mRNA level than healthy subjects, and active TB patients had lower CIS-1 mRNA level than healthy subjects. In non-aged adults (< 65 years old), TB patients had higher SOCS-3 mRNA and lower levels of SOCS-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and CIS-1 mRNAs; whereas, aged TB patients (≥ 65 years old) had lower levels of SOCS-5 and CIS-1 mRNAs. These data suggest that particular SOCS members and their correlative relationships allow discrimination of active TB from healthy and LTBI subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2605422355,"Most bacteria are an uncultured lot. When taken from their environment, the vast majority won’t grow on petri dishes, leaving us in the dark about their identity. Some seem to need ingredients only found in their native surroundings, while others grow in places with physical and chemical conditions that are not easily replicated in the laboratory. Thus, cultivating the complete microbiome has been a long-standing challenge. The recent shift in thinking about bacteria as our commensal partners rather than as agents of disease, as well as their use for sourcing natural compounds and tools for biotechnology, most notably CRISPR/Cas9, has reignited interest in the members of this dark microbiome. Technological advances allow not only the cultivation of new bacterial species, but also analysis of uncultivable ones via genome sequencing of environmental samples, an approach that provides a wealth of information about their properties. For instance, the successful growth of uncultured soil bacteria producing a new class of antibiotics made waves beyond the scientific community a couple of years ago, as it suggested a yet untapped source of molecules that could alleviate the threat of antibiotic resistance (Ling et al., 2015Ling L.L. Schneider T. Peoples A.J. Spoering A.L. Engels I. Conlon B.P. Mueller A. Schäberle T.F. Hughes D.E. Epstein S. et al.Nature. 2015; 517: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Uncultured bacteria again took center stage earlier this year, when mining of archaeal genomes from groundwater and soil uncovered components for new types of CRISPR/Cas9 systems (Burstein et al., 2017Burstein D. Harrington L.B. Strutt S.C. Probst A.J. Anantharaman K. Thomas B.C. Doudna J.A. Banfield J.F. Nature. 2017; 542: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Beyond soil, marine environments beckon with an array of exotic bioactive compounds generated by microbes. Life in unlikely places, such as the inside of sea sponges, prompts these symbiotic bacteria to produce abundant secondary metabolites (Lackner et al., 2017Lackner G. Peters E.E. Helfrich E.J.N. Piel J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E347-E356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), some of which have been already tapped for development of drugs targeting diseases from cancer to diabetes. These compounds can be exceptionally complex (Sardar and Schmidt, 2016Sardar D. Schmidt E.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2016; 31: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and deciphering their biosynthetic pathways brings a reward of its own, as shown by the recent characterization of enzymes involved in post-translational modifications of a potent bacterial toxin (Freeman et al., 2012Freeman M.F. Gurgui C. Helf M.J. Morinaka B.I. Uria A.R. Oldham N.J. Sahl H.G. Matsunaga S. Piel J. Science. 2012; 338: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Freeman et al., 2017Freeman M.F. Helf M.J. Bhushan A. Morinaka B.I. Piel J. Nat. Chem. 2017; 9: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Its diverse chemical modifications are achieved by a set of only seven enzymes, whose capabilities to rearrange protein structures provides inspiration for new engineering tools. Exploration of uncultured bacteria also fueled fundamental biological discoveries. Most recently, analysis of dozens of cyanobacteria genomes informed one of the major events in life history, the oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere (Soo et al., 2017Soo R.M. Hemp J. Parks D.H. Fischer W.W. Hugenholtz P. Science. 2017; 355: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Long thought to be dependent on the evolution and thriving of photosynthetic bacteria, the timing and sequence of the events leading to this extraordinary process have been uncertain. Mapping the phylogenetic relationships among cyanobacteria to the presence of photosynthesis machinery genes in their genomes showed that they acquired the ability to photosynthesize relatively late in their evolution, and that horizontal gene transfer may have played a role in distributing the metabolic capabilities among the cyanobacterial families. These early peeks into the dark microbiome indicate a fertile ground for drug and tool prospecting and open new routes for exploring the natural world. As new analytic approaches arise, the field seems to be poised for new exciting discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W2606636012,"To estimate gene regulatory networks, it is important that we know the number of connections, or sparseness of the networks. It can be expected that the robustness to perturbations is one of the factors determining the sparseness. We reconstruct a semi-quantitative model of gene networks from gene expression data in embryonic development and detect the optimal sparseness against perturbations. The dense networks are robust to connection-removal perturbation, whereas the sparse networks are robust to misexpression perturbation. We show that there is an optimal sparseness that serves as a trade-off between these perturbations, in agreement with the optimal result of validation for testing data. These results suggest that the robustness to the two types of perturbations determines the sparseness of gene networks."
