Under physiological conditions, saturated fatty acyl residues of such proteins partition into the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet with high affinity for rafts that are enriched in saturated fatty acyl-containing lipids. However, the biochemical alteration causing displacement of acylated proteins from rafts in PUFA-treated T cells is still under debate but could principally be attributed to altered protein acylation or changes in raft lipid composition. We show that treatment of Jurkat T cells with polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 (n-3)) results in marked enrichment of PUFAs (20:5; 22:5) in lipids from isolated rafts. Moreover, PUFAs were significantly incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine that predominantly resides in the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet. Notably, palmitate-labeled Src family kinase Lck and the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) were both displaced from lipid rafts indicating that acylation by PUFAs is not required for protein displacement from rafts in PUFA-treated T cells. In conclusion, these data provide strong evidence that displacement of acylated proteins from rafts in PUFA-treated T cells is predominantly due to altered raft lipid composition.

Lipid microdomains are characterized by a high concentration of cholesterol and sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and glycolipids, and their polar lipids contain predominantly saturated fatty acyl residues (13Brown D.A.

Such lipids spontaneously aggregate to form liquid-ordered membrane regions that are insoluble in non-ionic detergents facilitating raft isolation as detergent-resistant membrane domains (15Schroeder R.

Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are typical constituents of rafts, but both are attached exclusively in the outer (exoplasmic) leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer (16Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). The lipid composition of the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet of rafts is less well defined. It appears to be also enriched in saturated fatty acyl chains (18Fridriksson E.K. Shipkova P.A. Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. McLafferty F.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8056-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) but lacks stabilizing sphingolipids.A variety of proteins are targeted into membrane rafts, mostly by means of covalent lipid modifications. Many proteins are associated with the extracellular side of plasma membrane rafts by means of a GPI anchor that partitions in the exoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer. In contrast, transmembrane and intracellular proteins are targeted to membrane domains by acylation with fatty acyl moieties (19Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Myristoylation of the N-terminal amino group by amide bondage occurs co-translationally and is irreversible. However, for attachment to the plasma membrane (20Kwong J. Lublin D.M. Biochem. Biophys.

ProteinS-acylation is reversible and may be used to regulate the subcellular localization of proteins (19Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

The high packing order of saturated myristoyl and palmitoyl moieties facilitates interactions with membrane subdomains in a liquid-ordered state (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), and this preferential distribution underlies the enrichment of acylated proteins in lipid rafts under physiological conditions (19Melkonian K.A.

Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Shenoy Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J.

Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The localization of these proteins in rafts is important for their function emphasizing the role of lipid rafts in T cell signaling (11Hořejšı́ V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). Treatment of T cells with PUFAs selectively displaces signaling proteins such as Src family kinases Lck and Fyn from lipid rafts, which under physiological conditions are attached to the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet by means of acyl moieties (8Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPI-anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids that are both attached to the exoplasmic membrane leaflet remain unaffected. This modification of rafts by PUFAs is strongly related to their ability to block protein tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium response in T cells and was therefore proposed to underlie the inhibitory effect of PUFAs on cell signaling (8Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).The biochemical alterations underlying the selective displacement of acylated proteins from rafts by PUFA treatment are still under debate but could principally be attributed to altered protein acylation or changes in the raft lipid environment. We show that treatment of Jurkat T cells with polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 (n-3)) considerably increases raft lipid unsaturation by enrichment of PUFAs in raft lipids including lipids preferentially residing in the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet, thereby making the formation of liquid-ordered domains unlikely (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Furthermore, acylated proteins were displaced from lipid rafts in PUFA-treated T cells despite acylation with palmitate or its metabolite. In conclusion, these data provide strong evidence that displacement of acylated proteins from rafts by PUFA treatment is mainly due to changes in lipid composition of membrane rafts rather than altered protein acylation.DISCUSSIONPUFAs inhibit T cell signaling most probably by displacing proteins that are palmitoylated under physiological conditions from lipid rafts. This displacement may principally be due to altered protein acylation and/or altered raft lipid environment. By analyzing raft lipid fatty acyl composition and membrane subdomain distribution of palmitoylated proteins, we provide ample evidence that altered raft lipid composition underlies the displacement of proteins from lipid rafts in PUFA-treated T cells.PUFAs were highly enriched not only in bulk membranes but also in rafts following PUFA treatment of T cells. Inclusion of unsaturated fatty acids in model membranes greatly reduces raft formation (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) resulting in detergent solubility of incorporated proteins (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 44Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y.Z. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, raft lipids also contain some PUFAs under physiological conditions (18Fridriksson E.K. Shipkova P.A. Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. McLafferty F.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8056-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and distinct PUFAs, e.g. arachidonic acid, were even enriched in rafts compared with bulk membranes (Table I). Changes in lipid composition induced by treatment with polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid were markedly mitigated in rafts compared with bulk membranes, indicating that cells aim at maintaining raft structures by providing a saturated fatty acyl environment through yet unresolved compensatory mechanisms. Such partial compensation was particularly evident in the significantly minor incorporation of PUFAs and the concomitant increased content of saturated palmitic (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) resulting in a markedly lower unsaturation index in rafts compared with the bulk membranes of PUFA-treated T cells (TableI). Nevertheless, incorporation of PUFAs resulted in a considerable 42% increase in unsaturation in raft acyl chains of membranes from PUFA-treated compared with control-treated T cells.Acyl moieties of proteins partition in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane lipid bilayer. Lipid alterations in the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet of membrane rafts would hence be particularly effective in displacing palmitoylated proteins. In addition, changes in fatty acyl composition of exoplasmic leaflet lipids (sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine) could contribute to the displacement of palmitoylated proteins from membrane rafts by interdigitation of acyl chains with cytoplasmic leaflet lipids or protein acyl moieties (16Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Notably, the cytoplasmic leaflet of rafts incorporated significant amounts of PUFAs as shown by altered fatty acyl composition of raft phosphatidylethanolamine which predominantly resides in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane bilayer (41Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) (Table II). Interaction of phospholipid acyl chains with cholesterol is required to maintain organization of membrane rafts in a liquid-ordered phase particularly in the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet that lacks sphingolipids (16Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Raft cholesterol content was unaltered by PUFA treatment of T cells (TableI). However, the increase in lipid order induced by cholesterol highly depends on acyl chain unsaturation of phospholipid species in the absence of sphingolipids (45Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The cholesterol-induced lipid order is particularly decreased in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine when substituted at its sn-2 position with PUFA compared with oleic acid (18:1) (45Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in acyl chain composition of these typical lipids of the cytoplasmic leaflet as they occur in PUFA-treated T cells (Table II) appear detrimental for the lipid order in the cytoplasmic leaflet of membrane rafts, which is not stabilized by sphingolipids. In contrast, the exoplasmic lipid leaflet of rafts seems much less prone to be affected by fatty acyl unsaturation due to the presence of sphingolipids which greatly promotes the formation of a liquid-ordered state by interaction with cholesterol (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 44Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y.Z. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the considerable changes in fatty acyl composition of raft lipids, particularly of those residing in the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet, provide a biochemical basis that could underlie the selective displacement of palmitoylated proteins from membrane rafts in PUFA-treated T cells.Src family kinases Lck and Fyn as well as the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT are concentrated in rafts due to S-acylation with saturated fatty acids, particularly palmitate. Accordingly, Src family kinases and LAT are displaced from lipid rafts by mutation of palmitoylation sites (27Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Shenoy Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J.

Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) or inhibition of protein palmitoylation by drugs (47Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Protein S-acylation prefers but is not restricted to palmitoyl moieties (22Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 23Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Therefore, other saturated and even unsaturated fatty acyl moieties may be linked to cysteine residues of proteins (24Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 48Hallak H. Muszbek L. Laposata M. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4713-4716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Laposata M. Muszbek L. Lipids. 1996; 31: 217-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins acylated with PUFAs have been shown in vitro not to target proteins to rafts despite efficient membrane anchoring (25Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Thus, PUFA treatment of T cells could lead to substitution of protein palmitoyl residues by polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties as suggested (50Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To discriminate whether proteins are displaced from lipid rafts of PUFA-treated T cells by altered lipid environment or changes in protein acylation, we analyzed membrane subdomain distribution of palmitoylated Lck and LAT. Mammalian cells cannot synthesize PUFAs from palmitic acid. Therefore, if proteins are only displaced from lipid rafts when acylated with PUFAs then labeled proteins should not be found in soluble membrane fractions. In contrast, if protein displacement from rafts is due to altered raft lipid environment, palmitate-labeled proteins would be found in raft as well as soluble membrane fractions. The fact that palmitate-labeled Lck and LAT were recovered from soluble membrane fractions of PUFA-treated T cells to a similar extent as Lck and LAT protein (Fig. 2) reveals that direct protein acylation with PUFAs is not necessary for PUFA-mediated protein displacement from rafts. Moreover, these data strongly argue that alterations in the raft lipid environment are primarily responsible for displacement of acylated proteins from rafts following PUFA treatment. The reason for the minor importance of protein acylation with PUFAs may lie in its rather low efficiency compared with protein acylation with palmitate (50Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 51Bizzozero O.A. McGarry J.F. Lees M.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31362-31368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whose concentration was even increased in bulk membranes of eicosapentaenoic acid-treated compared with control-treated T cells (Table I). Thus, although protein acylation by PUFAs is possible, it is unlikely that acylation with PUFAs is a major cause for protein displacement from lipid rafts in PUFAs-treated T cells.In conclusion, our data on raft lipid fatty acyl composition and membrane subdomain distribution of palmitoylated proteins provide compelling evidence that incorporation of PUFAs in raft lipids is the leading alteration causing displacement of acylated proteins from membrane rafts in PUFA-treated T cells. Since raft localization of a variety of proteins is essential for their function in T cell signal transduction, alterations of raft lipid fatty acyl composition appear to mediate the inhibitory effect of PUFAs on T cell activation and possibly even their immunomodulatory effect. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),1 particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 (n-3)) and other members of then-3 series that are abundant in marine fish oils, modulate the immune response and are therefore applied clinically as adjuvant immunosuppressant in the treatment of inflammatory disorders (1Belluzzi A.

Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are typical constituents of rafts, but both are attached exclusively in the outer (exoplasmic) leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer (16Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). The lipid composition of the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet of rafts is less well defined. It appears to be also enriched in saturated fatty acyl chains (18Fridriksson E.K. Shipkova P.A. Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. McLafferty F.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8056-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) but lacks stabilizing sphingolipids. A variety of proteins are targeted into membrane rafts, mostly by means of covalent lipid modifications. Many proteins are associated with the extracellular side of plasma membrane rafts by means of a GPI anchor that partitions in the exoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer. In contrast, transmembrane and intracellular proteins are targeted to membrane domains by acylation with fatty acyl moieties (19Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Myristoylation of the N-terminal amino group by amide bondage occurs co-translationally and is irreversible. However, for attachment to the plasma membrane (20Kwong J. Lublin D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and localization in membrane lipid domains, proteins require at least a second fatty acyl substitution on cysteines usually with palmitoyl residues (22Casey P.J.

ProteinS-acylation is reversible and may be used to regulate the subcellular localization of proteins (19Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

The high packing order of saturated myristoyl and palmitoyl moieties facilitates interactions with membrane subdomains in a liquid-ordered state (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), and this preferential distribution underlies the enrichment of acylated proteins in lipid rafts under physiological conditions (19Melkonian K.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins involved in T cell signaling such as intracellular Src family protein-tyrosine kinases and transmembrane linker for activation of T cells (LAT) are highly concentrated in rafts due to post-translational palmitoylation (27Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Shenoy Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J.

Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The localization of these proteins in rafts is important for their function emphasizing the role of lipid rafts in T cell signaling (11Hořejšı́ V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). Treatment of T cells with PUFAs selectively displaces signaling proteins such as Src family kinases Lck and Fyn from lipid rafts, which under physiological conditions are attached to the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet by means of acyl moieties (8Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPI-anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids that are both attached to the exoplasmic membrane leaflet remain unaffected. This modification of rafts by PUFAs is strongly related to their ability to block protein tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium response in T cells and was therefore proposed to underlie the inhibitory effect of PUFAs on cell signaling (8Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The biochemical alterations underlying the selective displacement of acylated proteins from rafts by PUFA treatment are still under debate but could principally be attributed to altered protein acylation or changes in the raft lipid environment. We show that treatment of Jurkat T cells with polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 (n-3)) considerably increases raft lipid unsaturation by enrichment of PUFAs in raft lipids including lipids preferentially residing in the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet, thereby making the formation of liquid-ordered domains unlikely (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Furthermore, acylated proteins were displaced from lipid rafts in PUFA-treated T cells despite acylation with palmitate or its metabolite. In conclusion, these data provide strong evidence that displacement of acylated proteins from rafts by PUFA treatment is mainly due to changes in lipid composition of membrane rafts rather than altered protein acylation. DISCUSSIONPUFAs inhibit T cell signaling most probably by displacing proteins that are palmitoylated under physiological conditions from lipid rafts. This displacement may principally be due to altered protein acylation and/or altered raft lipid environment. By analyzing raft lipid fatty acyl composition and membrane subdomain distribution of palmitoylated proteins, we provide ample evidence that altered raft lipid composition underlies the displacement of proteins from lipid rafts in PUFA-treated T cells.PUFAs were highly enriched not only in bulk membranes but also in rafts following PUFA treatment of T cells. Inclusion of unsaturated fatty acids in model membranes greatly reduces raft formation (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) resulting in detergent solubility of incorporated proteins (15Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 44Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y.Z. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, raft lipids also contain some PUFAs under physiological conditions (18Fridriksson E.K. Shipkova P.A. Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. McLafferty F.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8056-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and distinct PUFAs, e.g. arachidonic acid, were even enriched in rafts compared with bulk membranes (Table I). Changes in lipid composition induced by treatment with polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid were markedly mitigated in rafts compared with bulk membranes, indicating that cells aim at maintaining raft structures by providing a saturated fatty acyl environment through yet unresolved compensatory mechanisms. Such partial compensation was particularly evident in the significantly minor incorporation of PUFAs and the concomitant increased content of saturated palmitic (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) resulting in a markedly lower unsaturation index in rafts compared with the bulk membranes of PUFA-treated T cells (TableI). Nevertheless, incorporation of PUFAs resulted in a considerable 42% increase in unsaturation in raft acyl chains of membranes from PUFA-treated compared with control-treated T cells.Acyl moieties of proteins partition in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane lipid bilayer. Lipid alterations in the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet of membrane rafts would hence be particularly effective in displacing palmitoylated proteins. In addition, changes in fatty acyl composition of exoplasmic leaflet lipids (sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine) could contribute to the displacement of palmitoylated proteins from membrane rafts by interdigitation of acyl chains with cytoplasmic leaflet lipids or protein acyl moieties (16Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Notably, the cytoplasmic leaflet of rafts incorporated significant amounts of PUFAs as shown by altered fatty acyl composition of raft phosphatidylethanolamine which predominantly resides in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane bilayer (41Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) (Table II). Interaction of phospholipid acyl chains with cholesterol is required to maintain organization of membrane rafts in a liquid-ordered phase particularly in the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet that lacks sphingolipids (16Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Raft cholesterol content was unaltered by PUFA treatment of T cells (TableI). However, the increase in lipid order induced by cholesterol highly depends on acyl chain unsaturation of phospholipid species in the absence of sphingolipids (45Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The cholesterol-induced lipid order is particularly decreased in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine when substituted at its sn-2 position with PUFA compared with oleic acid (18:1) (45Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in acyl chain composition of these typical lipids of the cytoplasmic leaflet as they occur in PUFA-treated T cells (Table II) appear detrimental for the lipid order in the cytoplasmic leaflet of membrane rafts, which is not stabilized by sphingolipids. In contrast, the exoplasmic lipid leaflet of rafts seems much less prone to be affected by fatty acyl unsaturation due to the presence of sphingolipids which greatly promotes the formation of a liquid-ordered state by interaction with cholesterol (26Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 44Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y.Z. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

In conclusion, the considerable changes in fatty acyl composition of raft lipids, particularly of those residing in the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet, provide a biochemical basis that could underlie the selective displacement of palmitoylated proteins from membrane rafts in PUFA-treated T cells.Src family kinases Lck and Fyn as well as the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT are concentrated in rafts due to S-acylation with saturated fatty acids, particularly palmitate. Accordingly, Src family kinases and LAT are displaced from lipid rafts by mutation of palmitoylation sites (27Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Shenoy Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J.

Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Protein S-acylation prefers but is not restricted to palmitoyl moieties (22Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 23Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Therefore, other saturated and even unsaturated fatty acyl moieties may be linked to cysteine residues of proteins (24Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 48Hallak H. Muszbek L. Laposata M. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Proteins acylated with PUFAs have been shown in vitro not to target proteins to rafts despite efficient membrane anchoring (25Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Thus, PUFA treatment of T cells could lead to substitution of protein palmitoyl residues by polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties as suggested (50Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To discriminate whether proteins are displaced from lipid rafts of PUFA-treated T cells by altered lipid environment or changes in protein acylation, we analyzed membrane subdomain distribution of palmitoylated Lck and LAT. Mammalian cells cannot synthesize PUFAs from palmitic acid. Therefore, if proteins are only displaced from lipid rafts when acylated with PUFAs then labeled proteins should not be found in soluble membrane fractions. In contrast, if protein displacement from rafts is due to altered raft lipid environment, palmitate-labeled proteins would be found in raft as well as soluble membrane fractions. The fact that palmitate-labeled Lck and LAT were recovered from soluble membrane fractions of PUFA-treated T cells to a similar extent as Lck and LAT protein (Fig. 2) reveals that direct protein acylation with PUFAs is not necessary for PUFA-mediated protein displacement from rafts. Moreover, these data strongly argue that alterations in the raft lipid environment are primarily responsible for displacement of acylated proteins from rafts following PUFA treatment. The reason for the minor importance of protein acylation with PUFAs may lie in its rather low efficiency compared with protein acylation with palmitate (50Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Thus, although protein acylation by PUFAs is possible, it is unlikely that acylation with PUFAs is a major cause for protein displacement from lipid rafts in PUFAs-treated T cells.In conclusion, our data on raft lipid fatty acyl composition and membrane subdomain distribution of palmitoylated proteins provide compelling evidence that incorporation of PUFAs in raft lipids is the leading alteration causing displacement of acylated proteins from membrane rafts in PUFA-treated T cells.

Secondary production by these zooplankton supports most food webs of the open sea, directly affecting pelagic fish populations and the biological pump of carbon into the deep ocean. Models of marine ecosystems are quite sensitive to the formulation of the term for zooplankton mortality1,2,3,4, although there are few data available to constrain mortality rates in such models. Here we present the first evidence for nonlinear, density-dependent mortality rates of open-ocean zooplankton. A high-frequency time series reveals that per capita mortality rates of eggs of Calanus finmarchicus Gunnerus are a function of the abundance of adult females and juveniles. The temporal dynamics of zooplankton populations can be influenced as much by time-dependent mortality rates as by variations in ‘bottom up’ forcing. The functional form and rates chosen for zooplankton mortality in ecosystem models can alter the balance of pelagic ecosystems1,2,3, modify elemental fluxes into the ocean's interior5, and modulate interannual variability in pelagic ecosystems6."

This posttranslational modification converts ACPs and PCPs from their inactive apo into the active holo form. We have investigated the 4′-phosphopantetheinylation reaction inBacillus subtilis, an organism containing in total 43 ACPs and PCPs but only two PPTases, the acyl carrier protein synthase AcpS of primary metabolism and Sfp, a PPTase of secondary metabolism associated with the nonribosomal peptide synthetase for the peptide antibiotic surfactin. We identified and cloned ydcBencoding AcpS from B. subtilis, which complemented anEscherichia coli acps disruption mutant. B. subtilis AcpS and its substrate ACP were biochemically characterized. AcpS also modified the d-alanyl carrier protein but failed to recognize PCP and an acyl carrier protein of secondary metabolism discovered in this study, designated AcpK, that was not identified by the Bacillus genome project. On the other hand, Sfp was able to modify in vitro all acyl carrier proteins tested. We thereby extend the reported broad specificity of this enzyme to the homologous ACP. This in vitro cross-interaction between primary and secondary metabolism was confirmed under physiological in vivo conditions by the construction of a ydcB deletion in a B. subtilis sfp+ strain. The genes coding for Sfp and its homolog Gsp from Bacillus brevis could also complement the E. coli acps disruption. These results call into question the essential role of AcpS in strains that contain a Sfp-like PPTase and consequently the suitability of AcpS as a microbial target in such strains. 4′-Phosphopantetheine transferases (PPTases) transfer the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety of coenzyme A onto a conserved serine residue of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid and polyketide synthases as well as peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases.

These include acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid synthases (FASs), ACPs of polyketide synthases (PKSs), and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs) and aryl carrier proteins of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) (1Lambalot R.H.

The free thiol moiety of Ppant serves to covalently bind the acyl reaction intermediates as thioesters during the multistep assembly of the monomeric precursors, typically acetyl, malonyl, and aminoacyl groups. Ppant fulfills two demands in these biosynthetic pathways. First, the intermediates remain covalently tethered to the multifunctional enzyme templates in an energy-rich linkage. Second, the flexibility and length of Ppant (about 20 Å) facilitates the transport of the intermediates to the spatially distinct reaction centers. The Ppant moiety is derived from coenzyme A (CoA) and posttranslationally transferred onto an invariant serine side chain. This Mg2+-dependent conversion of the apoproteins to the holoproteins is catalyzed by the 4′-phosphopantetheine transferases (PPTases) (1Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M.

Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Most organisms that employ more than one Ppant-dependent pathway also contain more than one PPTase. For example,Escherichia coli has three PPTases, namely the acyl carrier protein synthase AcpS involved in fatty acid synthesis, EntD involved in synthesis of the siderophore enterobactin, and the gene product ofyhhU, with as yet unknown physiological function (1Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 3Flugel R.S. Hwangbo Y.

Interestingly, PPTases of different pathways can have overlapping selectivity for their cognate acyl carrier protein partner. In E. coli, AcpS and EntD have reciprocal specificities, with AcpS only recognizing ACP and EntD only accepting the PCPs of the enterobactin NRPS (1Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sfp, the PPTase of the surfactin NRPS ofBacillus subtilis, was shown to also phosphopantetheinylate heterologous ACPs of FASs and PKSs (1Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). PPTases have been classified in three groups according to their sequence homologies and substrate spectrum. The first group is the AcpS type with AcpS of Escherichia coli as the name-giving prototype. PPTases of this type are about 120 aa in length, are found in almost all microorganisms for the modification of fatty acid ACP, and were shown to accept as substrate also ACPs of type II PKS systems (6Gehring A.M. Lambalot R.H. Vogel K.W. Drueckhammer D.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The PPTase Sfp of B. subtilis is the prototype of the second group. Enzymes of this type are about 240 aa in length and have mostly been found associated with the gene clusters for nonribosomal peptide synthesis. The well characterized Sfp exhibits an extraordinarily broad substrate specificity and could modify all acyl carrier protein substrates tested, including PCPs of NRPS as well as ACPs of FAS and PKS. The third group is an integrated PPTase found as the C-terminal domain of the multifunctional FAS2, for example in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This classification has recently been further supported by structural studies. The monomeric Sfp was found to fold in two domains with similar topology (8Reuter K. Mofid M.R. Marahiel M.A. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6823-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In Sfp, CoA is bound at the interface of this pseudohomodimer. Interestingly, both domains exhibit sequence homology to members of the AcpS group, which are only half the size of Sfp. Two highly similar structures of enzymes of the AcpS group have recently been reported, namely AcpS of B. subtilis (9Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10Chirgadze N.Y. Briggs S.L. McAllister K.A. Fischl A.S. Zhao G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5281-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In both structures, AcpS forms a trimer. As was already suggested from the Sfp structure, each AcpS monomer has the same folding as the two Sfp subdomains. However, since three AcpS subunits are present in this structure, three CoA binding sites are generated at the subunit interfaces. In this work, we set out to characterize the 4′-phosphopantetheinylation reactions in B. subtilis. This organism is of special interest in this respect, because it contains a large number of Ppant-dependent pathways of primary and secondary metabolism but only two PPTases, AcpS and Sfp (see Fig.2). We report on the biochemical characterization of AcpS and the identification of a second acyl carrier protein in B. subtilis, designated AcpK, and define the specificity of the two PPTases for the different acyl carrier proteins. As suggested from the in vitro data, we found that AcpS of B. subtilis is not essential in strains that aresfp+. From these results and from genetic complementation studies in E. coli, we present a refined model for the substrate spectrum of PPTases of the AcpS and Sfp type and consequences for their suitability as microbial targets. E. coli was grown on LB medium. B. subtilis was usually grown and maintained on Difco sporulation medium (11Nakano M.M. Marahiel M.A. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, for preparations of chromosomal DNA, it was also grown on LB medium. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for E. coli: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 60 μg/ml (25 μg/ml for M15/pREP4 strains). For B. subtilis, the following concentrations were used: chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml; MLS, erythromycin (1 μg/ml) plus lincomycin (25 μg/ml). For E. coli techniques, such as transformation, plasmid preparation, and P1 phage transduction, standard protocols were used (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) was used to amplify gene fragments for cloning and expression purposes, and the Expand Long Range PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for control PCRs and for the amplification of fragments used for transformations. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. [3H]CoA was purchased from Hartmann Analytics (Braunschweig, Germany). For manipulations in the chromosome of E. coli, we used the polA strain HSK42, which is unable to replicate ColE1-based plasmids. When transformed with such a plasmid, integration into the chromosome must occur under selective conditions. Double crossover transformants were identified by testing for sensitivity against ampicillin and were confirmed by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA (for the nrdD locus, oligonucleotides E1 (5′-GATTATTGCGCCACTGTTGC-3′) and E2 (5′-TCATTTTCCCACACGCCGAG-3′), annealing at the nrdD gene, were used). B. subtilis strains were transformed according to the protocol of Klein et al. (14Klein C. Kaletta C. Schnell N. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 132-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PCR analysis of new genotypes, chromosomal DNA was prepared. All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table I. Construction of the integration plasmid pUC18-nrdD::acps-spc for E. coli was as follows. The vector pET22b-acps (15Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24658-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was linearized with HindIII and ligated with the spectinomycin resistance cassette (spc+) excised from pDG1726 (16Guérout-Fleury A. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) withHindIII. The obtained plasmid pET22b-acps-spc was cut withBglII and SphI, and the excised fragment was cloned into BamHI- and SphI-treated pTZ18R. The resulting plasmid pTZ18R-acps-spc served as a template in a PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-ATAGTTAACGCGCGTTGGCCGATTC-3′ and 5′- ATAGTTAACGCCTCTTCGCTATTACGC-3′ to amplify a fragment that contained acps under control of thelac promotor of pTZ18R and spc+. This fragment was cloned blunt-ended into pUC18-nrdD, which was treated withEcoRV, to give pUC18-nrdD::acps-spc.Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmid nameRelevant characteristicsOrigin or referencepTZ18R, pTZ19RColE1 ori;bla+; E. coli cloning vectorsAccession numbers L08956 and L08957pTrc99aColE1 ori; bla+; E. coli cloning and expression vectorAccession number U13872pDR67ColE1 ori;bla+, amyE∷cat+;B. subtilis integration vectorRef. 38Ireton K.

This fragment was cloned into pTrc99a using theNcoI and XbaI sites introduced with the oligonucleotides. The resulting plasmid pTrc99a-5′-acps-3′ was then linearized at the single SacI site, which is localized at position 251 of the 381-bp acps gene. The kanamycin resistance cassette (kan+) was excised from vector pDG782 (16Guérout-Fleury A. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and BglII and cloned into pTZ18R to give pTZ18R-kan. The kan+cassette was then amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides 5′- ATAGAGCTCGACTCACTATAGGGAATTC-3′ and 5-′-ATAGAGCTCTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3′ from pTZ18R-kan, cut with SacI and ligated with the linearized fragment of pTZ18R-5′-acps-3′ to give pTrc99a-5′-acps::kan-3′. ydcB was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilisJH642 using oligonucleotides 5′-ATATAAGCTTCATTTAAATAGTACGTACGC-3′ and 5′- TATAAGATCTCACTATCAAATATATGAGTGG-3′ and cloned blunt-ended into pTZ18R that was linearized with HincII. The right orientation of ydcB under control of thelac promotor of pTZ18R-ydcB was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. The acps gene ofB. subtilis was cut out of pTZ18R-ydcB withHindIII and BglII and cloned between theHindIII and BglII sites of pDR67 to give pDR67-ydcB. pDR67 lacks an origin of replication for B. subtilis but can integrate into the amyE locus of the genome via the amyE front and amyE back fragments upstream and downstream of the multiple cloning site of the plasmid. The cat+ cassette conferring chloramphenicol resistance, which is also located between the two amyEfragments, serves to select for the integration. Inserts cloned into the multiple cloning site are under the control of the weak and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induciblespac promotor, which is leaky in rich media according to our experience. To clone flanking regions ofydcB, a fragment from 992 bp upstream to 994 bp downstream of ydcB was amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis MR168 by PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-ATAGGATCCAGCCTTCATTTTAAAGTGG-3′ (primer 1 in Fig. 6) and 5′-AATTCTGCAGCAATCTGGGCTTTTTCCTG-3′ (primer 2 in Fig. 6) and cloned into the BamHI and PstI sites of pTZ18R. The resulting plasmid pTZ18–5′-ydcB-3′ then served as a template for an inverse PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-ATAGATATCATGTATGATAACCTCC-3′ and 5′-ATAGATATCCTAGTCTGCATATTAGGG-3′ (introducingEcoRV restriction sites) to replace the entireydcB with the spc+ cassette of pDG1726 (16Guérout-Fleury A. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), which was excised with EcoRV andHincII, to give pTZ18R-5′-ΔydcB::spc-3′. TheHindIII-PstI fragment containing thegsp gene was excised from pGsp+ (17Borchert S. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated into pTZ19R to give pTZ19-gsp. The acpA gene encoding ACP was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCCATGGCAGACACATTAGAGCGT-3′ and 5′-TTTTGGATCCTTGCTGGTTTTGTATGTAGTTCAC-3′ from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis MR168 and ligated into theNcoI and BamHI sites of pQE60 to give the expression plasmid pQE60-acpA. The encoded recombinant protein carries the C-terminal tag GSRSHHHHHH. The acpK gene was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-TATCCATGGATAAACAGAGAATCTTTG-3′ and 5′-TATAGATCTGGCAGATTGCACTTTGTC-3′ from chromosomal DNA ofB. subtilis MR168. The amplified fragment was digested withNcoI and BglII and ligated into theNcoI and BamHI sites of pQE60 to create the expression plasmid pQE60-acpK encoding the recombinant AcpK with a C-terminal tag GSGSHHHHHH. The dltC gene encoding the d-alanyl carrier protein (DCP) was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-ATACCATGGATTTTAAACAAGAGG-3′ and 5′-ATAAGATCTTTTCAACTCAGACAGCT-3′ from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis MR168 and ligated into the NcoI and BglII sites of pQE60. The resulting plasmid pQE60-dltC encodes the recombinant DCP with a C-terminal tag RSHHHHHH. E. coli M15/pREP4 was transformed with pTZ18-ydcB to give strain RF3. 5 ml of an overnight culture of RF3 in LB were used to inoculate 500 ml of the same medium. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 300 rpm until an A600 of 0.7 was reached. The culture was then induced with 0.25 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 37 °C and 300 rpm for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g at 4 °C, resuspended in 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.8), and disrupted by three passages through a cooled French pressure cell. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged at 36,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 25% saturation. The resulting protein suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 36,000 × g and 4 °C for 45 min. Subsequently, the pellet was discarded, and ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 40% saturation. The suspension was stirred again at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged as described above. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m(NH4)2SO4 (HIC buffer A, pH 7.8) and centrifuged as described above, and the supernatant was applied to a High-LoadTM 26/10 phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with HIC buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.0 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4 in HIC buffer A; 4-ml fractions were collected. The presence of AcpS in the fractions was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (15% Laemmli gels). Fractions containing AcpS were pooled and concentrated by 40% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation as described above. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4/NaHPO4 (pH 7.0), centrifuged as described above, and applied to a SuperdexTM G75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 50 mmNaH2PO4/NaHPO4 (pH 7.0); 4-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing AcpS were collected, pooled, and applied to a 6-ml ResourceTM 15 S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4/NaHPO4 (CAT buffer A, pH 7.0). The column was washed with CAT buffer A, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in CAT buffer A while collecting 2-ml fractions. The AcpS-containing fractions were collected and applied to a SuperdexTM G75 26/60 gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (assay buffer, pH 8.8). Fractions containing AcpS were collected, analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, adjusted with glycerol to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. E. coli M15/pREP4 was transformed with pQE60-acpA, pQE60-acpK, and pQE60-dltC to give strains RF1, HM403, and RF4, respectively, for the production of the His6 fusion proteins ACP, AcpK, and DCP. Cells were grown, induced, harvested, and disrupted, and the crude cell extract was centrifuged as described above for RF3. Protein purification using Ni2+ affinity chromatography was carried out as previously described (18Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against assay buffer, brought to 10% glycerol (v/v), and stored at −80 °C. TycC3-PCP, hereafter referred to as PCP, and Sfp-His6 were produced and purified as previously described (8Reuter K. Mofid M.R. Marahiel M.A. Ficner R.

Fold Des. 2000; 8: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined based on the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm: AcpS, 6,520m−1 cm−1; ACP-His6, 1,280 m−1 cm−1; DCP-His6, 5,810 m−1cm−1; AcpK-His6, 1,400m−1 cm−1. AcpS and Sfp activity was assayed by using a radioactive assay method essentially as described previously (15Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24658-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This method measures the incorporation of the 3H-labeled 4′-phosphopantetheine group from [3H]CoA into apo-ACP or other acyl carrier proteins. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, a 6–100 μm concentration of the respective acyl carrier protein, 2–20 μm CoA, 119–475 nm[3H]CoA (specific activity: 40 Ci/mmol, 0.95 mCi/ml), 2.2 μm to 5.6 nm AcpS of B. subtilis, or 0.8 μm Sfp were incubated at 37 °C for 5–30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%) and 15 μl of bovine serum albumin (25 mg/ml). Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with 0.8 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 200 μl of formic acid. The resulting suspension was mixed with 3.5 ml of Rotiszint Eco Plus scintillation fluid (Roth) and counted using a 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). For kinetic studies, reaction mixtures contained, unless otherwise indicated, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8 (75 mm MES, pH 6.0, in the case of Sfp), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2–200 μm apo-ACP ofB. subtilis (apo/holo mixture) or 2–60 μmAcpK, 2–1000 μm CoA, and 5.6 nm AcpS ofB. subtilis or 10 nm Sfp and were incubated at 37 °C for 10–30 min. The reaction was stopped, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%). The amount of holo-ACP and AcpK formed was determined by an HPLC method. This method was adapted from a method described previously (15Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24658-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (800 μl each) were, after the addition of trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellet resuspended in 120 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8. A 100-μl sample of this solution was injected onto an analytical Nucleosil 250 C18-column (reversed phase; Macherey & Nagel) that had been equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbance at 220 nm was monitored. The column was eluted with a 1.2-ml linear gradient to 60% solvent B (methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by a 7.2-ml linear gradient to 100% solvent B at 0.3 ml/min. Under these conditions, holo-ACP migrated faster than apo-ACP (24.3 and 25.2 min, respectively). The amount of holo-ACP formed was determined by comparing the peak area of the holo-ACP formed with those of both apo- and holo-ACP and subtracting the amount of holo-ACP that was already present after the heterologous expression of the protein inE. coli (see “Results”). Apo-AcpK and holo-AcpK were separated in a similar manner using the same column and a 15-ml linear gradient to 80% solvent C (isopropyl alcohol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by a 0.6-ml linear gradient to 95% solvent C at 0.3 ml/min. Holo-AcpK and apo-AcpK eluted at retention times of 53.9 and 54.8 min. To determine Km and kcatvalues of AcpS and Sfp for apo-ACP and apo-AcpK, reaction mixtures (in triplicate) contained 1 mm CoA, 2–200 μmapo-ACP, or 2–60 μm apo-AcpK and either 5.6 nm AcpS or 10 nm Sfp. For the determination of the Km value of AcpS for CoA, the reaction conditions were the same as described above except that the concentration of apo-ACP was kept at 200 μm, and concentrations of CoA were 2–500 μm. The formation of holo carrier protein was measured by the HPLC method in all cases. Carrier proteins were dialyzed before the assay against the respective assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, in the case of AcpS and 75 mm MES, pH 6.0, in the case of Sfp). Since acps is an essential gene in E. coli (20Takiff H.E. Baker T. Copeland T. Chen S.-M. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a disruption mutant can only be generated when a complementing gene is present in trans. We therefore decided to first integrate a second copy of acps in another locus of the E. coli chromosome and then disrupt the gene at its natural locus (at 58 min; see Fig. 2A) with akan+ cassette. Theacps::kan+ genotype was then transduced using P1 phage into other E. coli strains carrying in trans a PPTase gene to be tested foracps complementation activity. For manipulations of the chromosome of E. coli, we used a polA mutant strain, HSK 42, that is unable to replicate ColE1-based plasmids and thus allows selection of integration into the chromosome. Double crossover integrations were identified by marker loss and PCR analysis with flanking primers. acps is the second gene in a bicistronic operon with pdxJ (the former name ofacps was dpj, for downstream ofpdxJ) and is followed by a termination loop (15Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24658-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Takiff H.E. Baker T. Copeland T. Chen S.-M. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A disruption ofacps was therefore not expected to exert polar effects on neighboring genes. The nrdD locus at 96 min (see Fig.2A) was chosen for the integration of a second copy of theacps gene into the E. coli chromosome.nrdD encodes the anaerobic deoxyribonucleotide reductase, which is not essential under the conditions used here (21Sun X.

In response to 0.68 and 6.8 μm STI571, proliferation of Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cells showed a 57% and 74% decrease, respectively, whereas glucose label incorporation into RNA decreased by 13.4% and 30.1%, respectively, through direct glucose oxidation, as indicated by the decrease in the m1/Σmnratio in RNA. Based on the in vitro proliferation data, the IC50 of STI571 in K562 cultures is 0.56 μm.

Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Significant defects in cytoskeletal architecture are observed in Bcr-Abl-transfected human fibroblasts that result in the loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions (2Gaston I. Stenberg P.E. Bhat A. Druker B.J. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In a recent clinical study, the new low molecular weight phenylaminopyrimidine class protein kinase inhibitor STI571 (CGP57148) was administered to 61 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)1 patients who demonstrated desirable hematologic and cytogenetic responses with no dose-limiting toxicities (3Buchdunger E. Stiles C. Druker B. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 611Google Scholar). The human myeloid leukemia cell line K562, which was isolated from a patient with CML-related blast crisis, is currently undergoing extensive studies to determine the molecular mechanisms of the role of the Bcr-Abl fusion oncoprotein in the progression of CML. It is evident that K562 cells strongly depend on the N-glycosylation of their universal high affinity glucose transporter, Glut-1, for disease progression because they show decreased proliferation and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA after inhibition of the N-glycosylation of Glut-1 in culture (4Ahmed N. Berridge M.V. Leuk. Res. 1999; 23: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). K562 cells also exhibit a concentrative mechanism consistent with Na+-dependent transport of glucose that shows similarities with Glut-2 low affinity, high capacity glucose transport (5Bading J.R. Mircheff A.K. Kan-Mitchell J. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 6Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that glucose provides the primary source of carbons for de novo nucleic acid, lipid, and amino acid synthesis in tumor cells, recent studies analyzing glucose metabolic pathways using biological mass spectrometry have revealed the mechanism by which transforming growth factor-β2 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein oppositely influence glucose intermediate metabolism and cell proliferation (7Boros L.G. Torday J.S. Lim S. Bassilian S. Cascante M. Lee W.-N.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1183-1185PubMed Google Scholar, 8Boros L.G. Bassilian S. Lim S. Lee W.-N.P. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that STI571 treatment decreases the proliferation and glucose-derived synthesis of RNA and palmitate in K562 leukemia cells. Metabolic enzymes, which control glucose carbon flow through the oxidative reactions of the pentose cycle, such as hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PDH), are primary targets of STI571. Our study reveals the importance of glucose-derived nucleic acid and fatty acid production in K562 cells as potential target pathways for STI571 via inhibition of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. K562 human leukemia cells and MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in minimum essential medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2. K562 leukemia cells were selected for the study because they represent a bone marrow-originated pure CML cell line isolated from a 53-year-old female patient with blast crisis, and they also express the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase protein, the primary target kinase of STI571 (1LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Metabolic changes observed in K562 cells in response to STI571 treatment were compared with the metabolic response of MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (9Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Cascante M. Lee W.N. Brandes J.L. Bassilian S. Yusuf F.I. Williams R.D. Muscarella P. Melvin W.S. Schirmer W.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4242-4248PubMed Google Scholar), which lack the Bcr-Abl fusion construct and also tested negative for functioning platelet-derived growth factor receptors (B type) and basic fibroblast growth factor (10Beauchamp R.D. Lyons R.M. Yang E.Y. Coffey Jr., R.J. Moses H.L. Pancreas. 1990; 5: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor receptors have also been reported as potential target sites of STI571 (11Buchdunger E. O'Reilly T. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 720Google Scholar). MIA cells were selected as negative controls because their metabolism has been studied extensively using the single [1,2-13C2]glucose label and biological mass spectrometry in the presence of various antiproliferative compounds in previous experiments (8Boros L.G. Bassilian S. Lim S. Lee W.-N.P. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Cascante M. Lee W.N. Brandes J.L. Bassilian S. Yusuf F.I. Williams R.D. Muscarella P. Melvin W.S. Schirmer W.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4242-4248PubMed Google Scholar). MIA negative control cells exhibit a comparable glucose consumption rate and bear the same G6PDH izoenzyme and doubling time in culture as K562 cells. To compare glucose utilization rates, ribose synthesis, lactate production, and fatty acid synthesis, K562 and MIA cells were incubated in [1,2-13C2]glucose-containing media (180 mg%, 50% isotope enrichment) in the presence of increasing doses of STI571. Cultures for the study were performed with the same cell number (1 × 107), which was achieved using standard cell counting techniques as described below. STI571 was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) according to a material/chemical transfer agreement. Cell number was determined using a Beckman Coulter (Miami, FL) Z1 Dual 2.2 counter-top particle counter before and after incubations with STI571. The gates were set at 38.02 μm (upper size) and 10 μm (lower size) during counts. Apoptotic and disintegrated cell figures were gated below the 10-μm size limit. One hundred μls of the trypsinized single cell suspension of each culture suspended in 9.9 ml of Isoton II balanced electrolyte solution (Beckman) was counted, and the number of surviving cells was displayed by the onboard computer interface. Trypsin (0.05%) was added to minimize adhesions between single cells during counting in the Isoton II solution. Media glucose and lactate levels were measured using a Cobas Mira chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). For glucose utilization/lactate production studies, we used short incubation period (12 h) cultures with reduced media volume (5 ml) to eliminate differences originating from the antiproliferative response of K562 cells to STI571 treatment. Glucose oxidation was determined by media13C/12C ratios in released CO2 by a Finnegan Delta-S ion ratio mass spectroscope (GC/C/IRMS). Release of13CO2 was measured to estimate glucose carbon utilization through oxidation by the cell lines and expressed as atom percent excess, which is the portion of 13C produced by the cultured cells above background in calibration standard samples (12Kasho V.N. Cheng S. Jensen D.M. Ajie H. Lee W.N. Faller L.D. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). RNA ribose was isolated by acid hydrolysis of cellular RNA after Trizol purification of cell extracts. The mRNA and rRNA of tumor cells were separated using the Qiagen RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to determine differential glucose tracer uptake by the structural species (rRNA) and the continuously synthesized species (mRNA) of cellular RNA. Ribose isolated from rRNA and mRNA was derivatized to its aldonitrile acetate form using hydroxyl amine in pyridine and acetic anhydride. We monitored the ion cluster around them/z 256 (carbons 1–5 of ribose; chemical ionization),m/z 217 (carbons 3–5 of ribose), and m/z 242 (carbons 1–4 of ribose; electron impact ionization) to find molar enrichment and positional distribution of 13C labels in ribose (13Lee W.-N.P. Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Bassilian S. Lim S. Cascante M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E843-E851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable [1,2-13C2]d-glucose isotope was purchased with >99% purity and 99% isotope enrichment for each position (Isotec, Inc., Miamisburg, OH). For isotope incubation and drug treatment studies, K562 and MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were seeded in T-75 tissue culture flasks after adjusting the number of cells to the values reported above. During the study, the cultures were supplied with 50% [1,2-13C2]glucose dissolved in otherwise glucose- and sodium pyruvate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The final glucose concentration was adjusted to 180 mg/100 ml. Glucose mass isotope analysis of the medium before cell incubations showed that the actual labeled glucose enrichment was 56.8% in the culture media, and this number was used for further calculations to accurately determine the maximum labeled glucose incorporation into biomolecules. Fig. 1 demonstrates 13C label incorporation into various metabolites of the glycolytic pathway using [1,2-13C2]glucose as the tracer. In Fig.1A, the [1,2-13C2]glucose label is incorporated as the second and third 13C-labeled carbons of dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; in Fig. 1B,[2,3-13C2]dihydroxyacetone-phosphate is then converted to [2,3-13C2]glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through triosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1), which will produce [2,3-13C2]pyruvate and [2,3-13C2]lactate labeled on the second and third positions. The alternate routes for glucose degradation include direct glucose oxidation and 13C carbon labeling of pentose cycle metabolites (Fig. 1C). Direct oxidation of glucose in the pentose cycle separates 13C label on the first and second carbon positions and produces ribulose 5-phosphate that is labeled only on the first position with 13C. Ribulose 5-phosphate can be incorporated into nucleotides by ribose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.20) (top bent arrow, Fig.1D), or it can be recycled back into the glycolytic pathway by pentose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1), carrying back only a single 13C label on the first carbon of [1-13C]xylulose 5-phosphate (bottom bent arrow, Fig. 1D). The loss of 13C from the first carbon of glucose in cellular RNA allows the measurement of direct glucose oxidation and of the contribution of the oxidative steps of the pentose cycle to nucleic acid ribose synthesis (m1/Σmn). If ribose supplies exceed the need for nucleic acid synthesis, consecutive enzymatic steps in the nonoxidative pentose cycle produce [1-13C]fructose, which is cleaved by aldolase(EC 4.1.2.13) and further metabolized into [3-13C]pyruvate and [3-13C]lactate, as described above. The relative ratio of [3-13C]lactate to [2,3-13C2]lactate (m1/m2) is a reliable index of glucose oxidation through the pentose cycle in mammalian cells (13Lee W.-N.P. Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Bassilian S. Lim S. Cascante M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E843-E851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleic acid ribose is also formed in mammalian cells through the nonoxidative reactions of the pentose cycle (Fig. 1E). When the cell culture medium contains only [1,2-13C2]glucose as the tracer and no isotope dilution is observed, nonoxidative ribose synthesis involves [1,2-13C2]fructose-6-phosphate and natural glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or [2,3-13C2]glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate as primary substrates for ribose synthesis. Ribose formation through the nonoxidative steps of the pentose cycle yields [1,2-13C2]ribose 5-phosphate or [1,2,4,5-13C4]ribose 5-phosphate, depending on the amount of label accumulation from labeled glyceraldehyde throughtriosephosphate isomerase (m2 +m4/Σmn). Because ribose is an obligatory precursor of nucleotide formation in all mammalian cells, the ratios of [1-13C]ribose to [1,2-13C2]ribose and [1,2,4,5-13C4]ribose in nucleic acid hydrolysates can be used to estimate the contribution of the oxidative and nonoxidative steps of the pentose cycle to de novonucleotide ribose synthesis. Lactate from the cell culture media (0.2 ml) was extracted by ethyl acetate after acidification with HCl. Lactate was derivatized to its propylamine-heptafluorobutyric anhydride form usingn-propylamine heptafluorobutyrate, and the m/z328 (carbons 1–3 of lactate; chemical ionization) was monitored for the detection of m1 (recycled lactate through the pentose cycle) and m2 (lactate produced by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) for the estimation of pentose cycle activity (13Lee W.-N.P. Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Bassilian S. Lim S. Cascante M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E843-E851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lee W.-N.P. Edmond J. Bassilian S. Morrow J.W. Dev.

Fatty acids were extracted with saponification of the Trizol cell extract after removal of the RNA-containing supernatant. Cell debris was treated with 30% KOH and 100% ethanol overnight, and the extraction was performed using petroleum ether. Fatty acids were converted to their methylated derivative using 0.5 nmethanolic-HCl (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Palmitate was monitored at m/z 270, and stearate was monitored atm/z 298. The enrichment of acetyl units and the synthesis of the new lipid fraction in MIA and K562 cells in response to STI571 treatment were determined using the mass isotopomer distribution analysis approach of different isotopomers of palmitate, an abundant cell membrane lipid readily recovered by biological mass spectrometry from cell pellets (16Lee W.-N.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 399: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lipid synthesis is also dependent on glucose carbons because they are the primary source of acetyl-CoA (Fig.1F), which is then incorporated into fatty acids throughde novo synthesis (C16, palmitate) or chain elongation (C18, stearate). The process involves pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC1.2.4.1) as the catalyzing enzyme and results in the formation of [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA, which is readily incorporated into palmitate (8Boros L.G. Bassilian S. Lim S. Lee W.-N.P. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mass spectral data were obtained on the HP5973 mass selective detector connected to an HP6890 gas chromatograph. The settings are as follows: gas chromatograph inlet, 230 °C; transfer line, 280 °C; mass spectrometer source, 230 °C; mass spectrometer Quad, 150 °C. An HP-5 capillary column (30 m, length; 250 μm, diameter; 0.25 μm, film thickness; Supelco) was used for glucose, ribose, glutamate, and lactate analysis. A Bpx70 column (25 m, length; 220 μm, diameter; 0.25 μm, film thickness; SGE Inc., Austin, TX) was used for fatty acid analysis with specific temperature programming for each compound studied. These enzymes have been shown to bear high (0.6–0.8) flux control coefficients in glycolysis and the pentose cycle in various mammalian cells (17Schuster S. Dandekar T. Fell A.D. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 53-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 18Sabate L. Franco R. Canela E.I. Centelles J.J. Cascante M. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, changes in their activities in response to increasing doses of STI571 treatment likely influence glucose uptake and the synthesis of nucleic acid ribose, lactate, palmitate, and glutamate in MIA and K562 cells. For enzyme activity studies, ribose 5-phosphate, xylulose 5-phosphate, Triton X-100, sodium deoxycholate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, NADH, triosephosphate isomerase/α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, glucose, ATP, thiamine pyrophosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, NADP+, and G6PDH were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO); MgCl2 and EDTA were obtained from Panreac Quimica S.A. (Barcelona, Spain); Tris was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA); and the Bio-Rad Protein Assay was obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Enzyme activities were measured using colorimetric assays on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Cell Positioner CPS-260). Protein concentration in cell extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay to calculate the specific activity of these enzymes after STI571 treatment in cultured MIA and K562 cells. MIA and K562 cells were plated, cultured, and treated as described for the isotope incubation studies above. After the 72-h treatment period using 0.68 and 6.8 μm doses of STI571, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached from the flask using 0.025% trypsin EDTA, and then resuspended in lysis buffer. Cells were homogenized using a laboratory sonicator and ultracentrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was separated and used for enzyme activity determinations. Transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1) activity was determined using the enzyme-linked method (20De La Haba G. Leder I.G. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 214: 409-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-ml aliquots of transketolase-free buffer were measured in spectrophotometry cuvettes containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm ribose 5-phosphate, 1 mm xylulose-5-phosphate, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 unit/ml triosephosphate isomerase/α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mm NADH, and 0.1 mm thiamine pyrophosphate. Transketolase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of cell extract at 37 °C. The oxidation of NADH, which is directly proportional to transketolase activity, was measured by the decrease of 340 nm absorbance. Transketolase activity is expressed as nmol × min−1× (mg protein)−1. G6PDH (EC 1.1.1.49) activity was measured as described by Tian et al. (21Tian W.N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cuvettes were prepared with a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm glucose-6-phosphate, and 0.5 mm NADP+. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of cell extract at 37 °C. The reduction of NADP, which is directly proportional to G6PDH activity, was quantitated by the increase of 340 nm absorbance, and G6PDH activity is expressed as nmol × min−1 × (mg protein)−1. Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) activity was determined by a modification of the method described by Grossbard et al. (22Grossbard L. Weksler M. Schimke R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Grossbard and Shimke (23Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hexokinase reaction is coupled with the release of NADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase after glucose activation by hexokinase. The reaction cuvette contained 1 mm NADP, 5 mm glucose, and 2 mm MgATP in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, at 37 °C. In this system, NADPH release is only possible upon the activation (phosphorylation) of glucose by hexokinase, in the presence of 1 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as the secondary enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding 10-μl aliquots of cell supernatant. We recorded 340 nm absorbance changes due to NADPH formation, and hexokinase activity is expressed as nmol × min−1 × (mg protein)−1. In vitroexperiments were carried out using three cultures each time for each treatment regimen and then repeated twice. Mass spectral analyses were carried out by three independent automatic injections of 1-μl samples by the automatic sampler and were accepted only if the standard sample deviation was <1% of the normalized peak intensity. Enzyme activity measurements were determined after correction for total protein content in cell extracts. Statistical analysis was performed using the parametric unpaired, two-tailed independent sample t test with 99% confidence intervals (μ ± 2.58ς), andp < 0.01 was considered to indicate significant differences in glucose carbon metabolism and enzyme activities in K562 and MIA cell cultures treated with increasing doses of STI571. Because of the two human cell lines involved, a clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board for the use of these commercially available cells for the experiments reported. For the present report, K562 myeloid blast and MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were treated with increasing amounts of STI571 (0.68 and 6.8 μm) for 72 h in the presence of [1,2-13C2]glucose. STI571 doses were selected for the study because the plasma levels of STI571 inducing hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients with CML are in the range of 0.1–3.4 μg/ml (0.17–5.68 μm) after treatment with 25–600 mg STI571/day (11Buchdunger E. O'Reilly T. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 720Google Scholar). Changes in metabolic enzyme activities, which bear high glucose carbon flow control characteristics through glycolysis and the pentose cycle, are also reported. The two cell lines showed similar rates of proliferation because their untreated control cultures contained the same cell number after 72 h of culture (2.75 × 107 cells; Fig.2A). Increasing doses of STI571 did not alter the final cell number in MIA cell cultures but decreased the K562 cell number in a dose-dependent fashion. Based on the in vitro proliferation data, the IC50 concentration of STI571 in K562 cultures is 0.56 μm. Both MIA and K562 cultures maintained an adequate lactate production rate, indicating viable and metabolically active cells throughout the experiment (Fig. 2B). Glucose consumption (Fig. 3A) and13CO2 release (Fig. 3B) in K562 cells indicated that glucose uptake and CO2 production from glucose are significantly decreased after STI571 treatment but are unaffected in MIA cells. The negative δ13CO2/12CO2 values in K562 cultures treated with 6.8 μm STI571 indicate the oxidation of carbon substrates that have 13C enrichment below the calibration standard sample.Figure 3Comparison of glucose consumption and13CO2 production from glucose in K562 leukemia and MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cultures in response to increasing doses of STI571 treatment. A, glucose consumption decreased in a dose-dependent manner in K562 cells in response to STI571 treatment (12-h culture). B, MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell 13CO2 release did not respond to STI571 treatment; on the other hand,13CO2 release from [1,2-13C2]glucose in K562 leukemia cells exhibited a dose-dependent significant decrease after treatment with 0.68 and 6.8 μm STI571 (72-h culture) (X̄ + S.D.; n = 9; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 13C content (known as Σmn) of rRNA and mRNA, respectively, demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in response to escalating doses of STI571 in K562 cells in comparison with MIA cells. The decrease in RNA 13C content was strictly confined to limited direct glucose oxidation (Fig.4A) becausem1/Σmn showed a characteristic decrease, whereas nonoxidative ribose synthesis (Fig.4B) demonstrated a relative increase (m2/Σmn). As is evident, STI571 treatment uniformly affected the synthesis of both mRNA and rRNA from glucose with a rapid, 13% and 30% decrease through direct glucose oxidation. MIA cell total RNA 13C content did not indicate a dose-dependent change after STI571 treatment. Likewise, the activities of G6PDH (Fig.5A) and hexokinase (Fig.5B), the enzymes primarily in control of direct glucose oxidation, were decreased by about 30% and 50% in 0.68 and 6.8 μm STI571-treated K562 myeloid cells, but not in MIA cells. The activity of transketolase, the primary enzyme in nonoxidative ribose synthesis, showed a less pronounced (only 4.8%) decrease after 0.68 μm STI571 treatment in K562 cells (Fig. 4C). Based on the calculated 0.56 μmconcentration of STI571 corresponding to the IC50 value in cell proliferation, it is evident that hexokinase and G6PDH, but not transketolase, are the enzymes responding to STI571 treatment and alter pentose cycle carbon flow as well as the proliferation of K562 cells. 13C enrichment of acetyl units from glucose was significantly higher (4-fold) in untreated MIA cultures than in K562 cells. On the other hand, K562 cells demonstrated about 50% higherde novo palmitate synthesis from glucose carbons. K562 cells exhibited a significant decrease in acetyl enrichment after all doses of STI571 (Fig. 6A). The fraction of newly synthesized palmitate was also significantly decreased after all doses of STI571 in K562 cells (Fig.6B). STI571 treatment did not affect 13C incorporation into glutamate in either cell line, indicating a limited role of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase signal transducer pathway and STI571 in the regulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities and carbon flow. Lactate m1/m2 ratios also responded weakly to STI571 treatment in both cells lines (data not shown). This study investigates the metabolic responses to STI571, a potent low molecular weight inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase construct, in cultured K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells in comparison with MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Using the [1,2-13C2]glucose tracer in in vitro metabolic studies has enabled us to study a broad range of intracellular glucose intermediates simultaneously and to investigate their label distribution to determine carbon flow through various metabolic pathways in response to this leukemia growth-modifying agent. Activity changes of three important metabolic enzymes involved in hexose/glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase), direct glucose oxidation (G6PDH), and nonoxidative glucose utilization (transketolase) were also reported. Our studies revealed profound metabolic differences directly affecting substrate utilization toward the synthesis of nucleic acid ribose and new palmitate in K562 myeloid leukemia cells. Previous studies revealed that transforming growth factor-β2, a prominent tyrosine kinase stimulator ligand, induces profound metabolic changes in invasive lung epithelial carcinoma cells characterized by increased glucose utilization and increased nucleic acid ribose synthesis through the nonoxidative steps of the pentose cycle but decreases direct glucose oxidation and pentose cycle activity (7Boros L.G. Torday J.S. Lim S. Bassilian S. Cascante M. Lee W.-N.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1183-1185PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, genistein, the isoflavonoid of the soy plant, is known to inhibit epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-β2 signaling through tyrosine kinase in various tumors, and it is a strong inhibitor of nucleic acid synthesis from glucose, which is the mechanism underlying its antiproliferative action in MIA cells (8Boros L.G. Bassilian S. Lim S. Lee W.-N.P. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other natural tumor-fighting compounds, such as the fermented wheat germ extract Avemar, also inhibit glucose-derived nucleic acid synthesis, glucose uptake, and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (24Boros L.G. Lapis K. Szende B. Tömösközi-Farkas R. Balogh A. Boren J. Marin S. Cascante M. Lee W.-N.P. Hidvégi M. Pancreas. 2001; 23: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cells respond to STI571 treatment with decreased glucose uptake and decreased proliferation. Both these features are present in metastatic tumors of stromal gastric cancer in response to STI571 treatment (25Joensuu H. Roberts P.J. Sarlomo-Rikala M. Andersson L.C. Tervahartiala P. Tuveson D. Silberman S. Capdeville R. Dimitrijevic S. Druker B. Demetri G.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). In a case report, multiple liver metastases and increased accumulation of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose were demonstrated on a positron emission tomography scan, but 1 month after treatment with STI571 no abnormal uptake of the tracer was seen in the liver metastases of stromal tumor cells. In a finding consistent with the hypodense appearance of metastases on magnetic resonance imaging, “cold” areas with less uptake of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose than the surrounding liver parenchyma were seen at the sites of liver metastases on the positron emission tomography scan obtained 2 months after STI571 treatment was started. Data acquired in our study indicate that STI571 regulates leukemia cell proliferation by altering the rate of glucose utilization for various intermediary metabolic steps including the synthesis of nucleic acid ribose through the oxidative reactions of the pentose cycle. This can be deduced from the dose-dependent significant decrease of hexokinase and G6PDH activities in K562 cells after STI571 treatment. Furthermore, stable glucose isotope incorporation into both mRNA and rRNA fractions decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Because ribose is a close metabolite of glucose, and ribose nucleotides are essential forde novo DNA and RNA synthesis, it is evident that inhibiting the formation of ribose from glucose through enzymes with high carbon flow control coefficients in glycolysis and the pentose cycle (18,19) is a central metabolic event by which STI571 regulates leukemia cell growth. It is likely that the oncogenic process mediated by the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is closely associated with increased enzyme protein synthesis and enzyme activities through either transcriptional regulation or direct phosphorylation that control carbon flow toward nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis in myeloid tumor cells. STI571 has a remarkable effect on the oxidation of the first carbon of glucose through the oxidative steps of the pentose cycle during oxidative ribose synthesis; therefore, it acts as an important agent in controlling NADPH production and fatty acid synthesis in Bcr-Abl-positive tumor cells. Although a relative increase in transketolase-derived ribose production is documented in this study, it is likely that increased nonoxidative ribose synthesis is not able to supplement tumor cell metabolic needs for reducing equivalents. These reducing equivalents would be used intensively forde novo fatty acid synthesis as well as the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides during DNA replication. We acknowledge a potential limitation of this study. Whereas there are clearly major changes in glucose metabolism in cells being treated with STI571, it remains unknown whether this is the major cause of cell death. A short review of reported changes in glucose metabolism in response to hydroxyurea treatment (a potent DNA/RNA synthesis inhibitor also used to treat CML) is given here to address whether decreased glucose uptake, activation, and oxidation are unique to direct targeting of the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl by STI571. Glucokinase activity of regenerating liver showed a dose-dependent increase (24 h) or no change (48 and 96 h) after 250 and 1000 mg/kg hydroxyurea treatment in rats (26Lea M.A. Sasovetz D. Musella A. Morris H.P. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 1994-1999PubMed Google Scholar). In the same study, hexokinase activity was decreased after 250 mg/kg hydroxyurea treatment but increased after 1000 mg/kg hydroxyurea treatment in hepatoma 7777 and 3924-A cells. In a later study, it was demonstrated that although the transport systems for thymidine and uridine are rapidly lost upon inhibition of RNA synthesis by hydroxyurea, the transport systems for choline and 2-deoxy-d-glucose are active and stable (27Plagemenn P.G. Richey D.P. Zylka J.M. Erbe J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in Novikoff rat hepatoma cells. Additional experiments indicate that deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methylglucose uptakes, which are associated with S-phase fraction, actually increase in a time-dependent manner in human SW620 colon tumor cells after hydroxyurea treatment (28Smith T.A. Titley J.C. Cancer Lett. 1999; 141: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Whereas hydroxyurea treatment seems to increase G6PDH and hexokinase activities, resulting in increased glucose activation and glucose oxidation rates in various tumor cells, the Bcr-Abl inhibitor STI571 inhibits these key enzymes, which are critically important for nucleic acid ribose synthesis from glucose. On the other hand, the activation of Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase is associated with the stimulation of glucose transport in a multipotent hemopoietic cell line of chronic myeloid leukemia (29Bentley J. Walker I. McIntosh E. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. Baldwin S.A. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The observation that Bcr-Abl regulates glucose transport in CML raises the possibility that glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in the aberrant survival/proliferation of stem cells in CML and that the effective inhibition of Bcr-Abl by STI571 ultimately affects glucose transport, activation, and nucleic acid ribose synthesis. In conclusion, the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase construct is an important signaling mechanism for the regulation of myeloid tumor cell macromolecule synthesis, metabolic pathway activities, proliferation, and growth. As demonstrated herein, regulation of metabolic enzymes involved in glucose carbon redistribution between proliferation-related structural and functional macromolecules (RNA, DNA, and fatty acids) is an effective mechanism to control tumor cell growth. Inhibiting the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase signal transducer pathway with STI571 results in profound intracellular metabolic changes that bring devastating consequences for the survival/proliferation of leukemia cells of the Bcr-Abl-positive myeloid lineage. Here we stipulate that similar growth control could be achieved in a wide variety of human tumors by the combination of glucose metabolic enzyme-inhibitory compounds. These compounds would exert their effect directly, without the need of the myeloid cell-specific Bcr-Abl signal transducer pathway (30Peng B. Hayes M. Druker B. Talpaz M. Sawyers C. Resta D. Ford J. Man A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 544Google Scholar), on glucose metabolic enzymes that control nucleic acid synthesis, carbon flow through the pentose cycle, and, ultimately, cell proliferation."

In isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons, CaR agonists activate non-selective cation and Ca2+-activated K+ channels (11Ye C. Kanazirska M. Quinn S. Brown E.M. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

CaR is a member of Family C of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, as are mGluRs, γ-amino isobutyric acid receptors (GABABRs), and putative pheromone/taste receptors. CaR and mGluR1α are both activated by extracellular Ca2+ over similar concentration ranges (19Kubokawa K. Miyashita T. Nagasawa H. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Murata Y.

Although CaR shares only a modest level of amino acid identity with mGluRs (<24%), critical structural similarities as well as overlapping agonist sensitivities hint at a common ancestry. In particular, CaR and Group I mGluRs have a large extracellular domain which incorporates both the agonist-binding site, sharing structural homology with bacterial periplasmic binding proteins and all other members of Family C (22Conklin B.R.

Given the overlapping expression of CaR and Group I mGluRs in brain, and their ability to form functional chimeras, we determined whether CaR and Group I mGluRs formed heterodimers in vivo. Here we demonstrate that heterodimers of these two distinct classes of G protein-coupled receptors form in vivo and in vitro, and demonstrate that trafficking of CaR within heterologously expressed CaR:mGluR heterodimers is influenced by glutamate and Homer 1c. Human CaR (hCaR) was obtained from Dr. Klaus Seuwen (Novartis Pharma, AG, Basel, Switzerland), rat mGluR1α from Dr. Thomas P. Segerson (Oregon Health Sciences University), rat mGluR5 and Homer 1c from Dr. Paul Worley (Johns Hopkins University), β2-adrenergic receptor from Dr. David Yue (Johns Hopkins University), and pDsRed1N1 was purchased from CLONTECH. hCaR-EGFP was prepared as described (26Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rat mGluR1α was subcloned from pBluescript into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) with NotI. The mGluR1α-EGFP construct was prepared by generating a polymerase chain reaction product containing a BamHI site in place of the stop codon, using the original mGluR1α in pBluescript as the template. After amplification, the product was cut withNotI-BamHI and subcloned in-frame into pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH). Double-tagged proteins (Flag-hCaR-EGFP and Flag-mGluR1α-EGFP) were generated by inserting the FlagTM epitope sequence in-frame after the respective signal peptides (MAFYSCCWVLLALTWHTSAYG for hCaR and MVRLLLIFFPMIFLEMSILP for mGluR1α) by inverse polymerase chain reaction (34Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using hCaR-EGFP and mGluR1α-EGFP as templates. The same technique was used to insert the FlagTM epitope sequence at the carboxyl termini of the wild type β2-adrenergic receptor, mGluR1α, mGluR5, and hCaR, to produce single epitope proteins. Plasmids were introduced into HEK-293 cells by the liposomal formulation NovaFECTORTM (Venn-Nova, Pompano Beach, FL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 2 µg of plasmid mixture was diluted in Opti-MEMTMI (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) and mixed with 5 µl of transfection agent. When necessary, pDsRed1N1, which generates a soluble control protein, was used to maintain a constant amount of DNA (and protein expression) for each transfection. Bovine brain was freshly obtained from a slaughterhouse and kept at 4 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution until dissection. Tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer (1 mm EDTA, 100 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) containing protease inhibitors (Cømplete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) using a Polytron homogenizer. After centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was stored in 500-µl aliquots at −80 °C. Transfected HEK-293 cells were rinsed with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and after brief centrifugation at 500 rpm, the pellet was suspended in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (as described above) and gently agitated at 4 °C for 30 min. The tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation.

Spiegel) and anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma) or Protein A-agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), for PA1–934 antibody (ABR, Golden, CO) was added to each tube (brain homogenate or transfected cells) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation from brain, 5 µl of ADD (1 µg/ml) or PA1–934 were added to each supernatant. For immunoprecipitation from transfected HEK-293 cells, 5 µl of anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) was added to each supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 25 µl of resin (either Protein G-Sepharose or Protein A-agarose, depending upon the antibody) was added to each tube and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed 3 times with ice-cold wash buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris buffer) and incubated in 30 µl of Western blot loading buffer (12 m urea, 4% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm Tris) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were run on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as previously described (26Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and blots probed with anti-GFP antibody at 1:2000 dilution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, transfected cells were replated into a 96-well plate pre-coated with rat tail collagen. Experiments were performed on the third day after transfection. Before experiments, cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/zero glutamate for 4 h. Wells were treated with various agonists, and reactions were halted by fixing for 10 min at 22–24 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed twice with PBS, and blocked for 30 min with PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum. The blocking solution was replaced by 50 µl of 1:4000 dilution of anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After 3 rinses with wash buffer B (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS), the plate was developed with 50 µl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (Sigma). After 20–30 min, the substrate solutions from each well were transferred to a new plate containing 50 µl of H2SO4 (1 m). The plate was analyzed at 450 nm on a SpectraMAX 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The original plate (containing the fixed cells) was washed 3 times with PBS, and then assayed for protein (Micro-BCA, Pierce, Rockford, IL) to permit normalization. Fisher F344 rats (21, 28, and 35 days of age, 5 rats per group) were deeply anesthetized with methoxyfluorane, and blood removed from tissues by intracardiac perfusion with 25 ml of cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Tissues were then fixed in situ by perfusion with 40 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer. After 18 h post-fixation within the skull, the brains were dissected out and embedded in gelatin (15 brains per block). Serial 40-µm thick cryostat sections were cut (Neuroscience Associates, Knoxville TN). Floating sections (5 sections per rat brain) were incubated with mild agitation in: 1) 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS pH 7.4 (PBS-T) for 20 min; 2) 5% normal donkey serum (JacksonImmunoResearch Labs, Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min; and 3) primary antibodies (10 µg/ml, diluted in blocking solution) for 18–48 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-CaR (ADD) and rabbit anti-mGluR1α (Chemicon Intl., Temecula, CA). Sections were then washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS-T before incubation with secondary conjugates (10 µg/ml, diluted in blocking solution). Conjugates used were donkey anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein and donkey anti-rabbit IgG labeled with rhodamine (JacksonImmunoResearch Labs, Inc.). Conjugate specificity was confirmed by abolition of detectable staining when the primary antibody was omitted. Sections were washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS-T, dipped in dH2O, and coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), sealed with nail polish. Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a 4-µm optical slice and final magnification of × 25–50. Two different antibodies against CaR were used in immunoprecipitation studies from bovine brain. A monoclonal anti-CaR antibody, ADD, was obtained from Dr. Alan Spiegel (35Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone Mineral Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a polyclonal anti-CaR antibody, PA1–934, purchased from Affinity BioReagents. To confirm the specificity of both antibodies in immunoprecipitation studies, CaR-EGFP was heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells, membranes solubilized, and immunoprecipitation performed with either ADD or PA1–934. Western blots were probed with anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes), and confirmed that both ADD and PA1–934 immunoprecipitated a band having a molecular mass appropriate to the GFP-tagged CaR (≈190 kDa), Fig.1A. CaR, mGluR1α, or CaR plus mGluR1α (1:1 cDNA ratio) were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with either ADD or PA1–934. Western blots were probed with anti-mGluR1α antibody (Chemicon), and as illustrated in Fig.1B, only cells which had been transfected withboth CaR and mGluR1α (lanes labeled C:G) yielded a band at the molecular mass consistent with mGluR1α (approximately 185 kDa). The anti-Flag antibody was used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation, and did not bring down mGluR1α. These results clearly demonstrate that stable CaR:mGluR1α heterodimers form when heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. To determine whether CaR:mGluR heterodimers were formed in vivo, CaR from bovine brain was immunoprecipitated with either ADD or PA1–934. A third, control immunoprecipitation utilized the anti-Flag antibody. Western blots were probed with anti-mGluR1α antibodies (Fig. 1C). Significant immunoreactivity was observed at a molecular weight consistent with fully glycosylated mGluR1 when immunoprecipitation was carried out with either ADD or PA1–934, but not when the anti-Flag antibody was used. The results illustrated in Fig. 1 indicate CaR:mGluR1 heterodimers form in vivo and in vitro. To define the brain regions in which CaR:mGluR1α heterodimerization might be important, we performed immunofluorescence localization studies with the monoclonal anti-CaR antibody ADD and a rabbit polyclonal anti-mGluR1α antibody (Chemicon) in juvenile rat brain. We examined 3–5 serial brain sections from F344 rats at 21, 28, or 35 days of age (n = 5 rats/age group). The immunoreactivity patterns observed for either receptor did not differ among these age groups. The expression patterns of both CaR and mGluR1α observed were consistent with previous studies (5Chattopadhyay N. Légrádi G. Bai M. Kifor O. Ye C. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Lechan R.M. Dev.

Brain Res. 1994; 21: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Representative images from 28-day-old rats are shown in Fig.2. The regions in which CaR and mGluR1α immunoreactivity were most highly expressed together were the cerebellum and the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, overlapping expression of CaR and mGluR1α was observed by confocal microscopy in cerebellar purkinje cells (Fig.2A, arrows) and molecular layer (Fig. 2A,Ml). Immunoreactivity for mGluR1α only was observed in the granule cell layer (Fig. 2A). In the hippocampus, both CaR and mGluR1α immunoreactivity was observed in the dentate gyrus and polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus (Fig. 2B) and CA3 region (not shown). CaR expression was also observed singly in hippocampal regions CA1 and CA2 (not shown), in isolated neurons in the brain stem (Fig. 2C) and in fiber tracts of the brainstem and corpus callosum (not shown). These results indicate that both receptor proteins are present in the same cell location, and therefore are available to form CaR:mGluR1α heterodimers at specific locationsin vivo. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 strongly suggest that CaR and mGluR1α are co-localized, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and that they can be co-immunoprecipitated from brain homogenates. When heterologously expressed in the same cells, CaR and mGluR1α can also be co-immunoprecipitated. Further experiments were therefore designed to test the specificity of the association and nature of the interaction. To determine the specificity of CaR interactions with Group I mGluRs, CaR-Flag was expressed in HEK-293 cells with various receptors tagged at their carboxyl termini with EGFP (CLONTECH). Membranes were isolated and CaR-Flag was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-GFP antibody to determine whether CaR-Flag interacted with the coexpressed receptors. The β2-adrenergic receptor, from a distinct family of G protein-coupled receptors, was used as a negative control, and did not co-precipitate with CaR-Flag (Fig.3A, B2:C). As a positive control, CaR-Flag and CaR-EGFP were co-expressed and co-precipitated with the anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3A, C:C), as we have previously shown (26Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, when CaR-Flag was co-expressed with either mGluR1α-EGFP (G1:C) or mGluR5-EGFP (G5:C), significant GFP immunoreactivity was observed, suggesting an intimate interaction between CaR and Group I mGluRs, consistent with heterodimerization. Given the structural similarities between CaR and mGluRs, several additional controls for specificity were performed. CaR-Flag was transfected into one population of HEK-293 cells, and mGluR1α-EGFP, mGluR5-EGFP, or β2-adrenergic receptor-EGFP were transfected into distinct populations of HEK-293 cells; membranes were isolated independently from each transfection. Equal amounts of membrane protein from two preparations (cells transfected with CaR-Flag plus cells transfected with one of the EGFP-tagged receptors) were mixed, and CaR-Flag was immunoprecipitated. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-GFP antibody. Illustrated in Fig. 3A (right panel) are the results, comparing CaR-Flag plus CaR-EGFP (C:C) or CaR-Flag plus mGluR1α-EGFP (G1:C) coexpressed in the same cells, and CaR-Flag and mGluR1α-EGFP expressed in different cells and mixed prior to immunoprecipitation (G1/C). When membranes of individually transfected cells were mixed prior to immunoprecipitation, no GFP immunoreactivity was observed. (Similar results were obtained with C/G5 and C/B2, data not shown.) These results suggest that the differentially epitope-tagged receptors must be expressed in the same cells for co-precipitation, and presumably heterodimerization, to occur. To determine whether the interaction between CaR and Group I mGluRs was stabilized via a covalent disulfide linkage, as is observed for CaR:CaR or mGluR:mGluR homodimers (26Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Romano C. Yang W.-L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), membranes isolated from HEK-293 cells co-transfected with CaR-Flag and CaR-EGFP (C:C) or CaR-Flag and mGluR1α-EGFP (G:C) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and then solubilized and electrophoresed in the absence or presence of β-mercaptoethanol. The Western blot in Fig. 3B illustrates that in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, GFP immunoreactivity appears predominantly at a molecular weight consistent with CaR-Flag:CaR-EGFP or CaR-Flag:mGluR1-EGFP dimers (and higher oligomers), while in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, the preponderance of GFP immunoreactivity is present at a molecular weight consistent with the respective monomers. These results strongly suggest that CaR:mGluR heterodimers are stabilized by covalent disulfide bonds, as has been demonstrated for the respective homodimers. CaR mutants which are misfolded or incorrectly dimerized are not fully glycosylated and do not traffic to the plasma membrane (33Hauache O.M. Hu J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M.

Western blots derived from immunoprecipitation of CaR-Flag plus Group I mGluRs exhibit predominantly the fully glycosylated forms of both CaR and mGluR1α or mGluR5 (Fig. 3A), suggesting complete processing of the heterodimers and localization to the plasma membrane. As a second test of plasma membrane localization of the CaR/mGluR heterodimers, we took advantage of the family of Homer/vesl proteins which interact with and specify subcellular localization of Group I mGluRs (40Xiao B. Tu J.C. Worley P.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In particular, Homer 1c has been shown both in vivo (41Tadokoro S. Tachibana T. Imanaka T. Nishida W. Sobue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13801-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in vitro (42Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. Chan W.-Y. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) to stabilize Group I mGluRs at the plasma membrane. An ELISA was used to quantify plasma membrane localization of CaR:CaR and mGluR1α:mGluR1α homodimers, as well as CaR:mGluR1α heterodimers; in each transfection, the first partner in the pair contained an amino-terminal Flag epitope. Coexpression of Flag-mGluR1α plus Homer 1c in HEK-293 cells resulted in a significant increase in plasma membrane localization of Flag-mGluR1α, when compared with Flag-mGluR1α alone (Fig.4A), as has been previously shown (42Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. Chan W.-Y. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CaR does not contain the -PPSPFR- epitope, present near the carboxyl terminus of Group I mGluRs, which is required for interaction with the Homer EVH1 domain (69Beneken J. Tu J.-C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In confirmation, the degree of plasma membrane localization of Flag-CaR in HEK-293 cells was not affected by coexpression with Homer 1c (Fig. 4B). However, when Flag-CaR plus mGluR1α were coexpressed, Homer 1c significantly increased the amount of plasma membrane-localized Flag-CaR (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that localization of Flag-CaR:mGluR1α heterodimers at the plasma membrane is stabilized in the presence of Homer 1c. In addition, the results imply that only a single -PPSPFR- epitope is required within the receptor dimer for Homer 1c-mediated enhancement of plasma membrane localization, since the increase in plasma membrane localization of the Flag-mGluR1α:mGluR1α dimers is comparable to that observed for the Flag-CaR:mGluR1α heterodimers (compare Fig. 4, A and B). Coexpression of Flag-CaR with mGluR5 significantly increased Flag-CaR at the plasma membrane in both the absence and presence of Homer 1c (Fig.4C). Coexpression of CaR and mGluR1α with Homer 1c increases CaR localization to the plasma membrane, presumably within the CaR:mGluR1α heterodimer (Fig. 4B). Conversely, decreases in plasma membrane localization occur as a result of agonist exposure for many GPCRs; therefore the effects of Ca2+ or glutamate were examined in cells expressing Flag-CaR:CaR, Flag-mGluR1α:mGluR1α, Flag-CaR:mGluR1α, or Flag-mGluR1α:CaR dimers. For each transfection pair, plasma membrane localization of the Flag-tagged receptor was determined by ELISA. Transfected cells were exposed to either control (0.5 mmCa2+, no glutamate), 10 mm Ca2+, 1 mm glutamate, or 10 mm Ca2+ plus 1 mm glutamate, for 15 min. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5. Cells expressing Flag-CaR:CaR (Fig. 5A) responded to 10 mm Ca2+ with a 57% decrease in plasma membrane localization of receptor dimers, but 1 mm glutamate had no statistically significant effect. The response to both 10 mm Ca2+ plus 1 mm glutamate was indistinguishable from the response to Ca2+ alone. Internalization of Flag-CaR:mGluR1α heterodimers was sensitive to either 10 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm glutamate to a similar extent, while there was no further potentiation of intern"

Sequencing of peptides derived from the purified protein allowed expressed sequence tag sequences to be identified that were assembled to yield a full-length composite sequence whose conceptual translation product contained the complete amino acid sequence of ovocalyxin-32. Data base searches revealed that ovocalyxin-32 has limited identity (32%) to two unrelated proteins: latexin, a carboxypeptidase inhibitor expressed in the rat cerebral cortex and mast cells, and a skin protein, which is encoded by a retinoic acid receptor-responsive gene, TIG1. High level expression of ovocalyxin-32 was limited to the isthmus and uterus tissue, where immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels demonstrated that ovocalyxin-32 is secreted by surface epithelial cells.

Calcification of the shell takes place upon organic cores associated with the fibers of the outer shell membrane, giving rise to the mammillary (inner) and palisade (outer) layers. The latter consists of columns of rhombohedral calcite with preferred orientation (4Sharp R.M. Silyn-Roberts H. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 175-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such a degree of structural and crystallographic organization may result from competition in crystal growth between adjacent nucleation sites (5Garcia-Ruiz, J. M., and Rodriguez-Navarro, A.

Osteopontin, a phosphorylated glycoprotein present in bone and other hard tissues, is also present in the eggshell (14Pines M. Knopov V. Bar A.

Its expression by cells of the uterine surface epithelium is greatly up-regulated in response to mechanical strain when an egg enters the uterus (15Lavelin I. Yarden N. Ben-Bassat S. Bar A. Pines M.

Eggshell-specific proteins termed ovocleidins have been identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and immunochemistry (16Hincke M.T. Tsang C.P. Courtney M. Hill V. Narbaitz R. Calcif.

One of these, ovocleidin-116, has been cloned and corresponds to the core protein of an eggshell dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (17Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Tsang C.P. McKee M.D. Nys Y. J. Biol.

Ovocleidin-17 is a C-type, lectin-like protein of 17 kDa, which also occurs as a glycosylated form (ovocleidin-23) (18Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

There has been a lack of precise molecular detail regarding the uterine-specific, eggshell matrix proteins: information that would be valuable in allowing comparisons with similar proteins in other calcifying tissues. In previous work, we reported that uterine fluid collected at the terminal phase of eggshell formation could dramatically delay the precipitation of calcium carbonate from a metastable solution of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate (20Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Samples of this uterine fluid, containing an abundant 32-kDa protein, inhibited the spontaneous precipitation of calcium carbonate in this crystal growth assay. The present study reports the isolation and amino acid sequencing of this protein, as well as its corresponding cDNA sequence, protein localization, and tissue expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUterine Fluid SamplingBrown egg-laying hens (ISA BROWN, 30–60 weeks of age) were housed individually in cages located in a windowless air-conditioned poultry house.

Eggs were expelled at precise stages of calcification with an intravenous injection of prostaglandin (PGF2, 50 µg/hen) at 6–9 h (initial stage), 18–19 h (active growth phase), or 22–23 h (terminal phase of shell calcification) after the preceding oviposition (post-oviposition (p.o.)1) (20Gautron J.

At this time, uterine fluid was collected in a plastic test tube placed at the entrance of the everted vagina. Aliquots of uterine fluid were then diluted in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) buffer (1:1; 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Some of these were used immediately to determine protein concentration. The remainder were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C.Preparation of Tissue ExtractsEggshell MatrixProteins associated with the eggshell matrix were extracted according to the procedure described previously (10Gautron J. Bain M. Solomon S. Nys Y. Br. Poult. Sci. 1996; 37: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Panheleux M. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. McKee M.D. Nys Y.

Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, 54 eggs were collected from hens at 6 months of age. The eggshells were rinsed first with running tap water, followed by 154 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors (2.5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 50 mmamino-n-caproic acid, 0.5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).The samples of powdered eggshell were first treated with 4m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 4 days. The supernatant was dialyzed, desalted, and concentrated in a stirring cell (Amicon Cell, cut-off 5 kDa; Amicon Bioseparation, Millipore S.A., Saint-Quentin/Yvelines, France). This sample is referred to as the extramineral shell extract.The pellet resulting from centrifugation of the preceding extraction was demineralized with 0.5 m EDTA, 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, then extracted in 4 m GdnHCl, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The supernatant was collected desalted and concentrated as described above. This sample is referred to as the intramineral shell extract.Bone and Cartilage ExtractionProteins from tibiotarsal bones and from the upper proliferating zone of the growth plate of broiler chickens (4 weeks old) were extracted by established procedures (22Termine J.D. Wientroub S. Fisher L.W. Dickson G.R. Methods of Calcified Tissue Preparation. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, Netherlands1984: 547-563Google Scholar). Samples (1 g) were first extracted in 4 mGdnHCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitor mixture to produce the extramineral cartilage and bone extracts. The pellets obtained during the preceding extraction were completely demineralized by extraction with 0.5 mEDTA, 4 m GdnHCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors to produce the intramineral cartilage and bone extracts.Other TissuesLaying hens (4 hens, aged 7 months) were sacrificed by lethal intravenous injection of pentobarbital at 2–4 or 16–17 h p.o. Various tissues (magnum, white and red isthmus, uterus, liver, kidney, duodenum, and skeletal muscle) were collected (0.5–2 g) and homogenized in 10 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 77 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitors). Each sample was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. Blood was collected from the same birds immediately before sacrifice. After centrifugation at 2,500 × g, the plasma was frozen for storage.Antibody PreparationTwo preparative SDS-PAGE gradient gels (3 mm width) were loaded with uterine fluid samples harvested at the terminal phase of shell calcification (8 mg of protein). After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then thoroughly rinsed with demineralized water. The gel containing the 32-kDa band was excised and ground into a fine powder with a Spex freezer mill. The powder was suspended in 154 mm NaCl, mixed 1:1 with Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected into 2 rabbits. The animals were boosted seven times, at 3-week intervals, with the same antigen preparation in Freund's incomplete adjuvant to obtain a satisfactory titer.Electrophoresis and ElectroblottingThe protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford procedure (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) (Pierce micromethod) using ovalbumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 4–20% gradient gel (24Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar). Tissue samples were diluted 1:1 in SDS-PAGE buffer and boiled for 5 min before being loaded onto the gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, or electroblotted (0.8 mA/cm2) onto either: (i) polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Hyperbond, Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, 10% methanol, for microsequencing, or (ii) nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol for Western blot analysis.Western BlottingNitrocellulose membranes were washed in PBS-Tween (0.01m phosphate buffer, 0.0027 m potassium chloride, 0.137 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween. The membranes were then washed twice in PBS-Tween (5 min) and incubated for 90 min with the rabbit antiserum raised against the 32-kDa protein (1:5,000 in PBS-Tween, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). After three washes in PBS-Tween (5 min), the membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:20,000 anti-rabbit Ig, peroxidase linked species-specific whole antibody (NA 934, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS-Tween, 1% BSA. The membranes were washed four times in PBS-Tween, and then twice in PBS. The enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to reveal immunoreactive bands. The exposure times used were 2, 10, 30, and 300 s.Purification and Sequencing of Ovocalyxin-32Intact eggs (89) were treated to selectively dissolve the shell exterior by immersion in 1 n HCl at room temperature for 3 min. This time was found to be optimal for relatively selective extraction of OCX-32 in small scale time trials (data not shown). This limited dissolution of the very superficial layer of shell produced an extract enriched in OCX-32 from which the protein was purified by liquid chromatography. This solution was dialyzed against three changes of 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and passed through a column of CM-Sepharose FF previously equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The column was washed with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and a gradient to 2m NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, was developed. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those eluting above 1.4 m NaCl were found to contain a single 32-kDa band (OCX-32). These fractions were pooled, dialyzed against water, and freeze-dried.The purified protein was reduced and carboxymethylated under denaturing conditions (18Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 997-1007PubMed Google Scholar) and precipitated twice with 10 volumes of ethanol. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage was performed in 70% formic acid by addition of a small crystal of CNBr and incubation of the mixture at 23 °C for 24 h in the dark. The resulting fragments were separated by reversed phase HPLC using a C18 column (18Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 997-1007PubMed Google Scholar). The fragments contained in the largest peak were further cleaved with lysyl endopeptidase and the peptides separated by HPLC. Sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 492 sequencer.N-terminal microsequencing of OCX-32 was performed with uterine fluid collected at the terminal phase or with eggshell extract, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue, 40% methanol, and 1% acetic acid for a few minutes and destained in 50% methanol until the bands became clearly visible. The 32-kDa protein of interest was excised, loaded into a protein sequencer, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation in an LF 3000 Protein Sequencer (Beckman/Porton, Beckman Instruments Inc.).Reverse Transcriptase-mediated PCR and Northern BlottingTotal RNA was prepared by using an RNA InstaPure kit (Eurogentec) to extract tissue from the different parts of the oviduct (magnum, white and red isthmus, uterus) and from liver, kidney, and duodenum. Hens were sampled at two stages of egg formation: before (3 h p.o) and during (16 h p.o.) eggshell calcification. Reverse transcription was performed with 5 µg of RNA, using random primers and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (RNase H−, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. PCR amplification was performed to amplify nucleotides 101–614 of the OCX-32 cDNA sequence, using the following primers: upper, 5′-GGACAGCACTGCACTACATCAA; lower, 5′-GGAATTTCGTGGAGCAAGACAA, for 22 cycles at 60 °C. The sequence of this 514-bp PCR product was verified by automated sequencing protocols, and radiolabeled (32P) by random priming at room temperature to serve as a cDNA probe for Northern blotting. RNA from various tissues (20 µg) was separated on 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N membrane by standard protocols (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized with the labeled probe overnight at 42 °C and washed (42 °C: 2× sodium citrate sodium chloride buffer (SSC), 0.1% SDS, 15 min; 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice for 15 min each; 55 °C: 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Labeled bands were visualized with x-ray film and quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager. The size of the OCX-32 transcript was calculated to be 1.3 kb.Two-way analysis of variance was used to study the effect of stage of eggshell formation and tissue on level of OCX-32 expression using the SYSTAT software program (Systat, Inc., Evanston, IL).Immunohistochemical Localization of Ovocalyxin-32Tissues used for this study were obtained from 8 hens with a hard-shelled egg in the uterus or with a forming egg in the white or red isthmus at the time of sacrifice. Tissue samples from the magnum, white isthmus, red isthmus, and uterus were immediately fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for 24 h. Samples from five eggshells were decalcified at room temperature over a period of ∼1 week in equal portions of 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer plus 150 mm EDTA, pH 7.7. The decalcified eggshells were subsequently fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for 24 h.Following fixation, samples were dehydrated through an ascending graded series of alcohol, cleared in two changes of histological clearing agent and infiltrated with two changes of polywax (code Z7882920, TCS Microbiology, Buckingham, United Kingdom). Each sample was then embedded (edge-on in the case of shell) into polywax blocks. Transverse sections (3–4 µm in thickness) of the embedded material were obtained using a Leitz rotary microtome and mounted on glass slides. Sections were dewaxed, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked using a solution of 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. Sections were washed in demineralized water and then again in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20, before incubation with 1% normal swine serum in TBS for 30 min. Sections were incubated overnight with rabbit antiserum to the 32-kDa protein (1/3,000 in 0.1% BSA, 0.01% sodium azide, TBS) at 4 °C. After another three rinses in TBS (5 min each), the sections were incubated for 40 min with biotinylated swine-anti-rabbit IgG 1/200. Following this, they were rinsed again (three 5-min rinses in TBS) and then incubated with StreptABComplex as per the manufacturer's instructions (StreptABComplex/HRP kit, code K0377, Dako, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom). Rinsing was repeated in TBS (three times for 5 min each), followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine chromogen. The reaction was terminated by rinsing in distilled water. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and mounted. The presence of a brown staining reaction indicated a positive result, with a negative result showing only the blue coloration of the counter stain. Controls to check for the presence of nonspecific reactions were performed with no primary antibody or with normal rabbit serum substituted for the primary antibody.Microscopic Analyses and Colloidal Gold Ultrastructural ImmunocytochemistrySamples of hen uterus and eggshell were fixed in aldehyde immediately after tissue harvest. These were washed, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in LR White acrylic resin as described previously (26McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 44-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Survey sections of embedded tissue were viewed by light microscopy, and selected regions trimmed for thin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. Grid-mounted tissue sections were processed for immunocytochemistry by incubation with primary antibodies, and immunolabeling patterns were visualized using protein A-colloidal gold complex (26McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 44-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) followed by conventional staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Incubated grids were examined in a JEOL JEM 2000FX operated at 80 kV. Control incubations consisted of identical section processing steps but omitting the primary antibody. Other samples of eggshell were fractured, critical-point or air-dried, and examined at 10 kV in a JEOL JSM 840A scanning electron microscope.DISCUSSIONThe eggshell is laid down upon the eggshell membranes in the distal part of the oviduct in association with an organic matrix composed of proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (7Tullet S.G. Wells R.G. Belyavin C.G. Egg Quality: Current Problems and Recent Advances. Butterworth, London1987: 123-146Google Scholar, 8Arias J.L. Fink D.J. Xiao S.Q. Heuer A.H. Caplan A.I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 145: 217-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This matrix is believed to modify the calcification process and influence the final microstructure of the eggshell (3Nys Y. Hincke M.T. Arias J.L. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. Solomon S.E. Poult. Avian Biol. Rev. 1999; 10: 143-166Google Scholar). A prerequisite to investigate this hypothesis is the characterization of the individual matrix components.Numerous matrix proteins have already been identified in the eggshell. These can be classified according to the tissue(s) in which they were first identified and with which they are most prominently associated. One group of identified eggshell matrix proteins corresponds to major proteins of the egg white. Ovalbumin was the first egg white protein described in the matrix of the eggshell (11Hincke M.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). More recently, the presence of lysozyme and ovotransferrin has been reported (12Gautron, J., Hincke, M. T., Panhéleux, M., Garcia-Ruiz, J. M., Boldicke, T. and Nys, Y. (2001) Connect. Tissue Res., in press.Google Scholar, 13Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Panheleux M. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. McKee M.D. Nys Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A second group includes proteins such as osteopontin, which are also found in other calcified tissues such as bones and teeth (14Pines M. Knopov V. Bar A. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally, a third group of proteins comprises those specific to the uterine tissue and to the eggshell, which have only been observed in extracts of eggshell or its precursor milieu, the uterine fluid. Two such eggshell-specific proteins have so far been identified: ovocleidin-17 (OC-17) (16Hincke M.T. Tsang C.P. Courtney M. Hill V. Narbaitz R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 997-1007PubMed Google Scholar) and ovocleidin-116 (OC-116) (17Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Tsang C.P. McKee M.D. Nys Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32915-32923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Ovocleidin-116 corresponds to the core protein of an eggshell dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (29Carrino D.A. Rodriguez J.P. Caplan A.I. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other proteoglycans that are believed to influence eggshell mineralization include keratan sulfate proteoglycans, which are present at the site of mineral nucleation (30Arias, J. L., and Fernandez, S. (2000) Proceeding of the XXI World's Poultry Congress Montreal (Canada) (Hunton, P., ed) CD S3. 6.03, Word Poultry Science Association, Saskatoon, Canada.Google Scholar). Their protein moiety has not yet been characterized.In the current study, a new eggshell-specific matrix protein was identified with a molecular mass of 32 kDa. Significant levels of this protein were only observed in the uterine fluid collected during the active and terminal phases of shell deposition. Sequence determination of the protein and its corresponding cDNA indicated that it has not yet been characterized, and it is therefore termed OCX-32 (Latinovum (egg) and calyx (shell)). OCX-32 was purified in amounts sufficient for peptide sequencing after CNBr or lysyl endopeptidase fragmentation. The internal sequences thus obtained were used for data base searches and were instrumental in identifying overlapping ESTs that included all peptide sequences and apparently represented cDNA coding for the entire protein. Data base searching with the predicted protein sequence yielded two distinct mammalian proteins, each with ∼30% identity to OCX-32 after alignment (Fig.12). One of them is latexin, a carboxypeptidase inhibitor, the expression of which seems to be restricted to a subset of neurons and a few non-neural tissues, as, for instance, peritoneal mast cell, in the rat (31Hatanaka Y.

The other one is the putative translation product of tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1), a retinoic acid receptor-responsive gene of human skin (34Nagpal S. Patel S. Asano A.T. Johnson A.T. Duvic M.

In the present study, we have identified a novel MKP, designated MKP-7, and mapped it to human chromosome 12p12. MKP-7 possesses a long C-terminal stretch containing both a nuclear export signal and a nuclear localization signal, in addition to the rhodanese-like domain and the dual specificity phosphatase catalytic domain, both of which are conserved among MKP family members. When expressed in mammalian cells MKP-7 protein was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, but this localization became exclusively nuclear following leptomycin B treatment or introduction of a mutation in the nuclear export signal. These findings indicate that MKP-7 is the first identified leptomycin B-sensitive shuttle MKP. Forced expression of MKP-7 suppressed activation of MAPKs in COS-7 cells in the order of selectivity, JNK ≫ p38 > ERK. Furthermore, a mutant form MKP-7 functioned as a dominant negative particularly against the dephosphorylation of JNK, suggesting that MKP-7 works as a JNK-specific phosphatase in vivo.

MAPKs consist of three major subfamilies, extracellular signal kinases (MAPK/ERK), stress-activated kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and homologues of the budding yeast HOG1 protein (p38). For full activation of these MAPKs, phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues found in TXY motifs is required by dual specificity kinases, known as MAPK kinases. Thus dephosphorylation of the TXY motif is critical for negative regulation of MAPK activity (3Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases, DSPs, which dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues of TXY motifs, has been identified and termed MAPK phosphatases (MKPs). So far 10 MKPs have been identified, including MKP-1 (4Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

This gene family conserves a rhodanese-like domain, which is also known as a CDC25-like domain, as well as an active site motif required for DSP activity (18Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). MKPs differ in terms of substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and target gene regulation, all of which allow fine regulation of MKP by extracellular stimuli (19Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MKPs are potential negative regulators of MAPK cascades and as such are assumed to be involved in carcinogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. As a result, all human MKP genes have been mapped. Among them, MKP-2 and MKP-3are mapped to a gene locus encoding tumor suppressors for prostate and pancreatic cancer, respectively (20Furukawa T.

Activation/phosphorylation of MAPKs leads to their nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of certain DNA-binding proteins that contribute to transcriptional regulation. The mechanism of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of MAPKs is, however, not clear. Recent reports indicate that several different proteins contain an intrinsic nuclear export signal (NES) motif mediating their subcellular localization and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling through association with the export receptor, CRM1/exportin 1 (22Fornerod M.

Substitutions of crucial leucines in the NES motif with alanines caused nuclear accumulation of MEK1 and ERK (30Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). By screening an EST library, we identified a human cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the MKP family, MKP-7. Interestingly MKP-7 contains predicted functional motifs such as a nuclear export signal (NES) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs), suggesting that it functions as a shuttle protein and a MAPK phosphatase. In this report, the substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and regulation of MKP-7 are presented and discussed. By using the amino acid sequence of human MKP-4, we screened an expressed sequence tag data base, dbEST, and identified a novel MKP. A human clone (GenBankTM accession number AI274662, IMAGE clone ID 1986459) and a mouse clone (GenBankTM accession numberAA879894, IMAGE clone ID 1230637) had high sequence homology to human MKP-4. The human and mouse clones were obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL), and their nucleotide sequences were determined using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method on a 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with a Dynamic dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We performed 5′- and 3′-RACE using cDNA derived from Jurkat cells as template and primers based on the human clone. Nucleotide sequencing analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the PCR product are identical to those of clone AI 274662 with the presence of some polymorphism in 5′- and 3′-UTR regions (data not shown). The obtained PCR fragment had an ORF of 1995 base pairs. The mouse clone lacked the first ATG; therefore, 5′- and 3′-RACE using cerebellar mRNA was performed, resulting in a PCR fragment containing an ORF of 1980 base pairs. All RACE methods were performed with a SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNAs from various tissues of 6-week-old male mice were isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate extraction (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The RNAs were fractionated on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were hybridized with a32P-labeled 1.8-kb insert of mouse MKP-7 cDNA, which contains the full-length ORF. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 0.65 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min, followed by sequential washes with 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, each for 15 min. The filters were exposed to an x-ray film using an intensifying screen at −80 °C. To construct pEGFP-MKP-7, the coding region of human MKP-7 cDNA was amplified by PCR to introduce a BglII site on the 5′ end and aSalI site on the 3′ end using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated to BglII andSalI-digested pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) in frame with the EGFP-coding sequence. To construct pFLAG-MKP-7, the same region was amplified by PCR to introduce a NotI site on the 5′ end and a SalI site on the 3′ end using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase and ligated to NotI- andSalI-digested pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma) in frame with the FLAG epitope sequence. Several constructs encoding MKP-7 mutant proteins, including DA (D213A), CS (C244S), delC1 (residues 1–290), delC2 (residues 1–370), delC3 (residues 1–604), LA (L380A, L383A, and L385A), delR (residues 162–665), and delR-LA (residues 162–665 of LA), were constructed by PCR and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). The final PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (CLONTECH) and sequenced. No substitution was found except for the targeted mutation. HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-MKP-7 (wild type or mutant constructs) together with SRα-HA-ERK2, SRα-HA-JNK1, or pMT3-HA-p38α. For transient assays, cells were transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were maintained with or without serum for 18 h and then stimulated with either 5 ng/ml PMA for 10 min for ERK2 activation or with 0.4 m sorbitol for 30 min for JNK1 and p38α activation. Twenty four hours after transfection, HeLa cells were maintained without serum for 18 h and then treated with 5 nm LMB (provided by Dr. M. Yoshida) for the indicated periods. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in MAPK lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min. Each sample (50 µg of protein) was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylation status of activated MAPKs was monitored by an anti-phospho-ERK antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), an anti-ACTIVE JNK antibody (Promega, Madison, WI), or an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The expression level of HA-tagged MAPKs and FLAG-tagged MKP-7 variants was monitored by anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed on a plate (300 µl/60-mm plate) in co-IP buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were measured as above. The supernatant (500 µg) was incubated with 2 µg of mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody and 15 µl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been equilibrated with the co-IP buffer in a 500-µl tube. After 1 h rotation at 4 °C, the beads were washed 5 times with 500 µl of the co-IP buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 µl of 1 × Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins were detected by the respective antibodies using ECL reagents. HeLa cells on coverslips coated with Vitrogen 100 (Collagen Biochemical, Palo Alto, CA) were transfected with wild type or mutant forms of pFLAG-MKP-7. Transfected cells were fixed in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After incubation in PBS containing 3% BSA (PBS-B) for 2 h, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (provided from Dr. K. Yamashita) to detect FLAG-tagged proteins and an anti-HA (12C5) antibody to detect HA-tagged proteins in PBS-B overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H + L) antibody (Chemicon International), fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.), or AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (highly cross-absorbed) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS-B. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted with PBS containing 90% glycerol. Fluorescence signals were visualized by a fluorescence microscope. To search for novel MKPs, we screened a human dbEST using the amino acid sequence of human MKP-4 as a probe. This clone (GenBankTM accession numberAI274662, IMAGE clone ID 1986459) also showed high sequence homology to human MKP-4. The nucleotide sequence of this clone was determined, and then 5′-RACE was performed to identify the first methionine codon and sequences of the 5′-UTR region. The full-length clone was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using mRNA from Jurkat cells. The nucleotide sequences were verified by comparing three independent clones (Fig. 1). The open reading frame (ORF) of this cDNA was predicted to encode 665 amino acids. A dual specificity phosphatase (DSP) catalytic site motif, VXVHCXAGXSRSXTXXXAYXM, which is essential for phosphatase activity, was found in this clone (32Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A MAPK-docking motif composed of a kinase-interacting motif (33Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) at residues 51–65 and δ-like domain (34Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

Since this ORF contains these two essential sequences, we designated the clone a new member of MKP gene family (Fig. 1). To date, 6 species among 12 DSPs have been designated MKP-1 to MKP-6 based on their structural similarity and substrate specificity toward MAPKs. Following this nomenclature, we named our novel DSP MKP-7 (Fig. 1). MKP-7 exhibits several other predicted functional motifs. Two bipartite NLS motifs (37Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) were located at amino acid residues 296–313 (NLS1) and 610–627 (NLS2). One leucine-rich NES motif was located at amino acid residues 376–385. The presence of a NES as well as an NLS suggested that MKP-7 acts as a shuttle protein. PEST sequences, which are thought to be involved in rapid degradation through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (38Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar), were found at residues 332–353 and 441–462 residues. The presence of these motifs suggested that a C-terminal stretch of MKP-7 is important for localization and stability of the protein. To obtain the mouse homologue, we screened mouse dbESTs and found one clone (GenBankTM accession number AA879894, IMAGE clone ID 1230637) that had high sequence homology to human MKP-7 but lacked the 5′-half of the ORF. We obtained a full-length cDNA clone by RACE using mouse cerebellum RNA as a template. The nucleotide sequence was verified using three independent reverse transcriptase-PCR fragments covering the entire ORF of mouse MKP-7. In Fig.2A the deduced amino acid of mouse MKP-7 (lower line) is aligned with human MKP-7 (upper line). The identity between mouse and human MKP-7 is 90.4% at the amino acid level. MKP-7 appears to be composed of three domains. Domain 1 is a rhodanese-like domain that contains two CH2 domains and a kinase-interacting motif. Domain 2 is a DSP catalytic domain that contains δ-like domain and catalytic motif, and domain 3 is a long C-terminal stretch. Domains 1 and 2 are highly conserved between human and mouse MKP-7s. The alignment of domain structures of MKP-7 with those of other MKPs is shown in Fig. 2B. MKP-7 has similar domain structures and the highest sequence similarity to hVH5. The similarities between human MKP-7 and hVH5 are 76.1, 59.6, and 30.5% in the DSP domain, rhodanese-like domain, and C-terminal stretch, respectively. The location of the MKP-7 gene on human chromosomes was determined by the identification of MKP-7 cDNA between two sequence-tagged site markers, G24001 and G41293, in Homo sapiens 12p BAC RP11-253I19 (GenBankTM accession number AC007619.22). This gene was localized to human chromosome 12p12 as shown in Fig. 3A. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the MKP-7 genomic clone with the cDNA, the MKP-7 gene was shown to be composed of at least seven exons (Fig. 3B). The catalytic core and C-terminal stretch were each encoded on a single exon, whereas the rhodanese-like domain was contained on three exons. Since the 5′-UTR sequence did not match any sequences in the NCBI data base or others, we did not identify the promoter region ofMKP-7. Theoretically, DSPs have tumor suppressor activity. The Recurrent Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer Data base searcher (www.cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Recurrent Aberrations) showed that chromosome 12p12 is a region where deletions often occur in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome, suggesting that tumor suppressor genes for leukemia lie within this region. The expression pattern of MKP-7 mRNA in mouse tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis using mouse MKP-7 cDNA containing the entire ORF as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4, two mRNA species of 4.1 kb as a major transcript and 2.1 kb as a minor transcript were detected. The 4.1-kb transcript was abundantly expressed in the brain, kidney, intestine, and testis but expressed at low levels in the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. The 2.1-kb transcript was detected only in the testis. To determine the substrate specificity of MKP-7 as a MAPK phosphatase, we analyzed the effect of MKP-7 on activation of HA-ERK2, HA-JNK1, or HA-p38α in vivo (Fig. 5). An inhibitory effect of MKP-7 on HA-JNK1 activation was substantial (Fig.5B). Co-transfection of 0.06 µg of MKP-7 expression plasmid reduced the level of HA-JNK1 activation to an unstimulated level (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3–6), and further inactivation was obtained in a dose-dependent manner, to trace levels (Fig. 5B, lanes 6–9). HA-p38α was also inactivated by MKP-7, although the effect was not as substantial (Fig.5C). Co-transfection with 0.6 µg of MKP-7 expression plasmid was required to reach the basal level of HA-p38α activation (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 3–8). In contrast, HA-ERK2 was not inactivated by MKP-7 (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–9). In order to analyze specificity further, we used two types of catalytically inactive proteins with mutations in conserved residues, MKP-7-CS (C244S) and MKP-7-DA (D213A). Both mutant proteins significantly enhanced phosphorylation of HA-JNK1 but had little effect on activation of HA-ERK2 and HA-p38α (Fig. 5B, lanes 10and 11), indicating that both mutant proteins function as dominant negatives toward JNK. Under the same conditions, MKP-5 inactivated JNK1 and p38α more strongly than ERK2, as reported (Fig.5, A–C, lane 12, and Refs. 11Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar and 12Theodosiou A. Smith A. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S. Ashworth A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6981-6988Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, MKP-7 blocked activation of MAP kinases in the order of selectivity, JNK1 ≫ p38α > ERK2. Since MKP-7 inactivated JNK1 and p38α in vivo, we asked whether MKP-7 binds MAPKs in vivo. We tested an in vivointeraction between MKP-7 and MAPKs by co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether MKP-7 has a binding preference among MAPKs and, if a direct interaction occurs, whether MAPKs must be phosphorylated for that interaction. FLAG-MKP-7 and HA-MAPKs (either HA-ERK2, HA-JNK1, or HA-p38α) were co-expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.6A). As expected, HA-JNK1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-MKP7 (Fig. 6A, lanes 10–13); however, stimulation did not affect this interaction (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 12 and 13). The interaction was observed even under culture conditions lacking starvation or stimuli (Fig. 6A, lane 10). When we expressed FLAG-MKP-7DA, an inactive mutant, interaction of FLAG-MKP-7DA and HA-JNK1 was similar to that of FLAG-MKP-7 and HA-JNK1 (data not shown), suggesting that MKP-7 binds the dephosphorylated as well as the phosphorylated protein. It should be noted that MKP-7 binds not only JNK1 but also ERK2 and p38α. Under standard conditions, we did not observe any binding preference of MKP-7 toward a specific MAPK. Under these conditions, the MAPK binding specificity of MKP-5 (Fig.6B) and MKP-2 (data not shown) was confirmed as already reported (11Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X. Gorospe M. Davis R.J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29440-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which excludes a possibility that the binding of MKP-7 and MAPKs is due to be artificial by overexpression. Taken together, we conclude that MKP-7 interacts with ERK2 and p38α as well as JNK1 with similar preference in vivo and that such interaction does not depend on the phosphorylation state of MAPKs. Since MKP-7 interacts with ERK2, p38α, and JNK1 under all conditions examined (Fig. 6), we further tested the effect of MKP-7-inactive mutants CS and DA on the phosphorylation state of MAPKs under unstimulated conditions (Fig.7). Expression levels of either FLAG-MKP-7 proteins or HA-MAPKs were similar in each lane (data not shown). A dominant negative effect against dephosphorylation of JNK was observed even in unstimulated cells (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and7). A similar effect was observed for ERK (Fig. 7A, lanes 5 and 7) but not for p38α (Fig. 7C, lanes 5 and 7). Next we examined those effects under conditions lacking starvation or stimulation (Fig. 7, D–F). Accumulation of phosphorylated forms of ERK2 and JNK1 was evident (Fig. 7, D andE, lanes 5 and 7) but that of p38α was not (Fig. 7F, lanes 5 and 7). These results suggest that MKP-7 may block ERK and JNK phosphorylation/activation when cells are unstimulated. In order to understand the function of MKP-7, we investigated the subcellular localization of MKP-7. The localization of EGFP-MKP-7 in HeLa cells is shown in Fig.8A. The control EGFP protein was distributed evenly in transfected cells, whereas EGFP-MKP-7 was specifically localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8A, a andc). In a separate experiment, we used FLAG-tagged MKP-7 to ensure that localization of MKP-7 to the cytoplasm was not an artifactual result of the green fluorescent protein domain being fused to the phosphatase (Fig. 8A, e). We examined the subcellular distribution of FLAG-MKP-7 in several cell lines, including COS-7, NIH3T3, and 293 cells. FLAG-MKP-7 was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of all these cell lines (data not shown). To determine whether the predicted NES is functional, we examined the effect of LMB on distribution of FLAG-MKP-"
https://openalex.org/W1489656307,"Synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), a key regulated enzyme in the pathway of polyamine biosynthesis, is feedback-controlled at the level of translation by spermidine and spermine. The peptide product of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the mRNA is solely responsible for polyamine regulation of AdoMetDC translation. Using a primer extension inhibition assay and in vitro protein synthesis reactions, we found ribosomes paused at or close to the termination codon of the uORF. This pause was greatly diminished with the altered uORFs' sequences that abolish uORF regulation in vivo. The half-life of the ribosome pause was related to the concentration of polyamines present but was unaffected by magnesium concentration. Furthermore, inhibition of translation initiation at a reporter gene placed downstream of the AdoMetDC uORF directly correlated with the stability of the ribosome pause at the uORF. These observations are consistent with a model in which regulation of ribosome pausing at the uORF by polyamines controls ribosome access to the downstream AdoMetDC reading frame."

This suggests amide protein modifications as important markers of pathophysiological processes. advanced glycation end product N ε-carboxymethyllysine 1,3-bis(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)imidazolium salt pyridoxamine bovine serum albumin N 6-{2-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}lysine N 6-glycoloyllysine [(3-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amino]acetic acid aminoguanidine high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry heptafluorobutyric acid butoxycarbonyl 2-ammonio-6-([2-[(4-ammonio-5-oxido-5- oxopentyl)amino]-4,5-dihydro-1 H-imidazol-5-ylidene]amino)hexanoate 2-ammonio-6-([2-[(4-ammonio-5-oxido-5-oxopentyl)amino]-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1 H-imidazol-5-ylidene]amino)hexanoate N,N(-di(N ε-lysino))-4-methyl-imidazolium (methylglyoxal-lysine dimer) thin-layer chromatography room temperature The Maillard reaction, or nonenzymatic browning, occurs in vivo and contributes to the late complications of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and aging. Model reaction systems show that reducing sugars, such as glucose, can react with proteins or other amine structures via highly reactive intermediates in complex reaction cascades. A variety of stable end products, known as advanced glycation end products, or AGEs,1 form as a result (1Ledl F. Schleicher E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1990; 29: 565-594Crossref Scopus (684) Google Scholar). However, the few AGEs identified in vivocannot account for the extensive protein modifications found in target tissues (2Monnier V.M. Nagaraj R.H. Potero-Otin M. Glomb M.A. Elgawish A.H. Sell D.R. Friedlander M.A. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1996; 11: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Monnier V.M. Glomb M.A. Elgawish A. Sell D.R. Diabetes. 1996; 45 Suppl. 3: 67-72Crossref Google Scholar). Since AGEs are recognized by cellular receptors, they can also damage tissues by triggering the production of reactive oxygen species (4Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wautier J.-L. Stern S. Aterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of AGE structures and mechanisms of their formation will aid in the development of pharmaceutical strategies to prevent AGE-associated complications. Both α-dicarbonyl structures and oxidative radical mechanisms are thought to play an important role within the Maillard reaction (5Wolff S.P. Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 6Fu M.-X. Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 42-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen radical reactions are directly coupled to the cross-linking of proteins and to the formation of AGEs such as N ε-carboxymethyllysine (CML). They are catalyzed by transition metal ions and can be inhibited by chelating agents. CML, the most prevalent AGE identified in vivo, is the major antigen recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against glycated proteins (7Reddy S. Bichler J. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). CML concentrations in collagen increase with age along with an overall increase in fluorescence, but CML concentrations rise markedly in diabetes. However, discrepancies between the extent of protein modification and fluorescence suggest that not all cross-linking modifications are due to colored, ultraviolet- or fluorescence-active structures. Thus, pentosidine, crosslines, and vesperlysine A, all of which are modifiers of proteins in vivo (8Sell D.R. Lapolla A. Odetti P. Fogarty J. Monnier V.M.

Several laboratories have attempted to define the structures of potential cross-link moieties. Eble et al. (11Eble A.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 285: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) found that radioactive labeled N α-formyllysine was bound covalently to glycated proteins only under oxidative conditions. Major quantities of lysine were released by acid and alkaline hydrolysis; this reaction could not be inhibited by prior reduction with sodium borohydride. Thus, the acid-stable imidazolium cross-links derived from the reaction of lysine with glyoxal and methylglyoxal (1,3-bis(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)imidazolium salt (GOLD), MOLD/imidazolysine; Refs. 12Odani H.

Lederer et al. (14Lederer M.O. Bühler H.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) incubated bovine serum albumin (BSA) with glucose under physiological conditions and reported the alternative structures GODIC, MODIC, and glucosepan. These imidazole ring-based structures cross-link protein-bound arginine and lysine residues, but they can be analyzed only after enzymatic hydrolysis because of their structural instability. Amides are novel AGEs that, like other known AGEs, result in protein cross-linking. Once we were able to synthesize GOLA or glyoxal-lysine-amide (N 6-{2-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}lysine) and GALA or glycolic acid-lysine-amide (N 6-glycoloyllysine) independently, we developed a means to detect them in modified proteins. We then confirmed their formation from physiological important sugars and showed that the underlying mechanisms were linked directly to CML. Our identification of GOLA in human lens proteins shows that these amides can form in human tissue proteins. We measured formation of GOLD in all incubations to determine the potential significance of GOLA and GALA for in vivo systems. Our experiments also explored the actions of aminoguanidine (AG) and pyridoxamine (PM), both of which are inhibitors of advanced glycation reactions in vivo (15Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Chemicals of the highest quality available were obtained from Aldrich, Sigma, and Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany) unless otherwise indicated. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Visualization of separated material was achieved with ninhydrin unless otherwise indicated.

CMPM was synthesized according to Lustenberger et al. (18Lustenberger N. Lange H.-W. Hempel K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1972; 84: 255-257Crossref Google Scholar) with major modifications. A solution of 879 mg (4.32 mmol) of pyridoxal in 2 ml of H2O was adjusted to pH 9.3 and then added to a solution of 389 mg (5.18 mmol) of glycine in 2 ml of phosphate buffer (0.5 m, pH 9.3). After 1 h of stirring at 4 °C, 3 ml of a NaBH4 solution (100 mg/ml 0.1 n NaOH) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at RT. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 with HCl, and the solvents were evaporated. The residue was subjected to column chromatography (Lobar RP-18, H2O). Material with a Rfvalue of 0.45 (TLC; n-butanol/H2O/pyridine/HOAc, 4:2:3:3, v/v) was combined, and solvents were evaporated to yield CMPM as colorless crystals (899 mg, 92%). ESI-MS: m/z227 [M + 1]+; 1H NMR (D2O):δ (ppm) 2.15 (s, 3 H), 3.33 (s, 2 H), 4.08 (s, 2 H), 4.39 (s, 2 H), 7.34 (s, 1 H); 13C NMR (D2O):δ (ppm) 17.19, 44.41, 48.65, 59.39, 127.16, 129.81, 133.71, 148.33, 160.97, 172.68. 197 mg (0.8 mmol) of N α-t-Boc-lysine was dissolved in 4 ml of H2O, and 232 μl (2.0 mmol) of glyoxal solution (40%) and 160 μl (2.0 mmol) of formaldehyde solution (37%) were added. The reaction mixture was heated for 24 h at 50 °C. After cooling, 4 ml of 6 n HCl were added, and the solution was stirred for 30 min at RT. Solvents were then completely removed in a vacuum concentrator, and the resulting residue was subjected to column chromatography (Lobar RP-18; heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) eluents, 35% solvent B as described below). Fractions with material having a Rf value of 0.13 (TLC;n-butanol/H2O/pyridine/HOAc, 4:2:3:3, v/v) were combined and immediately subjected to ion exchange chromatography (Dowex 50WX4–400, H+ form). The column was first flushed with water, and the target material was then eluted with 3n HCl. Solvents were evaporated, and the residue was freeze-dried to yield GOLD as a colorless amorphic material (56 mg, 31%; GOLD × 3HCl based on elemental analysis; spectroscopic data compliant with the literature (19Wells-Knecht K.J. Brinkmann E. Baynes J.W. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 6246-6247Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar)). In general, incubations were conducted in 0.2 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, after sterile filtration in a shaker incubator (New Brunswick Scientific, Nürtingen, Germany) at 37 °C. Reactant concentrations are given in the respective legends to figures and tables. Deaerated conditions were achieved in the presence of 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and by gassing with argon. The workup for reaction mixtures with N α-t-Boc-lysine was as follows. 25 μl of a NaBH4 solution (84.6 mg/ml 0.01 nNaOH) were added to 250-μl aliquots of incubations. After 1 h at RT, 2 ml of 3 n HCl were added. Solvents were removed after 30 min in a vacuum concentrator (Savant-Speed-Vac Plus SC 110 A combined with a Vapor Trap RVT 400, Life Sciences International, Frankfurt, Germany). The residue was taken up in H2O to appropriate concentrations for final high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. For analysis of CMPM, incubations were directly diluted without reduction and acid treatment. The workup for protein incubations was as follows. Incubations were dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then subjected to acid or enzymatic hydrolysis before HPLC analysis. The protein content after dialysis was measured by Coomassie blue staining using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with BSA as standard. 3-mg aliquots of protein were dried, dissolved in 2 ml of 6n HCl, and heated for 20 h at 110 °C under argon. Volatiles were removed in a vacuum concentrator, and the residue was diluted with H2O to concentrations appropriate for HPLC analysis. 3-mg aliquots of protein were diluted to 1 ml with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with the following enzymes: proteinase K (Sigma catalog no. P6556), carboxypeptidase Y (Sigma catalog no. C3888), peptidase (Sigma catalog no. P7500), Pronase E (Sigma catalog no. P5147), and aminopeptidase (Sigma catalog no. L6007). The enzymes were applied stepwise, and incubations with each were for 24 h at 37 °C in a shaker incubator. Specific combinations and concentrations are given in the legend to Table III. In general, a small crystal of thymol was added with the first digestion step. Once the total digestion procedure was completed, reaction mixtures were filtered through molecular weight cut-off 5000 filters (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and diluted with H2O to concentrations appropriate for HPLC analysis.

Chromatographic separations were performed on stainless steel columns (VYDAC 218TP54, 250 × 4.6 mm, RP18, 5 μm, Hesperia; Knauer Eurospher 100, 250 × 4.6 mm, RP18, 5 μm, Knauer, Berlin, Germany) using a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For the detection of CML, GOLA, and GOLD, the VYDAC column was used with the mobile phase consisting of water (solvent A) and MeOH/water (7:3, v/v; solvent B). 1.2 ml/liter HFBA was added to both solvents A and B. A postcolumn derivatization reagent was added at 0.5 ml/min prior to the detector. This reagent consisted of 0.8 g of o-phthaldialdehyde, 24.7 g of boric acid, 2 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 g of Brij 35 in 1 liter of H2O adjusted to pH 9.8 with KOH. The effluent was monitored at 340 nm (excitation)/455 nm (emission). The gradient for CML was as follows: 0–15 min, 2% solvent B isocratic; 15–20 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min. The gradient for GOLA and GOLD was as follows: 0–115 min, 6% solvent B isocratic; 115–120 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min. For CMPM, the VYDAC column was used with the above HFBA solvents but without postcolumn derivatization. The effluent was monitored at 328 nm (excitation)/395 nm (emission). The gradient for CMPM was as follows: 0–15 min, 5% solvent B isocratic; 15–25 min, linear gradient to 30% solvent B; 25–30 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min. For GALA, a 2-stage HPLC system with final precolumn derivatization was used. First, material was collected from the VYDAC column with the above HFBA solvents but without postcolumn derivatization (tR 6.6–9.3 min). The gradient was the same as for CML. Solvents were evaporated in a vacuum concentrator, and to the resulting residue 10 μl of the above postcolumn reagent were added and vigorously mixed. After 2 min 190 μl of phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.6) were added, and the solution was mixed and immediately subjected to the second HPLC system. The Knauer column was used with the mobile phase consisting of H2O/MeOH (9:1, v/v, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; solvent A) and H2O/MeOH (2:8, v/v; solvent B). The gradient was as follows: 0–45 min, 22% solvent B isocratic; 45–50 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min. The effluent was monitored at 340 nm (excitation)/455 nm (emission). For the detection of GOLD the postcolumn derivatization system described above was used. For the detection of GOLA a two-stage HPLC system was used. Material was first collected from the VYDAC column with the above HFBA solvents and gradient (tR 69–86 min) but without postcolumn derivatization. Solvents were evaporated in a vacuum concentrator, and the resulting residue was reconstituted in H2O and subjected to the second HPLC system using the above postcolumn derivatization. The Knauer column was used with the mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer (1.13 g of NaH2PO4 × 2H2O/liter, pH 4.0, solvent A) and propanol/water (6:4, v/v, 1.0 g of NaH2PO4 × 2H2O/liter, pH 4.0, solvent B). To both solvents A and B, 3 g of sodium dodecylsulfate/liter were added. The gradient was as follows: 0–50 min, linear gradient 20–40% solvent B; 50–55 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min. Water-insoluble protein was obtained from the laboratory of R. H. Nagaraj (prepared according to Ref. 20Padayatti P.S. Ng A.S. Uchida K. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1299-1304PubMed Google Scholar) and enzymatically hydrolyzed following protocol C (TableIII). For detection of GOLA, a two-stage HPLC system was used. First, material was repeatedly collected from the VYDAC column with the above HFBA solvent and gradient (tR 69–86 min) without postcolumn derivatization. Solvents of combined fractions were evaporated in a vacuum concentrator, and the resulting residue was then reconstituted in H2O and subjected to the second HPLC system using the above precolumn derivatization. The Knauer column was used with the same mobile phase as for GALA. The gradient was as follows: 0–60 min, 43% solvent B isocratic; 60–65 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min. For low resolution ESI-MS and coupled HPLC/ESI-MS, an HP-MS engine (Agilent Technologies, Hamburg, Germany) connected to the above Jasco HPLC system was used. Target material was first enriched by repeated collection from the above HFBA/VYDAC HPLC system and was then reinjected on a Knauer Eurospher 100 column (100 × 2.0 mm, RP18, 5 μm; the above HFBA eluents; flow rate: 0.15 ml/min; gradient: 0–30 min, linear gradient from 5 to 30% solvent B; 30–35 min, linear gradient to 100% solvent B; hold for 10 min). For accurate mass determination of amino acid modifications (21Tyler A.N. Clayton E. Green B.N. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a Micromass (Manchester, UK) VG platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface was used (ESI+; source temperature, 80 °C; capillary, 3.0 kV; cone voltage, 25 V). The data were collected in the multichannel acquisition mode with 128 channels per m/z unit using 13 scans (5 s) with a 0.2-s reset time. The resolution was 650 (10% valley definition). The sample was dissolved for analysis in water/MeCN (1:1) containing polyethylene glycol 200 (4 μg/ml) as a reference material, ammonium formate (0.1%), and formic acid (0.5%); the sample concentration was similar to that of polyethylen"

These systems consist of a histidine kinase that acts as the sensor of environmental stimuli and a response regulator that mediates the cellular response, generally at the level of transcriptional control (1Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). As with many signaling pathways, protein phosphorylation is used as a means to transmit information; however, unlike the majority of phosphoproteins found in higher eukaryotes, in which tyrosine, serine, or threonine serve as the substrate for phosphorylation, histidine kinases autophosphorylate a histidine residue from which the phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to a conserved aspartate residue in the response regulator. The catalytic mechanism is reasonably well understood for aspartyl phosphorylation, while far less is known about the autokinase reaction. This lack of information is due in part to the relative scarcity of detailed structural information for the histidine kinases. Recently, structural information has become available for the CheA (2Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 3Bilwes A.M. Quezada C.M. Croal L.R. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 4: 353-360Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and EnvZ (4Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M.T. Nature. 1998; 386: 88-92Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar) histidine kinases. These structures reveal that the catalytic ATP-binding domain is an autonomously folding α/β-sandwich that shares structural homology with a family of ATPases that include Hsp90, DNA gyrase B, and MutL (5Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Although these structures provide some insight into function, they have not allowed the assignment of catalytic residues. Here we describe the 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the PhoQ histidine kinase complexed with an AMPPNP1nucleotide. PhoQ is a transmembrane histidine kinase that is involved in Mg2+ homeostasis and/or pathogenesis of a number of Gram-negative bacteria (for review see Ref. 6Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). PhoQ responds to limiting concentrations of extracellular Mg2+ by increasing the net phosphorylation of the PhoP transcriptional response-regulator. The cytoplasmic portion of PhoQ consists of independently folded phosphotransfer and ATP-binding catalytic domains. The high degree of resolution reveals a detailed view of the nucleotide-binding site that provides new insights into catalytic mechanism. The plasmids used for expression of the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain (residues 219–486, which contains the phosphotransfer and catalytic domains) and the PhoQ catalytic domain (residues 331–486) were constructed as follows. For the cytoplasmic domain, DNA corresponding to codons 219–486 was PCR-amplified from plasmid pLPQ2 (7Waldburger C.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26630-26636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which contains a full-length copy of thephoQ gene, cut with NdeI and EcoRI (synthetic sites were introduced in the PCR primers), and cloned into the NdeI-EcoRI backbone of pAED4 (8Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pAED4QTR, has an initiating ATG codon (at the synthetic NdeI site) fused to codon 219 of phoQand all of the remainder of the gene including the native translational termination codon. In this plasmid, expression of the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain is controlled by a plasmid-borne T7 φ10 promoter and ribosome binding site. Variants of pAED4QTR were constructed in which the Lys-392, Arg-434, or Arg-439 codons were independently replaced with alanine codons. These mutant genes were constructed by encoding the mutant codon in a PCR primer that also contained a nearby unique restriction site, PCR-amplifying a portion of the gene, and cloning the mutated PCR product into the pAED4QTR plasmid. The phoQcatalytic domain was cloned into pAED4 as described above for the cytoplasmic domain, except a primer that fuses an initiating ATG codon to and amplifies DNA from codon 331 of phoQ was used. In the resulting plasmid, pAED4QKD, expression of the C-terminal PhoQ catalytic domain (residues 331–486) was controlled by the T7 φ10 promoter and ribosome binding site. Details of plasmid construction are available upon request. The PhoQ cytoplasmic domain (residues 219–486) was purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21 containing pAED4QTR (or variants with alanine substitutions at residues 392, 434, or 439) that had been treated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression of the protein. Cells were harvested, lysed by sonication, and the debris was removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added (15% w/v), and following centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. This solution was loaded onto a MonoQ anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a gradient from 50 mm to 0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain (as assayed by gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining) were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. This solution was loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted in 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing the cytoplasmic domain were pooled and judged to be greater than 95% pure, as assessed by gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. The PhoQ catalytic domain (residues 331–486) was purified from E. coli strain BL21 containing pAED4QKD as described above for the cytoplasmic domain with the following exception. Following removal of cellular debris, 20% ammonium sulfate (w/v) was added and the precipitate removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant to 35% (w/v) and the protein pelleted and purified as for the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain. Selenomethionine-containing protein was produced by a nonauxotrophic protocol (9Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) and purified as following the same protocol. Protein concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 9576 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm for the cytoplasmic domain based on the presence of 8 tyrosines in the sequence and 4788m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for the catalytic domain based on the presence of 4 tyrosines in the sequence (10Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 1. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1975: 187-188Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at 22 °C in 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2. [γ-32P]ATP (3.5–7.0 µCi at >5000 Ci/mmol) and varying amounts of non-labeled ATP (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 µm) were incubated with 1–2 µm PhoQ cytoplasmic domain in a 35-µl volume, and the autophosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed. Aliquots were removed and the reaction stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to gel electrophoresis to separate the protein from free nucleotide, and phosphorylated protein was quantitated by phosphorimaging. The rate of protein phosphorylation was calculated for each ATP concentration and plotted versusrate/free [ATP] (Eadie-Hofstee plot). Km (− slope) and Vmax (y axis intercept) were derived from the plots, and kcat was calculated as Vmax/[enzyme]. Although the autokinase reaction does not strictly follow Michaelis-Menten steady state kinetics because phosphorylation of the protein effectively reduces the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, we believe that the derived parameters are still useful in comparing mutant and wild type variants. The reaction can be assumed to be near steady state since the amount of phosphorylated protein was always less than 5% of the total. Crystallization was carried out at 4 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The protein concentration was 10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) 100 mm NaCl. Native and selenomethionine-containing kinase domain crystals were obtained in 1 week after mixing the protein and reservoir buffer (100 mmcacodylate (pH 6.5), 20–24% polyethylene glycol 1500, 100–200 mm magnesium acetate) in a 1:1 ratio. Crystals were in space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 43.5 Å, b = 45.0 Å,c = 71.8 Å. Heavy atom derivatives were generated by soaking crystals in reservoir solution plus 10 mmHgCl2 (36 h), 2 mm lead acetate (96 h), or 5 mm K2PtCl4 (144 h). For cryo experiments, crystals were transferred to 35% polyethylene glycol 1500, 7.5% ethylene glycol, 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 150 mm magnesium acetate for 1–2 min and flash-frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen Oxford Cryosystem. All x-ray data sets were collected at 100 K in-house on a Mar345 image plate detector, using a Rigaku RTP300 rotating-anode x-ray generator and at the NSLS Beamline X4A on a CCD Quantum 4 detector. The diffraction data were processed and reduced with Denzo and Scalepack (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by combination of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) and multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) data. Coordinates of 2 selenium atoms (out of three possible positions) were located from the MAD data using MADSYS (12Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and SOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) programs. The calculated electron density map showed a clear solvent boundary but not secondary structural elements. The phases derived from MAD data were used to locate the heavy atom positions in difference Fourier maps. MAD and MIR data were combined, and atom parameters were refined using isomorphous and anomalous differences, with the maximum likelihood method incorporated in MLPHARE (14Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The resultant phases to 2.75 Å were further improved by solvent flattening, and the resolution was extended to 1.6 Å using DM (14Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The consequent map was interpretable showing several secondary structure features. The initial model, containing 120 of the 156 residues, was built using the ARP/wARP program (15Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Combining the partial structure phases with experimental phases allowed manual tracing of the remaining residues with the program O (16Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Three N-terminal and the five C-terminal residues are missing from the final structure. The model was subjected to interactive cycles of manual rebuilding and conjugated gradient minimization, simulated annealing, and individual B-factor refinement using the programs O and CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Both anisotropicB-factor and bulk solvent corrections were applied. A molecule of AMPPNP, one Mg cation, and 189 water molecules were located during the refinement. Eleven residues present double conformation (residues 345, 348, 349, 351, 370, 371, 407, 414, 425, 465, and 471) in the final model. Stereochemistry checks indicate that the refined model is in quite good agreement with expectations for models within this resolution range (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics for the final model are given in Table I.

Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar). Structures were superimposed based on α-carbon atoms alone, and only atom pairs identified as equivalent were used for r.m.s. deviation calculations. The least-squares superimpositions were calculated using LSQMAN (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The overall best fits between the structures were determined using the “Brute” option in the program with a cut-off distance criterion of 3.5 Å and a minimum fragment length of three consecutive residues. The coordinates were taken from the Protein Data Bank with entry codes:CheA-KD, 1b3q (2Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I.

The multiple alignments of each protein with their respective families were taken from Pfam data base (Ref. 24Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L.L.

The crystal structure of the C-terminal PhoQ catalytic domain (residues 331–486) complexed with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, was solved by combining experimental phases from MIR with phases from MAD, and this structure was refined at 1.6-Å resolution (TableI). The structure as shown in Fig.1A is a two-layer α/β sandwich fold composed of a flat, mixed, five-stranded β sheet and three α helices (from left to right: βB, βD, βG, βF, and βE, and α1, α2 and α3, respectively), with dimensions 35 × 50 × 35 Å (Fig. 1). There is a deep cavity in one end where the AMPPNP molecule is localized, and the opposite end is closed by a small antiparallel β-sheet formed by the βA and βC strands. In the final model, segments at the N terminus (residues 331–335) and the C terminus (residues 481–486) are disordered and extend into the solvent. The region comprising residues 433–439 has highB-factors (51.4 Å2 on average) compared with the average for the protein (23.4 Å2), indicating an intrinsic flexibility. Nevertheless, the electron density is sufficiently well defined to trace the region (Fig. 1C). This flexible loop is part of a long polypeptide segment that extends away from the rest of the molecule and has been termed the ATP-lid in the homologous EnvZ and CheA proteins (5Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The proximity of this region to the bound AMPPNP molecule and the flexibility indicated by highB-factors suggest important roles in ATP binding and interactions with the phosphorylation site in the histidine phosphotransfer domain (see below). The detailed three-dimensional structure of the homologous kinase domains of CheA and EnvZ has been reported previously (2Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I.

Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M.T. Nature. 1998; 386: 88-92Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The structure of PhoQ-KD is shown with the crystal structure of theThermotoga maritima CheA kinase domain (2.6-Å resolution) and with the NMR structure of the E. coli EnvZ kinase domain (complexed with AMPPNP) in Fig.2B and an alignment of the amino acid sequences based on the superimposition of the structural elements is shown in Fig. 2A. CheA-KD, which is longer than the two other kinase domain (189 residues compared with 156 and 160 residues, respectively, in PhoQ-KD and EnvZ-KD), possesses two extra α helices, one between α2 and βD, and another before the ATP-lid loop (Fig. 2). Roughly 70% of the superimposed residues are identical for all three proteins and these primarily cluster in the N, G1, F, and G2 boxes that have been classically defined in alignments of the histidine kinase superfamily (25Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-52Google Scholar) and in the recently defined G3 box (5Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The remaining identical residues are mostly hydrophobic in character and are distributed between all of the structural elements where they generally participate in forming the core of the molecule (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the r.m.s. deviation between the backbone α-carbon atoms of the PhoQ-KD and CheA-KD models is lower (1.62 Å) than the r.m.s. deviation between the backbone traces of the more closely related (by sequence and structural organization) PhoQ-KD and EnvZ-KD proteins (1.84 Å). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the greater deviation from the EnvZ-KD is genuine, it seems more likely that this may result of ambiguities in the overlaid NMR structures. Consequently, detailed structural comparisons were carried out with the CheA-KD structure. Besides the two additional helices in CheA-KD, the principal structural difference between them is the conformations of the high flexibly loop of the ATP-lid (Figs.2B and 3). ATP-lid mobility is facilitated by the presence of three conserved glycine residues (441, 443, and 445 in PhoQ) of the G2 box and one following the F box (Gly-432 in PhoQ; Figs.2A and 3). The loop is anchored at its N terminus by the conserved phenylalanine residue (Phe-429 in PhoQ) for which the F box is named and at its C terminus by a conserved hydrophobic residue (Leu-446 in PhoQ and Met-507 in CheA) that begins the α3 helix (Fig.3). These two residues interact with each other as part of a larger hydrophobic patch in which Ile-428, Leu-446, and Ile-460 form a small pocket where Phe-429 is inserted (Fig. 3). The superimposition of CheA-KD shows a similar hydrophobic patch composed of Phe-487, Leu-486, Met-507, and Met-521 (Fig. 3). The chemical similarity of these residues and the similar organization in the EnvZ-KD model (Phe-387, Leu-386, Ile-408, and Leu-420; Fig.2A) suggest that this hydrophobic cluster is a general structural feature of histidine kinases. In the nucleotide-free CheA-KD model, the loop is extended toward the solvent in an “open” conformation (Fig. 3). In contrast, the PhoQ loop is in close contact with the main β-sheet, forming a “closed” conformation. The largest distance between equivalent residues in the ATP lid of PhoQ and CheA is 10 Å (Gly-441 in PhoQ and Gly-502 in CheA; Fig. 3). A 30° rotation of the loop about the hydrophobic patch anchor would produce an open conformation in PhoQ that would be structurally similar to that seen in CheA-KD. Three loop residues (Arg-434, Arg-439, and Gln-442) make extensive contacts with the phosphate groups and the chelated Mg2+ ion of the bound AMPPNP molecule in the PhoQ-KD structure, suggesting that nucleotide binding may induce the closed conformation. Apparently, the interactions with the AMPPNP phosphates play the principal role in the loop reorganization since the hydrophobic patch superimposes with minimal differences between the two structures (Fig. 3). Mutagenesis studies of the proposed hinge of the ATP-lid in EnvZ have shown that this region is essential for kinase activity (26Yang Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Figure 3ATP-lid movement in PhoQ-KD nucleotide-bound structure. Superimposition of Cα traces from PhoQ-KD (blue) and CheA-KD (yellow) shows the ATP-lid displacement toward the main β-sheet in PhoQ (closedconformation). The AMPPNP molecule is shown in magenta. Glycine Cα atoms are shown as spheres, and side chains of the hydrophobic patch residues are shown as sticks. Selected residues are labeled for each protein in the color corresponding to the backbone trace. β hairpin movement and the conserved Gly in the hairpin are also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The alternate disposition of the β-hairpin between the βF and βG strands represents a second, but minor structural difference between the PhoQ-KD and CheA-KD structures (Fig. 3). This β-hairpin corresponds to the recently defined G3 motif (5Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which includes a conserved glycine residue (Gly-469 in PhoQ) that immediately precedes the βG strand (Fig. 2A). Structurally, the β-hairpin lines the back of the nucleotide-binding site and provides solvent-mediated contacts with the AMPPNP ring. The β-hairpin is displaced in the PhoQ-KD structure relative to the CheA-KD structure (Fig. 3), and this displacement exposes two hydrophobic residues (Met-466 and Leu-467 in PhoQ) to the solvent. Together with Phe-397 in the βD strand, these residues form a solvent-exposed hydrophobic region. Perhaps ATP binding induces a shift in the position of the β-hairpin that, in turn, allows the hydrophobic patch to interact with the substrate histidine phospho-transfer domain, which is absent in this structure. These hydrophobic residues are not, however, conserved among histidine kinases, suggesting that the solvent exposure of the hydrophobic patch in PhoQ may simply be due to the space need of the ATP-ring pocket rather than a mechanistic function. Additional experiments will be necessary to address these possibilities. The ATP-binding pocket of PhoQ-KD involves not only absolutely conserved residues from the N, G1, F, G2, and G3 boxes, but also partially conserved residues from these motifs and from the ATP-lid loop (Figs. 2A and 4). In particular, residues from the G1, F, and G3 boxes provide the principal contacts with the adenosine moiety, whereas the N and G2 boxes contact both the adenosine moiety and Mg2+ phosphates. The ATP-lid interacts exclusively with the phosphates and the divalent cation. The hydrogen bond between the N6 amino group of AMPPNP and the carboxyl side chain of the conserved Asp-415 in the G1 box is the single direct protein interaction with the adenine ring (Fig.4). Water molecules mediate additional hydrogen bonds between the protein and the adenine nitrogen atoms (Fig.4). Specifically, the N6 amino group interacts with the main-chain carbonyl group of Val-386 through water W3. The endocyclic N1 atom of the adenine ring makes a bidentate water-mediated hydrogen bond to the main chain nitrogen atom of conserved Gly-419 and the side chain of Asp-415. Additionally, the adenine N7 atom forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen of conserved Asn-389, which makes an additional water-mediated interaction with the adenine N1 atom. Additional elements responsible for adenine base binding are Tyr-393, which makes an aromatic stacking interaction on one side, and Ile-420, which makes van der Waals contacts with the other face of the"

The catalytic domains in the carboxyl-terminal region were very much similar to those of other SUMO-1/Smt3-specific proteases, but the amino-terminal part was quite different. The enzyme specifically bound to Smt3a and Smt3b but not to SUMO-1. The SMT3IP2 expressed by Escherichia coli could cleave SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b from a SUMO-1/RanGAP1, Smt3a/RanGAP1, or Smt3b/RanGAP1 conjugate, respectively, and had the activity of a carboxyl-terminal hydrolase to produce a glycine residue in the carboxyl terminus of these ubiquitin-like proteins. The sequence data indicated that the amino acid sequence of SMT3IP2 was mostly identical to that of rat Axam, which binds to Axin and promotes the degradation of β-catenin, although its amino-terminal region was much shorter than that of Axam. Therefore, we designated this isopeptidase SMT3IP2/Axam2. When human SW480 cells were transfected with wild-type SMT3IP2/Axam2, the β-catenin disappeared. When the cells were transfected with the SMT3IP2/Axam2 C500A mutant, which had neither isopeptidase nor carboxyl-terminal hydrolase activity, or with the 1–352 mutant, which lacked the catalytic domain of the enzyme, again the β-catenin disappeared, indicating that the enzyme activities were not necessary for the instability of β-catenin in this transfection assay system and that its competition with Dvl for binding to Axin may be important for the instability of β-catenin as suggested previously for Axam (Kadoya, T., Kishida, S., Fukui, A., Hinoi, T., Michiue, T., Asashima, M., and Kikuchi, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 37030–37037). The involvement of its enzyme activities in the Wnt signaling pathway remains to be elucidated.

The sumoylation plays multiple functional roles in protein targeting, stabilization, and transcriptional activation. SUMO-1 modification of RanGAP1 results in the transfer of the protein from the cytoplasm to the nuclear pore complex. In the case of PML and Sp100, sumoylation leads to their subnuclear localization in the so-called PML nuclear bodies. Sumoylation of IκBα acts antagonistically to ubiquitination, and the modified IκBα is resistant to degradation. In addition, the SUMO-1 modification of p53 was shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of p53. In the conjugation system, a glycine residue in the carboxyl terminus of SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b is essential (7Mannen H. Tseng H.M. Cho C.L. Li S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the carboxyl-terminal residue of these proteins is not glycine. Therefore, the protein must be processed by a carboxyl-terminal hydrolase to produce a glycine residue in the carboxyl terminus prior to conjugation to the target proteins. A SUMO-1/Smt3 isopeptidase, which cleaves the linkage between SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b and the target protein in the conjugate (desumoylation), is also thought to exist. Budding yeast Ulp1 was the first identified of this kind of protease (24Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), which had both activities of carboxyl-terminal hydrolase and isopeptidase toward Smt3. Ulp1 is essential for cell viability and cell cycle progression, and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Ulp1 arrests cells at the G2/M phase at the nonpermissive temperature. Another budding yeast Smt3-deconjugating enzyme, Ulp2/Smt4, has been identified (25Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Deletion of ULP2 results in a variety of phenotypic abnormalities. These findings suggested that SUMO-1/Smt3-specific protease plays a significant role in the regulation of SUMO-1/Smt3-mediated cellular processes. In mammalian cells, three SUMO-1/Smt3-specific isopeptidases have been isolated and characterized so far (26Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One of them, SMT3IP1, which we isolated by use of the yeast two-hybrid screening using Smt3b as bait, was located exclusively in the nucleolus during interphase (26Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This enzyme bound to Smt3a and Smt3b, but not to SUMO-1, in both the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays. However, the enzyme could liberate SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b from SUMO-1/RanGAP1, Smt3a/RanGAP1, or Smt3b/RanGAP1, respectively, in vitro. But its carboxyl-terminal hydrolase activity was very weak when SUMO-1-, Smt3a-, or Smt3b-Myc-His6 was used as substrate. By expressed sequence tag (EST) data base searching using carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains of SMT3IP1, we found several cDNAs encoding putative SUMO-1/Smt3-specific proteases. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of one of these SUMO-1/Smt3-specfic proteases, which we call SMT3IP2/Axam2. It showed both SUMO-1/Smt3 hydrolase and isopeptidase activities and was localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, this protein is a homologue of rat Axam (27Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the latter of which binds to Axin (30Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) and promotes β-catenin degradation. By using mouse EST data base searching with the tBLASTn program for genes encoding proteins having sequence homology with the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains of SMT3IP1, we identified three EST clones (GenBankTMaccession numbers AI664083, AI152880, and AI390987), which overlapped partially with each other. Based on these EST sequences, a cDNA fragment was amplified by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using total RNA from mouse MC3T3E1 cells. The resulting PCR product was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming and used as a probe for screening a mouse MC3T3E1 cDNA library in λgt10 (6 × 105 plaques), which was kindly provided by Dr. Kiyoshi Nose, Showa University, Japan, to obtain a full-length cDNA. One positive cDNA clone was obtained and sequenced to confirm that it was the full-length murine SMT3IP2/Axam2 cDNA. A substitution mutant, C500A, was prepared by the PCR amplification method using a specific mutation primer as described previously (26Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The constructs of pEGFP-SMT3IP2/Axam2 were obtained by insertion of full-length, Δ1–61, 1–352, or C500A mutant SMT3IP2/Axam2 cDNA into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) for fusion in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the amino terminus of the enzyme. The pET11dGST-SMT3IP2/Axam2 was constructed by insertion of the murine SMT3IP2/Axam2 cDNA into the pET11dGST vector, which is a modified pET11d vector having a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene. For expression of GST-SUMO-1-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3a-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3b-Myc-His6, GST-Nedd8-Myc-His6, and GST-ubiquitin-Myc-His6as substrates for SMT3IP2/Axam2, their cDNAs encoding full-length precursor protein were amplified by the reverse transcript PCR method using total RNA from HeLa S3 cells and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen), which placed a Myc-His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Furthermore, the DNA fragments encoding SUMO-1-Myc-His6, Smt3a-Myc-His6, Smt3b-Myc-His6, Nedd8-Myc-His6, and ubiquitin-Myc-His6 were obtained by PCR and cloned into the pET11dGST vector. These recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21 LysS transformed with the recombinant plasmids. COS-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-SMT3IP2/Axam2 (Δ1–61) using DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with the bacterially expressed purified GST, GST-SUMO-1, GST-Smt3a, GST-Smt3b, or GST-Nedd8 fusion proteins for 30 min at 25 °C, and then the GST fusion protein was captured with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The resins were washed five times with the lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. The proteins that bound to the resins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody (Medical & Biomedical Laboratories Co.) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. The immunoblotted proteins were detected by the ECL method. In the carboxyl-terminal hydrolase assay, GST-SUMO-1-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3a-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3b-Myc-His6, or GST-Nedd8-Myc-His6 was used as the substrate. Bacterially expressed GST-SMT3IP2/Axam2 and substrates were purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and then eluted from the resin with 20 mm glutathione. The substrate (1 µg) was mixed with the purified enzyme (wild type, 20 ng; mutant, 50 ng) and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min in 20 µl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody (MBL) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. The immunoblotted proteins were detected by the ECL method. For the experiment using N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), the enzyme was preincubated with NEM at a final concentration of 5 mm. In the isopeptidase assay, GST-RanGAP1 was conjugated by biotinylated SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b in vitro as described previously (9Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The GST-SMT3IP2/Axam2 was purified as described above. The substrate immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (500 ng of protein) was mixed with the purified enzyme (100 ng) and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in 50 µl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation, proteins bound to the resin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-RanGAP1 antibody (21C7, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody with visualization by the ECL method. The biotinylated proteins in the membrane were detected by use of peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Extravidin, Sigma) and the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa S3 cells (2 × 105) were co-transfected with 2.0 µg of pEGFP SMT3IP2/Axam2 constructs (wild type or C500A mutant) and 0.5 µg of pFLAG-CMV-2 expression plasmids containing amino-terminal FLAG-tagged human SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b by using DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and directly lysed with SDS sample buffer. An equivalent amount of cell lysate was loaded in each lane and resolved by SDS-7.5% PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and the ECL method was used for detection. Human SW480 cells logarithmically growing on coverslips were transfected with pEGFP-SMT3IP2/Axam2 (either wild type or mutant) or co-transfected with pEGFP-SMT3IP2 (either wild type or mutant) and pEF-BOS Myc-Axin by using DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 36-h incubation, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS three times, and then blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Endogenous β-catenin protein in the cells was detected with monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (E-5) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Chemicon). Myc-Axin in the cells was detected with monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody (PL140, MBL) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel). The localization of GFP fusion proteins were detected with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (MBL) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Wako) or directly observed by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Earlier we isolated a SUMO-1/Smt3-specific protease and named it SMT3IP1 (26Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to be distantly related to yeast Ulp1 (24Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), human SENP1 (28Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and SUSP1 (29Kim I.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.-J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The conserved sequence was detected in their carboxyl-terminal regions containing the catalytic domains. In the present study we used the BLAST program to search for proteins containing the conserved carboxyl-terminal region of SMT3IP1 and identified several EST clones that encoded the putative SUMO-1/Smt3-specific protease. Of these clones, at least three of them (GenBankTM accession numbersAI664083, AI152880, and AI390987) partially overlapped each other, suggesting that they were originated from the same cDNA. Based on these EST sequences, a cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR, sequenced, and used as probe to screen a cDNA library. One positive clone was isolated. The cDNA insert was separated into two fragments by EcoRI, subcloned in pBluescript SK+, and sequenced. This cDNA contained a 1626-base pair open reading frame encoding a protein of 541 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa (Fig.1A). We named this protein SMT3IP2/Axam2 because of the characteristics of this protein described below. The catalytic domains in the carboxyl-terminal region of SMT3IP2/Axam2 were very similar to those of other SUMO-1/Smt3-specific proteases, but the amino-terminal part of SMT3IP2/Axm2 was quite different from that of the other enzymes. The cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues in the catalytic domains, which are characteristic of the SUMO-1/Smt3-specific protease, were conserved. Sequence analysis also indicated that the amino acid sequence of the SMT3IP2/Axam2 was almost identical to that of the previously reported rat Axam (GenBankTM accession number AF260129) (27Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and human SENP2 (GenBankTM accession number AF151697), although its amino-terminal region was shorter than that of rat Axam and human SENP2 (Fig. 1B). SMT3IP2/Axam2 cDNA had 67 base pairs, where a stop codon was detected in-frame, that were not contained in either the rat Axam or human SENP2 sequence (see sequenceunderlined in Fig. 1A). Also, the first two bases (GT) and the last two bases (AG) in this extra sequence corresponded to the bases in the intron-exon border. These data suggest that SMT3IP2/Axam2 may be alternatively spliced from the same gene corresponding to rat Axam or human SENP2. To determine whether this mRNA is expressed indeed in mouse tissues or culture cells, we conducted reverse transcriptase PCR using total RNA from mouse brain, heart, thymus, and Balb/c 3T3 cells. The PCR products from all tissues and cells tested were sequenced and were identical to this SMT3IP2/Axam2 cDNA (data not shown), suggesting that SMT3IP2/Axam2 is a major transcript in mouse cells. To demonstrate an interaction between SMT3IP2 and ubiquitin-like proteins, we expressed ubiquitin-like proteins inE. coli as GST fusion products. After they had been mixed and incubated with COS-7 cell lysates expressing GFP-SMT3IP2/Axam2, glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin was added to the mixture to capture the GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, SMT3IP2/Axam2 bound efficiently to GST-Smt3a or GST-Smt3b but not to GST-SUMO-1, GST-Nedd8, GST-ubiquitin, or GST alone. This feature of SMT3IP2/Axam2 is similar to that of SMT3IP1. To test whether or not SMT3IP2 indeed had SUMO-1/Smt3-specific protease activity, we prepared and purified the recombinant protein and assayed its activity. The GST-tagged SMT3IP2/Axam2 expressed in E. coli and purified by the use of glutathione-Sepharose 4B had the ability to cleave SUMO-1, Smt3a, and Smt3b from the SUMO-1/RanGAP1, Smt3a/RanGAP1, and Smt3b/RanGAP1 conjugate, respectively (Fig.3A). This enzyme activity was inhibited by treatment of SMT3IP2/Axam2 with NEM prior to incubation with the substrates, indicating that the reaction required an active sulfhydryl residue(s). When the cysteine 500 residue, which was suspected to be essential for the activity, was mutated to alanine, the mutant C500A did not show the activity. This result confirmed that this cysteine residue must be the catalytically active residue. Furthermore, to determine whether SMT3IP2 also had carboxyl-terminal hydrolase activity toward SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b in vitro, we prepared GST-SUMO-1-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3a-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3b-Myc-His6, and GST-Nedd8-Myc-His6 for use as substrates (Fig.3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, SMT3IP2 could cleave the carboxyl-terminal moiety of GST-SUMO-1-Myc-His6, GST-Smt3a-Myc-His6, or GST-Smt3b-Myc-His6, and the enzyme seemed to cleave Smt3a and Smt3b more preferably than SUMO-1 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). The enzyme did not cleave GST-Nedd8-Myc-His6 or GST-ubiquitin-Myc-His6proteins. These results indicate that SMT3IP2/Axam2 had both SUMO-1/Smt3-specific isopeptidase and carboxyl-terminal hydrolase activities. To check the isopeptidase activity in intact cells, we co-transfected HeLa cells with the cDNA of either wild-type or C500A mutant SMT3IP2/Axam2 and FLAG-tagged SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b. As shown in Fig.4, FLAG-tagged SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b could be conjugated to cellular target proteins. When wild-type GFP-SMT3IP2/Axam2 was overexpressed in the cells, all three conjugates almost disappeared (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 5, and8). Conversely, when the sole GFP moiety or the mutant C500A was overexpressed in cells, the three conjugates were still present. These results indicate that SMT3IP2/Axam2 could also hydrolyze the linkage between SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b and the target protein in the conjugate in intact cells and that SMT3IP2/Axam2 functions toward these three conjugates without any detectable differences in this assay system. To check the localization of the enzyme in cells, we transfected SW480 cells with GFP-fused full-length SMT3IP2/Axam2 and examined the localization of the protein by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.5, when GFP-SMT3IP2/Axam2 alone was expressed in SW480 cells, it was located predominantly throughout the cytoplasm and in cytoplasmic vesicles surrounding the nucleus (Fig.5A). In contrast, when GFP-SMTIP2/Axam2 and Myc-Axin were co-expressed in SW480 cells, each protein seemed to be located in the same cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 5B). This pattern of localization is similar to that observed previously when rat Axam and Axin were co-expressed in SW480 cells (27Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Overexpression of rat Axam in SW480 cells reduced the level of β-catenin protein in SW480 cells (27Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). So we also checked the effect of SMT3IP2/Axam2 on the stability of β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 6, when the wild-type enzyme was expressed in SW480 cells, the level of endogenous cytoplasmic β-catenin protein was reduced (Fig. 6B). Therefore, the amino-terminal sequence of SMT3IP2/Axam2, which is different from that of rat Axam, was not required for this effect. Furthermore we examined whether the protease activity of SMT3IP2/Axam2 was necessary for the reduction in the amount of β-catenin in the cells. When the protease activity-negative C500A mutant was expressed in SW480 cells, β-catenin also disappeared in the transfected cells (Fig.6C). Furthermore when the 1–352 mutant, which does not have the catalytic domain of the enzyme, was expressed in the cells, β-catenin also disappeared in the transfected cells (Fig.6D). These results indicate that the protease activity of SMT3IP2 is not required for the destabilization of β-catenin in this transfection assay. We found a previously unknown murine SUMO-1/Smt3-specific isopeptidase and named it SMT3IP2/Axam2. This enzyme was shown to be distantly related to SMT3IP1 (26Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), yeast Ulp1 (24Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), human SENP1 (28Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and SUSP1 (29Kim I.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.-J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The homologous sequence was only detected in its carboxyl-terminal region containing the catalytic domains. The enzyme could liberate SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b from SUMO-1/RanGAP1, Smt3a/RanGAP1 or Smt3b/RanGAP1, respectively, in vitro, and also cleave the carboxyl terminus of the SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b precursor. This enzyme appears to be a cysteine protease containing the well conserved His/Asp/Cys catalytic triad, and the essential cysteine residue is Cys-500 because the C500A mutant did not have protease activity. Sequence analysis indicated that this newly found isopeptidase was almost identical to the rat protein named rAxam or human SENP2, whose sequences are listed in GenBankTM. However, as it had an amino terminus different from that of Axam, we named it SMT3IP2/Axam2. Axam was identified, by the yeast two-hybrid screening, as a protein interacting with Axin. When Axam was expressed in human SW480 cells, the level of β-catenin was decreased. Besides this phenomenon, biochemical studies also suggest that Axam regulates the Wnt signaling pathway negatively, probably by competing with Dvl, which acts as a positive regulator, for binding to Axin (27Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The difference in the amino-terminal sequence between SMT3IP2/Axam2 and Axam seems to be due to alternative splicing of the mRNA because the mRNA of SMT3IP2/Axam2 had 67 extra base pairs in its 5′ sequence (underlined in Fig. 1A). SMT3IP2/Axam2 mRNA was expressed in all mouse tissues or cultured cells tested so far (data not shown). Also, the first two bases (GT) and the last two bases (AG) in this extra sequence corresponded to the bases in the intron-exon border (Fig. 1C). The translation of SMT3IP2/Axam2 starts from within this extra sequence because a stop codon exists in-frame within this extra sequence. Since the amino-terminal sequence of Axam contains a putative nuclear localization signal and PEST sequence, which SMT3IP2/Axam2 does not have, SMT3IP2 may be located more exclusively in the cytoplasm and be more stable than Axam. Since SMT3IP2/Axam2 binds to Axin and has carboxyl-terminal hydrolase and isopeptidase activities, the some components that bind Axin or Axin itself may be sumoylated and desumoylated by SMT3IP2/Axam2. Actually β-catenin was sumoylated in an in vitro assay system. 2F. Kobirumaki, T. Nishida, and H. Yasuda, unpublished results. β-Catenin has been shown to be degraded rapidly by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in SW480, whose adenomatous polyposis coli is truncated (31Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattore K., K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of β-catenin may compete with ubiquitination and may stabilize the protein against degradation as in the case of IκBα. SMT3IP2/Axam2 may regulate the Wnt signaling pathway negatively in the same manner as suggested above in the case of Axam. Although overexpression of SMT3IP2/Axam2 led to degradation of β-catenin in SW480 cells independent of its protease activity, still it may be the case that SMT3IP2/Axam2 plays an important role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway because it has a protease activity and co-localizes with Axin. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate this possibility. When SMT3IP2/Axam2 was overexpressed in HeLa cells, SUMO-1, Smt3a, or Smt3b conjugates were completely cleaved in vivo. However, it is possible that SUMO-1/Smt3-specific proteases regulate their activities with more substrate selectivity. In mammalian cells, SUMO-1/Smt3-specific proteases seem to consist of at least seven family members (32Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). As shown here, SMT3IP2/Axam2 was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and in cytoplasmic vesicles. On the other hand, SMT3IP1, SENP1, and SUSP1 were found in the nucleolus, throughout the nucleus, or in the cytoplasm, respectively. They may select their specific targets by different localization in a cell and/or by association with specific proteins that may be target proteins or with linker proteins between the target protein and the enzyme. In the case of SMT3IP2/Axam2, this enzyme seems to associate with Axin to cleave its specific substrate(s). We express our appreciation to Dr. Kiyoshi Nose, Showa University, Japan, for providing us the MC3T3 cDNA library."

The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded as precursors in the nuclear genome. Mitochondrial biogenesis is, therefore, dependent on the import and sorting of the nuclear encoded precursor proteins into mitochondrial subcompartments. In eukaryotes three distinct preprotein import systems located in the mitochondrial outer and inner membrane have been described (1Ryan K.R. Jensen R.E.

The outer membrane contains a general preprotein translocase, the TOM1complex, which mediates the recognition and binding of preproteins and their transfer across the outer membrane. This complex is most likely used by all nuclear encoded precursors. Import into and across the inner membrane is mediated by two distinct inner membrane translocases, the TIM22 and the TIM23 complexes. Both TIM complexes cooperate with the TOM complex but differ in their substrate specificity (6Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The TIM23 complex mediates import of preproteins with a positively charged matrix targeting signal into the mitochondrial matrix space and into the inner membrane (6Berthold J. Bauer M.F.

The translocation of such precursors into the matrix requires the membrane potential Δψ across the inner membrane and ATP in the matrix. The Δψ drives the translocation of the presequences through the protein-conducting channel of the TIM23 complex which is formed by the membrane-integrated proteins Tim23 and Tim17 (6Berthold J.

A molecular motor that is attached to the inner side of this channel then promotes further translocation of the mature portion of the preproteins into the matrix. This motor consists of the peripheral membrane protein Tim44, the mitochondrial Hsp70, and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1. Together, these components in repeated ATP-dependent reaction cycles facilitate the vectorial translocation into the matrix in a stepwise manner (14Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.-C. Neupert W.

Their precise function was not known until recently. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tim8 and Tim13 are also organized in a hetero-oligomeric complex in the intermembrane space. They are, in contrast to Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12, not essential for the viability of yeast cells (19Koehler C.M. Leuenberger D. Merchant S. Renold A. Junne T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that the TIM8·13 complex of yeast interacts with translocation intermediates of Tim23, the major component of the translocase for matrix-targeted preproteins (17Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The TIM8·13 complex assists the import of Tim23 by binding to the partially translocated precursor in the intermembrane space still associated with the TOM complex. It is only strictly required when the membrane potential is low and the interaction with TIM22 complex is inefficient (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the TIM8·13 complex was proposed to function in accumulating the Tim23 translocation intermediate thereby shifting the equilibrium toward direct interaction with the membrane-integrated portion of the TIM22 complex (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The human homolog of Tim8 is encoded by the DDP1 (deafness dystonia peptide 1) gene. Mutations in the DDP1 cause the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental retardation, and blindness (19Koehler C.M. Leuenberger D. Merchant S. Renold A. Junne T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Tranebjaerg L. Schwartz C. Eriksen H.

Most of the DDP1 mutations are loss-of-function mutations predicted to lead to an absent or a truncated gene product. So far, only one missense mutation was found causing a cysteine to tryptophan exchange (C66W) within the Cys4 motif (25Tranebjaerg L. Hamel B.C. Gabreels F.J. Renier W.O. Van Ghelue M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the structural organization of the human zinc finger proteins DDP1 and hTim13 and their functional role in mitochondrial preprotein import. We show that DDP1 interacts with hTim13 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space thereby forming a hetero-oligomeric complex of 70 kDa. When expressed in yeast, the DDP1·hTim13 complex facilitates import of hTim23. In human mitochondria the DDP1·hTim13 complex is in direct contact with translocation intermediates of hTim23. This suggests that an impaired mitochondrial preprotein import is the pathogenetic basis of the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome. For subcloning DDP1 and hTim13 into expression vectors, DNA was polymerase chain reaction amplified from DDP1- and hTim13-specific expressed sequence tag clones (18Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Mühlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using specific oligonucleotide primers (DDP1 forward: 5′-atg gat tcc tcc tcc tct tcc-3′; DDP1 reverse: 5′-tca gtc aga aag gct ttc tga g-3′; hTim13 forward: atg gag ggc ggc ttc gg-3′; hTim13 reverse: 5′-tca cat gtt ggc tcg ttc-3′). The DDP1 and hTim13 polymerase chain reaction products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subcloned into pYX142(LEU2) and pYX232(TRP1) yeast expression vectors (Novagen), respectively. The S. cerevisiae strain MB2-Δ8/Δ13 (tim8::HIS3;tim13::URA3) (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was transformed with both plasmids, and transformants were selected on minimal medium without histidine, uracil, leucine, and tryptophan. MBP fusion proteins were generated by digestion of the DDP1 and hTim13 polymerase chain reaction products with BamHI and XbaI and subcloning into pMal-cRI vectors (New England Biolabs). For in vitro synthesis of precursor proteins, yeast Tim23 and human Tim23 DNA were digested with EcoRI/HindIII and subcloned into pGEM4 (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from yeast were isolated as described (26Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from frozen HeLa cells (Computer Cell Culture Center, Mons, Belgium) or mouse liver were prepared in a medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, by differential centrifugation and subsequent sucrose step gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (27Bauer M.F. Gempel K. Reichert A.S. Rappold G.A. Lichtner P. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To analyze the subcellular localization of human small Tim proteins, the postmitochondrial supernatant after a 10,000 ×g centrifugation step was centrifuged in a TL100 ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min to yield the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) and the microsomal fraction (pellet). To release soluble components of the intermembrane space into the supernatant, mitochondria prepared from HeLa cells were solubilized using increasing concentrations of digitonin (0.05–0.3% w/v or 0.75–4.5 μg of digitonin/μg of mitochondrial protein) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Human mitochondria (100–250 μg) were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.5 ml of column buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge (30 min), the clear supernatant was either analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis (100 μg/lane) (28Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar) and subsequent immunodecoration or subjected to a Superose-12 gel filtration column (250 μg) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min in column buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against DDP1 and hTim13. As calibration standards thyroglobulin (670 kDa), apoferritin (440 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochromec (12.4 kDa) were used. Fractions in which DDP1 and hTim13 coeluted were subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation using either affinity-purified anti-DDP1 or anti-hTim13 IgG. Prior to immunoprecipitation, Triton X-100 was diluted to a final concentration of 0.2%. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against DDP1 and hTim13. Isolated mitochondria were resuspended at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 1 ml of column buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 0.5% Triton X-100 and lysed on ice for 30 min. After a clarifying spin (30 min, 100,000 ×g), the extracts were split into two aliquots, diluted to a final concentration of Triton X-100 of 0.2%, and immunoprecipitated using antibodies against either DDP1 or hTim13 prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunocomplexes were dissociated in SDS-containing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostaining with anti-DDP1 and anti-hTim13 antibodies. MBP-DDP1, MBP-hTim13, and MBP-lacα fusion proteins were expressed in XL1-blue Escherichia colicells at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mm zinc acetate for 16 h. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 1 mm zinc acetate, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A clarifying spin was performed, and the supernatant was either incubated with 40 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 1 h or applied directly to an amylose column for affinity purification. After binding the column was washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer lacking the zinc acetate. Elution from the resin was obtained using 10 mm maltose. Concentrations of the eluted proteins were adjusted to 300 μg/ml, and the Zn2+ content was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) in a Varian-Vista Simultan spectrometer. Precursor proteins were synthesized by coupled transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (30Pelham H.R. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Import reactions into isolated yeast mitochondria or mitochondria prepared from mouse liver were carried out for 10–20 min at 25 °C in 180 μl of import buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2) in the presence of 2.5 mm ATP and 5 mm NADH. To energize isolated mitochondria from mouse liver 2.5 mm succinate was added additionally. The reactions contained 180 μg of mitochondrial protein and 4% reticulocyte lysate with the radiolabeled precursor protein. Membrane potential was dissipated by omission of NADH and preincubation for 5 min at 25 °C with 1 μm valinomycin and 25 μm FCCP. Aliquots (50 μl) each corresponding to 50 μg of mitochondrial protein were either incubated with protease (50 μg/ml trypsin or 30 μg/ml proteinase K) for 20 min on ice followed by incubation with protease inhibitor (5 min on ice) or left untreated. Mitochondria were washed twice in HS buffer (20 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.6 m sorbitol), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. For cross-link experiments, import reactions were performed in import buffer using 7.5% reticulocyte lysate with the radiolabeled precursor protein. A 100-μg aliquot of freshly isolated mouse liver mitochondria was used for total cross-links and 30 μg for cross-linking and subsequent immunoprecipitation. After import,m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) was added to a final concentration of 100 μm and incubated 20 min on ice. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 80 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Mitochondria were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE (total cross-links) or lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 (30 min on ice) and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Antisera against the C termini of human small Tim proteins were raised in rabbits by injecting the chemically synthesized peptides CKSKPVFSESLSD (DDP1), CYNSRLQRERANM (hTim13), CLAAKAGLLGQPR (hTim9), CLMKRVQQSSGPA (hTim10a), and CAAEQPGVSPSGS (hTim10b) which had been coupled to activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Antibodies were affinity purified on SulfoLink gel (Pierce). Polyclonal antisera against the C-terminal 13-mers of human Tim44 and human Tim23 were raised as described before (27Bauer M.F. Gempel K. Reichert A.S. Rappold G.A. Lichtner P. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The identification of DDP1, hTim13, hTim9, hTim10a, and hTim10b as components of mitochondrial import systems is based on their sequence similarities to yeast Tim8, Tim13, Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12, respectively, structurally related zinc finger proteins identified in the mitochondrial intermembrane space of yeast (18Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Mühlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine the intracellular location of the human homologs immunoblot analyses of subcellular fractions prepared from HeLa cells were performed. Western blotting using affinity-purified antibodies indicated that DDP1, hTim13, hTim9, Tim10a, and hTim10b colocalized with human Tim23 in the mitochondrial fraction but were absent in the cytoplasmic or the microsomal fraction (Fig.1A). When isolated HeLa cell mitochondria were treated with proteinase K, neither protein was accessible to proteases (not shown), whereas all of them were released from the mitochondria when lysed with 0.1% digitonin (Fig.1B). To analyze the submitochondrial location of DDP1 and hTim13 in more detail, mitochondria were treated in a stepwise manner with increasing concentrations of digitonin and fractionated by centrifugation. At a concentration of 0.1% digitonin the outer membrane was selectively opened, but the inner membrane remained intact because hTim23, a component of the inner membrane (Fig. 1B), and hTim44, a peripheral mitochondrial matrix protein, were recovered in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1, B and C). Under these conditions DDP1 and hTim13 were completely released into the supernatant, demonstrating that both proteins are located in the intermembrane space. DDP1 and hTim13 belong to an evolutionary conserved protein family whose members share four conserved cysteine residues (Cys4 motif) (5Bauer M.F. Hofmann I. Neupert I. Brunner I. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Mühlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Cys4 motif is considered to constitute a metal binding site. The cysteine residues of yeast Tim10 and Tim12 have previously been shown to bind zinc, and zinc binding is required for the interaction of Tim10 and Tim12 with ADP/ATP carrier during import (8Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We constructed chimeric proteins consisting of DDP1 or of hTim13 fused to the MBP. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+ ions and affinity purified on amylose resin (Fig.2A). As a control, MBP protein fused to the α-fragment of the β-galactosidase (MBP-α) was purified (Fig. 2A). MBP-DDP1, MBP-hTim13, and MBP-α were analyzed using ICP. The atomic emission was determined at the zinc-specific wavelengths of 206.200 and 213.857 nm. The Zn2+ content was calculated based on the counts obtained at the major wavelength at 213.857 (Fig. 2B). The preparations of MBP-DDP1 and MBP-hTim13 contained Zn2+ in ∼1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the control preparation of MBP-α contained only background levels of zinc. This demonstrates that DDP1 and hTim13 are zinc-binding proteins. To test whether cysteine residues are involved in Zn2+binding the sulfhydryl groups of MBP-DDP1 were modified with NEM prior to affinity purification. The Zn2+ content of NEM-treated MBP-DDP1 was reduced to almost background levels (Fig. 2, Band C). Thus, the Cys4 motif appears to mediate the binding of Zn2+. Using recombinant MBP-DDP1 and MBP-hTim13 for calibration, we estimated that mitochondria from HeLa cells contain approximately equal amounts of DDP1 and hTim13, corresponding to about 10–50 pg/μg of mitochondrial protein (Fig.3A). To assess the organization of DDP1 and hTim13, mitochondria were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 and subjected to gel filtration analysis on a Superose-12 column. DDP1 and hTim13 coeluted in fractions corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 3B). DDP1 and hTim13 were absent in fractions corresponding to higher molecular masses. In addition, mitochondria were analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis (28Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). DDP1 and hTim13 were monitored by immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies. Each antibody detected a major band with an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a native molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 3C). A minor fraction of hTim13 was found in a complex of approximately 110 kDa. Thus, DDP1 and hTim13 appear to be organized in complexes of 70 kDa. According to the predicted masses of DDP1 and hTim13 these complexes may be composed of six or seven subunits. To investigate whether DDP1 and hTim13 form homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes, coimmunoprecipitations were performed using either total mitochondria or the 70-kDa fraction from the gel filtration column (Fig.3D). When total mitochondria were lysed with Triton X-100, antibodies against DDP1 precipitated both DDP1 and hTim13. Likewise, antibodies against hTim13 precipitated hTim13 and DDP1 (Fig.3D, left panel). Antibodies against DDP1 and hTim13 did not precipitate hTim9, hTim10a, or hTim10b (not shown). Both antibodies depleted their cognate antigen and the corresponding partner protein from mitochondrial extracts. Yet, Western blot analysis detected significantly lower amounts of the partner proteins in the immunoprecipitates. When DDP1 and hTim13 were immunoprecipitated directly from the 70-kDa fraction of the gel filtration column similar relative amounts of the respective partner proteins were determined (Fig. 3D, right panel). This suggests that DDP1 and hTim13 are organized in heterohexameric complexes containing approximately equal amounts of each component. The lower efficiency of coprecipitation of the respective partner proteins is likely to result from dissociation of the complex during immunoprecipitation or the subsequent washing procedures. Tim8 and Tim13, the yeast homologs of DDP1 and hTim13, are not essential for cell viability. The fungal TIM8·13 complex interacts with the translocation intermediate of Tim23 and facilitates its import by trapping the incoming precursor in the intermembrane space thereby preventing retrograde translocation (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yeast cells carrying disruptions of TIM8 and TIM13 (Δ8/Δ13) grew normally at 30 °C and 15 °C in media containing the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol. In media containing glucose as a carbon source Δ8/Δ13 grew significantly slower at 15 °C (cold-sensitive). When yeast cells are grown in the presence of glucose, respiration is down-regulated, and Δψ is lowered because it is mainly generated by the ADP/ATP carrier, which shuttles ATP from the cytosol into the matrix space in exchange for ADP from the matrix. It was suggested that the TIM8·13 complex is only required for import of yeast Tim23 (yTim23) when the membrane potential Δψ is low (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To analyze whether DDP1 and hTim13 are able to substitute for the function of Tim8 and Tim13, we expressed the human components in the Δ8/Δ13 yeast mutant. Both proteins were detected in mitochondria and released from the intermembrane space upon disruption of the outer membrane using digitonin at a concentration of 0.05% (Fig.4A). Wild-type (WT), Δ8/Δ13, and Δ8/Δ13 yeast cells harboring DDP1 and hTim13 (Δ8/Δ13+DDP1/hTim13) were grown at 15 °C and 30 °C in the presence of glucose. The cells grew normally at 30 °C (Fig.4, B and C, left panels). At 15 °C the growth rate of Δ8/Δ13 cells was reduced drastically compared with WT cells, whereas the Δ8/Δ13+DDP1/hTim13 cells grew nearly like WT (Fig. 4, B and C, right panels). Thus, DDP1 and hTim13 rescue thecold-sensitive deletion phenotype in yeast. This indicates that the human homologs are able to complement the function of the yeast TIM8-13 complex. We have investigated the role of DDP1 and hTim13 in the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins into yeast mitochondria. Mitochondria isolated from WT, Δ8/Δ13, and Δ8/Δ13+DDP1/hTim13 yeast cells were either energized with NADH or preincubated with valinomycin and FCCP to dissipate the membrane potential. Radiolabeled precursor of yeast Tim23 and of human Tim23 was added, and import was measured. In the absence of Δψ, yTim23 accumulated at stage III, a translocation intermediate that is partially resistant to trypsin treatment (Fig. 5, upper left panel). In Δ8/Δ13 mitochondria the amount of the stage III intermediate was reduced to ∼50% of the WT level, indicating that the TIM8·13 complex is required to trap the translocation intermediate in the intermembrane space. In mitochondria from Δ8/Δ13+DDP1/hTim13 cells the formation of the stage III intermediate was restored to WT levels. This indicates that the DDP1·hTim13 complex interacts with the Tim23 precursor of yeast. When human Tim23 was incubated with the mitochondria in the absence of Δψ no significant amounts of trypsin-protected species were detected (Fig. 5, upper right panel). Similarly, no resistant intermediates were detected when proteinase K was used (not shown). Although stage III intermediates of hTim23 were detected by cross-linking (see below), it is apparently not possible to characterize them by protease protection assays. In the presence of Δψ, yTim23 was equally well imported into yeast WT and Δ8/Δ13 mitochondria (Fig. 5, lower left panel), supporting the notion that the TIM8·13 complex is not strictly required for the biogenesis of yTim23 when the membrane potential is sufficiently strong (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yet, the import efficiency of yTim23 was increased significantly in mitochondria harboring the DDP1·hT13 complex, demonstrating that the human orthologs contribute to import of the yeast precursor (Fig. 5, lower left panel). At high levels of Δψ, hTim23 was imported efficiently into WT mitochondria (Fig. 5, lower right panel). The import of hTim23 was reduced significantly in mitochondria from Δ8/Δ13 cells, suggesting that it is dependent on the TIM8·13 complex even at high Δψ. When the human DDP1·hTim13 complex was present the import efficiency of hTim23 was restored. This indicates that the DDP1·hTim13 complex facilitates translocation and insertion of hTim23 into the mitochondrial inner membrane. In conclusion, the DDP1·hTim13 complex acts in the import of Tim23 and assists the translocation of the precursor across the outer membrane in a manner similar to the yeast TIM8·13 complex. In contrast to yTim23, the import of hTim23 is generally dependent on the assistance of the DDP1·hTim13 complex even when the membrane potential is high. Import of hTim23 into isolated mouse liver mitochondria was dependent on Δψ (data not shown). To address whether the DDP1·hTim13 complex is in contact with translocation intermediates (stage III) in mammalian mitochondria, we performed cross-linking. Mouse liver mitochondria were preincubated to dissipate the Δψ. Subsequently, radiolabeled hTim23 was added to accumulate stage III intermediates, and cross-linking with MBS was performed. Two major hTim23 cross-linking adducts were detected which correspond to apparent molecular masses of ∼33 and 35 kDa (Fig.6A). To characterize these cross-linking products immunoprecipitations with antibodies against DDP1 and hTim13 were performed (Fig. 6B). Under native conditions each of the antibodies precipitated both cross-linking products. This indicates that the hTim23 precursor interacts with the intact DDP1·hTim13 complex in the intermembrane space of mammalian mitochondria. The Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome is considered to be the first mitochondrial disorder caused by a defect in the mitochondrial import machinery. The suggestion of the underlying pathomechanism is based on the homology of the dysfunctional DDP1 to a family of small yeast proteins that act along the TIM22-dependent import pathway. In yeast, this protein family comprises the essential proteins Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12, and the nonessential components Tim8 and Tim13 (8Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W.

They form three distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes in the intermembrane space which facilitate the transfer of hydrophobic precursors from the TOM complex to the TIM22 complex in the inner membrane. These “small” TIM complexes bind to the translocation intermediates during import thereby maintaining the precursors in an import-competent conformation (17Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The TIM9·10 and the TIM9·10·12 complexes mediate the import of mitochondrial carrier proteins, whereas the TIM8·13 complex interacts specifically with translocation intermediates of Tim23, the major component of the inner membrane translocase for matrix targeted preproteins. By analogy to the function of Tim8 and Tim13 in yeast it was suggested that the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome is caused by a defect in the biogenesis of the human TIM23 complex (17Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the TIM8·13 complex in yeast is not strictly required for the import of Tim23. A requirement of the TIM8·13 complex was only observed when membrane insertion of Tim23 was compromised (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It was not clear whether the human DDP1 and hTim13 are true orthologs of Tim8 and Tim13 and fulfill a corresponding function in the import of Tim23. In the present study, we analyzed the structural organization and function of DDP1 and hTim13. We show that both proteins are located in the intermembrane space. They are present in roughly equimolar amounts and form hetero-oligomeric assemblies with an apparent molecular mass of ∼70 kDa. The 70-kDa complex appears to be composed of three molecules of DDP1 and three molecules of hTim13. However, it cannot be decided whether this stoichiometry is fixed or determined by the relative expression levels of the components. DDP1 and hTim13 belong to a family of evolutionary conserved proteins of the intermembrane space. In humans, six members have been identified all of which share four conserved cysteine residues (Cys4motif) considered to constitute a metal binding site. We determined that DDP1 and hTim13 bind Zn2+ ions in a 1:1 stoichiometry and thus appear to form zinc fingers. As in yeast these zinc fingers might be crucial for the recognition and binding of translocation intermediates by DDP1 and hTim13. We demonstrated that the human DDP1·hTim13 complex is functional in yeast. It rescues the growth defect observed at low temperature in the yeast Δtim8/Δtim13 mutant, indicating that it is a true ortholog. Moreover, mitochondria from the complemented strain import yTim23 with a higher efficiency than WT yeast mitochondria. Thus, DDP1 and hTim13 so far are the only components of the mitochondrial inner membrane translocase that are functional across species. Considering the rather low sequence similarity between the human and yeast orthologs and its restriction to regions around the conserved cysteine pairs (18Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Mühlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the putative zinc finger might be the functionally important element of the DDP1·hTim13 complex. In all but one patient with Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome this putative zinc finger is not expressed because of nonsense or frameshift mutations located upstream the Cys4 motif. In one patient a missense mutation, C66W, leads to a nonfunctional zinc finger. Studies on the mutant DDP1C66W revealed that it does not accumulate in the intermembrane space of mitochondria from patient cell lines. 2C. Köhler, personal communication. This suggests that the mutant DDP1 protein is not able to fold properly and is degraded rapidly; this also explains the full-blown clinical phenotype observed in a patient harboring the mutant C66W allele on the X chromosome. Has the DDP1·hTim13 complex a role in the biogenesis of the human TIM23 complex? Import of hTim23 into yeast mitochondria appears to be strongly dependent on the assistance of DDP1 and hTim13, whereas import of yTim23 does not require the yeast TIM8·13 complex under normal conditions. In particular, import of hTim23 into yeast mitochondria required the assistance of the DDP1·hTim13 complex even when the Δψ was high. Under these conditions biogenesis of yTim23 is independent of the yeast TIM8·13 complex. Furthermore, hTim23 was found to be in contact with the DDP1·hTim13 complex during import in isolated mammalian mitochondria. Together, these observations provide direct evidence that the DDP1·hTim13 complex fulfills an important role in import of Tim23 in mammals by trapping translocation intermediates in the intermembrane space (Fig.7A). Mutations in DDP1 are likely to cause a defect in the biogenesis of the Tim23 in humans (Fig.7B). In summary, the DDP1·hTim13 complex acts in the intermembrane space and specifically assists the import of the Tim23 precursors into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The DDP1·hTim13 complex functions in a manner comparable to that of the yeast TIM8·13 complex. Whereas import of yeast Tim23 does not require the TIM8·13 complex under normal conditions, import of hTim23, by contrast, appears to rely on the assistance of the DDP1·hTim13 complex under all conditions. Accordingly, the pathomechanism underlying the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome may therefore be based on a defective TIM23 translocase leading to severe pleitropic mitochondrial dysfunction.

We studied the binding of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein (gp) to CXCR4 but found that the gp120s from CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains bound nonspecifically to several cell lines lacking human CXCR4 expression. Therefore, we constructed paramagnetic proteoliposomes (CXCR4-PMPLs) containing pure, native CXCR4. CXCR4-PMPLs specifically bound the natural ligand, SDF-1α, and the gp120s from CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains. Conformation-dependent anti-CXCR4 antibodies and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 blocked HIV-1 gp120 binding to CXCR4-PMPLs. The gp120-CXCR4 interaction was blocked by anti-gp120 antibodies directed against the third variable (V3) loop and CD4-induced epitopes, structures that have also been implicated in the binding of gp120 to the other HIV-1 coreceptor, CCR5. Compared with the binding of R5 HIV-1 gp120s to CCR5, the gp120-CXCR4 interaction exhibited a lower affinity (Kd = 200 nm) and was dependent upon prior CD4 binding, even at low temperature. Thus, although similar regions of X4 and R5 HIV-1 gp120s appear to be involved in binding CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively, differences exist in nonspecific binding to cell surfaces, affinity for the chemokine receptor, and CD4 dependence at low temperature.

Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and are extremely hydrophobic. Purification of GPCRs from the cell membrane typically results in loss of native conformation (5Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

As such, most studies of GPCRs have been limited to cell-based assays. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of the cell surface can complicate the interpretation of results. These limitations make overexpression, native purification, and protein stabilization outside the cell membrane crucial to the understanding of GPCR structure and function. CXCR4 is a member of the GPCR family of proteins and is the receptor for the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α) (7Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J.

CXCR4 has a broad tissue distribution and interaction with SDF-1α leads to chemotaxis (7Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A.

These data suggest the importance of CXCR4 in normal human physiology as well as pathogenesis. CXCR4 is also a relevant molecule in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, initially binds to the CD4 molecule on the host cell surface (12Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). This interaction leads to conformational changes in gp120 that increase the affinity for the HIV-1 coreceptors (13Wu L.

Association of gp120 with the chemokine receptor is thought to promote conformational changes in the HIV-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, gp41 (21Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This culminates in fusion of the virion with the host cell, leading to viral entry. Given the normal physiological role of CXCR4 as well as its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, biochemical characterization of the interaction of CXCR4 with ligands, including HIV-1 gp120, is of paramount importance. Paramagnetic proteoliposomes (PMPLs) have been described that allowed the convenient study of a purified GPCR, CCR5, in a native, membrane-associated state (22Mirzabekov T. Kontos H. Farzan M. Marasco W. Sodroski J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Specific detergents were used to solubilize CCR5 in expressing cells in a native conformation (23Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the protein was captured on magnetic beads via an affinity tag, and a lipid membrane was reconstituted during the removal of detergent. CCR5 in PMPLs bound conformation-dependent antibodies and complexes of HIV-1 gp120 and soluble CD4 (22Mirzabekov T. Kontos H. Farzan M. Marasco W. Sodroski J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These CCR5-PMPLs were stable for up to 2 months and were able to be used in many assays typically reserved for GPCR-expressing cells. Here we describe overexpression of CXCR4 and subsequent solubilization of CXCR4-expressing cells in a manner that maintains native conformation of the molecule. This was documented by the binding of both conformation-dependent antibodies as well as the binding of SDF-1α to CXCR4 contained in cell lysates. Due to the limited stability of CXCR4 in detergent-containing cell lysates, we reconstituted CXCR4 into paramagnetic proteoliposomes (CXCR4-PMPLs). These CXCR4-PMPLs bound conformation-dependent antibodies, SDF-1α, and the gp120 of a CXCR4-using HIV-1 isolate, HXBc2. All of these interactions were determined to be specific and were as efficient as those observed with CXCR4 expressed on the cell surface. In fact, CXCR4-PMPLs proved to be a much more efficient tool for studying gp120/CXCR4 interaction by limiting the nonspecific binding that characterized the gp120 interaction with the cell surface. PMPLs represent a valuable tool for the screening and identification of GPCR/ligand interactions and may also be useful in the study of membrane proteins in general. Codon-optimized CXCR4 (synCXCR4) was synthesized as described previously for CCR5 (23Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CXCR4 was cloned into the PACH vector (a gift from Dr. Velan, Israel Institute for Biological Research) and a sequence encoding the C9 peptide (TETSQVAPA) was introduced immediately 5′ to the natural stop codon for CXCR4. The C9 peptide is a linear epitope recognized by the 1D4 antibody (24Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). PACH-SynCXCR4 DNA was transfected into Cf2Th cells using the Geneporter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) as described by the manufacturer. Stably transfected CXCR4-expressing cells were grown in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After selection, cells expressing the highest levels of CXCR4, as determined by 12G5 antibody staining, were sorted using FACS. Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (complete DMEM) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Stable transfectants were grown in complete DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cf2Th-CXCR4 and -CCR5 cells were treated for 24 h with 3 mm sodium butyrate prior to harvest. Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes to full confluency. Growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine was added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 40 µCi/ml each of [35S]methionine and -cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added, and the cells were incubated for 16–24 h. Following incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells harvested with PBS/5 mm EDTA. Cells were pelleted and snap-frozen on dry ice. Approximately 5 × 106 metabolically labeled Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells were suspended in solubilization buffer consisting of 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1% CHAPSO detergent (Anatrace). After suspension, the solution was incubated for 5 min on ice followed by 25 min on a rocker at 4 °C. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. CXCR4 in the cleared lysate was precipitated with either 1D4-Sepharose (23Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or protein A-Sepharose conjugated with one of the following anti-CXCR4 antibodies: 12G5 (PharMingen), 44708.111, 44716.111 or 44717.111 (all R & D Systems) for >5 h at 4 °C on a rocker. Following incubation, all precipitates were washed four times in solubilization buffer and resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad). Gels were washed for 30 min in 10% acetic acid, 20% methanol, 30 min in ENHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 20 min in 2% glycerol. Washed gels were dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 45 min and visualized by autoradiography on Kodak Biomax MR film. A plasmid expressing SDF1α-Ig (a gift of Dr. Timothy Springer, Center for Blood Research, Boston) was transfected into 293T cells using Geneporter transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with either complete DMEM or DMEM without cysteine and methionine supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 µCi each of [35S]cysteine and -methionine. Cells were then incubated for 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The medium was removed and centrifuged at 2000 × g to remove debris. SDF1α-Ig is a secreted protein and as such is found in the growth medium. Precipitation of metabolically labeled CXCR4 with SDF1α-Ig was performed as follows. Radiolabeled cleared lysate containing CXCR4 was incubated with protein A-Sepharose and 200 µl culture supernatant containing SDF1α-Ig for >5 h at 4 °C on the rocker. The protein A-Sepharose was washed, the protein eluted, and gels run as described above. Precipitation of metabolically labeled SDF1α-Ig with CXCR4 was performed as follows. CXCR4-containing cell lysate was incubated with 200 µl of radiolabeled SDF1α-Ig culture supernatant and 1D4-Sepharose for >5 h at 4 °C on the rocker. The 1D4-Sepharose was washed, the protein eluted, and gels run as described above. Ten ml of tosyl-activated M-280 Dynal beads (2 × 109 beads/ml) were conjugated with 6 mg of 1D4 antibody (National Cell Culture Center) as described by the manufacturer. Conjugated beads were resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 109 beads/ml in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide and stored at 4 °C. All lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids and were dissolved in chloroform. Six mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 3 mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and 1 mg of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate were pooled in a cryovial and dried under vacuum. This lipid mix was then resuspended in PBS and sonicated. Sonicated lipid was stored under liquid N2. Approximately 4 × 108Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells were resuspended in 4 ml of solubilization buffer. The solution was then incubated on ice for 5 min followed by 25 min at 4 °C on a rocker. CXCR4-containing lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysate was incubated with 2 × 109 1D4-coated M-280 Dynal beads at 4 °C for >2.5 h on the rocker. Beads were washed with solubilization buffer 3 times and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 1% CHAPSO, 20% glycerol, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate lipid mix. The solution was then dialyzed against 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 20% glycerol for 24 h at 4 °C using a Slide-A-Lyzer, 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Pierce) to remove detergent and allow the formation of PMPLs. PMPLs were then purified using a magnetic field. PMPLs were resuspended in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide. PMPLs were stable for >2 months at 4 °C. CCR5-PMPLs were synthesized as described previously (22Mirzabekov T. Kontos H. Farzan M. Marasco W. Sodroski J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Specifically, the streptavidin-biotin bridge was excluded and CHAPSO, not CymalTM-5, was used as the solubilizing detergent. All cells (1 × 106) and PMPLs (5 × 106) were stained in a final volume of 100 µl of PBS, 0.5% BSA. For detection of CXCR4 either on cells or PMPLs, anti-CXCR4 antibodies 12G5-PE (PharMingen) and 44717.111-PE (R & D Systems) were used at a final concentration of 10 nm. The isotype-matched control antibody MG2a04 (PharMingen) was used as a negative control for all stainings. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and washed twice in PBS, 0.5% BSA. All samples were analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACScan with CellQuest software. Competition assays were set up with 1 × 106 Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells (positive control), 1 × 107 CXCR4-PMPLs, or 1 × 107 CCR5-PMPLs (negative control). All reactions were performed in 100 µl of buffer containing 0.1 nm125I-labeled SDF-1α (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1× Binding Buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 5% dialyzed FCS). Cold SDF-1α competitor was added to samples in duplicate at concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 1 µm. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and washed 3 times in 1× binding buffer. Samples were subsequently read on a gamma counter and the results plotted. The pSVIIIexE7 plasmid encoding HIV-1 (HXBc2) gp120 was transfected into 293T cells using Geneporter reagent as described by the manufacturer. After 24 h, the transfection medium was replaced with Cys−/Met− DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU penicillin/streptomycin, 200 µCi of [35S]cysteine and -methionine. Cells were grown for 72 additional hours, and supernatants were collected. Approximately 1 × 108 PMPLs or 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 µl of gp120-containing culture medium (with 1 µg of soluble CD4). Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C and washed 2 times in complete DMEM. Cells or PMPLs were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 30 min on a rocker at 25 °C. The use of Triton X-100 allowed for the denaturation of CXCR4 resulting in the dissociation of gp120 from CXCR4. Stripped Dynal beads were then removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The radiolabeled gp120 glycoprotein was precipitated from supernatants with protein A-Sepharose and the gp120-specific antibody C11 for 1 h at 25 °C. Sepharose beads were washed twice in solubilization buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and SDS-PAGE was performed. Gels were dried and exposed to film for 12–72 h. The pSVIIIexE7 plasmid encoding HIV-1 (HXBc2) gp120 was transfected into 293T cells as described above. Subsequently, gp120 was recovered from supernatants using affinity chromatography. Approximately 5 × 106 CXCR4-PMPLs or 1 × 106 Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 5% FCS. HXBc2 gp120 (120 ng; 10 nm final concentration) was incubated with 1 µg of soluble CD4 for 1 h at 25 °C and the complexes added to the PMPLs/cells. Incubation proceeded for 1 additional hour at 25 °C. 1 µg of the C11 anti-gp120 antibody was then added and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. Tubes were washed once in PBS supplemented with 5% FCS and PMPLs/cells resuspended in 95 µl of PBS/5% FCS containing 5 µl of goat-α-human IgG-PE (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and washed 2 times in PBS, 0.5% BSA. Samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan with CellQuest software. Purified HXBc2 gp120 was prepared in 293T cells, as described above, and purified using affinity chromatography. The purified gp120 was iodinated to a specific activity of 500 Ci/mmol with IODO-BEADS (Pierce), as described by the manufacturer. 125I-labeled gp120 and unlabeled gp120 were incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of soluble CD4 (sCD4) for 1 h at 37 °C. Approximately 1 × 107 CXCR4-PMPLs were resuspended in 100 µl PBS, 5% FCS containing 0.5 nm125I-labeled gp120 (complexed with sCD4) and varying amounts of unlabeled gp120 (1 nm to 3 µm) (complexed with sCD4) in duplicate. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C, washed twice in PBS, 5% FCS, and read on a gamma counter. The cxcr4 gene was codon-optimized, cloned into the PACH vector, and overexpressed in a Cf2Th cell line in the same manner as described previously for CCR5 (23Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence for the bovine rhodopsin C9 peptide, which is recognized by the 1D4 antibody, was introduced immediately 5′ to the natural stop codon of the cxcr4 gene. The expressed CXCR4 thus contained the C9 peptide at the intracellular C terminus, permitting its purification with the 1D4 antibody (24Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) regardless of the conformational integrity of CXCR4. The level of expression of CXCR4 by the Cf2Th cells was assayed by FACS using the 12G5 antibody. Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells exhibited an ∼400-fold shift in mean fluorescence intensity above that seen when an isotype-matched control antibody was used (data not shown). We wished to solubilize and purify CXCR4 from the Cf2Th-CXCR4 cell line while maintaining its native conformation. The detergent used for solubilization is a critical parameter in this process and must be determined empirically. A panel of ∼100 detergents, including maltosides, glucosides, brijs, ethyl ethers, CHAPS/CHAPSO, HEGAs, MEGAs, and Fos-CholinesTM, was tested. The standard buffer used for solubilization consisted of 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture, and 1% of the detergents listed previously. The conformational integrity of CXCR4 in the cell lysates was monitored by precipitation of CXCR4 by the conformation-dependent anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5. The amount of CXCR4 precipitated by 12G5 was then compared with that precipitated by the 1D4 antibody, which recognizes the linear C9 epitope and is not influenced by CXCR4 conformation. It was determined that CHAPSO was the best detergent for maintaining the native conformation of CXCR4; a high percentage of the CXCR4 protein solubilized in CHAPSO was precipitated by 12G5. Fig.1A shows a representative precipitation of CXCR4 with 12G5 and 1D4, as well as some other conformation-dependent anti-CXCR4 antibodies (44708.111 and 44716.111). All of the antibodies precipitated the 47-kDa mature CXCR4 protein and a 34-kDa form. A small amount of 24-kDa protein was precipitated by all of the antibodies except 1D4; this may represent a CXCR4 variant lacking the C terminus. These data demonstrate that CXCR4 is maintained in a native conformation in cell lysates containing CHAPSO. The ability to precipitate CXCR4 with conformation-dependent antibodies from cell lysates prepared in CHAPSO suggested that CXCR4 was maintained in a native conformation. To assay the conformational state of CXCR4 solubilized in CHAPSO detergent further, we asked if CXCR4 in cell lysates could bind its natural ligand, SDF-1α. This was tested using an SDF1α-Ig fusion protein. SDF1α-Ig consists of SDF-1α bound to the Fc domain of human IgG1 through a flexible linker. When expressed in 293T cells, SDF1α-Ig is secreted into the growth medium. The presence of the Fc domain allows for isolation of SDF1α-Ig using protein A. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding SDF1α-Ig, and the cells were radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine and -methionine. Culture supernatants containing labeled SDF1α-Ig were collected and incubated with cell lysates containing either CXCR4 or CCR5. Samples were precipitated with the 1D4 antibody directed against the C9 peptide tags at the C termini of CXCR4 and CCR5 (Fig. 1B). The 1D4 antibody coprecipitated labeled SDF1α-Ig from lysates containing CXCR4 but not from CCR5-containing lysates. The total amount of SDF1α-Ig in the sample was determined by precipitation with protein A-Sepharose (SDF1α-Ig +C in Fig. 1B). This coprecipitation experiment was also done in reverse. Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells were metabolically labeled, solubilized with CHAPSO-containing buffer and the lysate incubated with unlabeled SDF1α-Ig-containing supernatant and protein A-Sepharose. Fig.1C shows the precipitation of CXCR4 with the 1D4 and 12G5 antibodies and with SDF1α-Ig. An Ig protein (identical with that found in the SDF1α-Ig fusion protein) was also used as negative control. 1D4, 12G5, and SDF1α-Ig all precipitated CXCR4 from cell lysates; however, the control Ig protein did not. Together these data demonstrate that CXCR4 contained in cell lysates is in a native conformation and can bind its natural ligand, SDF-1α. The stability of solubilized chemokine receptors is short lived, limiting utility (22Mirzabekov T. Kontos H. Farzan M. Marasco W. Sodroski J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, CHAPSO-solubilized CXCR4 was incorporated into PMPLs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of a lipid bilayer stabilizes the conformation of CXCR4 bound to the Dynabead. CHAPSO was an excellent detergent in this context because of its high critical micelle concentration (8 mm), allowing for rapid diffusion of the detergent and its replacement by lipid. To determine if CXCR4 was in a native conformation in PMPLs, we stained the CXCR4-PMPLs with two separate PE-conjugated antibodies (12G5 and 44717.111) specific for CXCR4. The PMPLs were analyzed by FACS, and the results are shown in Fig. 2A.Both antibodies recognized CXCR4 on the PMPLs. Isotype-matched controls were also used, and no shift in fluorescence was observed compared with unstained PMPLs (data not shown). Also, CCR5-PMPLs were stained with the anti-CXCR4 antibodies and no specific staining was observed (data not shown). The affinity of conformation-dependent antibodies for CXCR4-PMPLs was compared with that seen using Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells. Varying concentrations of antibodies were incubated with both Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells and CXCR4-PMPLs, and the fluorescence intensity measured by FACS for each concentration of antibody was plotted (Fig. 2B). The binding profiles for both antibodies were essentially equivalent for both Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells and CXCR4-PMPLs. This demonstrates that the conformation of CXCR4 found in PMPLs resembles that of CXCR4 naturally expressed in cell membranes. To examine the binding of SDF-1α to CXCR4-PMPLs and Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells, competition experiments were performed using125I-labeled SDF-1α with varying concentrations of cold SDF-1α competitor. As shown in Fig. 3, the competition profiles for SDF-1α on Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells and CXCR4-PMPLs were nearly identical. In contrast, SDF-1α exhibited minimal binding to CCR5-PMPLs. This demonstrates that CXCR4 contained in PMPLs is in a native conformation and can bind its ligand, SDF-1α, with wild-type affinity. To study binding of HIV-1 gp120 to CXCR4-PMPLs, soluble gp120 from the X4 HIV-1 strain HXBc2 was expressed transiently in 293T cells. Binding studies were performed using CXCR4- and CCR5-PMPLs and culture medium containing HXBc2 gp120 metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine and -methionine. PMPLs were incubated with gp120-containing culture medium in the presence of soluble CD4 (sCD4). PMPLs were then solubilized, and the bound gp120 was precipitated with the anti-gp120 antibody C11 (Fig.4A, right panel). The gp120 glycoprotein from an R5 HIV-1 strain, ADA, bound CCR5-PMPLs but exhibited minimal binding to CXCR4-PMPLs (data not shown). Interestingly, when this experiment was repeated using CXCR4- and CCR5-expressing cells, a quite different result was seen. HXBc2 gp120 bound equally well to CCR5- and CXCR4-expressing Cf2Th cells (Fig. 4A, left panel), yet ADA gp120 exhibited specific binding only to CCR5-expressing cells (data not shown).

Whether Sec22p exhibits its primary role at the ER or the Golgi apparatus is still a matter of debate. To determine the role of Sec22p in intracellular transport more precisely, we performed a synthetic lethality screen.

Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, vectorial transport between distinct compartments mainly involves small coated vesicles whose formation from the donor membrane is mediated by proteinaceous coats, either COPI, COPII, or clathrin. After uncoating, vesicles fuse selectively with an acceptor membrane (heterotypic fusion; see Ref. 2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Both homotypic and heterotypic fusion events rely on specific attachment reactions to guarantee that only appropriate membranes can mix. The membrane attachment itself consists of two steps, tethering and docking, involving different sets of proteins (3Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 4Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Tethering factors are peripherally membrane-associated protein complexes consisting of up to 10 different subunits, which share little sequence similarity.The subsequent docking stage involves specific sets of membrane-anchored proteins, so-called SNARE proteins (SNARE issoluble NSF (forN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)attachment protein receptor) (5Söllner T.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SNAREs are inserted into the membrane either by a C-terminal transmembrane domain or through lipid moieties attached to C-terminal cysteine residues. In contrast to the tethering factors, all known SNARE proteins are members of either of three protein families: the syntaxins, the synaptobrevins or VAMPs, and the SNAP-25 family members. To induce membrane fusion, SNARE proteins from apposed membranes must interact intrans. The formation of a stable four-helix bundle may generate enough energy to promote mixing of the lipid bilayer (8Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar).Lipid mixing experiments using SNARE complexes reconstituted into lipid bilayer vesicles indicated that only cognate SNARE combinations are able to induce fusion (11McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, SNARE proteins are rather promiscuous when the formation of the tight SDS or heat-resistant SNARE complexes is analyzed (12Yang B. Gonzalez L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Moreover, SNARE proteins can be part of more than one SNARE complex in vivo (14Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and some SNARE proteins can functionally replace each other (15Götte M. Gallwitz D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In vitro the synaptobrevin/VAMP homologs Snc1p and Snc2p in yeast can be replaced by two other members of the synaptobrevin family, the ER-Golgi SNARE Sec22p and the vacuolar SNARE Nyv1p (11McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, these SNAREs are unable to replace Snc1/2p in vivo (17Grote E. Vlacich G. Pypaert M. Novick P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4051-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), probably because they are retained in their specific compartments. Thus, the targeting of SNAREs to the right compartment is one way to increase the specificity of intracellular membrane attachment/fusion events.We analyzed previously (18Ballensiefen W. Ossipov D. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the targeting of the ER-to-Golgi SNARE Sec22p and show that the correct targeting of Sec22p involves its recycling from the Golgi to the ER via COPI-coated vesicles. In this respect, Sec22p as well as Bos1p (19Ossipov D. Schröder-Köhne S. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4135-4142PubMed Google Scholar) behave like ER-resident proteins that carry a KKXX ER-retrieval signal (20Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The coat of COPI vesicles in mammalian cells and yeast consists of seven subunits (α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ε-, and ζ-COP) and the small GTPase, ARF1 (21Wieland F. Harter C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The observations made by Letourneur et al. (20Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that KKXX-tagged proteins require COPI components for retrieval from Golgi to the ER provided first evidence that COPI vesicles mediate this retrograde transport. The same is true not only for Sec22p but also for other yeast proteins that recycle from Golgi to ER, for example, Emp47p, a Golgi lectin-like protein; Erd2p, the HDEL receptor; Sed5p, a Golgi-localized syntaxin homolog; and Mnn1p, a glycosyltransferase (23Schröder-Köhne S.

The SEC22gene was first isolated by us as a multicopy suppressor of defects in the small GTPase Ypt1p involved in ER-to-Golgi transport (namedSLY2; see Ref. 27Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Later SLY2 was found to be identical to SEC22 (28Newman A.P. Graf J. Mancini P. Rossi G. Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3663-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for which conditional mutant alleles had been identified by Novick et al. (29Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Like several other SNARE proteins, Sec22p can be a component of more than just one SNARE complex. Its physical interaction with the SNARE proteins Sed5p, Bos1p, Bet1p, and other Golgi SNARE proteins argues for a role in anterograde traffic from ER-to-Golgi (6Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R.

Sec22p also co-precipitates with the ER proteins Ufe1p and Sec20p that function in retrograde Golgi-ER transport (24Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B.

However, this defect, as with many other mutants affected in retrograde transport, could be a secondary effect. In vitro assays performed with permeabilized mutant cells showed that the sec22-3 mutation does not slow down forward transport but does inhibit retrograde transport (38Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 39Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion reconstituted with liposomes containing the ER-to-Golgi SNARE Bet1p requires the presence of Sec22p along with Sed5p and Bos1p on the opposing membranes to drive fusion (11McNew J.A.

In mammalian cells the Sec22p homolog sec22b coprecipitates with syntaxin 5 (∼Sed5p), rbet1 (∼Bet1p), and membrin (∼Bos1p) (41Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as well as syntaxin 18, which may be functionally equivalent to Ufe1p (42Hatsuzawa K. Hirose H. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Scheller R.H. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13713-13720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dual function of Sec22p may be conserved throughout evolution.To obtain additional clues to the function of Sec22p, we used a genetic approach. SEC22 is not essential for cell viability (27Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We tried to find mutant yeast strains in which SEC22 became essential. A new allele of yeast ORF YNL258c showed synthetic lethality with sec22Δ. Mutants inYNL258c were recently shown to be dependent on a dominant allele of SLY1, a suppressor of many ER-to-Golgi transport defects, and the gene was named DSL1 (43VanRheenen S.M. Reilly B.A. Chamberlain S.J. Waters M.G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 212-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidence was provided for a function of Dsl1p in ER-to-Golgi forward transport. Genetic interaction of some dsl1 mutants with the γ-COP-encoding SEC21 gene also suggested a role of Dsl1p in retrograde Golgi-to-ER traffic (43VanRheenen S.M. Reilly B.A. Chamberlain S.J. Waters M.G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 212-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We show that a new allele ofDSL1, dsl1-22, isolated in our screen indeed affects Golgi-to-ER retrieval of several proteins with only slight effects on forward transport. dsl1-22 interacts genetically with factors required for retrograde traffic, and Dsl1p binds coatomer. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for a direct role of Dsl1p in Golgi-to-ER traffic. Membrane-bound compartments in eukaryotic cells can fuse directly as shown for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and mitotic Golgi fragments as well as endosomal and lysosomal compartments (homotypic fusion; see Ref. 1Rothman J.E.

However, vectorial transport between distinct compartments mainly involves small coated vesicles whose formation from the donor membrane is mediated by proteinaceous coats, either COPI, COPII, or clathrin. After uncoating, vesicles fuse selectively with an acceptor membrane (heterotypic fusion; see Ref. 2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Both homotypic and heterotypic fusion events rely on specific attachment reactions to guarantee that only appropriate membranes can mix. The membrane attachment itself consists of two steps, tethering and docking, involving different sets of proteins (3Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 4Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Tethering factors are peripherally membrane-associated protein complexes consisting of up to 10 different subunits, which share little sequence similarity. The subsequent docking stage involves specific sets of membrane-anchored proteins, so-called SNARE proteins (SNARE issoluble NSF (forN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)attachment protein receptor) (5Söllner T. Whitehart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 6Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SNAREs are inserted into the membrane either by a C-terminal transmembrane domain or through lipid moieties attached to C-terminal cysteine residues. In contrast to the tethering factors, all known SNARE proteins are members of either of three protein families: the syntaxins, the synaptobrevins or VAMPs, and the SNAP-25 family members. To induce membrane fusion, SNARE proteins from apposed membranes must interact intrans. The formation of a stable four-helix bundle may generate enough energy to promote mixing of the lipid bilayer (8Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Lipid mixing experiments using SNARE complexes reconstituted into lipid bilayer vesicles indicated that only cognate SNARE combinations are able to induce fusion (11McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, SNARE proteins are rather promiscuous when the formation of the tight SDS or heat-resistant SNARE complexes is analyzed (12Yang B. Gonzalez L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Moreover, SNARE proteins can be part of more than one SNARE complex in vivo (14Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and some SNARE proteins can functionally replace each other (15Götte M. Gallwitz D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In vitro the synaptobrevin/VAMP homologs Snc1p and Snc2p in yeast can be replaced by two other members of the synaptobrevin family, the ER-Golgi SNARE Sec22p and the vacuolar SNARE Nyv1p (11McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, these SNAREs are unable to replace Snc1/2p in vivo (17Grote E. Vlacich G. Pypaert M. Novick P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4051-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), probably because they are retained in their specific compartments. Thus, the targeting of SNAREs to the right compartment is one way to increase the specificity of intracellular membrane attachment/fusion events. We analyzed previously (18Ballensiefen W. Ossipov D. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the targeting of the ER-to-Golgi SNARE Sec22p and show that the correct targeting of Sec22p involves its recycling from the Golgi to the ER via COPI-coated vesicles. In this respect, Sec22p as well as Bos1p (19Ossipov D. Schröder-Köhne S. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4135-4142PubMed Google Scholar) behave like ER-resident proteins that carry a KKXX ER-retrieval signal (20Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The coat of COPI vesicles in mammalian cells and yeast consists of seven subunits (α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ε-, and ζ-COP) and the small GTPase, ARF1 (21Wieland F. Harter C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The observations made by Letourneur et al. (20Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and Cossonet al. (22Cosson P. Démollière C. Hennecke S. Duden R. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that KKXX-tagged proteins require COPI components for retrieval from Golgi to the ER provided first evidence that COPI vesicles mediate this retrograde transport. The same is true not only for Sec22p but also for other yeast proteins that recycle from Golgi to ER, for example, Emp47p, a Golgi lectin-like protein; Erd2p, the HDEL receptor; Sed5p, a Golgi-localized syntaxin homolog; and Mnn1p, a glycosyltransferase (23Schröder-Köhne S. Letourneur F. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3459-3470PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B.

Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). How Sec22p is sorted into COPI vesicles is currently unknown. Moreover, the function of Sec22p is not entirely understood. The SEC22gene was first isolated by us as a multicopy suppressor of defects in the small GTPase Ypt1p involved in ER-to-Golgi transport (namedSLY2; see Ref. 27Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Later SLY2 was found to be identical to SEC22 (28Newman A.P. Graf J. Mancini P. Rossi G. Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3663-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for which conditional mutant alleles had been identified by Novick et al. (29Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Like several other SNARE proteins, Sec22p can be a component of more than just one SNARE complex. Its physical interaction with the SNARE proteins Sed5p, Bos1p, Bet1p, and other Golgi SNARE proteins argues for a role in anterograde traffic from ER-to-Golgi (6Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 30Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S.

Sec22p also co-precipitates with the ER proteins Ufe1p and Sec20p that function in retrograde Golgi-ER transport (24Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Lewis M.J. Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R.B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 93-97PubMed Google Scholar). sec22 mutants lead to a defect in forward traffic (34Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 35Newman A.P. Shim J. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Cell.

Trepte H.H. Schmitt H.D. Gallwitz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2980-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, this defect, as with many other mutants affected in retrograde transport, could be a secondary effect. In vitro assays performed with permeabilized mutant cells showed that the sec22-3 mutation does not slow down forward transport but does inhibit retrograde transport (38Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 39Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion reconstituted with liposomes containing the ER-to-Golgi SNARE Bet1p requires the presence of Sec22p along with Sed5p and Bos1p on the opposing membranes to drive fusion (11McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 40Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells the Sec22p homolog sec22b coprecipitates with syntaxin 5 (∼Sed5p), rbet1 (∼Bet1p), and membrin (∼Bos1p) (41Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as well as syntaxin 18, which may be functionally equivalent to Ufe1p (42Hatsuzawa K. Hirose H. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Scheller R.H. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13713-13720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dual function of Sec22p may be conserved throughout evolution. To obtain additional clues to the function of Sec22p, we used a genetic approach. SEC22 is not essential for cell viability (27Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We tried to find mutant yeast strains in which SEC22 became essential. A new allele of yeast ORF YNL258c showed synthetic lethality with sec22Δ. Mutants inYNL258c were recently shown to be dependent on a dominant allele of SLY1, a suppressor of many ER-to-Golgi transport defects, and the gene was named DSL1 (43VanRheenen S.M. Reilly B.A. Chamberlain S.J. Waters M.G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 212-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidence was provided for a function of Dsl1p in ER-to-Golgi forward transport. Genetic interaction of some dsl1 mutants with the γ-COP-encoding SEC21 gene also suggested a role of Dsl1p in retrograde Golgi-to-ER traffic (43VanRheenen S.M. Reilly B.A. Chamberlain S.J. Waters M.G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 212-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We show that a new allele ofDSL1, dsl1-22, isolated in our screen indeed affects Golgi-to-ER retrieval of several proteins with only slight effects on forward transport. dsl1-22 interacts genetically with factors required for retrograde traffic, and Dsl1p binds coatomer. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for a direct role of Dsl1p in Golgi-to-ER traffic.

By using a human neuroblastoma cell line lacking all the neurotrophin receptors and derived clones expressing the full-length or truncated forms of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), we have been able to demonstrate that the neuronal death induced by the prion protein fragment PrP-(106–126) is an active process mediated by a) the binding of the peptide to the extracellular region of p75NTR, b) the signaling function of the intracytoplasmic region of the receptor, and c) the activation of caspase-8 and the production of oxidant species.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13383-13636Crossref Scopus (5087) Google Scholar, 2Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Nature. 1997; 389: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). So far, the mechanisms by which the extracellular deposition of PrPSc, a protein characterized by its high content of β-pleated sheet and ability to form amyloid fibrils, elicits the neuropathological changes of the prion diseases, i.e. spongiform degeneration, neuronal loss, and appearance of reactive astrocytes and microglial cells (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13383-13636Crossref Scopus (5087) Google Scholar), had remained unknown.In recent years, it has been demonstrated that a prion protein fragment, PrP-(106–126), could induce neuronal death by apoptosis in rat hippocampal cultures (3Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). This peptide mimics the physico-chemical properties of PrPSc by exhibiting a prevalent β-pleated structure and forming amyloid fibrillar aggregates that are partially resistant to proteolysis (4Selvaggini C. De Gioia L. Cantù L. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L. Passerini F. Forloni G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The ability of PrP-(106–126) to elicit a neurotoxic effect has been widely confirmed (5Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 6Florio T. Thellung S. Amico C. Robello M. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Forloni G. Schettini G. J. Neurosci.

So far, the knowledge of such mechanisms had remained rather limited despite a series of recent findings, the most significant of which are: a) the binding of the prion peptide to cellular prion protein PrPC and the consequent inhibition of PrPC function (9Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); b) the perturbation of ion (especially calcium) homeostasis (6Florio T. Thellung S. Amico C. Robello M. Salmona M. Bugiani O.

Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).In the search for a prion receptor we focused our attention on the p75 low affinity NGF receptor, which belongs to the family of death receptors (13Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar) and can trigger apoptosis (14Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde A-Y.

Neurobiol. 1999; 20: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rationale of this investigation was 2-fold. First, it has been observed that PrP-(106–126) exhibits a prevalent β-sheet structure and forms fibrillar aggregates similarly to β-amyloid peptides (4Selvaggini C. De Gioia L. Cantù L. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L. Passerini F. Forloni G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Second, the β-amyloid peptides of Alzheimer's disease may exert their neurotoxic action via an interaction with p75NTR (17Rabizadeh S. Bittler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10703-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin.

The data herein presented support the view that the prion peptide-mediated cell damage occurs through its interaction with the p75 neurotrophin receptor.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have studied the effects of PrP-(106–126) on both the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells (BENTR-free), which express neither p75NTR nor any of the high affinity neurotrophin receptors (Trks) (20Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and SK-N-BE cell clones expressing the full-length p75NTR (BEp75) (Fig.1). The cell damage was analyzed by double staining of the specimens with both the cell-permeable acridine orange and the cell-impermeable ethidium bromide (21Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwald L.A. Cells, A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1998: 15.6-15.7Google Scholar) as shown in Fig.2. The results of these analyses, summarized in Fig. 3, Aand B, demonstrate that PrP-(106–126) could induce cell death in BEp75 cell clones, while being totally harmless forBENTR-free parental cells and for SK-N-BE cells transfected with an empty pCEP4β vector (not shown). Importantly, the neurotoxic action of PrP-(106–126) on BEp75 cell clones was detectable already at very low concentrations (Fig. 3C). Scrambled PrP-(106–126) was unable to induce cell death in either cell clones (not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that p75NTR is involved in the neurotoxic activity of prion peptide.Figure 3Time-course and dose-response of the effect of PrP -(106–126).

This receptor might be merely permissive for the cytotoxic action of PrP-(106–126) elicited via a mechanism independent of the actual binding of the peptide as in the case of excitotoxicity (22Oh J.D. Chartisathian K. Chase T.N. Butcher L.L. Brain Res. 2000; 853: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the binding of prion peptide to p75NTR might be directly involved in cell death. A series of experimental findings shows that the latter mechanism is the most likely one.First, we have treated SK-N-BE-derived cell clones expressing a truncated p75NTR (BEp75ΔECD) (Fig. 1) lacking the four cysteine-rich repeats of the extracellular region either with PrP-(106–126) or with staurosporine. The results (Fig.4) show that, while being still susceptible to staurosporine-elicited apoptosis,BEp75ΔECD cells were insensitive to the cytotoxic effects of PrP-(106–126), a finding indicating the requirement of the extracellular region of p75NTR for the cytotoxic effect of PrP-(106–126).Figure 4Cell damage by PrP -(106–126) and by staurosporine in different cell clones.

In fact, the results reported in Fig.5A show that125I-PrP-(106–126) binds to BEp75 cells but not to BENTR-free cells or to BEp75ΔECDcells lacking the extracellular region of the receptor. The specificity of the binding was shown by its competitive inhibition by an excess of cold aggregated PrP-(106–126). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 5C) showed that the binding of the aggregated peptide to p75NTRoccurs with a kd of 4.6 ± 0.7 nm (n = 4) and is saturable (Fig.5B). The specificity of the binding was also shown by the finding that it was inhibited by the antibody sc-6189 raised against the amino terminus of p75NTR (Fig. 5D) and by NGF (Fig. 5E). Since NGF binds to p75NTR with akd of 4–7 nm (18Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which is similar to that of PrP-(106–126), the high concentration of NGF required for inhibiting the binding of the prion peptide may indicate that the two ligands interact with different sites of p75NTR.Figure 5Specific binding of125I-PrP-(106–126) to p75NTR-expressing clones.A,binding of labeled peptide to whole cells of different clones in the presence or absence of unlabeled aggregated peptide.

Two mechanisms could be hypothesized. The binding of the prion peptide to p75NTRmight be able to activate the receptor and trigger the signals for cell death via the receptor's intracellular region or it could serve solely as an anchorage allowing for PrP-(106–126)-induced cell damage via other mechanisms. We demonstrated the validity of the first hypothesis by investigating the effect of PrP-(106–126) on cell clones expressing a truncated p75NTR devoid of the entire intracellular region (BEp75ΔICD) (Fig. 1). The results reported in Fig.4 show that these cells, despite normally binding the peptide (Fig.5A), were insensitive to its toxic effect indicating that the intracellular region of the receptor is necessary for signaling cell death.We have also investigated some of the biochemical events usually involved in active cell death. The results (Fig.6) demonstrate that p75NTR-mediated cell death induced by PrP-(106–126) is associated with the activation of caspases as it was fully suppressed by either Z-VAD-FMK (100 µm), a nonspecific inhibitor of caspases, or Z-IETD-FMK (20 µm), an inhibitor of receptor-activable caspase-8. These findings are consistent with the concept that prion peptide-elicited neuronal cell death via p75NTR is an active process that, by involving caspase-8, is reminiscent of the cell death induced by other members of the death receptors family (13Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). The data of Fig. 6 show that the cytotoxic effect of 50 nm staurosporine, a receptor-independent apoptogenic drug, was sensitive to Z-VAD-FMK but could not be suppressed by Z-IETD-FMK. The results of Fig. 6 also show that diphenyleneiodonium (100 nm), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, the enzyme forming reactive oxygen intermediates, and other flavo-protein dehydrogenases (23O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), could fully suppress the cell death by PrP-(106–126) mediated by p75NTR. This finding agrees with the notion that an oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of cell damage by prion peptide (12Guentchev M. Voigtlander T. Haberler C. Groschup M.H. Budka H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Figure 6Effect of inhibitors on the cell damage by PrP -(106–126) and by staurosporine.

These problems include the types of interaction such as the type of interaction of the prion peptide with the extracellular region of p75NTR, the signaling function of the different domains of the intracellular region, the identification of the events occurring down-stream the intracellular region (24Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 25Meldolesi J. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Trends Pharmacol.

J. 2000; 352: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The therapeutic and/or preventive strategies concerning the prion diseases are related to the mechanisms of formation and propagation of PrPSc and to the pathogenesis of the neuronal damage by PrPSc. It is likely that the results presented herein obtained by using the model of PrP-(106–126)-neurotoxic effect open new avenues for effective therapeutic strategies. Further studies will clarify if the neurotoxicity of purified infective PrPScprotein involves mechanisms similar to those of the PrP-(106–126) peptide. The aetiological agent of the prion diseases, a set of sporadic, genetic, and infectious neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals, has been proposed to be an aberrant isoform of the cell surface glycoprotein (PrPC)1 named Scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), which arises posttranslationally via conformational changes converting PrPC into PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13383-13636Crossref Scopus (5087) Google Scholar, 2Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Nature. 1997; 389: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). So far, the mechanisms by which the extracellular deposition of PrPSc, a protein characterized by its high content of β-pleated sheet and ability to form amyloid fibrils, elicits the neuropathological changes of the prion diseases, i.e. spongiform degeneration, neuronal loss, and appearance of reactive astrocytes and microglial cells (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13383-13636Crossref Scopus (5087) Google Scholar), had remained unknown. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that a prion protein fragment, PrP-(106–126), could induce neuronal death by apoptosis in rat hippocampal cultures (3Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). This peptide mimics the physico-chemical properties of PrPSc by exhibiting a prevalent β-pleated structure and forming amyloid fibrillar aggregates that are partially resistant to proteolysis (4Selvaggini C. De Gioia L. Cantù L. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L. Passerini F. Forloni G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The ability of PrP-(106–126) to elicit a neurotoxic effect has been widely confirmed (5Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 6Florio T. Thellung S. Amico C. Robello M. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Forloni G. Schettini G. J. Neurosci.

So far, the knowledge of such mechanisms had remained rather limited despite a series of recent findings, the most significant of which are: a) the binding of the prion peptide to cellular prion protein PrPC and the consequent inhibition of PrPC function (9Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); b) the perturbation of ion (especially calcium) homeostasis (6Florio T. Thellung S. Amico C. Robello M. Salmona M. Bugiani O.

Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In the search for a prion receptor we focused our attention on the p75 low affinity NGF receptor, which belongs to the family of death receptors (13Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar) and can trigger apoptosis (14Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde A-Y. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 15Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S.

Neurobiol. 1999; 20: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rationale of this investigation was 2-fold. First, it has been observed that PrP-(106–126) exhibits a prevalent β-sheet structure and forms fibrillar aggregates similarly to β-amyloid peptides (4Selvaggini C. De Gioia L. Cantù L. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L. Passerini F. Forloni G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Second, the β-amyloid peptides of Alzheimer's disease may exert their neurotoxic action via an interaction with p75NTR (17Rabizadeh S. Bittler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10703-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin.

The data herein presented support the view that the prion peptide-mediated cell damage occurs through its interaction with the p75 neurotrophin receptor. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have studied the effects of PrP-(106–126) on both the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells (BENTR-free), which express neither p75NTR nor any of the high affinity neurotrophin receptors (Trks) (20Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and SK-N-BE cell clones expressing the full-length p75NTR (BEp75) (Fig.1). The cell damage was analyzed by double staining of the specimens with both the cell-permeable acridine orange and the cell-impermeable ethidium bromide (21Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwald L.A. Cells, A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1998: 15.6-15.7Google Scholar) as shown in Fig.2. The results of these analyses, summarized in Fig. 3, Aand B, demonstrate that PrP-(106–126) could induce cell death in BEp75 cell clones, while being totally harmless forBENTR-free parental cells and for SK-N-BE cells transfected with an empty pCEP4β vector (not shown). Importantly, the neurotoxic action of PrP-(106–126) on BEp75 cell clones was detectable already at very low concentrations (Fig. 3C). Scrambled PrP-(106–126) was unable to induce cell death in either cell clones (not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that p75NTR is involved in the neurotoxic activity of prion peptide.Two mechanisms could be responsible for the function of p75NTR in the cell damage by the prion peptide. This receptor might be merely permissive for the cytotoxic action of PrP-(106–126) elicited via a mechanism independent of the actual binding of the peptide as in the case of excitotoxicity (22Oh J.D. Chartisathian K. Chase T.N. Butcher L.L. Brain Res. 2000; 853: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the binding of prion peptide to p75NTR might be directly involved in cell death. A series of experimental findings shows that the latter mechanism is the most likely one.First, we have treated SK-N-BE-derived cell clones expressing a truncated p75NTR (BEp75ΔECD) (Fig. 1) lacking the four cysteine-rich repeats of the extracellular region either with PrP-(106–126) or with staurosporine. The results (Fig.4) show that, while being still susceptible to staurosporine-elicited apoptosis,BEp75ΔECD cells were insensitive to the cytotoxic effects of PrP-(106–126), a finding indicating the requirement of the extracellular region of p75NTR for the cytotoxic effect of PrP-(106–126).Figure 4Cell damage by PrP -(106–126) and by staurosporine in different cell clones.

In fact, the results reported in Fig.5A show that125I-PrP-(106–126) binds to BEp75 cells but not to BENTR-free cells or to BEp75ΔECDcells lacking the extracellular region of the receptor. The specificity of the binding was shown by its competitive inhibition by an excess of cold aggregated PrP-(106–126). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 5C) showed that the binding of the aggregated peptide to p75NTRoccurs with a kd of 4.6 ± 0.7 nm (n = 4) and is saturable (Fig.5B). The specificity of the binding was also shown by the finding that it was inhibited by the antibody sc-6189 raised against the amino terminus of p75NTR (Fig. 5D) and by NGF (Fig. 5E). Since NGF binds to p75NTR with akd of 4–7 nm (18Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which is similar to that of PrP-(106–126), the high concentration of NGF required for inhibiting the binding of the prion peptide may indicate that the two ligands interact with different sites of p75NTR.Figure 5Specific binding of125I-PrP-(106–126) to p75NTR-expressing clones.A,binding of labeled peptide to whole cells of different clones in the presence or absence of unlabeled aggregated peptide.

Two mechanisms could be hypothesized. The binding of the prion peptide to p75NTRmight be able to activate the receptor and trigger the signals for cell death via the receptor's intracellular region or it could serve solely as an anchorage allowing for PrP-(106–126)-induced cell damage via other mechanisms. We demonstrated the validity of the first hypothesis by investigating the effect of PrP-(106–126) on cell clones expressing a truncated p75NTR devoid of the entire intracellular region (BEp75ΔICD) (Fig. 1). The results reported in Fig.4 show that these cells, despite normally binding the peptide (Fig.5A), were insensitive to its toxic effect indicating that the intracellular region of the receptor is necessary for signaling cell death.We have also investigated some of the biochemical events usually involved in active cell death. The results (Fig.6) demonstrate that p75NTR-mediated cell death induced by PrP-(106–126) is associated with the activation of caspases as it was fully suppressed by either Z-VAD-FMK (100 µm), a nonspecific inhibitor of caspases, or Z-IETD-FMK (20 µm), an inhibitor of receptor-activable caspase-8. These findings are consistent with the concept that prion peptide-elicited neuronal cell death via p75NTR is an active process that, by involving caspase-8, is reminiscent of the cell death induced by other members of the death receptors family (13Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). The data of Fig. 6 show that the cytotoxic effect of 50 nm staurosporine, a receptor-independent apoptogenic drug, was sensitive to Z-VAD-FMK but could not be suppressed by Z-IETD-FMK. The results of Fig. 6 also show that diphenyleneiodonium (100 nm), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, the enzyme forming reactive oxygen intermediates, and other flavo-protein dehydrogenases (23O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), could fully suppress the cell death by PrP-(106–126) mediated by p75NTR. This finding agrees with the notion that an oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of cell damage by prion peptide (12Guentchev M. Voigtlander T. Haberler C. Groschup M.H. Budka H.

The specificity of the binding was also shown by the finding that it was inhibited by the antibody sc-6189 raised against the amino terminus of p75NTR (Fig. 5D) and by NGF (Fig. 5E). Since NGF binds to p75NTR with akd of 4–7 nm (18Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which is similar to that of PrP-(106–126), the high concentration of NGF required for inhibiting the binding of the prion peptide may indicate that the two ligands interact with different sites of p75NTR. The results so far presented, showing that PrP-(106–126) is cytotoxic by binding to p75NTR, raise the problem of the role of this receptor in cell death induced by the peptide. Two mechanisms could be hypothesized. The binding of the prion peptide to p75NTRmight be able to activate the receptor and trigger the signals for cell death via the receptor's intracellular region or it could serve solely as an anchorage allowing for PrP-(106–126)-induced cell damage via other mechanisms. We demonstrated the validity of the first hypothesis by investigating the effect of PrP-(106–126) on cell clones expressing a truncated p75NTR devoid of the entire intracellular region (BEp75ΔICD) (Fig. 1). The results reported in Fig.4 show that these cells, despite normally binding the peptide (Fig.5A), were insensitive to its toxic effect indicating that the intracellular region of the receptor is necessary for signaling cell death. We have also investigated some of the biochemical events usually involved in active cell death. The results (Fig.6) demonstrate that p75NTR-mediated cell death induced by PrP-(106–126) is associated with the activation of caspases as it was fully suppressed by either Z-VAD-FMK (100 µm), a nonspecific inhibitor of caspases, or Z-IETD-FMK (20 µm), an inhibitor of receptor-activable caspase-8. These findings are consistent with the concept that prion peptide-elicited neuronal cell death via p75NTR is an active process that, by involving caspase-8, is reminiscent of the cell death induced by other members of the death receptors family (13Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). The data of Fig. 6 show that the cytotoxic effect of 50 nm staurosporine, a receptor-independent apoptogenic drug, was sensitive to Z-VAD-FMK but could not be suppressed by Z-IETD-FMK. The results of Fig. 6 also show that diphenyleneiodonium (100 nm), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, the enzyme forming reactive oxygen intermediates, and other flavo-protein dehydrogenases (23O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), could fully suppress the cell death by PrP-(106–126) mediated by p75NTR. This finding agrees with the notion that an oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of cell damage by prion peptide (12Guentchev M. Voigtlander T. Haberler C. Groschup M.H. Budka H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our results, showing that PrP-(106–126) damages neuronal cells by activating p75NTR, raise a series of problems to be investigated. These problems include the types of interaction such as the type of interaction of the prion peptide with the extracellular region of p75NTR, the signaling function of the different domains of the intracellular region, the identification of the events occurring down-stream the intracellular region (24Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 25Meldolesi J. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Trends Pharmacol.

The therapeutic and/or preventive strategies concerning the prion diseases are related to the mechanisms of formation and propagation of PrPSc and to the pathogenesis of the neuronal damage by PrPSc. It is likely that the results presented herein obtained by using the model of PrP-(106–126)-neurotoxic effect open new avenues for effective therapeutic strategies. Further studies will clarify if the neurotoxicity of purified infective PrPScprotein involves mechanisms similar to those of the PrP-(106–126) peptide. We thank Prof. S. Salvadori for the synthesis of PrP-(106–126) and Dr. M. Salmona (Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri (Milano, Italy) for the synthesis of scrambled PrP-(106–126)."

It is structurally and functionally distinct from the coatomer or COPI coat complex (5Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The primary function of the latter is believed to mediate retrograde transport in the early secretory pathway (6Cosson P. Letourneur F. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An outline of the events leading to COPII vesicle budding from the ER is now known (11Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the initiation of COPII vesicle budding, the small GTPase Sar1p (13Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) is first recruited onto the ER membrane, at least in part, through a guanine nucleotide exchange reaction catalyzed by the ER membrane protein Sec12p (14Barlowe C. Schekman R. Nature. 1993; 365: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Activated, GTP bound Sar1p on the membrane then recruits the Sec23p-Sec24p complex (15Hicke L. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sec23p is catalytically a GTPase activating protein of Sar1p (16Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Sec24p apparently does not influence the GTPase activating protein activity of Sec23p and although essential, its exact function is unclear (15Hicke L. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The resulting Sar1p/Sec23p-Sec24p complex appears to be important for cargo packaging (11Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R.

Bioassays. 1993; 15: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), on specific regions of the ER. These appear as vesicular “spotty” structures by light microscopy. The ERES are located in discrete positions of the ER reticulum and are found with the highest density at the perinuclear region, presumably where the ER membranes are in close apposition to the Golgi apparatus. At the ultrastructural level, immunogold labeling of COPII components can be found in distinct vesiculotubular structures devoid of ribosomes. These structures appear to be similar to structures where several viral proteins accumulate upon a low temperature (15 °C) treatment and which had been defined in terms such as vesicle-tubular structures (30Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (31Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a rough picture of the process of COPII budding has now emerged as outlined above, the mechanistic details are still missing. It is not known, for example, how each step of complex binding and interaction are regulated or coordinated. The COPII components are after all, cytosolic, and regulatory functions are probably executed by membrane components of the budding machinery. Little is known about the membrane components of the ERES, other than the expected presence of the mammalian homologue of the Sar1 GEF, the mammalian Sec12. We now show that mammalian membrane protein Yip1A, whose corresponding yeast homologue interacts with the yeast transport GTPase Ypt1p (32Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), is found at the ERES. Interestingly, Yip1A interacts with the Sec23-Sec24 complex of mammalian COPII. Data base searches were performed with the various Basic Local Alignment Search Tools (BLAST) algorithms (33Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Human and mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) clones were generated by the Washington University-MERCK EST projects, and were obtained from the IMAGE consortium via Research Genetics Inc. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out using high fidelity Pfu polymerase from Strategene. Fragments of the human Yip1A were generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the production of fusion proteins in bacteria or into a modified mammalian expression vector based on pCIneo (Promega) for Myc-tagged constructs. Library screening, cloning, and DNA sequencing were performed using standard methods as described (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Polyclonal antibodies against Yip1A in this study were obtained by immunization of mice and rabbits with a soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion construct corresponding to the hydrophilic N-terminal cytoplasmic region of Yip1A (GST-Yip1Acyto). Cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (21Tang B.L. Zhang T. Low D.Y.H. Wong E.T.

Cells plated on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by sequential incubation with the primary antibodies and FITC or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorescence labeling was visualized using an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with epifluorescence optics or MRC1024 (Bio-Rad) confocal laser optics. Cryosectioning and immunogold labeling for electron microscopy were performed as described previously (21Tang B.L. Zhang T. Low D.Y.H. Wong E.T. Horstmann H. Hong W. J. Biol.

Briefly, NRK cells grown to confluency were infected with the temperature-sensitive strain of the vesicular stomatitis virus, VSVts045 at 32 °C for 3–4 h. The cells were then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (100 µCi/ml) at the restrictive temperature (40 °C) for 10 min and perforated on ice by hypotonic swelling and scraping. These semi-intact cells were then incubated in a complete assay mixture of 40 µl containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 90 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm ATP, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase, 25 µg of rat liver cytosol, and 5 µl (25–30 µg) of protein for 1–2 × 105 of semi-intact cells. For a standard assay, samples were incubated for 90 min at 32 °C and transport terminated by transferring to ice. The membranes were collected by a brief spin and solubilized in 60 µl of 0.2% SDS, 50 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were digested overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 2.5 units of endoglycosidase H (endo H), and the reaction was terminated by adding 5 times concentrated gel sample buffer. The samples were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantified using the PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). As it was difficult to detect endogenous Yip1A in NRK cells by Western immunoblot, we transfected and selected a stable line of NRK with an elevated expression of Yip1A. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that the elevated expression did not change the steady state localization of Yip1A as detected by Yip1A antibody (not shown). The ER budding assay was performed according to Rowe et al. (37Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, NRK cells were infected with VSVts045 for 1 h at 32 °C and then shifted to 40 °C for 2 h to accumulate the mutant VSVG protein in the ER. VSV-infected NRK cells were harvested and homogenized using the Balch's homogenizer in 0.375 m sorbitol in 20 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.2. The homogenate was centrifuged briefly to remove nuclei and large debri, adjusted to 0.25 m sorbitol, and centrifuged at top speed for 5 min to pellet the microsomes. Microsome were resuspended in the transport assay mixture as above and the budding reaction initiated by the addition of cytosol and incubation at 32 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then adjusted to 0.25 m sorbitol and 150 mm potassium acetate, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (TLA 100 rotor, Beckman Instruments) for 1 min to generate the medium-speed pellet. The medium-speed supernatant was then centrifuged at 60,000 rpm with the same rotor to generate the high-speed pellet. Several mammalian (human and mouse) Yip1p-like sequences exist in the data base as EST clones. Complete DNA sequencing of some of these EST clones revealed two mammalian genes encoding proteins that share about 31% overall identity with yeast Yip1p (32Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and are about 61% identical to each other. We have named them Yip1A and Yip1B, respectively. An alignment between Yip1p, mouse Yip1A and mouse Yip1B is shown in Fig. 1A. Data base search using the Yip1A sequence revealed a family of homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (F32D8.4, T21659),Drosophila melanogaster (CG12404, AAF53235),Schizosaccharomyces pombe (T41464), and Arabidopsis thaliana (AAD21436) (Fig. 1 B). These proteins do not contain any discernable known functional domains. However, that they are members of a conserved family is also clearly illustrated by the similarity of their respective hydrophilicity profile (Fig.1 C). In addition to their overall homology, all of them have a hydrophilic N-terminal half followed by a hydrophobic C-terminal half with multiple potential membrane spanning domains. Yeast Yip1p had been shown to be a membrane protein with the hydrophilic N terminus facing the cytoplasm (32Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis with a cDNA fragment specific for Yip1A revealed two transcripts of about 1.8 and 2.8 kilobases in length with a fairly ubiquitously expression (Fig. 1 D). Yip1B, on the other hand, is encoded by a small transcript of about 1 kilobases in length and is found specifically in the heart. To investigate the subcellular location of Yip1A, we first expressed Myc-tagged Yip1A and Yip1B in cells. Indirect immunofluorescence with Myc antibody revealed that both Myc-tagged Yip1A and Yip1B are localized to membrane structures with a reticular ER-like background but are mainly concentrated at the juxtanuclear region (Fig.2, upper panels). The ER-like reticular background is more obvious for highly expressing cells. To investigate the subcellular localization of the endogenous protein, antibodies against the N-terminal hydrophilic portion of Yip1A were raised. Affinity purified rabbit antibodies detected a specific protein band of about 29 kDa in cell lysates (data not shown). Detection of the endogenous Yip1A in both primate (HeLa and Vero) and rodent (NRK) cells by indirect immunofluorescence using Yip1A antibodies revealed a pattern of vesicular structures. Although these structures can be found throughout the cell, they are concentrated at the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 2, lower panels). The labeling pattern of Yip1A is reminiscent of markers of the early secretory pathway. There is considerable co-localization between Yip1A with the KDEL receptor (38Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) at the light microscopy level (Fig.3, upper panels). Furthermore, like that of the KDEL receptor, the staining of Yip1A became more vesicular and scattered upon BFA treatment (Fig. 3, middle panels), a property characteristic of proteins in the early secretory pathway (38Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H-P. Yuan L.C.

Low S.H. Hauri H-P. Hong W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 398-410PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment with the microtubule disrupting drug, nocodazole, scattered the juxtanuclear labeling of both Yip1A and the KDEL receptor (38Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) into smaller membrane islets with a more peripheral distribution. The labeling pattern of Yip1A is also highly reminiscent of that of mammalian COPII components at the ERES (20Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Tang B.L. Zhang T. Low D.Y.H. Wong E.T. Horstmann H. Hong W. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Double labeling of Yip1A and the COPII component Sec31A indeed revealed a high degree of co-localization between these two proteins on membrane structures (Fig. 4A). This suggests that Yip1A is localized to the ERES. We further examined the subcellular localization of Yip1A at the ultrastructural level. Immunogold labeling of Yip1A can be found around but not within the Golgi stacks (Fig. 4 B) and are particularly enriched in structures with a vesiculated membrane profile around the Golgi apparatus. These structures are also enriched in the COPII component Sec13 (20Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, consistent with the results obtained at the light microscopy level, Yip1A is enriched the ERES. In view of the extensive co-localization of Yip1A with both the KDEL receptor and COPII components and bearing in mind that the KDEL receptor exhibits dynamic recycling between the ER and the Golgi, we examined to what extent is Yip1A distributed between the ERES and the cis-Golgi. A low temperature treatment (15 °C for 3 h) had been known to result in a block in transport at the ER-Golgi boundary, in the so-called “15 °C compartment” (31Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Saraste J. Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hauri H-P. Schweizer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that upon release from this 15 °C block, the KDEL receptor can be observed to move toward the juxtanuclear Golgi region (38Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells at 15 °C resulted in excellent co-localization of Yip1A with the KDEL receptor and Sec31 in structures that appeared less juxtanuclear and more scattered throughout the cell periphery as compared with untreated cells (Figs.5, A and B, upper panel). 10 min upon transfer of the cells to 37 °C, the majority of the labeling of all three proteins became more concentrated at the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 5, A and B, middle panel). The concentration occurs to differing degrees for the three proteins. Whereas the peripheral labeling for the KDEL-R almost exclusively became concentrated at the juxtanuclear region, a substantial number of peripheral spotty structures remained labeled with Sec31 and Yip1A (Fig. 5, A and B, lower panels). Yip1A is therefore behaving more like Sec31 than the KDEL receptor in terms of its dynamics upon release from the 15 °C block. We have previously shown that structures labeled with the COPII component Sec13 become delocalized from those labeled with the anterograde cargo VSVG not long after its exit from the ER (20Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To follow the labeling of Yip1A with an anterograde cargo, we double-labeled vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVts045) infected cells for Yip1A and the VSVG at various time points after transferring cells incubated at 40 to 32 °C. As shown in Fig.6, the best co-localization between Yip1A and VSVG occurs at 4 min after release from the temperature restriction (upper panel). At this time point a majority of the VSVG appeared to be co-localized with Yip1A at the ERES. There is already fairly apparent segregation of Yip1A and VSVG 7 min after release (second panel). At 15 min after release, VSVG is found exclusively at the juxtanuclear Golgi region (third panel). On the other hand, a significant number of peripheral spots with Yip1A labeling alone were observed. Even at the juxtanuclear region where the Yip1A labeling are more intense, Yip1A and VSVG labels do not appear to coincide. The former appeared to be a continuous large membranous structure resembling the Golgi apparatus, while the latter remained vesicular, very much like its peripheral counterparts. The segregation between Yip1A and VSVG is obvious at the 40-min time point. These results are consistent with the notion that Yip1A resides preferentially at the ERES. Mutant yeast cells depleted of Yip1p and conditionally lethal yip1 mutants accumulate ER membranes and are defective in protein secretion (32Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In view of its homology to Yip1p and the fact that it is enriched in the ERES, we sought to determine if Yip1A is involved in ER-Golgi transport. We reasoned that the N-terminal hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain of Yip1A might have a dominant negative effect when expressed in cells through its ability to compete for important interactions intrinsic to the endogenous Yip1A. We have therefore made an expression construct, mycYip1Acyto, that would express the cytoplasmic domain of Yip1A when transfected into cells. We first asked if the expression of mycYip1Acyto would in anyway affect the transport of the VSVG from the ER to the cell surface. Cells transiently transfected for 15 h were infected with VSVts045 at 32 °C and viral protein synthesis and transport is allowed to go on fo"

A known pathway of apoptosis downstream of Ask1 involves the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, the activation of caspases, and the fragmentation of nuclei. Here, we characterized a novel mechanism of Ask1-mediated cell killing that is triggered by the interaction with Daxx. Co-transfection of Ask1 and Daxx induced a caspase-independent cell-death process characterized at the morphological level by distinctive crumpled nuclei easily distinguishable from the condensed and fragmented nuclei seen during classical caspase-dependent apoptosis. The kinase activity of Ask1 was not involved in this process, because mutants lacking kinase activity were as efficient as wild type Ask1 in mediating Daxx-induced cell death. Ask1N, a deletant that lacks the C-terminal half including the kinase domain of Ask1, was constitutively active in producing crumpled nuclei. In contrast, Ask1ΔN, the reciprocal deletant that possesses constitutive kinase activity, produced fragmented nuclei typical of caspase-dependent death processes. We conclude that in addition to a caspase-dependent pro-apoptotic function that depends on its kinase activity, Ask1 possesses a caspase-independent killing function that is independent on its kinase activity and is activable by interaction with Daxx. In the physiological situation, such an activity is induced as a consequence of the translocation of Daxx from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a condition that occurs following activation of the death receptor Fas.

Studies with Ask1-deficient cells revealed that apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α treatment and H2O2 exposure is associated with an Ask1-mediated sustained activation of the JNK and p38 pathways (6Tobiume K.

Possible mechanisms by which apoptosis is induced downstream of Ask1 involve the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of Bcl-2 and the phosphorylation-mediated stabilization of c-Myc, both processes being catalyzed by activated JNK (8Yamamoto K.

Cytochrome ctranslocation leads to the activation of caspase activities and the cleavage of crucial targets such as the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, leading in turn to the typical manifestations of caspase-dependent apoptosis including internucleosomal DNA degradation and nuclear condensation and fragmentation (13Nagata S. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). One mechanism of activation of the pro-apoptotic function of Ask1 involves Daxx, a nuclear protein normally localized in the nuclear substructures called nuclear domain 10 or PML (promyelocytic leukemia) oncogenic domain (14Everett R.D.

In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which Ask1 mediates the toxic effect of cytoplasmic Daxx. The results revealed a novel function of Ask1 in regulated cell death. pEGFP-C1 expresses an enhanced green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH). pCINHuDaxx and pCIN-Fas express the full-length human Daxx and Fas protein, respectively (17Charette S.J.

Ask1 deletants were produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of pcDNA3-HA-Ask1 using primers delimitating the sequences to be deleted. All newly developed constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human Fas-activating antibody (clone CH11) was from Upstate Biotechnology,N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) was from Enzyme Systems Products, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was from Sigma. The anti-Daxx EL-68 antibody has been described before (17Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). HA.11 is a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the HA peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA (BabCo). 293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5%-CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 4.5 g/liter glucose (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog number 12800-017) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In some experiments as indicated, the cells were incubated in l-glutamine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog number 11960-044). Transfection was done as described before by calcium-phosphate precipitation in the presence of 50 μm chloroquine (17Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). 293 cells that were plated on gelatin-coated 6-well dishes were fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde made in saline (137 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 11 mm glucose, pH 7.2) and permeabilized for 15 min in 0.1% saponin. EL-68 antibody diluted 1/100 and HA.11 antibody diluted 1/300 was used to detect Daxx and HA-tagged proteins, respectively. Protein-antigen-antibody complex was revealed with AlexaFluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594-labeled anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted 1/2000. For fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein-expressing cells, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde as described above and then postfixed in 70% ethanol overnight. In all cases, the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (2.5 μg/ml). Epi-fluorescence microscopy was done on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Photographs were obtained with a CoolSnap digital camera system (RS Photometrics). Exponentially growing 293 cells were plated onto 6-well dishes at 1.5 × 105cells per well and transfected or treated 24 h later as described in the legend for Fig. 1. 24 h after transfection or treatment, floating and adherent cells were pooled, washed in saline, and lysed at 50 °C for 48 h in buffer containing 10 mm TRIS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. The lysate was subjected to two phenol-chloroform extractions. DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in 10 mm TRIS, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml RNase. The DNA was separated into a 1.0% agarose gel and revealed by ethidium-bromide staining. Transfection of plasmid pcDNA3-HA-Ask1 yielded the expression of HA-Ask1 that co-localized in the cytoplasm with endogenous Ask1. Transfection of plasmid pCINHuDaxx resulted in an enhanced expression of Daxx in the nucleus, which like endogenous Daxx was concentrated in nuclear bodies with the PML protein (see Ref. 14Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Pluta A.F. Sternsdorf T. Ainsztein A.M. Carmena M. Ruchaud S. Hsu W.L. Orr A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3443-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and see Fig.1A). However, co-transfection of the Daxx and Ask1 plasmids resulted in more than 50% of the cells in the localization of Daxx with Ask1 in the cytoplasm and in more than 95% of these cells, in severe morphological alterations of the nuclei (Fig. 1, A and B). The nuclei looked as if they had been crushed out of shape, showing frequent invaginations and irregularly condensed chromatin regions forming intranuclear wrinkles. These crumpled nuclei were easily distinguishable from the condensed and fragmented nuclei seen in classical caspase-dependent apoptosis as, for example, induced by Fas in the same cells (see later in Fig. 3). In contrast to the known mechanisms of Ask1-mediated apoptosis, this Daxx-Ask1-mediated cell-death process was insensitive to the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (17Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and was not accompanied by internucleosomal DNA degradation as seen otherwise after treatment with puromycin or activation of Fas in the same cells (Fig.1C). Once activated Ask1 leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38, two kinases whose activation has been often associated with apoptosis (see Refs. 2Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten-Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholarand 21Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1569-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and references therein). In initial experiments, however, we observed that transfection of Daxx, alone or together with Ask1, had no effect on the activity of JNK1 or p38 (data not shown) suggesting that Daxx did not lead to the activation of the kinase activity of Ask1 and thus that cell death was not induced as a consequence of such an activation. This was confirmed by looking at the potential of a kinase-inactive mutant of Ask1 (Ask1KM) to induce nuclear crumpling when co-transfected with Daxx. We found that co-transfection of Ask1KM with Daxx was as efficient as wild type Ask1 to cause the re-localization of Daxx to the cytoplasm and to induce the typical nuclear alterations (Fig. 1B). The kinase domain of Ask1 is centrally located in the protein and is regulated both by the N terminus, which contains the sites of interaction of numerous Ask1 regulators (3Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and by intramolecular interactions between the N and C termini. Such interactions keep the kinase in a repressed state, and deletion of the N-terminal domain of Ask1 leads to a constitutively activated kinase (2Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten-Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 3Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We investigated which domain of Ask1 was responsible for the caspase-independent cell-death activity by generating a number of deletants of the N terminus (Ask1ΔN, lacking residues 5–649), the kinase domain (Ask1ΔK, lacking residues 649–940), or the kinase domain and the C terminus (Ask1N, lacking residues 649–1375) (Fig.2A). All the mutant proteins with an intact N-terminal domain were able to re-localize Daxx to the cytoplasm, and conversely, the mutant lacking this domain (Ask1ΔN) was unable to retain Daxx in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with a previous demonstration that Daxx associates with the N-terminal domain of Ask1 (3Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The potential of the deletants to induce cell death either when expressed alone or with Daxx was tested also (Fig. 2C). All deletants that could maintain Daxx in the cytoplasm also produced crumpled nuclei in the presence of Daxx. Interestingly, in contrast to transfection of wild type Ask1, transfection of Ask1N alone already resulted in a significant constitutive cell killing activity, i.e. co-transfection with Daxx was not required although it enhanced the toxicity. The results clearly demonstrated that the kinase activity was not required for Ask1 to induce nuclear crumpling. Furthermore, the results suggested that the N-terminal domain of Ask1 possesses a cell-death activity that is normally repressed in the wild type protein and de-repressed by Daxx. Ask1ΔN, a constitutively kinase-active form of Ask1, is also known to induce cell death. When transfected, Ask1ΔN induced a slow caspase-dependent cell-death process that requires some 2–3 days and a sustained activation of JNK (6Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Monowa O. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Reports. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 7Hatai T. Matsuzawa A. Inoshita S. Mochida Y. Kuroda T. Sakamaki K. Kuida K. Yonehara S. Ichijo H. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26576-26581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We confirmed these results by showing that transfection of Ask1ΔN induced by 3 days a condensed/fragmented nucleus pattern typical of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 2D). No fragmentation (nor crumpling) was seen at 2 days. Furthermore, we found that Ask1ΔN-induced apoptosis was dependent on the absence of glutamine in the medium (data not shown), consistent with the results that t-glutamyl RNA synthetase is a repressor of this activity (27Ko Y.G. Kim E.Y. Kim T. Park H. Park H.S. Choi E.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6030-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cell death induced by transfection of Ask1ΔN contrasted with death induced by transfection of Ask1N. The Ask1N-induced process occurred by 24 h, was observed both in the presence and absence of glutamine (data not shown), and produced crumpled rather than fragmented nuclei (Fig. 2E). The results thus implied that Ask1 possesses two domains active in inducing cell death and thereby modulates two distinct mechanisms of cell death. The stimulation of the death receptor Fas represents one physiological situation in which this novel function of Ask1 may participate in cell-death induction. Indeed, Fas induces the translocation of Daxx from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and a caspase-independent cell-death process, which becomes important when the Fas-induced caspase-dependent pathway is inhibited either with zVAD-fmk treatment or expression of a dominant negative form of FADD (17Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Such a situation may occur in normal physiology, for example, during viral infection where inhibitory proteins like v-FLIP or CrmA are produced (28Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). We looked at whether the specific nuclear alterations obtained upon transfection of Ask1N or co-transfection of Daxx and Ask1 were also induced during Fas stimulation. Transfection with Fas followed by exposure to the Fas-activating antibody yielded within 24 h characteristic features of caspase-dependent apoptosis such as internucleosomal DNA degradation (Fig. 1C) and with times up to 72 h an increasing number of cells with a condensed and fragmented nucleus (Fig. 3, Aand C). Treatment with zVAD-fmk totally inhibited at all times the Fas-induced nuclear condensation/fragmentation phenotype. However, in the presence of zVAD-fmk, an increasing number of cells showed with times up to 72 h the same crumpled nuclear phenotype as seen after co-transfection of Daxx and Ask1 or Ask1N alone (see Fig.3B, and compare Fig. 3D to Fig. 3E and Fig. 2E). Overexpression of the kinase-dead mutant of Ask1 (Ask1KM) enhanced by 2- to 3-fold Fas-induced caspase-independent nuclear crumpling (Fig. 3B) presents further evidence that the two phenomena are similar. Nuclear crumpling was produced much faster after transfection of Ask1N than after activation of Fas, suggesting that Ask1N acted as a constitutive mutant short-circuiting early signaling events (e.g. Daxx re-localization) required in the case of Fas. Previous reports demonstrated that Ask1 can induce through its kinase activity a caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway. This was well illustrated in the case of caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress and tumor necrosis factor α where overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of Ask1 was shown to inhibit cell death (2Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten-Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z. Seimiya H. Naito M.

We reported here the existence of a novel mechanism of cell death signaling by Ask1. The process does not involve the kinase activity of Ask1 and activates a caspase-independent pathway leading to a nuclear crumpling morphology distinct from the caspase-dependent nuclear condensation/fragmentation process induced downstream of kinase active Ask1 and other classical pathways of apoptosis. The mechanism involves the N-terminal half of the protein for which no catalytic activity is known. The existence of two independent functions for Ask1 is not so surprising considering the possibility for many distinct functional domains in a protein of the size of Ask1 (∼155 kDa) and the already known large number of different targets to which Ask1 binds (3Chang H.Y.

There are in fact several protein kinases, including Ask1 itself, for which kinase-independent activities have been characterized (29Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M.

Our finding that Ask1N possesses a constitutive cell-death activity suggests that this activity is repressed in the wild type protein and that Daxx de-represses this activity when it interacts with the N terminus. This resembles the way the kinase activity of Ask1 is regulated, being repressed by intermolecular interaction between the C and N termini and activated by de-repressors such as TRAF2 (3Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 26Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In this respect it is interesting that Daxx has also been reported to activate the kinase activity of Ask1 (3Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The similarity of the mechanisms involved in the activation of the two functions of Ask1 makes it plausible that in some cellular context the interaction of Daxx with Ask1 results in the activation of the kinase activity rather than in the cell-death activity linked to the N terminus. The results presented here, together with previous findings, strongly suggest that the caspase-independent cell-death pathway mediated by the N terminus of Ask1 is activated and can play a role upon stimulation of the Fas receptor (17Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It is tempting to suggest that de-repression of this Ask1-induced cell-death pathway by Daxx may also be implicated importantly in the response to several stressful stimuli inasmuch as HSP27, a protein that protects cells against a large number of stress such as heat shock and toxic chemicals and has been demonstrated to bind Daxx and to prevent its translocation into the cytoplasm and its interaction with Ask1 (17Charette S.J.

In addition, this process is critically involved in pathological conditions including tumor progression, where there is formation of new vessels that differ from normal vasculature in terms of both structure and function (4Carmeliet P.

Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21919) Google Scholar). It has become clear that there are quantitative differences between normal and tumor vasculature, evidenced by changes in the balance of angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors. However, it is less clear whether there are qualitative differences. In any case, the critical role of vascular endothelium in tumor growth has led to an intense search for potential targets for angiogenesis-based therapies (6Thompson W.D. Li W.W. Maragoudakis M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Bergers G. Javaherian K. Lo K.M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Science. 1999; 284: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar).TEM1, a novel gene that may play a role in angiogenesis, was recently identified by St. Croix and colleagues (8St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). They found it to be one of several genes elevated in human tumor endothelium when they carried out a comparison of gene expression profiles of endothelial cells derived from normal or malignant colorectal tissues. Furthermore, by in situ hybridization, they confirmed its expression in neoplastic colon tissue. The same year, Christian et al. (9Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported the cloning ofTEM1 and showed that it is identical to endosialin, a 165-kDa glycoprotein previously described as an antigen selectively expressed in vascular endothelial cells (10Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Based on molecular analysis, TEM1/endosialin has been classified as a C-type lectin-like membrane receptor. Its extracellular portion contains five globular domains (C-type lectin domain, sushi-like domain, and three EGF1-like repeats) and a mucin-like region. The core protein is heavily sialylated and displays similarity to thrombomodulin, a receptor involved in control of blood coagulation (11Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and to complement receptor C1qRp (12Nepomuceno R.R. Ruiz S. Park M. Tenner A.J J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3583-3589PubMed Google Scholar). The role of human TEM1/endosialin remains unclear.In this work, we provide a molecular characterization of the mouse Tem1/endosialin cDNA and its genomic structure. In conjunction with this, we report the mapping of its location on the mouse chromosome and identification of its functional promoter. In addition, we present results from an extensive analysis of Tem1/endosialin mRNA and protein expression in vivo and in vitro. Our results provide new and intriguing data regarding the broad expression of Tem1/endosialin in both normal somatic cells and embryonic tissue. These findings alter the previous view that this gene is preferentially associated with tumor endothelium; however, they do not rule out the possibility that the expression of this gene is elevated in tumor tissue. Of further significance, and perhaps even more important, is our finding that Tem1/endosialin mRNA is regulated by cell culture density.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here indicate for the first time that Tem1/endosialin plays not only a role in tumor-specific endothelium, but a more general role in vascular endothelium both in the adult and during embryonic development. Although previous data suggested that its expression is restricted to tumors (9Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we propose that it may simply be expressed at higher levels during the formation of new vessels in tumors. In support of this idea, others have found that it is expressed during angiogenic states, such as in the corpus luteum and granular tissue of healing wounds (8St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Although this may not represent a qualitative difference between normal endothelium and tumor endothelium as suggested previously, it may certainly reflect a quantitative difference. Quantitative differences are likely in tumor tissue known to have imbalances in the levels of regulators of angiogenesis. SinceTem1/endosialin's expression is most likely elevated in tumor tissues undergoing formation and reorganization of vessels, it could provide a target for antiangiogenic therapy for neoplastic disease.Endothelial cells demonstrate heterogeneity among and within tissues (1Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Pober J.S. Wick T.M. Konkle B.A. Schwartz B.S. Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distribution of Tem1/endosialinvaried among tissues with higher levels in the heart and pancreas and lower expression in the spleen and liver in both mice and humans. In addition, the placenta, ovary, and uterus were demonstrated to have high levels. This observation, along with the fact that the gene was expressed in rat capillary cells, but not in large vessel cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), suggests that this gene may be important in some subtype(s) of microvascular endothelial cells.As we have demonstrated in this study, Tem1/endosialinmRNA is up-regulated as cells increase in density. This was shown for NIH 3T3 cells as well as a mouse endothelial cell line, IP2-E4, and was confirmed at the protein level in NIH3T3 cells. Because its up-regulation may be associated with contact inhibition, we performed experiments to test whether, under conditions of forced expression, the gene could induce growth arrest. However, we were not able to demonstrate such a function for Tem1/endosialin. We hypothesize, therefore, that up-regulation of this gene occurs either in conjunction with increases in cell density or growth arrest but does not induce growth arrest itself. The fact that Tem1/endosialin is also up-regulated in serum-starved cells suggests that this induction is not simply triggered by the contact between cells per se. Alternatively, there may be more that one mechanism for its induction. Our data using luciferase reporter constructs show that the density-dependent expression is at least in part due to differences in activity at the promoter level. Many potential transcription factor-binding sites have been identified in the sequence of the promoter region (Fig. 9), and it will be of interest to determine which of these sites functions to activate Tem1 transcription.The Tem1/endosialin protein might serve one of several roles in the vasculature including signaling from cell to cell or serving as a receptor for soluble ligands. Its potential role in cell-cell interactions is suggested by the structure within its extracellular domain. Like many selectins that are involved in cell-cell interactions, it has a C-lectin domain and EGF domains (28Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Its potential cell-cell interactions could include homotypic interactions or heterotypic interactions with periendothelial cells (pericytes in small vessels) that lie adjacent to endothelial cellsin vivo (3Carmeliet P. Collen D. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One cannot rule out the additional possibility that Tem1/endosialin is involved in interactions with components within the extracellular matrix. In any case, its specific function in the vasculature is beyond the scope of this discussion and will be subject of future investigations.Tem1/endosialin shares, in its extracellular domain, homology with thrombomodulin. This is a cell surface molecule that is widely expressed on normal endothelial cells and under certain conditions in smooth muscle cells. It is best known for its role in the interaction with thrombin in the coagulation cascade (9Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C.

Tem1/endosialin, however, lacks homology to thrombomodulin in the thrombin interaction domains (EGF repeats 5 and 6). An additional role for thrombomodulin is evident from its ability to inhibit arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation (32Li J. Garnette C.S. Cahn M. Claytor R.B. Rohrer M.J. Dobson J.G. Gerlitz B.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, embryonic lethality in homozygous thrombomodulin knockout mice has been proposed to be due to thrombin-independent functions (35Weiler-Guettler H. Aird W.C. Rayburn H. Husain M. Rosenberg R.D. Development. 1996; 122: 2271-2281PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel investigations on this related protein may help us to begin to understand the function of Tem1/endosialin.Our findings concerning the localization of Tem1/endosialin in the cell support its predicted cell surface association. Following transfection and immunofluoresence of permeabilized cells, we found a proportion of the protein in the vicinity of the cell membrane, although a large proportion was also found in the perinuclear region. It is interesting to point out that this localization is similar to that seen for thrombomodulin following transient transfection and permeabilization of cells (36Teasdale M.S. Bird C.H. Bird P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 480-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We realize that the GFP or Myc-His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus used in this study could potentially alter the localization of the protein. Although we wanted to confirm our result by looking at endogenous Tem1/endosialin, our antibody raised to the protein did not function well in this assay.The intracellular tail of Tem1/endosialin contains several putative phosphorylation sites that could serve in transduction of extracellular signals. This domain could also function in the subcellular localization of the protein, as was shown to be the case for thrombomodulin (37Conway E.M. Nowakowski B. Steiner-Mosonyi M. J. Cell.

Only a small proportion (at most 5%) of genes lack introns. A family whose diverse members are usually intronless are the G-protein-coupled receptor family genes. Among other human cell surface receptor genes, about 35% are found to be intronless (38Gentles A.J. Karlin S. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 47-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that an advantage of being intronless may be that transcription can occur more efficiently and with greater abundance, but in some cases experimental evidence indicates that introns actually increase gene expression levels (39Duncker B.P. Davies P.L. Walker V.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our data indicate that Tem1/endosialin may be functionally involved in angiogenesis or vascular function, not only in pathological situations, but under physiological conditions as well. Although information about pathways leading to its activation and about its function is scarce, our work provides important clues, comprehensive molecular data, and useful tools that will facilitate further studies. Angiogenesis, a tightly regulated formation of new blood vessels, plays an essential role in embryonic development, normal growth, wound healing, and other physiological processes (1Cines D.B.

In addition, this process is critically involved in pathological conditions including tumor progression, where there is formation of new vessels that differ from normal vasculature in terms of both structure and function (4Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7354) Google Scholar, 5Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21919) Google Scholar). It has become clear that there are quantitative differences between normal and tumor vasculature, evidenced by changes in the balance of angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors. However, it is less clear whether there are qualitative differences. In any case, the critical role of vascular endothelium in tumor growth has led to an intense search for potential targets for angiogenesis-based therapies (6Thompson W.D. Li W.W. Maragoudakis M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Bergers G. Javaherian K. Lo K.M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Science. 1999; 284: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). TEM1, a novel gene that may play a role in angiogenesis, was recently identified by St. Croix and colleagues (8St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). They found it to be one of several genes elevated in human tumor endothelium when they carried out a comparison of gene expression profiles of endothelial cells derived from normal or malignant colorectal tissues. Furthermore, by in situ hybridization, they confirmed its expression in neoplastic colon tissue. The same year, Christian et al. (9Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported the cloning ofTEM1 and showed that it is identical to endosialin, a 165-kDa glycoprotein previously described as an antigen selectively expressed in vascular endothelial cells (10Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Based on molecular analysis, TEM1/endosialin has been classified as a C-type lectin-like membrane receptor. Its extracellular portion contains five globular domains (C-type lectin domain, sushi-like domain, and three EGF1-like repeats) and a mucin-like region. The core protein is heavily sialylated and displays similarity to thrombomodulin, a receptor involved in control of blood coagulation (11Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and to complement receptor C1qRp (12Nepomuceno R.R. Ruiz S. Park M. Tenner A.J J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3583-3589PubMed Google Scholar). The role of human TEM1/endosialin remains unclear. In this work, we provide a molecular characterization of the mouse Tem1/endosialin cDNA and its genomic structure. In conjunction with this, we report the mapping of its location on the mouse chromosome and identification of its functional promoter. In addition, we present results from an extensive analysis of Tem1/endosialin mRNA and protein expression in vivo and in vitro. Our results provide new and intriguing data regarding the broad expression of Tem1/endosialin in both normal somatic cells and embryonic tissue. These findings alter the previous view that this gene is preferentially associated with tumor endothelium; however, they do not rule out the possibility that the expression of this gene is elevated in tumor tissue. Of further significance, and perhaps even more important, is our finding that Tem1/endosialin mRNA is regulated by cell culture density. DISCUSSIONThe data presented here indicate for the first time that Tem1/endosialin plays not only a role in tumor-specific endothelium, but a more general role in vascular endothelium both in the adult and during embryonic development. Although previous data suggested that its expression is restricted to tumors (9Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we propose that it may simply be expressed at higher levels during the formation of new vessels in tumors. In support of this idea, others have found that it is expressed during angiogenic states, such as in the corpus luteum and granular tissue of healing wounds (8St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Although this may not represent a qualitative difference between normal endothelium and tumor endothelium as suggested previously, it may certainly reflect a quantitative difference. Quantitative differences are likely in tumor tissue known to have imbalances in the levels of regulators of angiogenesis. SinceTem1/endosialin's expression is most likely elevated in tumor tissues undergoing formation and reorganization of vessels, it could provide a target for antiangiogenic therapy for neoplastic disease.Endothelial cells demonstrate heterogeneity among and within tissues (1Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Pober J.S. Wick T.M. Konkle B.A. Schwartz B.S. Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distribution of Tem1/endosialinvaried among tissues with higher levels in the heart and pancreas and lower expression in the spleen and liver in both mice and humans. In addition, the placenta, ovary, and uterus were demonstrated to have high levels. This observation, along with the fact that the gene was expressed in rat capillary cells, but not in large vessel cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), suggests that this gene may be important in some subtype(s) of microvascular endothelial cells.As we have demonstrated in this study, Tem1/endosialinmRNA is up-regulated as cells increase in density. This was shown for NIH 3T3 cells as well as a mouse endothelial cell line, IP2-E4, and was confirmed at the protein level in NIH3T3 cells. Because its up-regulation may be associated with contact inhibition, we performed experiments to test whether, under conditions of forced expression, the gene could induce growth arrest. However, we were not able to demonstrate such a function for Tem1/endosialin. We hypothesize, therefore, that up-regulation of this gene occurs either in conjunction with increases in cell density or growth arrest but does not induce growth arrest itself. The fact that Tem1/endosialin is also up-regulated in serum-starved cells suggests that this induction is not simply triggered by the contact between cells per se. Alternatively, there may be more that one mechanism for its induction. Our data using luciferase reporter constructs show that the density-dependent expression is at least in part due to differences in activity at the promoter level. Many potential transcription factor-binding sites have been identified in the sequence of the promoter region (Fig. 9), and it will be of interest to determine which of these sites functions to activate Tem1 transcription.The Tem1/endosialin protein might serve one of several roles in the vasculature including signaling from cell to cell or serving as a receptor for soluble ligands. Its potential role in cell-cell interactions is suggested by the structure within its extracellular domain. Like many selectins that are involved in cell-cell interactions, it has a C-lectin domain and EGF domains (28Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Its potential cell-cell interactions could include homotypic interactions or heterotypic interactions with periendothelial cells (pericytes in small vessels) that lie adjacent to endothelial cellsin vivo (3Carmeliet P. Collen D. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One cannot rule out the additional possibility that Tem1/endosialin is involved in interactions with components within the extracellular matrix. In any case, its specific function in the vasculature is beyond the scope of this discussion and will be subject of future investigations.Tem1/endosialin shares, in its extracellular domain, homology with thrombomodulin. This is a cell surface molecule that is widely expressed on normal endothelial cells and under certain conditions in smooth muscle cells. It is best known for its role in the interaction with thrombin in the coagulation cascade (9Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Tem1/endosialin, however, lacks homology to thrombomodulin in the thrombin interaction domains (EGF repeats 5 and 6). An additional role for thrombomodulin is evident from its ability to inhibit arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation (32Li J. Garnette C.S. Cahn M. Claytor R.B. Rohrer M.J. Dobson J.G. Gerlitz B. Cutler B.S. J. Vasc. Surg. 2000; 32: 804-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Olivot J.M. Estebanell E. Lafay M. Brohard B. Aiach M. Rendu F. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and modulate mitogenic responses of endothelial cells to thrombin (34Lafay M. Laguna R. Le Bonniec B.F. Lasne D. Aiach M. Rendu F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, embryonic lethality in homozygous thrombomodulin knockout mice has been proposed to be due to thrombin-independent functions (35Weiler-Guettler H. Aird W.C. Rayburn H. Husain M. Rosenberg R.D. Development. 1996; 122: 2271-2281PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel investigations on this related protein may help us to begin to understand the function of Tem1/endosialin.Our findings concerning the localization of Tem1/endosialin in the cell support its predicted cell surface association. Following transfection and immunofluoresence of permeabilized cells, we found a proportion of the protein in the vicinity of the cell membrane, although a large proportion was also found in the perinuclear region. It is interesting to point out that this localization is similar to that seen for thrombomodulin following transient transfection and permeabilization of cells (36Teasdale M.S. Bird C.H. Bird P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 480-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We realize that the GFP or Myc-His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus used in this study could potentially alter the localization of the protein. Although we wanted to confirm our result by looking at endogenous Tem1/endosialin, our antibody raised to the protein did not function well in this assay.The intracellular tail of Tem1/endosialin contains several putative phosphorylation sites that could serve in transduction of extracellular signals. This domain could also function in the subcellular localization of the protein, as was shown to be the case for thrombomodulin (37Conway E.M. Nowakowski B. Steiner-Mosonyi M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).An interesting outcome of our analysis of the genome structure of murine Tem1/endosialin was the finding that the coding region for the gene is intronless.

However, an important issue that remains to be clarified is the molecular events that lead to the formation of distinct isoforms of PrPSc called prion strains. Prion strains are defined, stable forms of PrPSc with characteristic physical-chemical features that, upon inoculation in animals, cause disease with a unique incubation time as well as type and distribution of the lesions (2Prusiner S.B.

Prion strains also exist in human prion diseases, which include sporadic and genetic forms as well as forms acquired by infection (13Telling G.C. Parchi P. DeArmond S.J. Cortelli P. Montagna P.

The sporadic form is the most common and comprises five distinct subtypes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and the sporadic form of fatal insomnia (sFI) (8Gajdusek D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M.

Neurol. 1996; 39: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In PrPSc type 1, the unglycosylated fragment migrates at 21 kDa; in type 2 it migrates at 19 kDa (5Parchi P. Castellani R.

The different sizes are likely due to conformational differences between PrPScspecies resulting in the exposure of different PK cleavage sites. PrPSc types 1 and 2 have been transmitted to transgenic mice and are considered to represent human prion strains (13Telling G.C. Parchi P. DeArmond S.J. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Gabizon R.

In contrast, the M/M2 sCJD phenotype is clinically similar to CJD and is characterized by severe spongiosis of the cerebral cortex but with little involvement of the thalamus (16Parchi P. Giese A.

In this study, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting as a novel approach to explore differences among prion strains. We demonstrate for the first time major differences between the PrPSc associated with sFI and that present in M/M2 sCJD. Brain tissue was obtained from the frontal cortex of four autopsy-confirmed cases with sporadic prion disease that were M/M at codon 129 of the PrP gene (PRNP) and had the PrPSc type 2 and of two genotype-matched cases free of prion disease used as controls (5Parchi P.

The four prion disease cases were categorized as sFI (n = 2) or M/M2 sCJD (n = 2) based on their histopathological and PrP immunohistochemical features (16Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P.

In one case each of sFI and M/M2 sCJD, tissue was also obtained from the hippocampus (CA1) and the thalamus (mediodorsal nucleus). Frontal cortex obtained at biopsy was also examined in one case of M/M2 sCJD. Brain homogenates were prepared in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. To obtain detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions, tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of sucrose buffer (0.25 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH8.0) and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged again at 60,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C and stored. The pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of TNE buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with 2% Sarkosyl, centrifuged at 60,000 × g for another 1 h at 4 °C, and stored. For proteinase K treatment, brain homogenates without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml PK (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digestion was stopped with 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Before PNGase F treatment, PK-treated and untreated brain homogenates were mixed with 0.1 volumes of 10× denaturing buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS, pH 7.5), and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. PNGase F (New England BioLabs Inc.) digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h with the addition of 0.1 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40. mAb 8H4 to the C terminus and mAb 8B4 to the N terminus of PrPC were coupled to Sepharose 4B immunoaffinity columns (21Zanusso G.

Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight by equilibrating 20 μl of immunoaffinity beads with a predetermined amount of brain preparation. The bead-bound PrP was eluted and processed for two-dimensional electrophoresis. Brain homogenate was mixed with PAGE loading buffer (160 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heated for 10 min at 95 °C before loading onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional PAGE was performed as described by the supplier with minor modifications using Mini-Protean II two-dimensional cell and Mini-Protean II tube module (Bio-Rad). Similar amounts of PrP were loaded onto the tube gel, subjected to 500 V for 10 min and 750 V for 5 h. The extruded gel tubes were equilibrated in gel equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, pH 6.8) for 15 min and loaded onto the two-dimensional gel (15% SDS-PAGE). The pH gradients of two-dimensional gels were determined from duplicate gels loaded with two-dimensional gel marker and detected with Coomassie Blue. PAGE slabs were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted (21Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C.

PrP was detected using mAb 8H4 in combination with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc antibody and visualized with chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). On one-dimensional immunoblots, all untreated PrP preparations from control, M/M2 sCJD, and sFI brains display the typical pattern of human brain PrP, although control brains contain only PrPCwhereas PrP from M/M2 sCJD and sFI comprises both PrPC and PrPSc (and presumably other abnormal PrP isoforms), referred to as total PrP. After immunostaining with mAb 8H4 to the C terminus, PrP forms two prominent bands of 35–42 and 28–35 kDa that contain the full-length diglycosylated PrP form and the monoglycosylated as well as the diglycosylated and monoglycosylated N-terminal-truncated PrP forms, respectively (Fig.1, A, C,E). Two less prominent bands of ∼27 and ∼18 kDa are likely to contain the unglycosylated full-length and the unglycosylated N-terminal-truncated PrP forms (7Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (80): 19173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). On two-dimensional immunoblots, five major sets of PrPCforms are detected in controls (Fig. 1B). The uppermost set of 35–42 kDa, which includes between 13 and 20 individual spots spanning pI values that range from pH 4.5 to 8.0, presumably corresponds to the full-length diglycosylated form. The second, third, and fourth sets of ∼35, 29–35 and 24–28 kDa, contain 6–13 spots and have a pI range between pH 4.5 to pH 6.0. They are likely to represent mostly glycosylated forms of the N-terminal-truncated PrPC species and, to a lesser extent, the full-length monoglycosylated and unglycosylated species. The fifth set of ∼18 kDa includes three spots and probably contains the unglycosylated truncated form. A similar pattern is seen for the total PrP from the cases of sFI (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the pattern of M/M2 sCJD comprises two additional sets of spots of ∼36 and ∼31 kDa, which span the entire pI range, from pH 4.5 to 8.0, and match in pH range the 35–42 kDa set containing the full-length diglycosylated form (Fig.1F). The other four PrP sets are similar to those of controls and sFI. All these patterns were reproducible. We separated the detergent-soluble PrP fractions that contain mostly PrPC from the detergent-insoluble fractions that are highly enriched in PrPSc (and, presumably, other abnormal PrP isoforms) in control, sFI, and M/M2 sCJD (Fig.2) (22Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Similar profiles are obtained in the two-dimensional immunoblots of the soluble PrP from the control, sFI, and M/M2 sCJD brains as well as of the insoluble PrP obtained from the sFI brains (Fig. 2, A--E). In contrast, the insoluble PrP from M/M2 sCJD displays the same two ∼36 and ∼31 kDa additional sets of spots observed in total PrP preparations (Figs.2F and 1F). To investigate further the nature of the two additional sets of spots observed in M/M2 sCJD, the detergent-insoluble PrP was affinity-purified in control, sFI, and M/M2 sCJD with mAb 8B4, directed to the N-terminal region of PrP. Equal amounts of purified PrP carrying an intact N terminus were processed for two-dimensional blotting and immunoreacted with mAb 8H4 directed to the PrP C terminus (Fig.3). Again, control and sFI preparations form similar patterns characterized by a single set of spots, whereas M/M2 sCJD two-dimensional blots contain the two additional populations of PrP (Fig. 3). This experiment clearly shows that the variant insoluble PrP pattern associated with M/M2 sCJD is, for the most part, generated by the full-length form of the insoluble PrP, which carries at least two additional sets of different glycans. Consistent with this conclusion, the removal of the N-linked glycans by PNGase F treatment greatly reduces the difference in insoluble PrP pattern that M/M2 sCJD displays when compared with sFI and controls (Fig.4). These preparations show four major spots migrating at 18–21 kDa, which likely represent N-truncated PrP fragments (Fig. 4). However, the M/M2 sCJD preparations also contain a larger spot of 27–29 kDa and pI between pH 7 and 8, which corresponds to the PrP full-length form and is much weaker in sFI and control. These findings argue that the different PrP pattern of M/M2 sCJD results not only from a larger variety of glycans but also from the presence of a larger quantity of full-length PrP.Figure 4One- and two-dimensional immunoblots of full-length and truncated PrP following deglycosylation. Brain lysate from control (A and B), sFI (Cand D) and M/M2 sCJD (E and F) were treated with PNGase F and processed for one-dimensional (A,C, and E) or two-dimensional immunoblot (B, D, and F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine PrPSc, equal amounts of PK-treated total PrP from sFI or M/M2 sCJD were processed for one- and two-dimensional immunoblotting. In one-dimensional immunoblots, PrPScdistributes in three bands, which migrate at 30–35, 27–28, and ∼19 kDa and are indistinguishable in the sFI and M/M2 sCJD preparations (Fig. 5, A andC). In contrast, although sFI and M/M2 sCJD two-dimensional immunoblots share many spots, at least 14 of them are present only in the M/M2 sCJD preparations (Fig. 5D). However, after deglycosylation all differences in PrPSc pattern have vanished. Both blots contain a similar set of 5–6 spots that migrate at ∼19 kDa as the PK- and PNGase F-treated PrPSc in two-dimensional immunoblots. Therefore, in PrPScpreparations the distinctive two-dimensional immunoblot pattern of M/M2 sCJD is generated mostly by the presence of more diverse glycans. Analysis of PrPSc by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting has shown that PrPScassociated with distinct animal and human prion diseases may differ in gel mobility and in the ratio of the glycoforms, providing the first insight into the molecular basis of prion diversity (4Kascsak R.J.

However, one-dimensional immunoblotting has obvious limitations because of its relatively low capacity to separate different proteins, especially glycoproteins, which may differ only in the type of their glycans. When we used two-dimensional immunoblotting to compare the insoluble PrP and the PrPSc associated with the M/M2 sCJD phenotypes with that of sFI, we observed that in M/M2 sCJD the PrP pattern is characterized by two distinctive features: 1) the presence of three rather than one set of glycans linked to the full-length PrP, and 2) a relatively larger quantity of the full-length PrP. The single set of glycosylated, full-length PrP present in sFI and control is distributed over a wide pI range but displays a fairly uniform molecular mass of 38–43 kDa, indicating that this set carries glycans that are heterogeneous with respect to the charges, but have the mass expected for the presence of two glycans. In M/M2 sCJD. the two additional sets of spots have lower molecular masses. The nature of these glycans needs to be analyzed, but the upper two sets are consistent with the PrP di- and monoglycosylated forms whereas the lower set might contain simpler glycans chains. In two-dimensional preparations of a PK-resistant PrPSc fragment generated by the PK treatment, the M/M2 sCJD patterns differ from that of sFI in the presence of several spots, which span a wide pI range and occupy the upper half of the blot. These spots are likely to represent the PK-truncated forms of the full-length, glycosylated PrPSc, which form the 35–37 and 30–33 kDa sets of spots in the M/M2 sCJD-insoluble preparations not treated with PK. The amount of PrPSc present in the cerebral cortex from M/M2 sCJD is 5–10-fold larger than that in sFI and might result in the presence of PrPSc forms that generate the variant patterns in M/M2 sCJD but are undetectable in sFI. Furthermore, the different PrP pattern might result from the vast difference in histological lesions between sFI and M/M2 sCJD. We investigated these two possibilities but observed no difference in pattern regardless of whether the two-dimensional immunoblots were loaded with total tissue homogenate (containing different amounts of PrP) or with equal protein amounts of immunopurified total PrP or of PrPSc. The pattern was also unchanged when tissue was obtained from the hippocampal formation that has minimal histopathology in both diseases or from the thalamus that is more severely affected in sFI than in M/M2 sCJD. Finally, the PrP pattern remained unchanged regardless of whether we used brain tissue obtained from an autopsy (in which a different rate of postmortem autolysis might play a role in the PrP pattern formation because there may be delays of 8–18 h before the tissue is harvested) or whether the brain tissue was obtained from a biopsy, which has minimal autolysis. Combined, these findings indicate that the different two-dimensional gel patterns formed by the insoluble PrP and by the PrPSc in sFI and M/M2 sCJD are likely to be due to the intrinsic differences of PrPSc rather than being secondary to the different quantities of PrPSc, the different histopathology, or postmortem autolysis. The role of the glycans in prion strain determination is controversial. In variant CJD, the human prion disease recently observed in the United Kingdom and believed to have been acquired from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), PrPSc has a glycoform ratio similar to that observed in the PrPSc of BSE and to that of mice infected with PrPSc derived from variant CJD and BSE (6Collinge J.

Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Giese A. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 386: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the glycoform ratio reflecting the glycosylation site occupancy is reproduced upon inoculation to receptive animals. However, it is unclear whether preferential glycan site occupancy is consistently reproduced upon transmission to receptive animals (13Telling G.C. Parchi P. DeArmond S.J. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Gabizon R. Mastrianni J. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2079-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). A comparative study of experimental scrapie in Syrian hamsters has shown that PrPCand PrPSc contain the same set of at least 52 glycan species but in different relative amounts (24Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Wing D.R. Prusiner S.B. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These changes could be due to a preferential conversion to PrPSc of PrPC that contains certain kinds of sugars (24Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Wing D.R. Prusiner S.B. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the glycosylation machinery may be impaired in certain cell populations as the result of the neurodegeneration associated with the disease process (24Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Wing D.R.

This, in turn, results in the underrepresentation of some glycans, which, therefore, are less available for conversion. In M/M2 sCJD, only insoluble PrP and PrPSc form the variant two-dimensional pattern, whereas the pattern of the soluble PrP is similar to that of PrPC from controls. Therefore, the most economical explanation for these findings is that the variant PrPSc present in M/M2 sCJD is the result of preferential conversion and the accumulation of full-length glycoforms that are normally underrepresented, rather than being secondary to an impairment of the cell glycosylation machinery. The finding that prolonged exposure of the two-dimensional immunoblots from controls reduces somewhat the pattern differences with M/M2 sCJD supports this conclusion (data not shown). Glycans affect many characteristics of the glycosylated protein, including stability, protein-to-protein interactions, packing, and orientation at the cell surface (24Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Wing D.R. Prusiner S.B. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Zuegg J. Gready J.E. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 959-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the conformation and other properties of the glycosylated, full-length PrPSc present in M/M2 sCJD are different from that of the corresponding PrPSc species present in sFI. This, in turn, would determine the different phenotype. If the only conformational differences between the sFI and M/M2 sCJD PrPSc species were those determined by the variant glycans, this work, to our knowledge, would be the first observation that two PrPSc species associated with distinct disease phenotypes differ only in the glycans they carry. Transmission experiments are needed to test this hypothesis."

The structure of unliganded SsMTAP was refined at 2.5-Å resolution and the structures of the complexes were refined at resolutions ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 Å. SsMTAP is unusual both for its broad substrate specificity and for its extreme thermal stability. The hexameric structure of SsMTAP is similar to that of purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from Escherichia coli, however, only SsMTAP accepts 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine as a substrate. The active site of SsMTAP is similar to that of E. coli PNP with 13 of 18 nearest residues being identical. The main differences are at Thr89, which corresponds to serine in E. coliPNP, and Glu163, which corresponds to proline in E. coli PNP. In addition, a water molecule is found near the purine N-7 position in the guanosine complex of SsMTAP. Thr89 is near the 5′-position of the nucleoside and may account for the ability of SsMTAP to accept either hydrophobic or hydrophilic substituents in that position. Unlike E. coli PNP, the structures of SsMTAP reveal a substrate-induced conformational change involving Glu163. This residue is located at the interface between subunits and swings in toward the active site upon nucleoside binding. The high-resolution structures of SsMTAP suggest that the transition state is stabilized in different ways for 6-amino versus6-oxo substrates. SsMTAP has optimal activity at 120 °C and retains full activity after 2 h at 100 °C. Examination of the three-dimensional structure of SsMTAP suggests that unlike most thermophilic enzymes, disulfide linkages play a key in role in its thermal stability.

Sulfolobus solfataricus 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase purine nucleoside phosphorylase 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine Formycin B 5′-Deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.28) from Sulfolobus solfataricus(SsMTAP)1 functions in the purine salvage pathway where it catalyzes the phosphorolysis of 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) (1Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Bertoldo C. De Rosa M. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24762-24769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a sulfur-containing nucleoside generated as a by-product of polyamine biosynthesis (2Pegg A.E. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 682-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products of the MTA cleavage reaction are adenine and 5-methylthio-d-ribose 1-phosphate. S. solfataricus is a thermophilic microorganism belonging to Archaea, the third primary domain (3Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4399) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the symmetrical polyamines, sym-norspermine and sym-norspermine, is highly operative in thermophilic archaebacteria (4Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Pontoni G. Zappia V. Bachrach U. Heimer Y.M. The Physiology of Polyamines. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 47-62Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for MTAP in the catabolism of large quantities of MTA in these organisms (Scheme FS1). SsMTAP has been classified as a hyperthermophilic enzyme since its optimum temperature (120 °C) is higher than the boiling point of water (1Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Bertoldo C. De Rosa M. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24762-24769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is also characterized by extreme thermostability, demonstrating full activity after 2 h at 100 °C and showing an apparent melting temperature of 132 °C. In addition, the enzyme remains stable in the presence of protein denaturants, detergents, and organic solvents, even at elevated temperatures. While human MTAP requires reducing agents in order to maintain activity (5Della Ragione F. Carteni-Farina M. Gragnaniello V. Schettino M.I. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12324-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SsMTAP does not. In fact, the presence of several disulfide bonds is believed to play a role in the extreme thermostability and durability of the enzyme. Previous work suggested that SsMTAP is a hexamer (160 kDa) consisting of six identical subunits of 27 kDa each. Early biochemical studies on the hexameric SsMTAP also revealed that this enzyme shares the broader substrate binding characteristics of hexameric PNPs (1Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Bertoldo C. De Rosa M. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24762-24769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, although SsMTAP is classified as an MTA phosphorylase, it shares negligible sequence homology with human MTAP (14% identity) and reveals a significant sequence identity to Escherichia coliPNP (32%). Like E. coli PNP, SsMTAP will utilize inosine, guanosine, and adenosine as substrates. Unique to SsMTAP, however, is the ability to cleave MTA as well. MTA phosphorylases are members of the purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) family of enzymes, which function in the salvage pathways of cells (6Parks Jr., R.E. Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 483-514Google Scholar). This family of proteins can be roughly divided into two classes, the hexameric PNPs and trimeric PNPs, based on the quaternary structure of the physiologically relevant form of the enzyme. Interestingly, the monomers of trimeric and hexameric PNPs are structurally similar even though the oligomeric assemblies are unrelated (7Mao C. Cook W., J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T., A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Results of early biochemical studies and sequence homology suggest that SsMTAP belongs to the hexameric class of enzymes (1Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Bertoldo C. De Rosa M. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24762-24769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this enzyme is the first hexameric nucleoside phosphorylase shown to utilize MTA as a substrate. In contrast, human MTAP is a member of the trimeric class of enzymes. Recently, the complete genome sequence revealed that S. solfataricuscontains a second enzyme that is homologous to trimeric human MTAP (GenBankTM accession number AE006641). However, no obvious PNP is encoded in the S. solfataricus genome. Many of the enzymes in the PNP family have been well characterized, and crystal structures have been obtained for both trimeric and hexameric PNPs. Atomic resolution structures of human (8Ealick S.E.

Here, we report the crystal structures of unliganded SsMTAP and binary and ternary complexes of SsMTAP bound to substrates and substrate analogs. Our studies on MTAP from S. solfataricus are aimed toward understanding the structural basis for its broad substrate specificity and toward understanding the factors that contribute to its extreme thermostability. Recombinant SsMTAP utilized for these structural studies was expressed and purified according to the methods of Cacciapuoti et al. (19Cacciapuoti G. Fusco S. Caiazzo N. Zappia V. Porcelli M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme is similar to the wild-type enzyme regarding molecular weight, hexameric structure, presence of intersubunit disulfide bonds, substrate specificity, and specific activity. However, the recombinant SsMTAP demonstrates both lower thermophilicity and thermostability (19Cacciapuoti G. Fusco S. Caiazzo N. Zappia V. Porcelli M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to ∼7–10 mg/ml using ultrafiltration. All SsMTAP crystals were grown at either room temperature or 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The drops contained 1.2 µl of protein solution and 1.0 µl of reservoir solution suspended over 850 µl of reservoir solution. For the native SsMTAP crystals, the reservoir solution contained 28–30% dioxane, 12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.12 mMgCl2, 0.04 m NaCl, and 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Microseeding with previously grown crystals improved the size and diffraction quality of the crystals. Native crystals of SsMTAP are plate-like with typical dimensions of 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.1 mm. The 12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in the mother liquor acts as a suitable cryoprotectant when freezing the crystals. Crystals containing SsMTAP complexed with guanosine, adenosine, MTA, or Formycin B (FMB) plus sulfate ion were generated by co-crystallization. The conditions were identical to those given above for the native SsMTAP crystallization except that the reservoir solution contained 28–30% dioxane, 12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.12 mMgCl2, 0.03 m MgSO4, and 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In order to obtain the structure of the enzyme bound to phosphate, magnesium sulfate was replaced by ammonium chloride and potassium phosphate was added to the reservoir solution. The final reservoir solution contained 28–30% dioxane, 12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.12 mNH4Cl, 0.02 m KH2PO4, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. We also attempted to prepare SsMTAP crystals containing FMB and phosphate using these conditions but only phosphate was observed in the active site (see below). Data for unliganded SsMTAP were collected using a single frozen native SsMTAP crystal at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). The crystals diffracted to 2.5-Å resolution and a complete data set was collected using the oscillation method. Data were subsequently processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38241) Google Scholar). Crystals of the native SsMTAP belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221. Data for SsMTAP crystals containing sulfate and guanosine, adenosine, MTA, or FMB were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Data for the SsMTAP crystals grown in the presence of phosphate with and without FMB were also collected at CHESS. All data for SsMTAP complexes were collected using frozen crystals. The CHESS data were processed with MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Brick P. Wonacott A.T. Daresbury Lab. Info. Q. Protein Crystallogr. 1986; 18: 33-39Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA (22Evans, P. R. (1993) in Proceedings of CCCP4 Study Weekend, Data Collection and Processing, January 29–30, pp. 114–122, SERC, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK.Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite of programs (23Collaborative Computational Project-Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19664) Google Scholar). The native SsMTAP crystals and SsMTAP crystals containing MTA/sulfate, FMB/sulfate, FMB/phosphate, and sulfate alone all crystallized in the orthorhombic space group C2221. The SsMTAP crystals containing guanosine/sulfate, adenosine/sulfate, and phosphate alone all crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21. The unit cell parameters for the two space groups are related withaO ∼ aM,bO ∼ 2bM, andcO ∼ cMsinβM. There are three subunits per asymmetric unit in the orthorhombic form and the hexamer is formed using a crystallographic 2-fold axis. There is an entire hexamer in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic form. The Matthews number (VM) (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7893) Google Scholar) is 2.5 Å3/Da for both crystal forms, which corresponds to a solvent content of about 52%. Both forms grow under similar conditions and have similar crystal morphologies. The actual crystal form can only be determined by examining the x-ray intensity data.

Krenitsky T., A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as the search model (sequence identity is 32%). Data between 10- and 4-Å resolution were included in the cross-rotation and translation functions, which were carried out using the CNS software package (25DeLano W.L. Bruenger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1995; 51: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The rotated and translated search model was carried through a round of rigid-body refinement. Electron density maps were calculated using the observed amplitudes measured from the native SsMTAP crystal and phases calculated from the refined search model. The interactive computer graphics program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) was then used to replace residues in theE. coli search model with corresponding residues in the SsMTAP sequence. Several rounds of torsion angle simulated annealing using CNS followed by manual refitting of the model in O were performed. Water molecules were included in the model during subsequent rounds of refinement. This refined model was then used as a search model in molecular replacement to determine the structure of the monoclinic form of SsMTAP, which contains an entire hexamer in the asymmetric unit. Refinements of all structures were performed with iterative cycles of torsion angle simulated annealing using CNS and manual refitting of the models in O. The structures of the complexes were determined by refining the SsMTAP structure in the appropriate space group (P21 or C2221). After an initial round of simulated annealing refinement, difference Fourier maps were used to reveal the active site contents (Fig. 1). The ligand atoms were included in the model followed by iterative cycles of model building and refinement. Individual isotropic B-factors and water molecules were included during the later stages of refinement.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure reveals that SsMTAP is a hexamer containing six identical subunits of ∼27 kDa each, confirming the results from previous biochemical studies (1Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Bertoldo C. De Rosa M. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24762-24769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is disc shaped and is ∼40 Å thick with a diameter of about 106 Å across the hexameric face. The molecule displays D3symmetry and can be described as a trimer of dimers with three symmetric intersubunit disulfide bonds linking the dimers to one another. Fig. 2 shows the hexameric arrangement of subunits and the location of the disulfide bonds. The observation of only three disulfide bonds contrasts with results from earlier work, which predicted the presence of six intersubunit disulfide bonds and suggested that the hexamer was arranged as a dimer of trimers (1Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Bertoldo C. De Rosa M. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24762-24769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of SsMTAP is very similar to that of the E. coli PNP hexamer (7Mao C. Cook W., J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T., A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Bzowska A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Each SsMTAP monomer contains one active site, which is located near a dimer interface. The two active sites in the dimeric unit are related by a molecular 2-fold axis and are separated by about 20 Å. The dimers are formed mainly by contacts between residues from helix α2, helix α3, and three loops. These dimers form hexamers through contacts involving residues on strand β6, helix α3, helix α4, strand β7, and three loops. The hexamer forming contacts include disulfide bonds between pairs of 2-fold related Cys125 residues. Cys125 is located on the loop between helix α3 and helix α4 of each subunit near the center of the hexamer. Because the disulfide linkage spans a molecular 2-fold axis, only three disulfide bonds form per hexamer. The final models of SsMTAP and its complexes consist of all residues except for 1 or 2 residues at the N terminus of each chain and 3 or 4 residues in the loop between the last strand, β9, and the C-terminal α helix. These residues showed weak electron density and are believed to be flexible or disordered. The overall fold of SsMTAP (Fig.3) is very similar to E. coliPNP (7Mao C. Cook W., J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W.

The central portion of the molecule is made up of a large eight-stranded mixed β sheet with topology β2, β3, β4, β1, β5, β9, β6, and β7. Strand β8 is a 5-residue strand that forms hydrogen bonds with the ends of strands β7 and β5 resulting in a smaller 5-stranded β sheet with topology β6′, β7′, β8, β5′, and β9′, where the prime designates the C-terminal end of that strand. The two fused β sheets form a distorted β barrel near the active site. The core β sheet structure is flanked by seven α helices. Although no sulfate or phosphate was added during crystallization of native SsMTAP, some residual electron density was observed in the predicted phosphate-binding site. Modeling sulfate or phosphate in this region resulted in a poor fit to the electron density and refinement resulted in extremely high B-factors (>70 Å2) for either of these ions when it was included in the model. Based on these results neither sulfate nor phosphate is present in the final model. It is possible that the electron density is due to phosphate that is present at very low occupancy or that the phosphate-binding site is occupied by several disordered water molecules. Co-crystallization of SsMTAP with the nucleoside substrate guanosine in the presence of sulfate resulted in a ternary complex of SsMTAP-Guo-SO4. Sulfate was chosen as a phosphate substitute on the basis that the two anions share similar chemical characteristics and that sulfate is an inhibitor of the catalytic reaction. There is one hexamer in the asymmetric unit and each of the six active sites contains one molecule of guanosine bound in the nucleoside-binding site and one sulfate ion bound in the phosphate-binding site. The refined guanosine shows a glycosidic torsion angle (O4′-C1′-N9-C4) of 109° and a C4′-endo sugar pucker. This is an unusual conformation compared with nucleosides in solution, which generally have a glycosidic torsion angle near 0° (syn) or 180° (anti) and a C2′-endoor C3′-exo sugar pucker (27Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). However, the nucleoside conformation is similar to that found in the mammalian PNP-nucleoside complexes (11Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M. Federov A.A. Almo S.C. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7135-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization of SsMTAP with the nucleoside substrate adenosine in the presence of sulfate resulted in a ternary complex of SsMTAP-Ado-SO4. There is one hexamer in the asymmetric unit and difference electron density maps revealed some variation in the adenosine occupancy among the six active sites. As a result, adenosine was modeled in only four of the six active sites. One sulfate ion was bound in each of the six phosphate-binding sites. Adenosine is observed with a glycosidic torsion angle of 116° and a C4′-endosugar pucker. Co-crystallization of SsMTAP with the nucleoside substrate MTA in the presence of sulfate resulted in a ternary complex of SsMTAP-MTA-SO4. There is one-half of a hexamer in the asymmetric unit. Each of the three active sites contains one molecule of MTA bound in the nucleoside-binding site and one sulfate ion bound in the phosphate-binding site. Both the initial Fo− Fc and the final 2Fo −Fc difference maps reveal weak density for the 5′-methylthio group while density for the purine base and the remainder of the ribose moiety is well defined. It is possible that the inability of the 5′-methylthio group to form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of His5 may allow this portion of the molecule to become flexible. Consequently, the weak density for the methylthio group likely results from high thermal motion or disorder. MTA is modeled with a glycosidic torsion angle of 124° and a C4′-endosugar pucker. Co-crystallization of SsMTAP with either sulfate or phosphate resulted in the binary complexes SsMTAP-SO4 and SsMTAP-PO4, respectively. For each complex there is one hexamer in the asymmetric unit and each of the six active sites contains one sulfate/phosphate ion bound in the phosphate-binding site. Closer inspection of the electron density maps for the SsMTAP-PO4 complex revealed the presence of one well ordered molecule of Tris bound to each phosphate ion and extending into the ribose-binding site. Interestingly, although Tris buffer is used at a concentration of 0.1 m for all co-crystallization experiments, none of the sulfate containing structures revealed the presence of a bound Tris molecule in the active site. Co-crystallization of SsMTAP with the noncleavable inosine analog FMB and phosphate revealed only phosphate bound in the active site. In this complex, there is one-half of a hexamer in the asymmetric unit and each of the three active sites contains one molecule of phosphate ion. Further inspection of the electron density map revealed that a molecule of Tris was bound instead of FMB. In contrast, co-crystallization with FMB in the presence of sulfate revealed both sulfate and FMB in the active site. The SsMTAP-FMB-SO4 ternary complex has one-half of a hexamer in the asymmetric unit and each of the three active sites contain one molecule of FMB bound in the nucleoside-binding site and one molecule of sulfate ion bound in the phosphate-binding site. The active site of SsMTAP was characterized using the binary and ternary complexes described above. The SsMTAP active site is located near the surface of the molecule in a groove formed at the dimer interface (Fig. 2). In contrast to the buried active site of the trimeric PNPs, the SsMTAP active site is relatively open. This exposed active site is similar to that seen in the hexameric E. coli PNP structure (7Mao C. Cook W., J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T., A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D.

The active site of SsMTAP consists of about 18 residues from eight separate polypeptide regions. These include Gly21, Arg25, Ile64, Arg86, Thr89, Thr90,Gly91, Phe160, Glu163, Val179, Glu180, Met181, Glu182, Ser204, and Asp205 from one subunit and Val4, His5, and Arg43from an adjacent subunit.

J. and Woodcock, E. A. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 10845–10850). To examine the PLC subtype mediating the α1-adrenergic receptor response, PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 were overexpressed in NCM using adenoviral infection (Ad-PLC-β1 NCM and Ad-PLC-β3 NCM, respectively) and PLC responses assessed from [3H]inositol phosphate (InsP) generation in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The [3H]InsP response to NE (100 μm) was enhanced in Ad-PLC-β1NCM relative to cells infected with blank virus (Ad-MX NCM), but was reduced in Ad-PLC-β3 NCM. In contrast, the [3H]InsP response to ATP (100 μm) was not elevated in Ad-PLC-β1 NCM, and was enhanced rather than diminished in Ad-PLC-β3 NCM, showing that effects of the two PLC-β isoforms were specific for particular receptor types. PLC-δ1 overexpression selectively reduced NE-induced [3H]InsP responses, without affecting the ATP stimulation. The reduced NE response was associated with a selective loss of PLC-β1 expression in Ad-PLC-δ1 NCM. α1-Adrenergic receptor activation caused phosphorylation of PLC-β1 but not PLC-β3, whereas stimulation by ATP induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3 but not PLC-β1. Taken together, these studies provide evidence that NE-stimulated InsP generation in NCM is primarily mediated by PLC-β1, despite the presence of both PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 isoforms. Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NCM) generates primarily inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) in response to rises in intracellular Ca2+, or inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) in response to norepinephrine (NE) (Matkovich, S.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 2-3Google Scholar), and Ins(1,4,5)P3, which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). However, studies from our laboratory using intact heart and isolated cardiomyocytes have shown that, unlike responses in other cell types, α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) stimulation of cardiomyocytes generates principally Ins(1,4)P2, which has no Ca2+-mobilizing function (3Woodcock E. Suss M. Anderson K. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 252-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Matkovich S.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Biol.

In marked contrast, increased intracellular Ca2+ itself stimulates robust Ins(1,4,5)P3 responses (4Matkovich S.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10845-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Introduction of Ins(1,4,5)P3 into patch-clamped myocytes causes inward, depolarizing current via Na+/Ca2+ exchange (5Gilbert J.C. Shirayama T. Pappano A.J. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1632-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and is associated with prolongation of the action potential and the consequent development of early and delayed afterdepolarizations (6Felzen B. Shilkrut M. Less H. Saparov I. Coleman R. Robinson R. Berke G. Binah O. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, Ins(1,4,5)P3 is potentially arrhythmogenic (7Lipp P. Laine M. Tovey S.C. Burrell K.M. Berridge M.J. Li W. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 939-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and mechanisms that by-pass its generation may be cardioprotective. For these reasons, we sought to clarify the mechanisms responsible for primary generation of Ins(1,4)P2, rather than Ins(1,4,5)P3 in response to α1-AR activation. As an initial step in this process, we attempted to identify the PLC subtype mediating the response. The three major classes of mammalian PtdIns-specific PLC enzymes are β, γ, and δ (8Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), and a new class, PLC-ε, has recently been identified (9Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M.

PLC-β isoforms can be activated by heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq class via its activated α subunit (10Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C.

GTPγS-bound Gαq has been shown to stimulate both PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 to a similar extentin vitro (13Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, especially those of the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi class, are able to activate PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 (15Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A.

PLC-γ isoforms comprise a part of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase cascades and can also be stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate generated in response to phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation (17Bae Y.S.

It is the most Ca2+-sensitive of the PLC subtypes (20Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), and there have been reports of its activation by the GTP-binding protein transglutaminase II in response to α1-AR stimulation (21Nakaoka H.

The current experiments were undertaken to establish which PLC isoform mediates the distinctive InsP response to α1-AR activation in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. NCM were prepared from 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups, essentially as described previously (23Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). NCM were isolated by repeated trypsin digestion with gentle mechanical dispersion, pre-plated twice for 30 min each to remove non-myocytes, and left to attach for 18 h in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate onto uncoated dishes, at a typical seeding density of 700 cells/mm2. Medium was then replaced with a defined serum-free medium consisting of DMEM, 10 μg/ml human insulin, 10 μg/ml bovine apo-transferrin, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Bromodeoxyuridine was omitted after 3 days. NCM were treated with adenovirus and labeled with [3H]inositol in defined inositol-free, serum-free medium for 48 h prior to experiments. Adenoviruses expressing PLC-β1, PLC-β3, and Gα11 were prepared as described previously (24Gasa R. Trinh K.Y., Yu, K. Wilkie T.M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rat PLC-δ1 cloned into theNotI site of pZipNeo (25Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. S. G. Rhee. The NotI restriction fragment corresponding to PLC-δ1 was subcloned into pXCMV, which is an adenoviral shuttle vector formed by subcloning a pRcCMV expression cassette (Invitrogen) into pXCX3, which in turn is derived from pXCX2 (26Spessot R. Inchley K. Hupel T.M. Bacchetti S. Virology. 1989; 168: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This construct was cotransfected into HEK293 cells with pJM17 (modified adenovirus backbone), and cultures were overlaid with agarose. Following recombination, individual plaques were selected and purified through sequential rounds of infection and agarose overlay. High titer viral stocks were produced by amplification of the virus through successive rounds of infection in HEK293 cells, with purification on CsCl gradients. Blank virus (Ad-MX) contained the adenoviral backbone but expressed no additional gene product. Rat PLCγ1 was subcloned into pShuttle-CMV and recombined with pAdEasy-1 (27Mitchell C.J. Kelly M.M. Blewitt M. Wilson J.R. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19072-19077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 10–50 plaque-forming units/cell, corresponding to 0.5–2.5 × 107 plaque-forming units/35-mm well. Infection with adenovirus expressing an S65T-modified green fluorescent protein (kindly supplied by Dr. Ross Hannan, Molecular Physiology Laboratory, Baker Medical Research Institute) confirmed infection of >90% of cardiomyocytes present on each well. NCM were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins extracted in ice-cold lysis buffer at pH 7.7 containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein content of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard using a dye reagent from Bio-Rad. Proteins from whole-cell lysates were separated on 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (28Cannon-Carlson S. Tang J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to confirm equal protein loading and transfer efficiency, blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, and then probed with antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Gαq/11, PLC-β1, and PLC-β3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for Gαq/11 and PLC-β3 and 2 μg/ml for PLC-β1. Mouse monoclonal anti-PLC-δ1antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology and used at a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml. Mouse monoclonal anti-PLC-γ1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories and used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit) were used at a dilution of 1:5000 for PLC-β1 and 1:10,000 for all other PLCs and Gαq/11. [3H]Inositol-labeled (48 h, 10 μCi/ml) NCM were washed with unlabeled medium and pretreated with 10 mm LiCl in DMEM for 10 min prior to the addition of agonist. For experiments involving NE, propranolol (1 μm) and β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) were included. For experiments using the synthetic α1-AR agonist phenylephrine (PE), propranolol (1 μm) was included. After stimulation, [3H]InsPs were extracted with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmsodium phytate and the supernatants subsequently treated with a 1:1 mixture of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane:tri-n-octylamine to remove remaining trichloroacetic acid. The aqueous phase containing [3H]InsPs was prepared for high performance liquid chromatography, which was performed as described previously (29Woodcock E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Neonatal cardiomyocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 80 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid. Labeled cells were challenged with agonists for the specified times and subsequently lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g (4 °C, 15 min), and the resultant supernatant was pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 30 s, 4 °C), the supernatants were incubated at 4 °C overnight with PLC-β1 (4 μg) or PLC-β3 (2 μg) antibodies and protein A-Sepharose with gentle rocking. Precipitates were washed five times at 0 °C, extracted with sample buffer, and proteins separated on a 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.32P labeling was quantified using a Fujix BAS 1000 phosphorimager. Fetal calf serum specially selected for low endotoxin was obtained from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Parkville, Australia). DMEM, Hepes, and other materials for the preparation of cell culture solutions and media were cell culture-grade obtained from Sigma and dissolved in MilliQ H2O. Norepinephrine bitartrate and ATP (disodium salt) were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Inositol (18.00 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Bucks., United Kingdom). [32P]Orthophosphoric acid (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences or Bresatec, Pty. Ltd. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or BDH/AnalaR and were of analytical reagent grade. Differences between treatment groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, and accepted as statistically significant at a family error rate ofp < 0.05 (individual pairwise comparisons were significant at p < 0.02). Unless otherwise noted, results shown are from representative experiments performed in triplicate, which were repeated in independent NCM preparations at least three times. InsP responses to α1-adrenergic receptor activation are mediated by the Gq class of heterotrimeric G proteins that stimulate the β isoforms of PLC. PLC-β1 and PLC-β3isoforms are expressed in NCM, and both of these are potential targets for activated Gαq (13Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the PLC-β isoform principally mediating α1-AR-stimulated InsP responses in NCM, we overexpressed either PLC-β1 or PLC-β3 and measured [3H]InsP responses to NE. NCM were labeled with [3H]inositol, treated for 48 h with adenoviruses expressing PLC-β1 or PLC-β3, and then washed and pretreated with 1 μm propranolol and 10 mm LiCl prior to stimulation with 100 μm NE for 20 min. In Ad-MX NCM, NE increased [3H]InsP content (Fig.1). In comparison with Ad-MX NCM, Ad-PLC-β1 NCM showed an enhanced NE response, but NE responses in Ad-PLC-β3 NCM were significantly decreased (Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that overexpression of PLC-β1 has different effects on NE responses from overexpressed PLC-β3, and suggest that PLC-β1 is more likely to be a mediator of α1-AR responses. Neither PLC-β1 nor PLC-β3 overexpression caused any alteration in [3H]InsP content in unstimulated cells. Overexpressed PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 had opposite effects on [3H]InsP responses to NE, and it was necessary to determine if this finding was specific to α1-AR responses. Similar experiments were performed using ATP to stimulate [3H]InsP responses via P2Y2-purinergic receptors in NCM. [3H]InsP responses to 100 μm ATP in Ad-MX NCM, Ad-PLC-β1 NCM, or Ad-PLC-β3 NCM are shown in Fig. 1. In contrast to findings with NE, ATP-stimulated [3H]InsP responses were not altered by overexpression of PLC-β1 and furthermore were enhanced, rather than decreased, in Ad-PLC-β3 NCM. Thus, overexpressing each of the two PLC-β isoforms causes different effects on NE and ATP responses. The data suggest that PLC-β1 is the primary PLC isoform responsible for [3H]InsP responses to α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, but PLC-β3 is a more likely mediator of responses to ATP. Experiments were performed to examine effects of overexpressed PLC-β1 or PLC-β3 on the contents of other intermediates potentially involved in receptor stimulation of InsP generation. Extracts of Ad-MX NCM, Ad-PLC-β1 NCM, and Ad-PLC-β3 NCM were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with subtype-selective PLC and Gαq/11 antibodies. As expected, overexpression of PLC-β1 increased PLC-β1 content, but surprisingly also increased the expression of PLC-δ1 (Fig.2). There was no change in the content of PLC-β3, PLC-γ1, or Gαq/11. Overexpression of PLC-β3 increased the amount of PLC-β3 with no change in PLC-β1, PLC-γ1, or Gαq/11 content, and there was no change in PLC-δ1 content. The finding that Ad-PLC-β1 NCM contained heightened levels of PLC-δ1 as well as PLC-β1 raised the possibility that PLC-δ1 contributed to the increased α1-AR response. Accordingly, experiments were performed with Ad-PLC-δ1 NCM. Whereas PLC-β1 or PLC-β3 overexpression did not increase basal activity, there was an elevated [3H]InsP content in Ad-PLC-δ1 NCM (Fig.3). Despite the increased basal activity, Ad-PLC-δ1 NCM had a reduced [3H]InsP response to NE (Fig. 3A). Thus, increased PLC-δ1 content does not account for the enhanced NE response seen in Ad-PLC-β1 NCM, and this instead most likely reflects the increased PLC-β1 availability. In contrast to findings with NE, overexpression of PLC-δ1did not reduce the InsP response to ATP (Fig. 3B). Thus, α1-AR stimulation of [3H]InsP generation was specifically disrupted by overexpression of PLC-δ1. To identify possible mechanisms by which PLC-δ1 overexpression might lead to a selective reduction in α1-AR-stimulated PLC activity, we examined the cellular content of PLC isoforms and Gαq/11. Cell lysates from Ad-MX NCM and Ad-PLC-δ1 NCM were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies to PLC-δ1, PLC-β1, PLC-β3, PLC-γ1, and Gαq/11. Treatment with virus encoding PLC-δ1 resulted in a marked elevation of PLC-δ1 content (Fig. 4). Levels of PLC-β3, PLC-γ1, and Gαq/11 were not altered by PLC-δ1overexpression, but PLC-β1 content was markedly reduced (Fig. 4). Thus, the selectively reduced NE-stimulated [3H]InsP response in Ad-PLC-δ1 NCM is associated with decreased PLC-β1 expression, and this may explain the reduced response to α1-AR stimulation. Overexpression studies provided evidence that PLC-β1 is the primary mediator of InsP responses to α1-AR activation, despite the presence of both PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 isoforms. However, such high levels of expression could potentially lead to unphysiological interactions. For this reason, it was necessary to find evidence for selective interaction between the receptors and the PLC-β subtypes at physiological expression levels. To do this we measured PLC-β isoform phosphorylation in response to stimulation with the synthetic α1-AR agonist PE or with ATP. PE was used in these experiments rather then NE to minimize any possible PLC-β3 phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase A (30Strassheim D. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39767-39772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) following β-AR stimulation. NCM were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h then stimulated with either PE (50 μm, plus 1 μm propranolol to block β-ARs) or ATP (100 μm) for 30 s or 1 min. Extracts were prepared, immunoprecipitated with PLC-β1 antibody, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No32P-labeled material with the expected molecular mass values of PLC-β1 (140 and 150 kDa for the two splice variants; Ref. 31Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J.K. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was observed in immunoprecipitated extracts from unstimulated NCM or from NCM treated with ATP. However, stimulation with PE (50 μm) for 30 s caused the appearance of a phosphorylated band within this molecular mass range. Stimulation for 1 min was less effective. Subsequent ECL-Western blotting of the membrane confirmed the immunoprecipitation of PLC-β1 (Fig.5A). In similar experiments, 32P-labeled NCM were treated with 50 μm PE or 100 μm ATP for 30 s or 1 min, and extracts were immunoprecipitated with PLC-β3antibody. No 32P-labeled band corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of PLC-β3 (143 kDa), was detected in extracts immunoprecipitated with PLC-β3antibody from unstimulated cells or from cells stimulated with PE. However, stimulation with ATP for 1 min (30 s was less effective) caused phosphorylation of PLC-β3 (Fig. 5B). Thus, α1-AR and P2Y2R specifically phosphorylate PLC-β1 and PLC-β3, respectively. Results of these studies at physiological levels of PLC expression support the conclusions from the overexpression experiments that α1-ARs couple to PLC-β1 and P2Y2Rs couple to PLC-β3. The apparently selective interaction of P2Y2Rs to PLC-β3 might be explained if these coupled primarily to Gi rather than Gq/11 in NCM. To examine this possibility, we treated NCM with PTX (1 μg/ml, for 24 h) to inactivate G proteins of the Giclass. PTX treatment did not significantly reduce the stimulation by either NE (100 μm) or ATP (100 μm), providing evidence that neither receptor type was Gi-coupled (Fig.6A). In another series of experiments, Gα11 was overexpressed in NCM by treating with adenovirus encoding Gα11(Ad-Gα11) for 48 h (50 plaque-forming units/cell). Overexpression of Gα11 increased responses to both NE and ATP (Fig. 6B), supporting the notion that both responses are mediated by the Gq/11 class of heterotrimeric G protein. Thus, the data provide evidence that α1-ARs couple to PLC-β1 via Gq/11 while P2Y2Rs also couple via Gq/11 but in this case the PLC activated is PLC-β3. We have recently reported two distinct pathways of InsP generation in NCM, one involving Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation in response to elevated Ca2+ and the other involving primarily the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P to Ins(1,4)P2 following α1-AR activation (4Matkovich S.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10845-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 is associated with the onset of arrhythmias (7Lipp P. Laine M. Tovey S.C. Burrell K.M. Berridge M.J. Li W. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 939-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 32Du X.-J. Anderson K. Jacobsen A. Woodcock E. Dart A.

Circulation. 1996; 93: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); thus, hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P to Ins(1,4)P2, by limiting changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation, may be an important cardioprotective mechanism. It is essential, therefore, to identify the mechanisms responsible for the preferential hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P to Ins(1,4)P2, and, as a first step, this report is concerned with identifying the PLC subtype mediating the response to α1-AR activation. α1-ARs couple via the Gq/11 class of heterotrimeric G proteins (34Rybin V. Han H.M. Steinberg S.F. G Proteins. 1996; 29: 344-361Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to PLC-β isoforms (11Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.-H. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and of these the β1 and β3 subtypes are expressed in cardiomyocytes (8Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 14Jhon D.-Y. Lee H.-H. Park D. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We overexpressed the two candidate PLC-β subtypes in NCM using adenoviral infection and examined their effects on NE responses. Overexpression of PLC-β1 enhanced NE-stimulated [3H]InsP responses, in keeping with an activation mediated by the α subunit of Gq. However, even though Gαq has been shown to interact with PLC-β3, overexpression of this latter PLC isoform actually decreased rather than increased NE responses. Importantly, overexpression of the two PLC-β subtypes affected P2Y2R signaling differently, with overexpressed PLC-β3 actually increasing, rather than decreasing [3H]InsP responses (Fig. 1). Thus, taken together, the data imply that PLC-β1 is instrumental in mediating responses to NE, but not those to ATP. The mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of PLC-β3 overexpression on α1-AR-mediated responses have not been further elucidated. It is possible that the large excess of PLC-β3 relative to PLC-β1in Ad-PLC-β3 NCM competes for access to endogenous Gαq (13Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PLC-γ1 (27Mitchell C.J. Kelly M.M. Blewitt M. Wilson J.R. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19072-19077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) did not alter [3H]InsP responses to either NE or ATP, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 μm) was not inhibitory (data not shown). Thus, neither receptor appears to be coupled to PLC-γ under the conditions of our experiments (35Puceat M. Vassort G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An unexpected finding of these studies was the apparently selective effect of PLC-β1 and PLC-δ1 on the expression of each other (Figs. 2 and 4). Overexpression of PLC-β1 caused increased expression of PLC-δ1, whereas overexpressed PLC-δ1reduced PLC-β1 content. The mechanism and the physiological relevance of these changes are unknown. However, in the context of the current studies, this cross-talk provided further support for PLC-β1 as the mediator of α1-AR signaling in NCM. Overexpression of PLC-δ1 decreased the α1-AR response, as expected if this were mediated by PLC-β1 (Fig. 4). The demonstration that overexpressed PLCs can have apparently “specific” effects on other isoforms made it imperative to show that α1-ARs and P2Y2Rs interact with PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 selectively, at physiological levels of the PLC isoforms. In non-transfected NCM, addition of ATP but not the α1-AR agonist phenylephrine caused rapid phosphorylation of PLC-β3. This again pointed to P2Y2R but not α1-AR coupling to PLC-β3, in agreement with the findings of the overexpression studies. Selective phosphorylation of PLC-β3 has been reported previously in ATP-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary cells (30Strassheim D. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39767-39772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), even though PLC-β1 was present. Phosphorylation of PLC-β3 by protein kinase C, protein kinase A, or protein kinase G family members has been reported and is associated with decreased activity (36Yue C.P. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Yue C.P. Kus C.Y. Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19770-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLC-β1 has previously been reported only in response to receptor tyrosine kinases, and in these studies was shown not to occur in response to G protein coupled receptors (39Faenza I. Matteucci A. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Aluigi M. Peruzzi D. Vitale M. Castorina S. Suh P.G. Cocco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30520-30524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40Martelli A.M. Billi A.M. Manzoli L. Faenza I. Aluigi M. Falconi M. DePol A. Gilmour R.S. Cocco L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Such phosphorylation of PLC-β1 downstream of tyrosine kinases and growth signaling pathways appears to be a feature of undifferentiated cells, as this response decreases with differentiation (41Cocco L. Rhee S.G. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli F.A. Eur. J. Histochem. 2000; 44: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cocco L. Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Manzoli F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The observed selective phosphorylation of PLC-β1 following α1-AR activation in cardiomyocytes, where more than 90% of the cells have lost replicative ability, is thus a novel finding and most likely involves different mechanisms from those described previously. This is currently under investigation. Despite the finding that ATP and NE activate different PLC-β subtypes, both appear to couple to the Gq/11 class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Thus, downstream signaling specificity is conferred by the receptor rather than the particular G protein involved. The most obvious explanation for this is that the receptors, coupling proteins, and PLCs, possibly together with other factors such as RGS proteins, are held in close association by a scaffolding system. In Drosophila photoreceptors, PLC and other signaling components form multiprotein structures through a PDZ scaffold protein (INAD) (43Cook B. BarYaacov M. BenAmi H.C. Goldstein R.E. Paroush Z. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such scaffolding proteins have not been identified in mammalian cells, but mammalian PLCs have domains that recognize PDZ domains, making a similar scenario a possibility (20Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 44Hwang J.I. Heo K. Shin K.J. Kim E. Yun C.H.C. Ryu S.H. Shin H.S. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16632-16637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In further support of a scaffolding principle, a recent study has identified multiple Gα-binding domains in the sequences of “activators of G protein signaling” (AGS molecules), suggesting a possible scaffolding function (45Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments using green fluorescent protein-tagged Gαq, showed a non-homogeneous distribution of Gαq in the plasma membrane, resembling clusters of receptor populations seen in previous studies (46Hughes T.E. Zhang H.L. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that there are signaling complexes involving receptors, G proteins, and PLC enzymes in NCM and that these account for the observed PLC subtype-selective coupling to particular receptor classes. Discrete areas of plasma membrane enriched in PtdIns(4,5)P2have been demonstrated (47Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that PLC can act on this substrate to generate Ins(1,4,5)P3 only when the PLC-containing complex and the PtdIns(4,5)P2 are co-localized. Such a mechanism could provide an explanation for the preferential hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P following α1-AR activation. However, such a proposal requires that PtdIns(4)P is localized differently from PtdIns(4,5)P2, and this is currently unknown. Another possibility is that the specific phosphorylation of PLC-β1 in NCM, in some way alters the activity to cause a change in preferred or available substrate. Further studies are required to distinguish these possibilities. We thank Dr. Hongwei Qian for expert help with the phosphorylation studies and Bronwyn Kenney for technical assistance.

To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed specific regulatory regions within theSM-MHC −4.2 to +11.6 kb region by a combination of deletion analyses of various SM-MHC transgenes as well as by DNaseI hypersensitivity assays and in vivo footprinting in intact SMC tissues. The results showed that SM-MHCtransgene expression depended on a large number of required regulatory modules that were widely spread over the −4.2 to +11.6 region. Moreover, the results revealed several unexpected novel features of regulation of the SM-MHCgene including: 1) unique combinations of regulatory modules were required for SM-MHCexpression in different SMC-subtypes; 2) repressor modules as well as activator modules were both critical for SMC specificity of the gene; 3) certain modules were required in certain contexts but were dispensable in others within a given SMC-subtype (i.e. the net activity of the module was determined by interaction between modules not simply by the sum of module activities); and 4) we identified a highly conserved 200-base pair transcriptional regulatory module at +8 kb that was required in the large arteries but dispensable in the coronary arteries and airways in transgenic mice and contained multiple potential cis-elements that were occupied by nuclear proteins in the intact aorta based on in vivofootprinting. Taken together, the results suggest a model of complex modular control of expression of the SM-MHC gene that varies between SMC subtypes.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Its expression is regulated precisely and dynamically during SMC differentiation and also during the formation and development of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis (2Aikawa M. Sakomura Y. Ueda M. Kimura K. Manabe I. Ishiwata S. Komiyama N. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Aikawa M. Kim H.S. Kuro-o M. Manabe I. Watanabe M. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies on the mechanisms that regulate SM-MHCgene expression would be of great importance not only for understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in SMC differentiation but also for the understanding of the mechanisms of phenotypic modulation of SMCs in vascular diseases. We previously demonstrated that the SM-MHC genomic region from −4.2 to +11.6 kb was capable of driving LacZ transgene expression in virtually all SMC subtypes in transgenic mice in vivo (4Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, a LacZ transgene containing the −4.2 kb to +88 bp of the SM-MHC gene was not expressed in any SMCs in multiple transgenic lines, indicating an absolute requirement of the intronic sequence from +88 bp to +11.6 kb forSM-MHC expression in vivo. We have confirmed recently the rigorous SMC specificity of the SM-MHC −4.2 to +11.6 region in vivo using a Cre recombinase-activating reporter system in which transgenic mice carrying an SM-MHC−4.2 to +11.6 region Cre transgene were crossed to a floxed indicator line that showed Cre-induced activation of LacZ (5Regan C.P. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because this system provides an integral of promoter activity throughout development and maturation, it provides a very sensitive means of detecting even transient expression in non-SMCs. Transgene expression was tightly confined within the SMCs in this system, thus further demonstrating the SMC specificity of the SM-MHC −4.2 to +11.6 kb sequence (5Regan C.P. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a first step to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the SM-MHC gene, we previously analyzed the function of three conserved CArG elements within the 5′-flanking and first intronic sequences in transgenic mice (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Results of these studies demonstrated that the three CArG elements were differentially required in SMC subtypes in vivo. For example, although CArG1 in the 5′-flanking sequence was required for all SMCs, the intronic CArG element was dispensable in all SMC subtypes other than the large arteries. These results implied that expression of theSM-MHC gene was regulated by multiple transcriptional regulatory regions including the 5′-flanking and intronic regions containing the CArG elements. However, these studies examined the function of individual cis-elements and did not define the precise regulatory regions within the −4.2 to +11.6 SM-MHCregion required for SMC-specific gene expression in vivo. Similarly, although the previous studies showing that the proximalSM22α promoter was capable of driving transgene expression in arterial SMCs but not in venous or visceral SMCs suggest that this gene is controlled by multiple regulatory modules (7Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev.

Development. 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar), the specific regulatory modules required for expression within SMC subtypes have not been identified. To examine the hypothetical modular control mechanisms of the SMC-specific genes in vivo, we analyzed regions within −4.2 to +11.6 kb of the SM-MHC gene that were required for expression of the gene in vivo in transgenic mice. The results support a complex model in which the SM-MHC is controlled by multiple positive- and negative-acting regulatory modules that are widely distributed within the −4.2 to +11.6 kb sequence. Moreover, we present novel evidence showing that these regulatory modules function differentially in SMC subtypes. These results imply that the SM-MHC gene regulatory system consists of multiple modular regulatory domains that confer the capability for SMCs to respond to vastly divergent environmental cues in developmental space and time and under pathophysiological conditions. Deletion constructs of the −4.2/+11.6 LacZ were generated by restriction digestion and ligation. The integrity of the constructs was determined by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing. The structure of the constructs is indicated schematically in Fig. 1. To generate the −1.3/+11.6 LacZ construct, a part of the 5′-flanking sequence was taken from the pCAT-1346 (10Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For construction of the 3xHS7-TK LacZ plasmid, three copies of theStyI/StuI fragment (+8038 to +8327) containing the highly homologous sequence was subcloned in tandem 5′ of the minimal TK promoter in pTK LacZ (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The culture methods for rat aortic SMCs were described previously (10Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For transfection, SMCs were plated at 20,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates. DNA was transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) according to manufacturer recommendations on the next day of plating. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To eliminate errors in the production of plasmids and to eliminate variability of plasmid quality, at least two independently prepared plasmid DNA samples of independent clones were transfected in duplicate. Transgenic mice were produced using standard procedures (4Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These mice were used to establish breeding founder lines (F0) or sacrificed for the analysis of reporter expression (transient transgenic lines). The analysis of transgenic mice was performed as described previously (4Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All animal procedures used in these studies were reviewed and approved by the University of Virginia Animal Use and Care Committee. Transient transgenic lines were harvested at embryonic day 18.5. Because of the relatively weak activity of the wild-type SM-MHC −4.2/+11.6LacZ construct in many SMC tissues including large blood vessels within the embryo (4Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), LacZ expression patterns of various transgene constructs were mainly compared using 4–8-week-old F1 mice from founder lines except as noted otherwise. Because of inherent variations in transgene expression among transgenic lines and minor variations in the preparations from a given line, multiple independent transgenic lines of each construct were examined for transgene expression (see Table I). A similar pattern of transgene expression was observed between independent founder transgenic lines.Table ISummary of reporter gene expression in SM-MHC LacZ transgenic miceNo.ConstructLacZ-positive lines/total lines (transient)AortaCoronary arteryMesenteric arteryVena cavaAirwaysStomachIntestineBladderExpression in non-SMCs/ positive lines1−4.2/+11.64/4 (1)+++++++++++++++++++1 /42−1.3/+11.62/4 (0)−−−−+++++++2 /23−4.2/+2.53/8 (3)+/−−+−+++++++2 /34−4.2/+5.38 /10 (5)−−+/−−+/−+++0 /85−4.2/+5.3;+7.5/+910/11 (8)+++++++++++++++++++0 /106−4.2/+11.6 ΔHS73/3 (0)−++++++++++++++0 /37−4.2/+93/3 (1)+/−+/−+/−+/−+++++++++++0 /38−4.2/+2.5;+5.3/+11.64/4 (0)+++/−+++++++++++1 /493xHS7 − TK LacZ0/3 (0)−−−−−−−−0 /0 Open table in a new tab Rat-cultured SMCs were permeabilized and treated with DNaseI as described previously (11Ymer S. Jans D.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent rat-cultured SMCs in 15-cm dishes were rinsed with PBS. PBS was replaced with 3 ml of permeabilizing buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 0–3200 units/ml of DNaseI (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were permeabilized by adding 3 ml of permeabilizing buffer containing 0.12% lysolecithin (Sigma) and incubated for 6 min at room temperature. The cells were lysed by adding 1.2 ml of lysis buffer (312.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm EDTA, 6.25% SDS, and 1.25 mg/ml proteinase K). Samples were incubated at 37°C overnight. Genomic DNA was purified by phenol, phenol/chloroform, and chloroform extractions followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA was digested with restriction enzymes as indicated. The probes for Southern hybridization were aBamHI/ApaI fragment (probe A, −3140 to −2120),SacI/XmnI fragment (probe B, +3980 to +4580), andKpnI/XbaI fragment (probe C, +5310 to +5880) of the SM-MHC gene. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) treatment of intact tissues was described previously (12Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29842-29851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fat and matrixes were removed from tissues prior to DMS treatment. The intact rat aorta was incubated in 5 ml of PBS containing 8 µl of DMS for 2 min at 37°C with agitation. Endothelial and adventitial layers were removed from the aorta after DMS treatment. Genomic DNA was purified from the treated tissues and subjected to piperidine treatment as described previously (12Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29842-29851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated PCR was performed as described previously (12Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. J.

In brief, 2 µg of DNA samples was subjected to first primer extension from biotinylated gene-specific primer 1. A 20-µl reaction containing 1× LA Taq buffer (Takara), 0.5 pmol of primer, and 2 µg of DNA was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min using a thermal cycler. The temperature was decreased by 10 °C/min and held at Tm-5 °C for 30 min. Five microliters of 1× LA Taq buffer, 0.25 mm each of dNTPs, and 2.5 units of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) was added and incubated for 10 min. Subsequent reactions were incubated at 76 °C for 10 min. Primer extension products were then ligated to a double-stranded linker oligonucleotide by adding 45 µl of ligation mixture containing 7 µl of 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs), 0.7 µl of 100 mm ATP, 50 pmol of the double-stranded linker oligonucleotide, and 2 µl of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), and the reactions were incubated at 16 °C overnight. The linker oligonucleotide was produced by annealing 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTCT-3′ and 5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′ (13Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). A T nucleotide was added to the original sequence of the former oligo (13Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) to facilitate ligation of Taq-amplified products. Primer extension products were purified using Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Dynal). Forty microliters of Dynabeads was washed once with 100 µl of 2× binding and washing buffer (2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) using a magnetic separation stand (Promega). Beads were resuspended in 70 µl of 2× binding and washing buffer and then added to ligation reactions. The samples were mixed for 5 min at room temperature with constant rotation. Beads were washed two times with 100 µl of 2× binding and washing buffer and two times with 100 µl of 1× TE buffer (10 nm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 nm EDTA). Beads were resuspended in 40 µl of 0.15 m NaOH and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Beads were captured on a magnetic stand, and the supernatants were ethanol-precipitated using 250 µl of ethanol, 4 µl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH. 5.2, and 2 µl of SeeDNA coprecipitant (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precipitated DNA was washed twice with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 10 µl of distilled H2O. Exponential amplification was done in 50 µl of reaction containing 1× LA Taq buffer, 0.4 mmeach of dNTPs, 200 nm gene-specific primer 2, 200 nm linker primer, and 2.5 units of LA Taq. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min and 15–18 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; Tm-5 °C for 2 min; 76 °C for 3 min and 1 cycle of 76 °C for 10 min. Fifteen microliters of PCR products were labeled for visualization by adding 5 µl of labeling mixture containing 1× LA Taq buffer, 20 nm32P end-labeled gene-specific primer 3, 1.5 mm each dNTPs, and 1.25 units of LA Taq and incubated at 94 °C for 2 min and 5–8 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, Tm-5 °C for 2 min, 76 °C for 3 min, and 1 cycle of 76 °C for 10 min. PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and resolved on denaturing 6% Long Ranger (BMA) gels. Sequencing ladders produced from the gene-specific primer 3 were run on the same gel as size markers (data not shown). The PCR primers for the antisense strand (forward primers) are: gene-specific primer 1, 5′-CAAAGCATTCAGTGTGGAAC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CTTCCTTGGCTTTGACCAAAGCAGTC-3′; and primer 3, 5′-TCCTTGGCTTTGACCAAAGCAGTCTTGTGC-3′. Primers for the sense strand (reverse primers) are: primer 1, 5′-AACATACTTTAGGCACATAG-3′; primer 2, 5′-GTCACTCAGAGGCCTAGTGTTTGTG-3′; and primer 3, 5′-CACTCAGAGGCCTAGTGTTTGTGTCATTCC-3′. The methods for preparation of nuclear extracts and for performing EMSAs were described previously (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 kcpm of 32P-labeled probe was incubated with nuclear extracts in 20 µl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) with 0.25 µg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min. For supershift assays, 1 µl of specified antibody was added after the 20-min incubation period, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 10 min. The reactions were run on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Sequences of EMSA probes are: rat Ft3 probe, 5′-CTCACTCCGTTTTTGGCCAGA-3′; human Ft3, 5′-GCTCTCCTTTTTTGTACAGA-3′; serum response element, 5′-AGATGTCCTAATATGGACATCCT-3′; and Ft4, 5′-GACACAAACTTTGCACTTGATCTTGTT-3′. Results of our previous studies showed that expression of the SM-MHCgene in vivo depended on 1) the region from −4.2 to +11.6 kb and 2) three CArG elements located within two highly conserved regions of ∼200 bp in the 5′-flanking sequence at −1.3 kb and the first intronic sequence at +1.6 kb (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On this basis, we hypothesized that the SM-MHC gene might be regulated by multiple transcriptional regulatory subregions including these two CArG-containing regions. The overall goal of the present studies was to test this hypothesis and to identify specific transcriptional regulatory regions required for SM-MHC expression in vivo. Given the very large size of the SM-MHCregulatory region (∼16 kb), we employed multiple experimental methods and strategies to characterize regulatory regions including 1) DNaseI hypersensitive assays and in vivo footprinting to identify regions that may contain transcriptionally active elements based on evidence of binding of nuclear proteins, 2) identification of regions that are conserved across species, 3) testing various SM-MHCpromoter constructs based on transient transfection studies in cultured SMCs, and 4) testing selected promoter constructs in transgenic mice. However, our major focus was on testing candidate regions in vivo in transgenic mice, because cultured SMCs are know to be phenotypically modulated, and we have shown previously that results obtained in cultured SMCs are often invalid for predicting the activity of promoter constructs in vivo (4Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Expression patterns of various SM-MHC transgenic constructs were examined mainly using 4–8-week-old F1 mice because of the late induction of SM-MHC −4.2/+11.6 LacZ transgenes during mouse development (4Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the inherent variability in transgenic expression observed in embryos that would confound direct comparisons of the activity of various test constructs. To begin identification of specific regulatory regions required forSM-MHC expression in vivo, we first investigated whether subfragments containing known transcriptional regulatory regions were sufficient for transcription in vivo. We initially tested the sequence from −1342 bp to +11.6 kb (−1.3/+11.6LacZ, Construct 2 in Fig.1), because the 1346 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence contains the entire conserved 227-bp domain (−1321 to −1095) containing the CArG1 and CArG2 elements that we previously showed were required for expression within the context of the SM-MHC −4.2/+11.6 LacZ transgene (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, in reporter assays using cultured SMCs, the −1.3/+11.6LacZ construct showed activity equivalent to that of the −4.2/+11.6 LacZ (data not shown). In contrast, −1.3/+11.6LacZ transgenic mice clearly showed weaker LacZexpression in many SMC subtypes as compared with −4.2/+11.6LacZ transgenic mice (Fig. 2and Table I). For example, the −1.3/+11.6 LacZ construct showed no expression in vascular SMCs except very weak expression in several small arteries (Fig. 2, compare panels 2a with1a). Relatively strong transgene expression was observed in the trachea and main trunks of bronchi (Figs. 2, 2b, and3e), but no expression was detected in airway SMCs within the smaller branches of the bronchial tree. The transgene was expressed strongly in the GI tract and bladder (Fig. 2, 2c–2e), although expression was somewhat uneven with some cells staining very intensely, whereas others were very weakly stained. Of particular significance, unlike the wild-type −4.2/+11.6 LacZ transgene, which is highly SMC-specific, the expression of the −1.3/+11.6 LacZ transgene was observed consistently in a fraction of cardiac muscle cells and various non-SMC mesenchymal cells (data not shown). These results thus clearly demonstrate that the −1.3 to +11.6 region was not sufficient for SMC-specific expression in vivo and the region from −4.2 to −1.3 contains regulatory sequences important for the expression in vascular and airway SMCs as well as elements required for restrictingSM-MHC expression to SMCs.Figure 3Histological and macroscopic examination ofLacZ expression in various SM-MHCdeletion mutant transgenic mice. β-Galactosidase staining of various transgenic mouse tissues. a–d, histological examination of the aorta of the −4.2/+2.5 LacZ(a), −4.2/+5.3 LacZ (b), −4.2/+5.3;+7.5/+9 LacZ (c), and −4.2/+9LacZ (d) transgenic mice. e andf, histological sections of bronchus of the −1.3/+11.6LacZ (e) and −4.2/+2.5;+5.3/+11.6LacZ (f) transgenic mice. g andh, histological examination of the stomach of the −4.2/+2.5LacZ (g) and −4.2/+2.5;+5.3/+11.6LacZ (h) transgenic mice.

The 2500 bp of the first intronic sequence was chosen based on the fact that it contains the intronic CArG region (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and on results of transient transfection assays in cultured SMCs showing that the activity of the −4.2/+2.5LacZ construct was equivalent to that of the −4.2/+11.6LacZ construct (6Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Despite the strong reporter activity in cultured SMCs, the −4.2/+2.5 LacZ construct was not fully active in SMCs in vivo and showed differential reductions in transgene expression in several SMC subtypes in transgenic mice (Fig.2, compare row 3 with row 1). For example, very weak expression was observed in vascular SMCs within the aorta (Figs.2, 3a, and 3a). However, transgene expression in the airways was very strong and equivalent to that of the full-length transgenic lines (Fig. 2, compare 3b with 1b). The −4.2/+2.5 LacZ transgene was also expressed strongly in the GI tract. However, transgene expression in the GI tract differed among parts of the tissues (Figs. 2, 3d, and 3g) and did not show consistently strong staining as observed in −4.2/+11.6 LacZ transgenic mice. Strong transgene expression was also observed in cardiac and skeletal muscles (Figs. 2,3a, and 3i). These data indicate that theSM-MHC −4.2 to +2.5 kb region is not sufficient for expression of the SM-MHC gene in vivo and that the region between +2.5 and +11.6 kb is required for expression in subsets of SMCs including vascular and bladder SMCs. Results also show that the region from +2.5 to +11.6 contains regulatory regions that suppress transgene expression in non-SMCs. Taken together, the results of our initial experiments show that SM-MHC expressionin vivo requires regulatory modules located outside of the −1.3 to +2.5 kb region. Our initial results clearly demonstrated that theSM-MHC region from +2.5 to +11.6 contains regulatory regions required for SMC-specific expression of the SM-MHC gene in transgenic mice. Given the large size of this region and the relative lack of large regions that are highly conserved across species, we analyzed various 3′-deletion mutants of this region in cultured SMCs to identify possible regulatory regions that could be subsequently tested in transgenic mice. The results of transient transfection studies in cultured rat aortic SMCs showed that the construct containing theSM-MHC sequence from −4.2 to +5.3 kb (−4.2/+5.3LacZ, Construct 4 in Fig. 1) had the strongest activity (65-fold activity over promoterless pAUG LacZ versus 57-fold activity of the −4.2/+11.6 LacZ), suggesting that the region from +2.5 to +5.3 might contain additional positive regulatory regions required for SM-MHC expression. However, in contrast to observations in cultured SMCs, addition of the region from +2.5 to +5.3 resulted in a marked reduction in expression of the transgene as compared with that of the full-length −4.2/+11.6LacZ transgenic lines or the shorter −4.2/+2.5LacZ transgenic lines (Fig. 2, compares row 4with rows 1 and 3). For example, multiple −4.2/+5.3 LacZ lines showed no transgene expression in vascular SMCs or airway SMCs (Figs. 2, 4a and 4b, and 3b). Although some transgene expression was detected in the GI tract and bladder, LacZ staining was limited to a small fraction of SMCs (Fig. 2, 4c–4e). As such, transgene expression in the SMCs of the −4.2/+5.3 lines was markedly weaker than that of −4.2/+11.6 LacZ and −4.2/+2.5 LacZtransgenic mouse lines. Interestingly, although expression of the −4.2/+2.5 LacZ transgene was observed in"

PTHrP is a multifunctional protein in which bioactivity is mediated by two distinct pathways. Its classic parathyroid hormone-like activity results from binding of its amino terminus to cell surface PTH1R and activation of signal transduction pathways. Another less well recognized pathway involves translocation of PTHrP to the nucleus via a mid-region bipartite nuclear targeting sequence (NTS), similar in structure and function to those found in retroviral regulatory proteins. PTHrP was identified in the nucleus of several different cell types in vivo and in vitro, where it has been implicated in cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. In previous work we showed that nuclear translocation of PTHrP enhanced the survival of serum-deprived chondrogenic cells, associated with RNA, and localized to a region of the nucleus rich in complexes of newly transcribed ribosomal RNA and protein. In this work we have used two chondrogenic cell lines, CFK2 (PTH1R+) and 27m21 (PTH1R−) to further explore mechanisms whereby PTHrP rescues immature chondrocytes from apoptosis. Endogenous PTHrP and exogenous PTHrP NTS peptide protected serum-deprived cells from apoptosis, in the presence and absence of PTH1R. The survival of cells expressing PTHrP and those treated with PTHrP NTS peptide was associated with a rapid shift into Go/G1accompanied by a significant down-regulation of rRNA synthesis and a decrease in the number of actively translating polyribosome complexes. Together with our previous observations, this work predicts a role for PTHrP in modulating ribosome biogenesis and preventing chondrogenic cells from progressing through the cell cycle in an unfavorable environment.

Henderson J.E. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 809-826Google Scholar). Subsequently it was identified as a physiological regulator of cell function in a wide variety of fetal and adult tissues (2Moselely J.M. Martin T.J. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 363-376Google Scholar). Its pivotal role in normal skeletal biology was defined in mice with a targeted disruption of thePTHrP or PTH/PTHrP receptor gene when the homozygous-null offspring from heterozygous matings died in the perinatal period with a chondrodysplastic phenotype (3Karaplis A.C.

The epiphyseal growth plates of these mice were characterized by a decrease in proliferating chondrocytes and premature differentiation to hypertrophy (5Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1611-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although the heterozygous animals appeared normal at birth, they developed osteopenia by 8 weeks of age as a consequence of haplotype insufficiency (6Amizuka N. Karaplis A.C. Henderson J.E. Warshawsky H. Lipman M.L. Matsuki Y. Ejiri S. Tanaka M. Izumi N. Ozawa H. Goltzman D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 175: 166-176Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, PTHrP has been identified as a key regulator of chondrocyte and osteoblast function in bone development and in skeletal homeostasis. The rodent PTHrP gene encodes a 141-amino acid protein that shares limited amino-terminal sequence homology with parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is the body's major regulator of calcium homeostasis (7Kai H.Y. Stewart A.F. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 347-362Google Scholar). Most of the documented biological activity of PTHrP is mediated through binding of its amino terminus to a G protein-coupled receptor (PTH1R) that it shares with PTH (8Segre G.V. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.C. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 377-403Google Scholar). Indeed, the biochemical abnormalities associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy closely resemble those seen in hyperparathyroidism because high circulating levels of tumor-derived PTHrP activate PTH1R in kidney and bone, which are the classic target tissues of PTH (1Goltzman D. Henderson J.E. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 809-826Google Scholar). Although their amino termini share some sequence homology, the mid-region and carboxyl terminus of PTHrP are quite different from PTH and have been attributed unique biological functions. For example, synthetic fragments corresponding to amino acids 75–85 of PTHrP have been implicated in placental ion transport and those corresponding to amino acids 107–111 have been shown to inhibit bone resorption (9Mallette L.E. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 171-184Google Scholar). Similarly, amino acids 87–107 of the mature 141-amino acid PTHrP protein represent a functional, bipartite nuclear targeting sequence (NTS) that is not present in the 84-amino acid PTH protein. Mutagenesis studies showed that an intact PTHrP NTS directed the passage of both homologous and heterologous proteins to the nucleus and nucleolus (10Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H.

Furthermore,in vivo studies demonstrated that PTHrP localized to the coarse fibrillar component of the nucleolus where newly formed complexes of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein destined to become mature ribosomes accumulate (10Henderson J.E.

Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the presence of PTHrP, which is a prototypical secretory protein, in the nuclear compartment.

In addition to an increase in the physiological apoptotic death of fully differentiated chondrocytes at the chondro-osseous junction, where cartilage is replaced by bone (26Farnum C.E. Wilsman N.J. Am. J. Anat. 1989; 186: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Poole A.R. Laverty S. Mwale F. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. The Osteoporosis Primer. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000: 3-17Google Scholar), a large population of immature chondrocytes undergoing apoptosis were observed throughout the growth plates of PTHrP-null mice (23Amizuka N. Henderson J.E. Hoshi K. Warshawsky H. Ozawa H. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5055-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggested that the profound reduction in cellularity in the growth plates of PTHrP-null mice could have resulted not only from a failure of chondrogenic cells to replicate but also from their failure to survive. Furthermore, native CFK2 chondrogenic cells, which express very low levels of endogenous PTHrP, rapidly undergo programmed cell death when they are deprived of growth factors, whereas those transfected with cDNA expressing the full-length protein survive indefinitely (10Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It has therefore become apparent over the past few years that the biological activity of PTHrP is mediated by two distinct mechanisms. One involves activation of the cell surface PTH1R by amino-terminal fragments that share sequence homology with PTH. The other involves translocation of the protein to the nucleus via a mid-region NTS that is similar in structure and function to those found in retroviral regulatory proteins such as TAT and REV. In the current studies we have used CFK2 cells, which express PTH1R, and 27m21 cells, which do not, to further examine the mechanisms whereby PTHrP rescues immature chondrogenic cells from programmed cell death. Both endogenously expressed PTHrP-(1–141) and exogenous PTHrP-(87–107) NTS peptide protected serum-deprived CFK2 and 27m21 cells from apoptosis. The presence of an intact PTHrP NTS promoted a rapid shift of the serum-deprived cells into Go/G1, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in rRNA synthesis and a reduction in the number of actively translating polyribosome complexes. Taken together with our previous observations, this work predicts a role for PTHrP in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and of cell cycle progression in an unfavorable environment. A previously described cDNA encoding PTHrP with an 11-amino acid Myc epitope tag (12Aarts M.M. Levy D. He B. Stregger S. Chen T. Richard S. Henderson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was modified by PCR for subcloning into the MSCV-Ap2 retroviral vector (28Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A.

Primers 5′-ctc gag acg atg ctg cgg agg ctg-3′ and 5′-gga tcc gtt gtt cag gtc ctc ttc-3′ were used to generate PTHrPmyc with a 5′XhoI site and a 3′ BamHI site. PTHrPmyc was then cloned upstream of an internal ribosomal entry site and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the MSCV-Ap2 vector. The resulting vector, rPmAp2, encodes the full-length, 141-amino acid rat PTHrP protein with a carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope tag and GFP. Synthetic PTHrP-(1–34) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA) and the 87–107 NTS peptide, which represents the nuclear targeting signal of PTHrP, was synthesized at the Sheldon Biotechnology Institute (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) as described (11Aarts M. Guo R. Bringhurst R. Henderson J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and all plasticware (Falcon) from Becton Dickinson Labware (Lincoln Park, NJ). The CFK2 cell line, maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% calf serum, was derived from the chondrocranium of a neonatal rat and has been used extensively as an in vitro model of chondrogenesis (29Bernier S.M. Goltzman D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 27m21 cell line was maintained in DMEM with 10% calf serum. It was derived by in vitro selection for PTH1R-null homozygosity from heterozygous cells cloned initially from the proximal tibial growth plates of the offspring from matings of compound mutant mice heterozygous for inactivation of thePTH1R gene and for a transgene encoding a temperature-sensitive T antigen (TsA58TaG) (Immortomouse, Charles River, MA) (30Divieti P.

Clonal lines of 293GPG packaging cells expressing either MSCV-Ap2 vector (Ap2) or rPmAp2 (PTHrP) virus were established using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated transfection of 5 μg of MSCV-Ap2 or rPmAp2 linearized with FspI and the Zeocin resistance plasmid pJ6Ωbleo (32Ory D.S.

Selection was carried out with 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 4–6 weeks, and retrovirus was harvested and titered as described by Galipeau et al. (28Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from the viral-producing cells was sterilized by filtration through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and frozen at −20 °C until used to infect CFK2 and 27m21 cells. 104 cells/well in 24-well cluster plates were left to adhere for 24 h before the addition of 0.5 ml/well of viral supernatant containing 3 μg of Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.) on a daily basis for 3 consecutive days before assessment of GFP by flow cytometric analysis. Ten micrograms of RNA isolated from native CFK2 and 27m21 cells were reverse-transcribed using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) for 1 h at 37 °C. PCR was performed using Taq polymerase to amplify products of the indicated size with the primers listed in TableI.

Briefly, confluent layers of opossum kidney cells (OK/E) were stimulated for 3 h with serial dilutions of medium harvested from cells transduced with Ap2 vector or PTHrP, or with a synthetic PTHrP-(1–34) standard.

Cells plated at 105 cells/well in six-well plates were left to adhere for 24 h in serum-supplemented medium and then cultured for 96 h in medium containing 0.1% BSA, in the presence of 10−7m PTHrP-(1–34) or PTHrP-(87–107). Non-adherent cells were dislodged by gentle agitation and harvested for chromosomal DNA analysis before overlaying the adherent cell layer with 75% glycerol and photographing under a phase contrast microscope or harvesting for chromosomal DNA analysis. DNA was extracted from cells digested for 2 h at 56 °C in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Metabolic labeling was performed as described previously (21Henderson J.E. He B. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, CFK2 and 27m21 cells were plated in serum-supplemented medium at 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and changed after 24 h to medium containing 0.1% BSA, with or without peptides as described above. At the indicated times, cell layers were pulsed for 3 h with 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine or 5 μCi/well [35S]methionine (in methionine-free medium), washed twice with PBS, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH for scintillation counting. Flow cytometric analysis was performed in the Department of Clinical Hematology at the Sir Mortimer Davis-Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in medium at 105 cells/ml for analysis on an Epics XL/MCL Coulter analyzer. GFP fluorescence was analyzed in live cells that were gated on a forward scatter/side scatter profile. Cell cycle analysis was performed on trypsinized cells fixed for 5 min in 95% ethanol and resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma). Propidium iodide content was assessed at 488 nm on 10,000 cells for each analysis and the results expressed in both pictorial and numerical format. Whole cell lysates were prepared in Triton lysis buffer as described previously (12Aarts M.M. Levy D. He B. Stregger S. Chen T. Richard S. Henderson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and fractionated lysates prepared according to the method of Borer et al. (33Borer R.A. Lehner C.F.

Cells at 80% confluence were harvested by scraping into hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Cells were left to swell on ice for 15 min, vortexed for 10 s, and the nuclei pelleted briefly in a microcentrifuge. The cytoplasmic supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and reconstituted to 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% Triton X-100. The nuclear fraction was washed twice with hypotonic buffer and the pellet reconstituted in Triton lysis buffer. The protein content of total and fractionated cell lysates was assessed using the BioRAD DC protein assay kit and the samples stored at −80 °C until the time of analysis. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described (12Aarts M.M. Levy D. He B. Stregger S. Chen T. Richard S. Henderson J.E. J. Biol.

The polyclonal antiserum 14891/7 was raised in rabbit against synthetic PTHrP-(87–107) conjugated to keyhole limpet protein (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera were purchased from Sigma. Immunofluorescent staining for PTHrP in transduced 27m21 chondrogenic cells using the 14891/7 anti-PTHrP-(87–107) antisera and anti-rabbit fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody was performed essentially as described (11Aarts M. Guo R. Bringhurst R. Henderson J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Confocal laser microscopy was performed at the Center de Recherche Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal (Quebec, Canada). Fluorocein was excited with an argon/krypton laser, and the emitted fluorescence was detected with a 523/33 band filter. Imaging was performed at 1-μm intervals through the stained cells, using phase contrast to localize the nucleoli. Chondrocytes were plated at 1.5 × 106cells/150-mm dish 24 h prior to depriving of serum for the indicated times. Cells were harvested by scraping into lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 units/ml RNasin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After removing the membranes by centrifugation, 1.5 mg of lysate was layered onto a 15–45% linear sucrose gradient and spun in an ultracentrifuge for 2 h at 32,000 rpm. Fractions removed from the top of the gradient using an Auto Densi-Flow® density gradient fractionator were fed into a Beckman Flowcell cuvette. The absorbance was measured every 3 s at optical density of 260 using a Beckman DU-65 Spectrophotometer, and the data were analyzed using a Kinetics Soft-Pac module. Control and PTHrP-expressing chondrocytes were plated at 2 × 105cells/well in six-well plates 24 h prior to labeling total cellular RNA for 1 h at 37 °C with 25 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Radiochemicals) in 0.5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed twice with PBS and total RNA harvested using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) as described previously (12Aarts M.M. Levy D. He B. Stregger S. Chen T. Richard S. Henderson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was denatured by heating for 5 min at 70 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 17.5% formaldehyde, and 20 mm MOPS and resolved on agarose-formaldehyde gels containing ethidium bromide as described. Radiolabeled RNA was visualized by autoradiography after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data was graphed and analyzed using GraphPad Prism3, and comparisons between groups were made using the Student's ttest and analysis of variance, with a value of p < 0.05 considered to be significant. In the present study we investigated the hypothesis that nuclear targeting of PTHrP promotes quiescence in serum-deprived chondrogenic cells, thus allowing them to escape apoptotic cell death in an unfavorable environment. To determine what role, if any, signal transduction downstream of PTH1R played in protecting chondrocytic cells from apoptosis, we employed two different cell lines in the current studies. CFK2 cells, which express PTH1R, were derived from the chondrocranium of a normal fetal rat. PTH1R-null 27m21 cells were derived from the epiphyseal growth plate of neonatal mice as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.1A shows RT-PCR analysis of total RNA harvested from the native cell lines. A low level of PTHrP expression was apparent in both cell lines, whereas only CFK2 cells expressed PTH1R. Although fibronectin and type II collagen were observed in both cell lines, their relative levels of expression suggested that the 27m21 cells represented a less mature stage of chondrogenic differentiation than the CFK2 cells. After the cells were infected with retrovirus carrying a GFP marker (Ap2) or both GFP and PTHrP with an 11-amino acid Myc epitope tag (PTHrP), flow cytometric analysis for GFP was used to select populations transduced with an efficiency of >95%. As a measure of its bioactivity, PTHrP secreted from the infected cells was tested for its ability to bind and activate PTH1R on OK/E renal epithelial cells, which resulted in inhibition of transport of radiolabeled phosphate into the cells (21Henderson J.E. He B. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig.1B shows the bioactivity of serial dilutions of conditioned medium harvested from subconfluent populations of transduced cells, compared with that elicited by a synthetic PTHrP-(1–34) standard. At a 1:4 dilution, conditioned medium from both cell populations elicited a response comparable to that of 5 × 10−11m synthetic PTHrP-(1–34), whereas the medium harvested from control cultures did not"
https://openalex.org/W1518481952,"A novel microsomal β-glucosidase was recently purified and characterized from human liver that catalyzes the hydrolysis of bile acid 3-O-glucosides as endogenous compounds. The primary structure of this bile acid β-glucosidase was deduced by cDNA cloning on the basis of the amino acid sequences of peptides obtained from the purified enzyme by proteinase digestion. The isolated cDNA comprises 3639 base pairs containing 524 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated and 334 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequences including the poly(A) tail. The open reading frame predicts a 927-amino acid protein with a calculated Mr of 104,648 containing one putative transmembrane domain. Data base searches revealed no homology with any known glycosyl hydrolase or other functionally identified protein. The cDNA sequence was found with significant identity in the human chromosome 9 clone RP11-112J3 of the human genome project. The recombinant enzyme was expressed in a tagged form in COS-7 cells where it displayed bile acid β-glucosidase activity. Northern blot analysis of various human tissues revealed high levels of expression of the bile acid β-glucosidase mRNA (3.6-kilobase message) in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta and lower levels of expression in the liver and other organs."
https://openalex.org/W1544532207,"Abstract Fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of mental impairment, is generally caused by large expansions of a CGG repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene followed by transcriptional silencing. However, there is growing evidence that translation of the FMR1 message is also impaired, presumably because of the expanded CGG element in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the FMR1 message. To study the properties of the FMR1 5′-UTR, deletions were generated within a normal 5′-UTR with 16 CGG repeats for both monocistronic and dicistronic (luciferase) reporter constructs. Transient transfection experiments revealed a ∼20-nucleotide region upstream of the CGG repeat element that functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The normal CGG element itself does not appear to influence the efficiency of IRES-mediated stimulation of downstream reporter activity (∼18-fold over controls). Additional controls indicate that the enhanced activity of the downstream reporter is not due to readthrough from the upstream cistron, nor is it due to translation of cryptic monocistronic transcripts. The role of the FMR1 IRES element is not known at present; however, by analogy to other IRES-containing mRNAs expressed in neurons, the FMR1IRES element may help to promote translation in dendrites."

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1059-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although neither the regulation mechanisms nor the in vivosubstrates of murine Sak kinases have been elucidated yet, accumulating evidence suggests that Sak is involved in cell growth or cell division process. First, transcriptional regulation of the sak gene seems to be linked to the cell growth status. Northern analysis revealed that the sak-a expression is abundant in organs containing dividing cells, such as testis, thymus, and spleen, but is not found in liver, heart, or brain (1Fode C. Motro B. Yousefi S. Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been also demonstrated that, in 3T3 cells, expression of sak-a transcripts is high through S-G2-M-phases of cell cycle but declines in G1 (10Fode C. Binkert C. Dennis J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Second, forced expression of sense or antisense RNA of sak-a gene both acts suppressive to the growth of CHO1 cells (1Fode C. Motro B. Yousefi S. Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Fode C. Binkert C. Dennis J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, a tightly regulated Sak activity may be required for normal cell growth. However, efforts have failed to demonstrate the kinase activity of mouse Sak either by autophosphorylation or by using exogenous substrates, which has seriously hampered the characterization of this protein. Hence, nothing is yet known for the molecular mechanism by which Sak contributes to cell growth or cell division. Plk, a well studied representative of this subfamily, is an M phase-specific serine-threonine kinase whose activity peaks at the onset of mitosis. Plk is co-localized with CHO1/MKLP-1, a kinesin-like protein, at the midbody in late M-phase, and was shown capable of phosphorylating CHO1/MKLP-1 in vitro (11Lee K. Yuan Y.-L.O. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Without the activity of Cdc5 (another member of the Plk/Polo family), S. cerevisiae cells no longer complete the M-phase and result in a dumbbell-shaped terminal morphology with the nuclei almost divided but still connected by a thin bridge of chromatin (8Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4445-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ectopic expression of mouse Plk in these cells rescued the inappropriate cell division cycle, indicating that Plk is a functional homologue of Cdc5 in higher eukaryotes (8Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4445-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In contrast, introduction of a kinase-inactive Plk could not compensate for the defect of Cdc5, and the S. cerevisiae cells accumulated at G2/M in cell cycle. Therefore, Plk and Cdc5 may be required for cytokinesis in late M-phase, especially for the coordinated movement of microtubules. Such physiological role would be also applicable toDrosophila Polo. The polo gene product shows a cyclical kinase activity which peaks at late anaphase/telophase during the rapid cycles of mitosis in syncytial Drosophila embryos. Mutations of the polo gene cause abnormal mitotic and meiotic divisions (12Fenton B. Glover D.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest anin vivo function common to the Plk/Polo family kinases as a controller of mitotic spindles in late M-phase. It is yet obscure whether Sak also regulates microtubules in M-phase of cell cycle. Fode et al. (10Fode C. Binkert C. Dennis J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Sak-a leads to the suppression of CHO cell growth without the accumulation of cells in any phase of cell cycle. This is in contrast to the cell cycle arrest caused by the loss of Cdc5/Plk activities. Therefore, the intracellular targets of Sak and Plk kinases are likely to be different. In addition, a low-grade sequence homology (20–30%) can be found among the C-terminal non-catalytic regions of the Plk/Polo family kinases, whereas the non-catalytic region of Sak has no sequence similarity to them. Importantly, Sak lacks the polo homology domain, an amino acid stretch of ∼20 residues highly conserved within the non-catalytic regions of the Plk/Polo family kinases. The murine Sak kinases instead have “PEST” regions in its C terminus (13Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar), which is a unique character to Sak. Therefore, the non-catalytic domain of Sak is structurally distinct from those of the Plk/Polo family members. This non-catalytic C-terminal region should be important for the appropriate function of Sak, since the expression of Sak-b, lacking most of the C-terminal part of Sak-a, could not suppress the growth of CHO cells. Thus, it would not be surprising if Sak is assigned a totally distinct role in vivo from those of the Plk/Polo family kinases, and we believe it is still an open question whether Sak should be included in the Plk/Polo family kinases. Tec is a non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) that belongs to a recently identified subfamily of PTKs, including Tec, Btk, Itk/Tsk/Emt, Txk, and Bmx (14Mano H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Mano H. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 69: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar). Tec has been shown to become activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated by the stimulations of cell surface receptors on blood cells, and that Tec is involved in the cytokine-driven activation mechanism of c-fos transcription (16Yamashita Y. Watanabe S. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Komatsu N. Hatake K. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Mano H. Blood. 1998; 91: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify downstream effectors of Tec, we searched for Tec-interacting proteins (TIPs) by using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interestingly, one of such proteins turned out to be human Sak. Analysis of the Tec-Sak interaction in 293 cells has revealed that Sak is tyrosine phosphorylated by Tec. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that co-expression of Tec strongly increases the protein amount of Sak in cells. Our data indicate a novel role of Sak as an effector molecule of PTKs. The mouse hematopoietic cell lines, BA/F3 cells (17Palacious R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and 32D cells (18Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 25 units/ml of mouse IL-3. Human kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Sf21 cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were grown in suspension at 28 °C in the SF-900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies) without CO2 supply. The cDNA corresponding to the kinase domain of human Tec (amino acids 357–630) was inserted into the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector, pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), giving rise to pGAL4bd-TecKD. Since this construct covers the ATP-binding site of Tec, the resultant fusion protein should have a PTK activity. Indeed, one of the isolated TIP clones, TIP4/BRDG1, turned out to be a phosphorylation-dependent binding protein to Tec (19Ohya K. Kajigaya S. Kitanaka A. Yoshida K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Yamanaka T. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11976-11981Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pGAL4bd-TecKD plasmid was then used in the screening as described previously (19Ohya K. Kajigaya S. Kitanaka A. Yoshida K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Yamanaka T. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11976-11981Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Mano H. Ohya K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Ogawa W. Inazawa J. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Hatake K. Kasuga M. Ozawa K. Kajigaya S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The TIP6 cDNA obtained by the two-hybrid screening was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and used as a probe to screen the K562 cDNA library which was constructed in the λZAP II phage vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After the second round of screening, positive phage clones were converted to pBlueScript II plasmids (Stratagene) by the in vivo excision protocol according to the manufacturers instructions. Insert cDNAs of the plasmids were compared by restriction map analysis, and the longest one was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. A cDNA fragment containing the full coding region of human Sak was amplified from the TIP6 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, and inserted into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-FLAG vector to encode the Sak protein with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. With the pcDNA/Sak-F plasmid as a template, pcDNA/SakKM-F was generated by using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to express SakKM-F in which Lys41 at the ATP-binding site is replaced with Met. The expression plasmids for ΔPEST1 (lacking aa 272–311 of Sak-F) and ΔPEST1KM (a kinase-inactive mutant of ΔPEST1) were constructed with the ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) based on the pcDNA/Sak-F and pcDNA/SakKM-F plasmids, respectively. The expression plasmid for ΔPEST2 (lacking aa 805–883) was also constructed by the same kit with pcDNA/Sak-F as a template. Desired mutations in these constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The 293 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 10 µg each of expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate method. After 2 days of incubation, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and resuspended into the lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 200 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 30 min, cell extracts were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Sak and its mutants were immunoprecipitated from 1.5 to 2 mg of the lysates by anti-FLAG antibody (αFLAG Ab) (M2; Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). For immunoblotting, samples were separated through SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 4% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V; Sigma). The membranes were then incubated with αFLAG Ab or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (αTyr(P) Ab) (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at room temperature in TBST. Specific bindings of the antibodies were visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturers instruction. For the in vitro kinase assay, the immune complexes were washed twice with the lysis buffer, three times with the kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2), and finally incubated with 0.37 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 30 °C. For the phosphoamino acid analysis, the samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. A piece of the membrane containing the Sak protein was cut out, and subjected to the acid hydrolysis and the electrophoresis through a thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described previously (21Mano H. Yamashita Y. Sato K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs of Sak-F was inserted into the pFastBac1 plasmid (Life Technologies). Recombinant baculovirus based on this plasmid was generated by the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression systems (Life Technologies), and was used to infect Sf21 cells with the baculovirus expressing Tec or TecKM (22Ohya K. Kajigaya S. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Hatake K. Miura Y. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27178-27182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After 48–72 h of culture, cells were harvested and lysed as described above. The Sak cDNA fragment encoding the domain 1 (aa 1–297), domain 2 (aa 326–569), domain 3 (aa 586–830), or domain 4 (aa 889–970) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and inserted into pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce the GST fusion protein in BL21 cells (Stratagene). Anti-Tec immune complexes, prepared from BA/F3 cells, were washed extensively by the kinase buffer, mixed with 3 µg each of GST or the GST fusion proteins, and finally incubated with 100 µm cold ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were eluted into the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immunoblotted with α-Tyr(P) Ab or anti-GST antibody (AMRAD, Kew Victoria, Australia). BA/F3 cells Expressing Sak Variants—With the BOSC23 packaging cell line, ecotropic retrovirus was generated from pMX-iresCD8 (see “Results”), pMX-ΔPEST1-iresCD8, or pMX-ΔPEST1KM-iresCD8, and was used to infect BA/F3 cells. After the infection period, 1 × 107 cells of each population were resuspended into 90 µl of the MACS buffer (PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide) and incubated with anti-CD8 antibody conjugated with magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). After washing with the MACS buffer, cells were loaded onto the mini-MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec). The CD8high-population of each set was then eluted into the MACS buffer according to the manufacturers protocol. For the analysis of DNA contents, BA/F3 cells expressing CD8 (BA/F3-CD8), CD8 + ΔPEST1 (BA/F3-ΔPEST1), or CD8 + ΔPEST1KM (BA/F3-ΔPEST1KM) cells were resuspended into the propidium iodide (PI) suspension buffer (0.05 mg/ml PI, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 80 units/ml RNase A). DNA profiles of each cell fraction was examined using a FACScan processor (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and the cell cycle distribution was determined by the ModFIT program (Becton Dickinson). Staining of the cells with Annexin-V-FLUOS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was carried out according to the manufacturers instruction. The tissues were fixed with 3.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h and washed overnight in the same buffer. Then, the tissues were postfixed in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution for 90 min at 4 °C, dehydrated through graded ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. The ultra thin sections were made with an LKB 8800 Ultrotome III (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were observed under Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) after staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. BA/F3 cells (1–2 × 106 cells) expressing the Sak mutants with the FLAG tag were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, PBS for 15 min, followed by the second fixation in 70% ethanol at −20 °C for 14 h. Cells were then permealized by 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS and subjected to the incubation with 3% non-fat dry milk, PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were stained with the same solution containing αFLAG Ab (20 µg/ml) for 1.5 h, followed by the incubation with fluorescein-conjugated swine anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. After the incubation with PBS containing PI (200 ng/ml) and RNase A (200 µg/ml), cells were analyzed by a fluorescence microscope (BX50; Olympus, Tokyo). To investigate the downstream signaling system of Tec, we looked for its substrates by using the yeast two-hybrid system. With the Tec kinase domain containing its ATP-binding site as a “bait,” a total of six TIPs were identified from various cDNA expression libraries of human origin (19Ohya K. Kajigaya S. Kitanaka A. Yoshida K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Yamanaka T. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11976-11981Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Mano H. Ohya K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Ogawa W. Inazawa J. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Hatake K. Kasuga M. Ozawa K. Kajigaya S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Among them, TIP6 was isolated from a human cDNA library from bone marrow mononuclear cells, and its predicted amino acid sequence was highly homologous to the C-terminal portions of mouse Sak-a, raising the possibility that TIP6 is the human homologue of Sak-a. We then examined whether TIP6 is expressed in hematopoietic cell lines by Northern blot analysis. A major transcript of 4.2 kilobases long was identified in 32D and BA/F3 cells (both of mouse origin), and two major transcripts of 5.5 and 4.0 kilobases long were in K562 cells (human origin) (data not shown). A cDNA library of K562 cells was then constructed in λZAPII phage vector (Stratagene), and was used to isolate the full-length human TIP6 cDNA. The longest TIP6 cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 970 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 109 kDa (Fig.1A). The homology of the amino acid sequences between TIP6 and mouse Sak-a is 94.4% in the kinase domain, 75.9% in the C-terminal region, and 78.3% in overall. The putative PEST sequences identified in mouse Sak-a are also found in TIP6 at the corresponding positions (Fig. 1, A andB). Therefore, TIP6 is likely to be the human homologue of Sak. It should be noted that, compared with mouse Sak-a, human Sak has a 35-amino acid insertion (shown boxed in Fig. 1A) at the position where alternative exons were reported in mouse (1Fode C. Motro B. Yousefi S. Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, Sak variants generated by alternative splicing of the mRNAs may be present also in the human system. Although the kinase domain of human Sak has moderate sequence similarity to the members of the Plk/Polo family (43.1% with the kinase domain of DrosophilaPolo, 38.1% with that of human Plk), we could not detect significant sequence similarity between the C-terminal non-catalytic region of human Sak and those of the Plk/Polo family kinases. It is not known whether Sak receives inputs from PTKs. To investigate the functional interaction between Tec and human Sak, we tested if Sak becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by Tec in cells. The pcDNA/Sak-F plasmid, which produces the human Sak protein with a C-terminal FLAG tag (Sak-F), was introduced into human kidney 293 cells together with an expression plasmid for Tec. Sak-F was immunoprecipitated by αFLAG Ab and probed with α-Tyr(P) Ab. Interestingly, as shown in Fig.2A, Sak-F became profoundly tyrosine phosphorylated when co-expressed with Tec (lane 3in the upper panel). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues was also evident when a kinase-inactive SakKM-F was used instead of Sak-F (lane 6). In both cases, loss of Tec activity led to the disappearance of Sak phosphorylation (lanes 4 and 7). Furthermore, from Fig. 2A we could deduce the following information for Sak protein. First, as evident from the lower panel, the amount of Sak-F protein was far more abundant when co-expressed with Tec than expressed alone (compare lanes 2and 3). This effect was almost canceled when a kinase-inactive Tec (TecKM) in which Lys397 at the ATP-binding is replaced with Met (23Mano H. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Miura Y. Ozawa K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used (lane 4). Thus, Tec activity should protect Sak protein from degradation in cells or should induce the Sak mRNA. It is not yet clear why the protein amount of kinase-inactive Sak (SakKM) was more abundant than that of wild Sak (compare lanes 2 and 5). We believe the Sak protein is prone to degradation in a dependent manner to its PEST sequences (see the following paragraphs), and it could be possible that the kinase activity of Sak affects its structure, thereby changing the accessibility of the ubiquitination machinery. The second interesting finding was that, under the presence of Tec, electrophoretic mobility of Sak-F became significantly slower than that of SakKM-F (compare lanes 3 and 6). This mobility shift was not owing to the phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, since tyrosine-phosphorylated SakKM-F inlane 6 does not have the slow mobility. Rather, the shift is likely to arise from the activity of Sak-F itself; in other words, phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. To decipher the mechanism underlying the accumulation of Sak proteins, we examined whether co-expression of Tec induces the transcription ofSak. RNA was extracted from 293 cells transfected with the mock vector, the Sak-F expression plasmid, or the Sak-F expression plasmid plus Tec expression plasmid. Northern blot analysis with theSak cDNA probe revealed that co-expression of Tec slightly affected the expression level of the Sak message (upper panel, Fig. 2B). We confirmed that more than 70% of 293 cells incorporated the DNAs in our transient expression system (data not shown), and, thus, the difference of the message level observed in Fig. 2B should be too little to account for the vast change in the protein amounts of Sak. Hybridization of the same RNA set with the β-actin probe demonstrated that an equivalent amount of RNA was loaded in each lane (lower panel). These results imply that Tec may increase the amount of Sak proteins by a translational or post-translational mechanism. We next investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Sak is mediated specifically by Tec. Sak-F was transiently expressed in 293 cells either alone or in combination with Tec, Jak2, or Lyn, and analyzed for its tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.2C, Sak became phosphorylated only when co-expressed with Tec, but not with the other kinases examined. Therefore, Sak is not a common substrate of various PTKs, but may be an effector molecule only to a subset of PTKs. We then examined the Tec-Sak interaction in the insect cell system. Sf21 cells derived from Spodoptera frugiperda were infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressing human Sak-F alone or in combination with the Tec-expressing or TecKM-expressing virus. After 2 days of incubation, Sak was immunoprecipitated from the cells and probed with αFLAG Ab (upper panel of Fig.3A). Interestingly, Sak protein was abundantly expressed in Sf21 cells even without the introduction of Tec. In parallel with the ample expression, we could detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of Sak, which is presumably carried out by endogenous PTKs in Sf21 cells (lower panel). As expected, in response to the introduction of Tec proteins, Sak phosphorylation significantly increased. This result favors the idea that Sak is a direct substrate of Tec in vivo. To study which part of the Sak protein contains the phosphorylation targets of Tec, immunoprecipitated Tec protein was mixed with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST fusion proteins of domain 1 (aa 1–297), domain 2 (aa 326–569), domain 3 (aa 586–830), or domain 4 (aa 889–970) of Sak (see Fig. 1B), and was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Although there are gap regions not covered by any of the fusion proteins above (for example, aa 298–325), those sequences do not contain any tyrosine residues. Moreover, addition of some of the large gaps to the GST fusions made the recombinant proteins very prone to degradation inEscherichia coli. The samples reacted with ATP were subsequently separated through SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with α-Tyr(P) Ab. As shown in Fig. 3B, only the domain 1 (corresponding to the catalytic region) became a good substrate of Tecin vitro (left panel). The same membrane was re-probed with anti-GST antibody to estimate the amounts of GST fusion proteins used in the assay (right panel). We could not prevent the GST-domain 2 and GST-domain 3 proteins from proteolysis during the incubation period with MgCl2 and ATP. Previous efforts have been unsuccessful to detect the kinase activity of Sak proteins. Here we examined whether human Sak has a demonstrable activity in an in vitro kinase assay and whether its activity is controlled by Tec. Sak-F was transiently expressed in 293 cells either alone or in combination with Tec, immunoprecipit"

The bacterial surface protein ActA is solely responsible for this process by mimicking fundamental steps of host cell actin dynamics. ActA, a modular protein, contains an N-terminal actin nucleation site and a central proline-rich motif of the 4-fold repeated consensus sequence FPPPP (FP4). This motif is specifically recognized by members of the Ena/VASP protein family. These proteins additionally recruit the profilin-G-actin complex increasing the local concentration of G-actin close to the bacterial surface. By using analytical ultracentrifugation, we show that a single ActA molecule can simultaneously interact with four Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domains. The four FP4 sites have roughly equivalent affinities with dissociation constants of about 4 µm. Mutational analysis of the FP4 motifs indicate that the phenylalanine is mandatory for ActA-EVH1 interaction, whereas in each case exchange of the third proline was tolerated. Finally, by using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation techniques, we demonstrate that ActA is a monomeric protein. By combining these results, we formulate a stoichiometric model to describe how ActA enables Listeriato utilize efficiently resources of the host cell microfilament for its own intracellular motility.

The four FP4 sites have roughly equivalent affinities with dissociation constants of about 4 µm. Mutational analysis of the FP4 motifs indicate that the phenylalanine is mandatory for ActA-EVH1 interaction, whereas in each case exchange of the third proline was tolerated. Finally, by using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation techniques, we demonstrate that ActA is a monomeric protein. By combining these results, we formulate a stoichiometric model to describe how ActA enables Listeriato utilize efficiently resources of the host cell microfilament for its own intracellular motility.

Following ingestion of contaminated food, entry into the host occurs in the intestinal tract, where L. monocytogenes induces its own phagocytosis by epithelial cells (4Schlech W.F. Lavigne P.M. Bortolussi R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The bacterium escapes from the phagosome and freely proliferates within the host cell cytosol. Concomitantly with bacterial replication, L. monocytogenes induces polymerization of host actin at its surface leading to the formation of a comet tail-like structure (5Mounier J. Ryter A.

Contact of the motile bacteria with the host cell plasma membrane leads to filopod-like extensions that are internalized by neighboring host cells where the bacterium continues its infectious life cycle. Intracellular motility and the cell-to-cell spread of L. monocytogenes depends on the presence of a single surface protein, ActA, with the sole function of actin recruitment (11Domann E. Wehland J.

Heterologous expression of the actA gene in immobileListeria innocua is thus sufficient to induce actin-based propulsion within the host cell (13Kocks C. Marchand J.B. Gouin E. d'Hauteville H.

Likewise, recombinant ActA, bound to the surface of either Streptococcus pneumoniae or polystyrene beads, induces comet tail formation and subsequent actin-based motility in Xenopus extracts (14Theriot J.A.

Furthermore, ActA expressed in mammalian cells is targeted to the surface of mitochondria that subsequently become covered with actin filaments (17Pistor S. Chakraborty T. Niebuhr K. Domann E. Wehland J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mature ActA, containing 610 amino acid residues, can be divided in three distinct functional regions (Fig. 1A) (18Lasa I. David V. Gouin E. Marchand J.B. Cossart P. Mol.

These eukaryotic proteins, including Drosophila Enabled (Ena), mammalian Enabled (Mena), Ena/VASP-like protein (Evl), and the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) all contain a highly conserved N-terminal Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain that specifically recognizes the FP4 motif present in ActA and in the eukaryotic focal adhesion proteins zyxin and vinculin (21Niebuhr K.

By interacting with ActA, Ena/VASP proteins are responsible for recruitment of the actin assembly machinery to the surface ofListeria cells. The crystal structures of the Mena and Evl EVH1 domains in complex with an ActA-derived FP4 peptide indicate that the peptide ligand adopts a polyproline II (PPII) helix conformation (26Prehoda K.E.

Biol. 1999; 6: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is recognized and bound by a hydrophobic crevice on the surface of the protein. In addition to the N-terminal EVH1 domain, the Ena/VASP proteins incorporate a central proline-rich region containing single or multiple GPPPPP (GP5) motifs known to interact with profilin (28Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P.

The latter, an actin-monomer binding protein, in turn enhances actin polymerization under specific conditions (30Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although the central proline-rich region of ActA, in contrast to the N-terminal part, is not strictly required for actin assembly andL. monocytogenes motility, its deletion leads to delocalization of VASP and Mena from the bacterial surface, resulting in a drastic reduction in listerial motility and a strongly attenuated virulence (18Lasa I.

Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the central region of ActA acts as an accelerator of actin filament assembly by increasing the local G-actin concentration at the surface of the motile pathogen (18Lasa I.

We present the first precise stoichiometry of the complex formed by recombinant ActA and Mena EVH1 domain using analytical ultracentrifugation. We also demonstrate how mutations of the fourth FP4 motif of ActA influence the complex formation. Finally, by using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation techniques, we unambiguously show that ActA is a functional monomer in contradiction to previous reports of ActA dimer formation (33Mourrain P. Lasa I. Gautreau A. Gouin E. Pugsley A. Cossart P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10034-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All chemicals were obtained from Merck, Fluka, or Sigma. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were ordered from Life Technologies, Inc. The coding sequence for recombinant, soluble ActA protein in which the C-terminal transmembrane anchor is replaced by a polyhistidine (His6) tag was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing Pwopolymerase and wild-type L. monocytogenes EGD chromosomal DNA as a template. The oligonucleotide GATTTCCATGGTGAAGATGCTTCTA (underlining indicates restriction sites; here NcoI) anneals upstream of theactA promoter and was used in combination with the downstream primer AAGGATCCCTGCAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTAGATCTGTATGGTTCCCTGGTTCT (BamHI) to amplify a DNA fragment containing theactA promoter (recognized by the transcriptional regulator PrfA), the gene encoding the signal sequence, and the first 585 amino acid residues of ActA, followed by a His6 tag and aBamHI restriction site. The 2145-bp PCR product was digested with BamHI and NcoI and ligated into the Gram+/Gram− shuttle vector pSOG3 (a gift from S. Otten; Giessen, Germany), previously digested using NcoI andBglII, yielding pSOPact encoding a 591-amino acid ActA-His6 fusion protein (here denoted sActA). TheprfA gene was amplified by PCR using L. monocytogenes EGD chromosomal DNA as template and the primers CCTCGGTACCATATACTAACTCTA (KpnI) and TTGCAGGCCTTCTTGGTGAAGC (StuI) annealing upstream of the prfA promoter and downstream of the prfA gene. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with KpnI andStuI and ligated into pSOPact yielding pMMPact. Single amino acid residue substitutions within the fourth proline-rich repeat were introduced using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The coding sequence for the EVH1 domain of murine Mena (residues 1–112) was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pBSS“ containing Mena cDNA (a gift from F. Gertler; Boston) as a template and the primers CCGCACCATGGCTGAACAGAGTATC (NcoI) and CTTAGAAGTGTTAAATTGACAGGATCCAGGG (BamHI). After NcoI and BamHI digestion, the PCR fragment was ligated with the NcoI/BglII-digestedEscherichia coli expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutants and PCR-amplified fragments were resequenced to rule out PCR errors. To prevent contamination of sActA with native, membrane-bound ActA, the expression of sActA and sActA mutants was performed in the strain L. monocytogenes EGD Δvgc, which lacks the complete virulence gene cluster. 2T. Chakraborty, unpublished results. Cells of L. monocytogenes EGD Δvgc were transformed with plasmids encoding sActA derivatives as described by Park et al. (34Park S.F. Steward G.S.A.B. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For ActA protein purification, 5 ml of brain heart infusion medium containing 5 µg/ml erythromycin was inoculated with a single colony of L. monocytogenes EGD Δvgc transformed with the pMMPact plasmid and grown overnight at 37 °C. The bacterial culture was diluted 50-fold in brain heart infusion medium with 5 µg/ml erythromycin and grown for 10 h at 37 °C. This culture was used to inoculate 4 liters of freshly prepared MM1 minimal medium (containing 6.56 g KH2PO4, 30.96 g Na2HPO4, 0.41 g MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 0.088 g ferric citrate, 10 g glucose, 0.1 gl-leucine, 0.1 g l-isoleucine, 0.1 gl-valine, 0.1 g l-methionine, 0.1 gl-arginine, 0.1 g l-cysteine, 0.1 gl-glutamine, 0.5 mg riboflavin, 1 mg thiamin, 0.5 mgd-biotin, and 0.005 mg α-lipoic acid) with 5 µg/ml erythromycin to an A 600 nm of 0.1 and grown overnight at 28 °C. Following centrifugation, 20 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl) was added to the supernatant and incubated with agitation for 6 h at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C in the presence of Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was collected in a column and washed with binding buffer to remove traces of MM1 media. sActA was eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin in batch mode using 3 × 50 ml of elution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 m imidazole, pH 7.5). Protein fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, applied to a MonoQ 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient ranging from 0 to 500 mm in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Fractions containing sActA were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The correct processing of sActA was verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis and by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Absorption coefficients were calculated from the amino acid composition to be 13,960 and 16,500 m−1 cm−1 (280 nm) for ActA and Mena EVH1, respectively (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Mena EVH1 domain was produced as an N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. colistrain BL21(DE3) Codon Plus (Stratagene). For protein production, cells were cultured at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium (containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 34 µg/ml chloramphenicol) to anA 600 nm of 0.5–0.8. Prior to induction with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside (final concentration, 0.1 mm), cells were cooled to 20 °C. Cell culturing was continued for 18 h. After French press cell lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PreScission-Protease cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Non-binding cell constituents were eluted with PreScission-Protease cleavage buffer. Following removal of the GST tag (200 units of PreScission-Protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3–5 days at 4 °C), Mena EVH1 domain was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated using Centriplus 3 cells (Amicon). After dialysis against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, the protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a MonoS 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) applying a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The purified protein was concentrated to 15 mg/ml on the basis of its theoretical extinction coefficient (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the purified proteins was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. Ten microliters of carboxylated polystyrene beads (0.5 µm, Polysciences, Inc.) were washed twice with homogenization buffer (36May R.C. Hall M.E. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Machesky L.M. Sechi A.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 759-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and incubated with 0.75 mg/ml purified sActA (or mutants) and 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature. Control beads were coated with BSA alone at concentrations of 2 mg/ml. Coated beads were washed three times with homogenization buffer, resuspended in 10 µl of the same buffer, and stored on ice. To determine the binding activity of the ActA proteins, 1 µl of ActA-coated beads (or BSA-coated beads) was mixed with 9 µl of mouse cytosolic brain extract and 0.2 µl of rhodamine-labeled G-actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were applied to glass coverslips coated with Cell-Tak (Becton Dickinson), incubated for 5 min to allow attachment of the beads to the glass surface, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. Ena/VASP proteins bound to the bead surface were detected using the Evl monoclonal antibody 84H1 (37Krause M. Sechi A.S. Konradt M. Monner D. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Specimens were mounted with Prolong (Molecular Probes) and observed with a Zeiss inverted microscope 135 TV using a 100×/1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective in combination with 2.5× optovar optics. Image acquisition followed Geese et al.(38Geese M. Schluter K. Rotkegel M. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Sechi A.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the binding of the Arp2/3 complex to ActA, the procedure was repeated, with the difference that the coated beads were resuspended in Laemmli SDS gel buffer. The Arp2/3 complex was detected by Western blot analysis using a p21-Arc affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (23Pistor S. Groebe L. Sechi A.S. Domann E. Gerstel B. Machesky L.M. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3277-3287PubMed Google Scholar). A Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric scanner and an 8-place An50 Ti rotor with double sector centerpieces at 45,000–50,000 rpm and 20 °C was used for all sedimentation velocity experiments. A standard titration experiment consisted of a total of 12 different mixtures of sActA (or sActA mutants) and Mena EVH1. 400 µl each of these mixtures were prepared, and every second of these probes was run immediately (1 h after mixing), while the remaining 6 were kept at 4 °C and run after ∼7 h. A simple binding model for the interaction of n molecules EVH1 with a single molecule of ActA is given by Reaction 1,ActA+n·EVH1⇔ActA·EVH1+(n−1)·EVH1⇔......⇔ActA·EVH1nREACTION1with a single macroscopic binding constant defined by Equation1,K=[EVH1bound][EVH1free]·(n[ActAtotal]−[EVH1bound])Equation 1 For the case of two macromolecules, ActA and EVH1, forming multiple complexes ActA·EVH1n, it is shown in the supplement that in the presence of an excess of free EVH1 two sedimenting boundaries are formed: a slow sedimenting boundary representing free excess EVH1 and a faster sedimenting boundary representing ActA and all complexes ActA·EVH1n together. The shape of a concentration profile for a single species in a sedimentation velocity experiment can be satisfactorily modeled by a Gaussian error function. To evaluate binding of EVH1 to ActA, the concentrations of free and bound EVH1 were extracted from the measured profiles A(x,t) by fitting Equation 2,A(x,t)=APA(O)·e−2sAω2tςkA2π∫−∞xe−12y−xm·esAω2t)ςkA2dyEquation 2 +APM(O)·e−2sMω2tςkM2π∫−∞xe−12y−xm·esMω2tςkM2dydescribed in detail in the Supplemental Material.s A and s M are the sedimentation coefficients of the slow and fast sedimenting boundaries, respectively. This fit yields the absorption for EVH1free( APA(0)) and the sum of the absorptions for sActAtotal and EVH1bound( APM(0)) at the beginning of the sedimentation run. The total concentrations of sActA and EVH1 at the beginning of the sedimentation run are known from their respective absorptions at 280 nm. Thus, the concentrations of EVH1freeand EVH1bound can be calculated and used to deriven and K for the above binding model by non-linear least square fitting. For sedimentation, equilibrium analysis samples of 120 µl were run in 6-channel centerpieces (column height ∼3 mm) at the specified speed until no change in concentration distribution could be observed for at least 12 h. Scans from these 12 h were averaged and evaluated by fitting the distribution function for a single species (Equation3), c(x)=c(xm)·eM(1−v¯p)ω2(x−xm)22RTEquation 3 where x is distance from the center of rotation;x m is position of the meniscus; ω is angular velocity; v̄ is partial specific volume of the solute; ρ is density of the solution) using the program package AKKUPROG (39Kindler B. Akkuprog: A Program for the Evaluation of Chemical Reaction Velocities and the Analysis of Biopolymers in the Ultracentrifuge.Ph.D. thesis. University Hannover, 1997Google Scholar). The partial specific volume for ActA was calculated from the amino acid composition to be 7.29·10−4m3/kg. Soluble recombinant ActA (sActA, residues 1–591; Fig.1 A) and the sActA mutants I354P, I354M, I354S, and F351D were purified from supernatant of pMMPact-transformed L. monocytogenes EGD Δvgc cell cultures yielding about 10 mg of pure and homogeneous protein per liter (Fig. 1 B). As reported previously (12Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Cell. 1992; 68: 521-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), sActA (65 kDa) migrates with an apparent molecular mass of about 95 kDa presumably due to its extended shape caused by the central proline-rich sequences. The functional activity of the ActA proteins was verified through induction of actin filament assembly in mouse cytosolic brain extracts (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the BSA-coated control beads, clouds of actin filaments surrounded ActA-coated polystyrene beads, indicating that the recombinant ActA proteins were competent for recruitment of actin cytoskeleton components. Ena/VASP protein recruitment by ActA was verified by incubating ActA-coated beads with mouse cytosolic brain extract and labeling them with an antibody recognizing Evl, a member of the Ena/VASP family abundant in brain cells (Fig. 2 B). The successful recruitment of Evl by all ActA variants proves their proline-rich repeat sequences to be functional under the experimental conditions used in this study. Recognition of ActA proteins by the Arp2/3 complex was corroborated by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against the p21-Arc (Arpcomplex) subunit (Fig. 2 C). All ActA variants bind p21-Arc in the cell extracts indicating a direct interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. In summary, all purified ActA proteins were completely functional and properly folded and hence suited to analyze their interaction with EVH1 domains. Separate ultracentrifugation experiments of free sActA and free Mena EVH1 domain showed that each protein solution contains a single molecular species (data not shown). The corresponding sedimentation constants are 2.6 S and 1.7 S, respectively. Analysis of the shape of the sedimenting boundary for sActA alone using numerical integration of Lamm's differential equation (39Kindler B. Akkuprog: A Program for the Evaluation of Chemical Reaction Velocities and the Analysis of Biopolymers in the Ultracentrifuge.Ph.D. thesis. University Hannover, 1997Google Scholar, 40Claverie J.-M. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 1685-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41Urbanke C. Ziegler B. Stieglitz K. Fresenius Z. Anal. Chem. 1980; 301: 139-140Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) gave a diffusion coefficient of ∼6·10−11 m2s−1 corresponding to 40 kg/mol molar mass. Dimeric or higher oligomeric species of sActA or Mena EVH1 were not observed. Upon addition of Mena EVH1 domain to sActA in molar ratios ranging from 0.5:1 to 17:1, the sedimentation constant of the sActA·EVH1 complex increased (Fig. 3, A andB). A maximum of 4.2 S is observed at a molar ratio of about 10:1 and above. Molar ratios above 1:1 produced an additional slower sedimenting boundary with a sedimentation constant of 1.7 S corresponding to free Mena EVH1. By evaluating the heights of the sedimenting boundaries the concentrations of free EVH1 and the sActA·EVH1 complex can be calculated. The resulting binding isotherm shows that a single sActA molecule can simultaneously interact with up to four Mena EVH1 domains (n = 3.8 ± 0.3) (Fig.4A). Furthermore, the full saturation of all four binding sites of sActA by Mena EVH1 domains requires an 8–10-fold molar excess of Mena EVH1 under the conditions of the sedimentation experiment. On the assumption that each of the four EVH1-binding sites shows a similar affinity for Mena EVH1 domains, a dissociation constant for each FP4-EVH1 interaction of about 4 µm was estimated.Figure 4Complex formation of ActA variants and Mena EVH1.

The NKA analogues wereN-biotinylated to facilitate the rapid detection of covalent analogue-receptor interactions utilizing streptavidin reactivity.N-biotinyl-[Tyr1,Cys9]NKA,N-biotinyl-[Tyr1,Cys10]NKA were both found to reversibly disulfide bond to the NK2 receptor mutant Met297 → Cys. This is consistent with the improved affinities of these particular analogues for the Met297 → Cys receptor as compared with those for the wild-type and Met297 → Leu receptors. In our three-dimensional model, Met297 occupies the equivalent position in helix 7 to the retinal binding Lys296 in rhodopsin. Binding of the NK2receptor antagonist [3H]SR 48968 and of125I-NKA was used to characterize additional receptor mutants. It seems that the aromatic residues Trp99 (helix 3), His198 (helix 5), Tyr266, His267, and Phe270 play an important role in NKA binding as structural determinants. The existence of overlapping SR 48968 and NKA binding sites is also evident. These data suggest that the peptide binding site of the NK2R is at least in part formed by residues buried deep within the transmembrane bundle and that this intramembranous binding domain may correspond to the binding sites for substantially smaller endogenous GPCR ligands.

Their more variable N termini may play a role in determining the somewhat limited selectivities of these neuropeptides for the mammalian tachykinin NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors (1Maggi C.A. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The tachykinin receptors belong to an extensive family of seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which bind an array of extracellular ligands such as biogenic amines, odorant molecules, neuropeptides, and glycoproteins in order to convey their signals to the intracellular environment (2Horn F. Wear J. Beulers M.W. Horsch S. Baurock A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have constructed a three-dimensional receptor model of the tachykinin NK2 receptor (NK2R) in order to identify putative NKA binding residues (3Donnelly D. Maudsley S. Gent J.P. Moser R.N. Hurrell C.R. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to identify a subset of amino acids that participate in NKA binding by virtue of the reduced affinities of receptor mutants containing substitutions of these side chains (4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang R.-R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutagenesis of this kind is commonly used to define the functional determinants within GPCRs. However, the resultant data often require careful interpretation as it may be difficult to distinguish receptor sites that participate in direct ligand interactions from those sites that influence receptor conformation. This is particularly significant for the larger flexible peptides that appear to make a greater number of receptor contacts than smaller endogenous GPCR ligands. Peptide agonist binding sites have been more reliably mapped by affinity and photoaffinity labeling methods (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J.

It is also possible to confer wild-type receptor binding characteristics upon receptor mutants by chemically modifying the ligand, thus distinguishing binding residues from conformational determinants in the receptor. This concept of positive complementation was utilized by Strader et al.(9Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 262: 16439-16443Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) to demonstrate the interaction of serine residues in helix 5 of the adrenergic receptors with the hydroxyl groups of adrenalin. Here we describe a technique that incorporates aspects from both affinity labeling and positive complementation studies by using cysteine-substituted NK2R mutants and NKA analogues, to define NKA-NK2R interactions.

Protein chemical reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The synthesis and purification of the cysteine-substituted NKA analogues has been described previously (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Peptide N-biotinylation was performed by adding 5.0 μmols of biotinyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester dropwise to 2.5 μmols of each peptide in 0.2 ml of 0.05 mNaHCO3, pH 8.2 and terminated after 30–45 min by the addition 0.2 ml of 5% (v/v) acetic acid. Labeling was assessed using analytical ascending TLC on precoated plastic sheets with silica gel 60 (0.2 mm; Merck) using butan-1-ol/acetic acid/H2O, 4:2:3 as mobile phase. Labeled peptides were visualized using UV light or 0.1% (w/v) ninhydrin, extracted with 5% (v/v) acetic acid, and precipitated. Precipitants were washed three times with 0.5 ml of 1% (v/v) acetic acid and twice with acetone and finally dissolved in 1 ml of DMF containing 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol prior to reverse-phase HPLC with a water/acetonitrile linear gradient (0–60% acetonitrile in 30 min). Peptide fractions were subjected to amino acid sequencing, lyophilized, and reconstituted. Final peptide concentrations were determined using 3 mm5,5-dithio-bis-(-2-nitrobenzoic) acid in the presence of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 (12Labrou N.E. Clonis Y.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutations were introduced by the method reported in Ref. 13Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar and confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant NK2Rs were expressed in Sf9 insect larval cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies Inc.). Briefly, an XbaI-BamHI restriction fragment of the NK2R cDNA was subcloned into pFastBac1. Recombinant bacmid DNAs isolated from transformedE. coli DH10BAC cells were used to transfect Sf9 cells in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected Sf9 cells were maintained at 27 °C in a TC-100 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin for 5 days before recombinant viruses containing the NK2Rs were recovered and used to further infect Sf9 cells. Typically, 2 × 106 Sf9 cells/ml were infected and harvested 75 h post-infection for radioligand binding and affinity labeling studies. Prior to radioligand binding, cells were washed twice with TC-100 medium and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in TC-100 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 100 μg/ml bacitracin (binding buffer). For competition assays, 105cells were incubated in binding buffer with 0.1 or 1 nm125I-NKA and varying concentrations of each competing peptide for 90 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was determined using 0.1 μm NKA. Samples were then microcentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min, overlaid with 2:1 (v/v) dibutylphthalate/dinonylphthalate, microcentrifuged, and snap frozen on dry ice. The tip of each tube were counted in a Wallac 1470 Wizard γ-counter. For antagonist binding assays, the cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 5 nm [3H]SR 48968 and varying concentrations of SR 48968. In this case, nonspecific binding was determined using 5 μm SR 48968. Tritiated samples were counted in a Tricarb 1900 TR Packard liquid scintillation counter after dissolution in Emulsifier SafeTM (Packard). Data were analyzed by computerized non-linear regression using GraphPAD software (GraphPAD, San Diego). 105 infected Sf9 cells were incubated with the appropriateN-biotinylated cysteine-substituted peptide for 90 min at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotonin ( 1 mm final concentration). Cu2+-phenanthroline was then added, and the cells were incubated for a further 60 min, pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, resuspended in an 0.2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, repelleted, and boiled for 1 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) containing 25 mm NEM. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under denaturing conditions and electroblotted onto 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Specific ligand-receptor interaction was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Streptavidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or alternatively, a mouse anti-His6 monoclonal antibody/POD detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to demonstrate protein expression. 2 × 105 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0 and incubated for 90 min with 4 nm125I-NKA in the absence and presence of 20 μm NKA. The cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 200 μm ice-cold 5 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC)/PBS, pH 7.0 (30 min on ice followed by 30 min at room temperature). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography following exposure of X-Ograph Blue film (X-Ograph Ltd.) to Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels for 14 days at −70 °C. Table I shows the binding profiles of Cys-substituted NK2R mutants for 125I-NKA and the non-peptide antagonist [3H]SR 48968. The receptor mutants Trp99 → Cys, His198 → Cys, and Tyr266 → Cys demonstrate no detectable binding activity. The mutants Thr24 → Cys and Phe26 → Cys in the N-terminal tail, Asn86 → Cys (in helix 2), Asn97 → Cys (in extracellular loop 1), and His267 → Cys and Phe270 → Cys (in helix 6), despite their inability to bind 125I-NKA retain wild-type affinities for [3H]SR 48968. A final subset of mutants (Gln109 → Cys and Asn110 → Cys in helix 3 and Ile202 → Cys in helix 5) displays approximately wild-type affinities for both ligands.Table IThe affinities of NK2R mutants for NKA and SR 48968ReceptorIC50nm ± S.E.NKA1-aIC50(nm) ± S.E. values determined by competition with 0.1 nm125I-NKA.SR 489681-bIC50 (nm) ± S.E. values determined by competition with 5.0 nm[3H]-SR 48968.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, Met297 → Cys demonstrates a 6-fold lower affinity for NKA, but not for SR 48968, than the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1, A and B). These data are comparable for those obtained for a receptor mutant in which Met297 is substituted with Leu, where a selective 8-fold reduction in NKA affinity is observed (TableII). Further competition studies were performed in order to determine the affinities of the wild-type receptor and Met297 → Cys and Met297 → Leu mutants for the Cys-substituted NKA analogues (Table II). Cysteine substitution of amino acids at positions 1–8 within NKA appear to have similarly detrimental consequences on ligand affinity for both the wild-type and Met297 → Cys receptors; the presence of a tyrosine residue at position 0 or 1 of NKA or of Cys substitutions at His1 or Lys2 has little effect on peptide affinity, whereas substitutions at Thr3, Asp4, Ser5, Val7, Gly8, Leu9, and Met10 have more notable effects on peptide binding and [Tyr1,Cys6]NKA has little binding activity. However, whereas the affinity of [Tyr1,Cys9]NKA for the wild-type receptor is 286-fold lower than that of NKA, this analogue displays a similar affinity to NKA for the Met297 → Cys mutant. The Met297 → Leu mutant more closely resembles the wild-type receptor in this respect as its affinity for [Tyr1,Cys9]NKA is 82-fold lower than its affinity for NKA. The difference between the Met297 → Cys and Met297 → Leu mutants is further emphasized by the 5-fold greater affinity of the Met297 → Cys receptor as compared with a 141-fold lower affinity of the Met297 → Leu mutant for [Tyr1,Cys10]NKA than for NKA.Table IIAffinities of the wildtype, Met297 → Cys and Met297→ Leu NK2Rs for Cys-substituted NKA analoguesNKA analogue2-aThe sequences of these analogues are given in Ref. 11.Kinm ± S.E.Wild-type2-bKi (nm) ± S.E. values determined by competition with 0.1 nm125I-NKA (wild type column) or 1 nm[125I]-NKA (Met297 mutants) using the equationKi = IC50 (nm)/(1 + [125I-NKA]/Kd where Kd= IC50 (from Table I) [125I-NKA (nm)].2-cData taken from Ref. 11.

Open table in a new tab The presence of a biotin group at the N-terminal end of NKA does not appear to alter the affinity of NKA for the wild-type NK2R (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the cysteine-substituted NKA analogues were N-biotinylated to facilitate the rapid detection of covalent ligand-receptor interaction using streptavidin affinity chemistry. Disulfide bond formation was catalyzed by the addition of Cu2+-phenanthroline and assessed using a Streptavidin-peroxidase system. In the case of cells expressing the Met297 → Cys receptor, a 45-kDa protein was labeled by both N-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys9]NKA andN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys10]NKA but not with the remaining analogues (Fig. 2). Labeling was not evident for uninfected or Sf9 cells expressing the wild-type receptor cDNA (Fig.3).Figure 3Specificity of Met297 → Cys labeling with N-biotin-[Tyr1, Cys9] NKA and N-biotin-[Tyr1, Cys10] NKA.

Neither cells expressing the wild-type receptor (lanes 7 and 9) nor uninfected cells (lanes 8 and 10) were labeled withN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys9]NKA (lanes 7 and 8) orN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys10]NKA (lanes 9 and 10).

TheN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys9]NKA- andN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys10]NKA-labeled 45-kDa species correspond to an anti-His6 antibody immunoreactive protein detected in Sf9 cells expressing C-terminally His6-tagged NK2Rs and to a protein expressed in Sf9 cells transfected with the wild-type NK2R cDNA, which cross-links to 125I-NKA following EDC treatment (Fig. 5).Figure 5Confirmation of the 45-kDaN-biotin-[Tyr1, Cys9] NKA - and N-biotin-[Tyr1, Cys10]NKA-labeled proteins as the NK2R.

The proteins are comparable in mobility to those labeled byN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys9]NKA (lane 1) andN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys10]NKA (lane 2) in cells expressing the Met297 → Cys receptor cDNA.

It is generally accepted that small conformationally constrained ligands interact with a limited number of receptor sites whereas the binding of larger peptides or proteins involves more extensive receptor contacts. Ligand binding may be influenced by both the local and global conformations of the receptor and the conformation of the ligand itself. As such, the binding sites of small chemical compounds, which typically contain few rotatable bonds, are more readily deduced than those of larger peptide ligands. Here we describe the identification of NKA binding residues within the human NK2R by exploiting the ability of Cu2+-phenanthroline to promote disulfide bond formation between two spatially proximal thiol groups; one within the peptide ligand and the second within the receptor. The affinities of ten NKA analogues, each containing a single cysteine substitution for the wild-type NK2R (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) are consistent with data from previous structure-activity studies (12Labrou N.E. Clonis Y.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 14Buck S.H.

Trans. 1990; 18: 1323-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that neither the presence of a bulky tyrosine residue nor of a biotin moiety at the extreme N terminus of NKA affect ligand affinity (Fig. 1C). Single Cys substitutions of His1 and Lys2 also appear to be of little consequence. However, Cys substitutions made at the remaining positions within NKA, particularly of the conserved residues within the C-terminal motif Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2, significantly reduce peptide affinity for 125I-NKA binding sites (Table II). This is indicative of a NKA binding site that leaves the extreme N terminus of NKA exposed to receptor regions that are less constrained than the transmembrane bundle, such as the extracellular N terminus and loops. Molecular dynamic simulations of NKA and the cysteine-substituted analogues were used to examine their global structures and essential motions in solution (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the Cys5analogue displays only a 5-fold lower affinity for the wild-type receptor than NKA, this peptide was structurally more dissimilar from NKA than the other analogues. In contrast, Cys6 displays an average structure that most closely resembled that of NKA yet displays little binding activity. As the [Cys6]NKA analogue is more conformationally flexible than [Cys5]NKA, this suggests that even substantial changes in the overall average structure and/or modest changes in the conformational flexibility of the NKA analogues can be tolerated. This is supportive of a model of peptide binding in which there is an induced fit of the ligand into a conformationally adjustable binding site. These data also suggest a role for the highly conserved Phe6 of NKA in receptor interaction. Using solution-based molecular dynamics simulations, we predict Phe6 clusters with Leu9 and Met10 (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cysteine substitutions of Leu9 or Met10 were found to alter the average structure of the peptide less than the Cys5 but more than the Cys6 substitutions (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Hence, the reduced affinities of [Tyr1,Cys9]NKA and [Tyr1,Cys10]NKA may only be partly attributed to conformational differences in ligand structure and flexibility. This, in turn, implicates disruption of specific receptor-ligand interactions as the primary cause of the reduction in the affinity of C-terminally Cys-substituted NKA analogues. Consistent with the loss in affinity of [Tyr1,Cys8]NKA for the wild-type receptor, Gly8 is unlikely to participate in direct receptor interaction. Instead, this residue may stereochemically influence Leu9 and Met10 within the binding crevice. We targeted putative NKA binding residues within the transmembrane bundle of the NK2R for site-directed cysteine substitution mutagenesis. Residues in the equivalent positions in the extracellular loop regions and N terminus to NK1R, which influence SP binding (16Munekata E. Kubo K. Tanaka H. Osakada F. Peptides. 1987; 8: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Saviano G. Temussi P.A. Motta A. Maggi C.A. Rovero P.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implies that there are at least two possible receptor conformations, R and R*. Agonists bind with highest affinity to and stabilize receptors in the active R* conformation and classical antagonists highlight both R* and inactive R sites without altering the R-R* interchange. Therefore, as illustrated for the NK1R, (16Munekata E. Kubo K. Tanaka H. Osakada F. Peptides. 1987; 8: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Saviano G. Temussi P.A. Motta A. Maggi C.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the inability of an agonist to compete for radiolabeled antagonist binding sites (predominantly R) but not agonist binding sites (predominantly R*) may result from disruption of the R-R* interchange. For this reason, the agonist and antagonist binding characteristics of the mutant receptors were determined using125I-NKA and [3H]SR 48968, respectively (Table I). Consistent with the effect of alanine substitutions, Cys substitutions of Thr24, Phe26 (in the N terminus), Asn86, Asn97 (in helix 2), His267, or Phe270 (in helix 6) abolish 125I-NKA but not [3H]SR 48968 binding (5Huang R.-R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Only those residues at the equivalent positions in the N-terminal tail play a similar role in SP binding to the NK1R (16Munekata E. Kubo K. Tanaka H. Osakada F. Peptides. 1987; 8: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Saviano G. Temussi P.A. Motta A. Maggi C.A. Rovero P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Zoffmann S. Gether U. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This illustrates that although there may be some similarities among the agonist binding sites of these tachykinin receptor subtypes, evolutionary divergence of the NK1R and NK2R and/or SP and NKA has resulted in the development of different modes of receptor-ligand recognition (21Rosenkilde M.M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant receptors Gln109 → Cys and Ile202→ Cys appear to display wild-type affinities for both125I-NKA and [3H]SR 48968. Ile202lies close to the NKR-conserved His198, a known NKA binding residue (4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saviano G. Temussi P.A. Motta A. Maggi C.A. Rovero P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In our three-dimensional receptor model, both these residues face His267, the second conserved His (helix 6). Surprisingly, the substitution of Ile202 with Cys but not with Val (4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is tolerated. Gln109 occupies the equivalent position to Glu113, the Schiff's base counterion of rhodopsin (22Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Science. 1989; 246: 928-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 23Zhukovsky E.A. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D.

A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Its substitution with the equivalent residue in the NK1R (His), but not with Ala, has been shown to reduce the affinity of NKA binding (4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang R.-R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the NK2R, the imidazole ring of His but not the smaller side chains of Ala and Cys presumably sterically hinders ligand binding. Within the NK1R the equivalent amino acid to Gln109 (His108) has also been shown to participate in high affinity agonist binding (25Fong T.M. Yu H. Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25668-25671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that both Gln109 and Ile202 lie close to residues that interact with NKA. Gln109 packs against Met297 in helix 7, which occupies the equivalent position to the retinal binding Lys296 of rhodopsin (26Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The substitution of Met297 with either Cys or Leu reduces NKA affinity. The Met297 → Cys mutant displayed a rank order of affinity for the Cys-substituted analogues, which was similar to that of the wild-type receptor except that whereas [Tyr1,Cys9]NKA and [Tyr1,Cys10]NKA have substantially lower affinities for the wild-type receptor than NKA, [Tyr1,Cys9]NKA demonstrates an affinity similar to NKA, and [Tyr1,Cys10]NKA has a 5-fold higher affinity than NKA for Met297 → Cys (TableII). This mutation-induced recovery of analogue affinity was not evident for the Met297 → Leu mutant or for other mutant receptors, which displayed 125I-NKA binding. Specific disulfide interactions between Cys297 in the mutant receptor and Cys9- or Cys10-substituted NKA analogues were confirmed by Cu2+-phenanthroline-catalyzed disulfide bond formation between Met297 → Cys receptorsN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys9]NKA andN-biotin-[Tyr1,Cys10]NKA (Fig. 2). The 45-kDa proteins visualized using Streptavidin-peroxidase correspond to proteins detected n Sf9 cells expressing His-tagged wild-type or Met297 → Cys receptors with a monoclonal His6 antibody (Fig. 5). Furthermore, labeling is reductant-reversible and NEM-sensitive (Fig. 4) and is inhibited by excess NKA (Fig. 3). These observations indicate labeling of NK2Rs and illustrate the proximity of Cys297 to the extreme C terminus of the NKA analogues and therefore to NKA. Fig. 6 shows the possible transmembrane disposition of NKA (4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang R.-R.C.

We have shown that NKA adopts an extended loop-like conformation within which the side chains on Asp4, Phe6, Val7, Leu9, and Met10 are exposed (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As Phe6, Leu9, and Met10 appear to cluster together and as Leu9 and Met10 lie close to Met297 in the receptor, this would place Phe6, and perhaps Val7, within the transmembrane bundle. Previous data (3Donnelly D. Maudsley S. Gent J.P. Moser R.N. Hurrell C.R. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggest the NKA binding site is formed partly by residues in helices 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the receptor. The absence of covalent labeling of Asn86 in helix 2 and Gln109 in helix 3 suggests that these residues may not participate in direct NKA interaction but rather may influence the local conformation around Met297. Similarly, the substitution of His198 and His267 with aliphatic amino acids appears to compromise the binding of or the subsequent intracellular response to NKA (4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang R.-R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the absence of covalent labeling with any of the biotinylated NKA analogues and is supported by the variable degrees to which different substitution of these residues or of surrounding residues (such as Val201, Ile202, and Tyr206) are tolerated. The remaining candidates for NKA interaction reside in helices 6 and 7. The apparent lack of involvement of Leu292(4Bhogal N. Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27269-27274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Phe293, (5Huang R.-R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Trp294 (unpublished observation) in NKA binding is suggestive of a mode of NKA-receptor interaction where Phe6 and Val7 of NKA lie in a horizontal plane with Leu9 and Met10. This places Phe6 close to Tyr266 and Phe270 on helix 6 of the NK2R. The near wild-type NKA binding properties of receptors retaining the aromatic nature at these sites as compared with the absence of NKA binding to mutants that contain aliphatic residues at these two positions within helix 6 suggest Tyr266 and Phe270 may participate in aromatic-aromatic interactions with the NK-conserved Phe6 of NKA and, as such, may play similar ligand stabilizing roles to the aromatic floor residues in the aminergic receptors (27Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Blundell T.L. Recept. Chann. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar). Although a region near the extracellular side of helix 7 has been implicated in SP binding to the NK1R (20Huang R.-R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Li Y.-M. Marnerakis M. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1213-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), to date there is little evidence for the interaction of SP with more deeply buried residues in this transmembrane segment. Possible differences in the active conformations, and therefore receptor binding sites, of NKA and SP is further highlighted by the absence of roles for the highly conserved helix 5 and 6 histidine residues in SP binding to the NK1R (18Zoffmann S. Gether U. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Fong T.M. Yu H. Cascieri M.A. Underwood D. Swain C.J. Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2728-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, it has been suggested that the N-and C-terminal residues of SP both interact with receptor regions exposed or close to the extracellular environment (20Huang R.-R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Li Y.-M. Marnerakis M. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. J. Biol.

We predict that Asp4 of NKA lies close to the receptor N terminus (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Rigden D.J. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) where it may interact with Thr24 and Phe26 in the receptor N terminus, Tyr93, Asn97, and Trp99 in the first extracellular loop, or residues in the third extracellular loop (5Huang R.-R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the conserved C terminus of NKA appears to interact with the Met297 within the helical bundle. In conclusion, using thiol we have demonstrated the proximity of the two most C-terminal residues of NKA to Met297, a deeply buried site in the seventh transmembrane helix of the NK2R. To date, this is the most convincing evidence to support the role of the transmembrane helices in the binding of peptide agonists to tachykinin receptors. Consistent with other views of peptide agonist binding to GPCRs (31Feng Y.-H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X.-P. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12846-12850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.F. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This strategy of mapping the peptide binding site of the NK2R dispenses with the need for proteolytic cleavage and peptide sequencing associated with more classical affinity labeling methodologies."

Protein cargoes to be imported into the nucleus contain internal sequences, termed nuclear localization signals (NLS), that target them to the nucleus (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The recent purification and analysis of the yeast NPC indicates that the majority of the ∼40 proteins that make up the NPC, collectively termed nucleoporins, are localized symmetrically throughout the pore complex (6Rout M.P.

A subset of these proteins contains a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motif. These proteins appear to line the nuclear pore channel and can be subdivided further into either GLFG repeat-containing proteins or FxFG proteins (6Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A., K.

The small GTPase Ran is central to nucleocytoplasmic transport. Although Ran is localized throughout the cell, ∼80% is concentrated within the nucleus (17Moore M.S. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that the majority of nuclear Ran is GTP-bound. On the other hand, RanGAP (Ran GTPase-activating protein) is predominantly cytoplasmic (20Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Melchior F. Weber K. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), suggesting that the majority of cytoplasmic Ran is GDP-bound. Thus, the nucleotide bound state of Ran may act as a cellular marker that allows the transport machinery to distinguish between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. This strict compartmentalization of the Ran effectors also suggests that Ran must shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm to undergo a complete round of GTP hydrolysis. It is hypothesized that RanGTP exits the nucleus complexed with importin-β-like transport receptors, and RanGDP is then re-imported into the nucleus by the small homodimeric protein NTF2 (23Ribbeck K.

NTF2 specifically interacts with the GDP-bound form of Ran, and this interaction has been extensively characterized through mutational analysis of both NTF2 and Ran (27Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J.

Biol. 1998; 277: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the interaction between NTF2 and Ran is required to concentrate Ran in the nucleus and consequently for protein transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (33Stewart M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins is predicted to be more complex than the Ran-NTF2 interaction because NTF2 is capable of interacting with multiple FxFG nucleoporins that line the central channel of the pore (34Grote M. Kubitscheck U. Reichelt R. Peters R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent in vitro binding studies indicate that the interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins is relatively weak (35Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Chaillan-Huntington C. Braslavsky C.V. Kuhlmann J. Stewart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5874-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This suggests a model in which NTF2 transiently interacts with nucleoporins enabling the NTF2-RanGDP complex to move through the pore by hopping from one repeat to another (37Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). If this is the case, one would predict that decreasing or increasing the affinity of NTF2 for FxFG nucleoporins could have a detrimental effect on NTF2 function. However, the lack of an NTF2-FxFG co-crystal structure has made it difficult to engineer mutants crucial to testing this hypothesis. Bayliss et al. (35Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) utilized the crystal structure of NTF2 bound to RanGDP to predict which residues in NTF2 might be involved in binding to nucleoporins. They identified residue Trp-7 as a potential site for FxFG binding and engineered a mutation in the rat NTF2 protein, W7A NTF2, with a reduced affinity for FxFG nucleoporins. They went on to demonstrate that the W7A NTF2 protein only weakly stimulates nuclear import of RanGDP in vitro. However, a recent study by Ribbeck and Görlich (38Ribbeck K. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) that examined the rate of translocation of both NTF2 and W7R NTF2 showed that W7R NTF2 enters the nucleus quite rapidly compared with a control green fluorescent protein (GFP). This led these authors (38Ribbeck K. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) to suggest that there are other residues in NTF2 in addition to Trp-7 that are critical for mediating the interaction with NPCs. The transport receptor importin-β also interacts with FxFG nucleoporins (8Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 10Chi N.C. Adam J.H.E.

Cell. 2000; 5: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) presumably to allow the translocation of importin-β-cargo complexes through the NPC. One could envision that the import of RanGDP by NTF2 via the ability of NTF2 to interact with nucleoporins is analogous to the import of protein cargo by importin-β. If so, the recent co-crystal structure of importin-β bound to five FxFG nucleoporin repeats from Nsp1p (37Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) might give some clues about how NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins interact. The importin-β-FxFG structure revealed that the phenylalanines of the FxFG repeat cores are buried in a hydrophobic pocket on importin-β, with the phenylalanines of the FxFG repeat core forming stacking interactions with themselves and hydrophobic residues in importin-β. This observation is consistent with the finding that a hydrophobic residue, Trp-7, is involved in the NTF2-FxFG nucleoporin interaction. However, mutations in Trp-7 appear only to weaken and not eliminate the interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins (35Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 38Ribbeck K. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), suggesting that other hydrophobic residues in NTF2 are also involved in this interaction. To fully understand the function of NTF2, it is imperative to define all residues that are critical for NTF2-nucleoporin interactions in vivo. In this study, we have used mutational analysis to probe the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins in vivo. First, we engineered a series of mutant NTF2 proteins that disrupt the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins to varying extents. Our data show that the strength of NTF2 binding to nucleoporins can be reduced significantly without reducing cell viability. However, if this interaction is abolished completely, cells can no longer survive. Second, we isolated a mutant of NTF2 that has an increased affinity for FxFG nucleoporins. This mutation renders the NTF2 protein nonfunctionalin vivo, and overexpression of this mutant protein blocks NLS-mediated protein import. Together, these results support a model in which the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins occurs at a sufficiently low affinity to enable NTF2 to move freely from one FxFG repeat to another as it translocates through the pore complex. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the fine-tuned interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins is critical in vivo. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma or United States Biological unless otherwise noted. All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Δ6NTF2 was made using a PCR-based strategy. The NTF2 promoter was amplified from pAC117 with 5′-GGC ACC GGT CAT TAT AAA GAT AAT AGT ATT AAA ACC-3′ and 5′-GCG AGC TCC CCT TTC ATA TTG TTC GGC TA-3′ as primers. The resulting PCR product was digested with AgeI and SacI and subcloned into pAC715 (pRS314YRB1) digested with AgeI andSacI. The Ntf2p coding region from Gln-10 to the stop codon including the 3′-untranslated region was amplified from pAC117 with 5′-GCG ACC GGT CAA AAC TTC ACC CAG TTT TAC TA-3′ and 5′-CCC TCG AGC GCT ATC GCC TTA TAC ATC G-3′ as primers. The resulting PCR product was digested with AgeI and XhoI and subcloned into pAC715 containing the NTF2 promoter digested withAgeI and XhoI. The six-amino acid deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing then subcloned into the SacI andXhoI sites of pPS315 (CEN, LEUplasmid). Wild-type and mutant Ntf2p-GFP fusion proteins were transformed into the NTF2 deletion strain, ACY114, maintained by a wild-type copy of GSP1 (scRan) (pAC78). scRan-GFP was transformed into ACY114 expressing each of the mutant alleles of NTF2 as the only copy of NTF2. The GFP fusion proteins were localized by viewing the GFP signal directly in living cells through a GFP-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. The NLS-GFP import assay was performed as described previously (42Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to early mid-log phase in synthetic media containing 2% glucose (w/v) at 25 °C, pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm sodium azide, 10 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose in glucose-free synthetic media, and incubated at 25 °C for 45 min. The cells were then pelleted, washed with 1 ml of ice-cold ddH20, repelleted, resuspended in 100 µl of glucose-containing synthetic media prewarmed to 37 °C, and incubated at 37 °C. For scoring, 2-µl samples were removed every 2.5 min, and cells were observed and counted through a GFP-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope. Cells were scored as “nuclear” if the nucleus was both brighter than the surrounding cytoplasm and a nuclear-cytoplasmic boundary was visible. At least 100 cells were counted at each time point. The in vivo function of each of the Ntf2 mutant proteins was tested by using a plasmid shuffle technique. The NTF2deletion strain, ACY114, was transformed with plasmids encoding each of the Ntf2 mutant proteins. Single transformants were grown in liquid culture to saturation. The saturated cultures were serially diluted (1:10) and spotted on fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates to eliminate the URA3 plasmid-encoded wild-type Ntf2p (43Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). This results in cells that express each of the mutant Ntf2 proteins on a low copy centromeric plasmid as the sole copy of Ntf2p. All Ntf2 proteins were purified from Escherichia coliessentially as described (25Quimby B.B. Lamtina T. L'Hernault S. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28575-28582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with the following changes. After lysis and clarification, E. coli lysates were applied to DEAE ion exchange column pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Ntf2p was eluted from the column with a gradient of 0 to 1m NaCl. Fractions containing Ntf2p were pooled, concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon) concentrator, and applied to a column of Sephacryl SR100 pre-equilibrated in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing purified Ntf2p were collected, pooled, and stored at −80 °C in 10% glycerol. Purified Ntf2 proteins were cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-Sepharose beads as described previously (25Quimby B.B. Lamtina T. L'Hernault S. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28575-28582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Yeast cell extracts were prepared as described (25Quimby B.B. Lamtina T. L'Hernault S. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28575-28582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two mg of BQY65 (MATα ura3–52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 GSP1Δ::HIS3 GSP2Δ::HIS3 myc-GSP1) cell extract was incubated with 50 µl of Ntf2p-Sepharose beads. For the competition experiment, either 300 µg of wild-type Ntf2p or 300 µg of bovine serum albumin was added in addition to the yeast cell extract. Binding was carried out in PBSM (PBS, 2.5 mmMgCl2) in a total volume of 500 µl at 4 °C for 1 h. Following the binding, the beads were pelleted, and unbound lysate was removed from the beads. This fraction was designated the unbound sample, and 20 µg of total protein, corresponding to 1% of the total unbound volume, was analyzed. After the unbound sample was removed, beads were washed once for 10 min in 1 ml of PBSM and twice for 10 min in PBSMT (PBS, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). The beads that contained the bound fraction were then boiled in sample loading buffer (100 µl total volume), 10% of the total bound proteins (10 µl) was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Because the bound proteins were eluted directly into sample buffer, it was impossible to quantitate the total amount of bound sample. However, within each experiment the percentage of total bound protein loaded was equal, so direct comparisons could be made between each of the bound lanes within each experiment. This is also the case for the unbound samples. Samples (bound and unbound) were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. For many of the experiments some low level of nonspecific or low affinity binding of Nup2p to the beads (whether they were charged with Ntf2 protein or not) was observed. This Nup2p was readily washed from the beads by the PBSM/PBSMT washes used in our protocol and could be recovered in a wash fraction by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (data not shown). This means that in some experiments, the amount of total protein (summing the unbound and bound lanes) is not equal despite the fact that the same lysates with identical amounts of Nup2p were used for each sample within the experiment. For all experiments the amount of unbound (1% of total unbound volume) and bound (10% of total bound volume) sample loaded in each lane was identical, and therefore direct comparisons can be made between the bound lanes shown for all samples and between the unbound lanes shown for all samples. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described (44Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Ntf2p-GFP was detected by incubation with 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody. Nup2p was detected by incubation with 1:3000 dilution of mAb414 (Babco). Myc-Gsp1p was detected with 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Dominant negative alleles ofNTF2 were generated using random PCR mutagenesis. A 4.0-kilobase pair PCR product that included the entireNTF2 open reading frame was generated using Taqpolymerase under mutagenic conditions (7 mmMgCl2) and purified on a Qiaquick PCR column from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). The plasmid pAC82 was linearized withBamHI and SalI to remove a 475-base pair insert containing the coding region of NTF2. Gap repair ligation (56Orr-Weaver T.L. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) was achieved by co-transforming the wild-type strain PSY580 with the PCR product and linearized the GAL1-NTF2 plasmid (pAC82). Colonies were selected on synthetic complete media plus 2% (w/v) glucose lacking leucine (SD −Leu). The plates were then replica plated to synthetic complete media plus 2% galactose (w/v) lacking leucine (Sgal −Leu) supplemented with 7.5 mg of the vital dye erythrocin B/liter and incubated at 30 °C. Addition of galactose to the media initiates the overexpression of the plasmid encoded Ntf2 protein. Uptake of the erythrocin B dye by dead cells, which results in a pink colony, was used to identify colonies that died upon overexpression of the Ntf2 protein. Plasmids were rescued from dominant negative colonies and retransformed into wild-type cells (PSY580) to confirm plasmid linkage and the dominant negative phenotype. Plasmids that retested were sequenced to identify the mutations. Cells were grown in SD −Leu overnight at 30 °C, diluted 1:200 into synthetic complete media supplemented with 2% raffinose (w/v) lacking leucine, grown at 30 °C to ∼107 cells/ml, and induced with 2% galactose (w/v). Cells were counted every 2 h. Two hundred cells were plated at each time point on SD −Leu media and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. Viability was determined by counting the number of colonies that arose from the 200 cells plated. As the two phenylalanines in the FxFG repeat core have a very hydrophobic nature, one would anticipate that their binding site on NTF2 would also be hydrophobic, analogous to the hydrophobic FxFG binding site identified on importin-β (37Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Previous work consistent with this hypothesis has shown that residue Trp-7 of rNTF2 contributes to the interaction between rNTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins (35Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and that mutation of Trp-7 of rNTF2 to alanine reduces binding to FxFG nucleoporins (35Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, in crystal structures of both wild-type and mutant rNTF2 (35Bayliss R.

Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the hydrophobic patch surrounding Trp-7 is often involved in hydrophobic crystal contacts between adjacent molecules in the crystal lattice (29Clarkson W.D. Corbett A.H. Paschal B.M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. Gerace L. Silver P.A. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M.

In particular, close interactions between the aromatic ring of Phe-126 and both Trp-7 and Trp-112 are found in the crystal packing of the W7A-rNTF2 mutant (35Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M.

https://openalex.org/W1974580977,"The N-end rule relates the amino terminus to the rate of degradation through the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. Proteins bearing basic (type 1) or large hydrophobic (type 2) amino termini are assumed to be targeted through this pathway by their higher affinity for binding to the responsible E3 ligase compared with proteins bearing other residues (type 3). Paradoxically, a significant fraction of eukaryotic protein degradation occurs through the N-end rule pathway, although the majority of cellular proteins are type 3 substrates. We have exploited specific interactions between ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2/Ubc) and their cognate E3 ligases to purify for the first time the mammalian N-end rule ligase E3alpha/Ubr1 to near homogeneity. In vitro studies show that E3alpha forms lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin degradation signals on type 1-3 substrates and is absolutely dependent on Ubc2/Rad6 orthologs. Biochemically defined kinetic studies show that the basis of N-end rule specificity is a k(cat) rather than the K(m) effect originally proposed, since all three substrate classes show similar binding affinities (K(m) approximately 5 microm) but V(max) values that are 100- and 50-fold greater for type 1 and 2 versus type 3 model substrates, respectively. In addition, the N-end rule dipeptides lysylalanine and phenylalanylalanine are general noncompetitive inhibitors for E3alpha-catalyzed ubiquitination of type 1-3 substrates rather than type-specific competitive inhibitors as predicted. These observations are consistent with a model in which the N-end rule effect reflects substrate binding-induced transitions in E3alpha to a catalytically competent conformer, the equilibrium for which depends on the identity of the amino terminus or the presence of basic or hydrophobic surface features. The model reconciles conflicts between specific predictions and empirical observations relating N-end rule targeting in addition to explicating the efficacy of selected dipeptides as potent in vivo inhibitors of this pathway."

Several laboratories, including our own, have provided insights into the molecular regulation of the MnSOD gene through promoter elements (11Kuo S. Chesrown S.E. Mellott J.K. Rogers R.J. Hsu J.L.

Interestingly, induced MnSOD transcripts do not return to basal levels following treatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, suggesting the involvement ofde novo transcription and translation in the turnover of the message (14Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data implicate the existence and potential importance of an underlying mechanism controlling MnSOD mRNA half-life in both the basal and stimulated expression of this gene. Modulations in mRNA stability provide a rapid mechanism for regulating cellular protein levels independent of de novotranscription. Not surprisingly, the regulation of this process is highly coordinated as evidenced by the disastrous consequences observed with v-fos. Fibroblasts expressing v-fos appear oncogenic due to the loss of a native destabilizing element within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR). The result is higher levels of thefos gene product and the observed oncogenic phenotype (15Lee W.M. Lin C. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5521-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,16Raymond V. Atwater J.A. Verma I.M. Oncogene Res. 1989; 5: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Analogously, MnSOD overexpression has not only uncovered its cytoprotective potential but demonstrated that uncontrolled expression of this antioxidant activity causes potent antiproliferative effects in a variety of cell culture (17Li N. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Zhong W.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3113-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Therefore, the control of MnSOD mRNA levels may be a critical physiological mechanism for overall regulation of the redox state of the cell. Perhaps the most ubiquitous and well understood destabilizing element found within rapidly degraded mRNAs is the adenylate-uridylate-rich element (ARE). To date, at least three classes of ARE have been identified based on their presence, number of repeats of the pentamer AUUUA, and the subsequent effects of RNA deadenylation and decay (20Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition to the AREs found with chemokine, cytokine, and proto-oncogene transcripts containing AREs, coding region determinants of stability have been identified within a variety of mRNAs including vascular endothelial growth factor (21Dibbens J.A.

The best characterized of these elements is the c-fos major coding region determinant of stability (mCRD). Recently, work by Grosset et al. (27Grosset C. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) clearly defined the boundaries of the c-fosmCRD, established the importance of its position relative to the poly(A) tail, and identified and cloned several cellular factors that interact with the mCRD. The purpose of this study was to better understand the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate the stability of the MnSOD mRNA. To this end, we have modified the c-fos short term promoter activation system previously described by Shyu et al. (28Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) to identify functional elements that control MnSOD mRNA half-life. We have demonstrated that destabilization of the MnSOD mRNA is mediated by an ∼280 base sequence element within the coding region of the rat MnSOD mRNA that is functional during both basal and stimulus-dependent gene expression. Most importantly, we have observed that this cis-acting, destabilizing element functions independently of ribosome transit. MnSOD fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a previously characterized MnSOD cDNA (29Hurt J. Hsu J.L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using standard conditions and primers specific to appropriate 5′ and 3′ termini. Products are denoted by their position relative to the translational initiation site (+1) of the MnSOD cDNA (Fig. 3). For the in-frame/coding region pBSOD constructs, care was taken to ensure proper transition between each of the RNAs in the chimera so as not to introduce frameshift mutations or premature stop codons. The MnSOD fragments were ligated into either theBamHI (coding region) or BglII (3′-UTR) sites of the previously described plasmid pBBB4 (28Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. Ann-Bin Shyu (Fig. 2A). Restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing verified the integrity and orientation of each pBSOD vector.Figure 2Measurement of β-globin mRNA half-life in L2 cells.

At 90% confluence, cells were split into 3 × 150-mm plates 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were exposed to a total of 30 μg of plasmid DNA, 15 μg of pBBB4 control plasmid, and 15 μg of each pBSOD vector in DEAE-dextran (13Rogers R.J. Chesrown S.E. Kuo S. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 233-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were pooled and split into 8 × 100-mm plates. After a 24-h recovery period, the cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h by incubation with F12K plus 0.5% FBS. The serum-responsive, human c-fos promoter was then activated by incubation with medium containing 15% FBS. Total RNA was isolated from cells at the indicated times as per the Chomczynski and Sacchi method with modifications (14Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μg of RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels, electrotransferred to Zetabind membranes, and UV-cross-linked as described (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed in prehybridization buffer (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar) for 15 min at 60 °C. Membranes were hybridized overnight in prehybridization buffer with a radiolabeled 0.42-kb MluI-BamHI fragment of the β-globin gene contained in the vector pBBB4 (Fig. 2A), generated by random primer extension (31Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). All blots were probed with a radiolabeled 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment of a cathepsin cDNA to control for variations in loading. To verify that the serum starvation/refeeding protocol afforded transient stimulation of the cell cycle-regulated c-fos promoter, we hybridized a representative pBBB4 time course with a radiolabeled 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment of mouse c-fos cDNA. After hybridization, membranes were washed and exposed to film using Fisher Biotech L-Plus intensifying screens at −75 °C. All Northern analyses are representative of experiments repeated 2–3 times. The half-lives of the corrected pBSOD mRNA levels were determined by densitometric analysis using NIH Image. The curve-fitting software Enzfitter 2.0 (Biosoft Corp.) was utilized to calculate mRNAt½ values from maximal induction following serum refeeding. The decay patterns fit a single exponential decay, andt½ values were calculated from these fitted curves. We have previously reported that the five transcripts of rat MnSOD mRNA observed on steady state Northern analysis arise from alternative polyadenylation of the primary transcript (29Hurt J. Hsu J.L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory has also shown that each of the mRNA species are induced and degraded similarly in response to proinflammatory mediators (14Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that actinomycin D treatment leads to prolonged stabilization of both basal and induced MnSOD transcripts, implicating the involvement of de novo transcription in mRNA turnover (14Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby precluding its use to directly assess MnSOD mRNA half-life. Therefore, in an effort to explore the potential role of mRNA stability in regulating levels of MnSOD, we utilized a stimulus-dependent wash-out approach (32Melendez J.A. Baglioni C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to quantitatively determine the half-life of the endogenous MnSOD mRNA. L2 cells, a rat pulmonary epithelial-like cell line, were stimulated with the known inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5 μg/ml) for 5 h. MnSOD mRNA levels were evaluated temporally by Northern analysis in the continued presence of LPS (Fig.1A) or following the removal and subsequent wash-out of the stimulus (Fig. 1B). These experiments demonstrate a role for RNA stability in regulating levels of rat MnSOD. As shown in Fig. 1C, densitometric analysis of the representative Northern data depicted in Fig. 1Bprovides a t½ of 4.2 h for the endogenous MnSOD message. To localize the sequence elements involved in regulating MnSOD mRNA stability, we have employed the plasmid-based short-term promoter activation system, pBBB4 shown in Fig.2A (26Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The utility of this vector system is illustrated in Fig. 2B. L2 cells, transiently transfected with pBBB4, are subjected to serum starvation (0.5% FBS) for 24 h, effectively silencing transcription from the plasmid-based c-fos promoter. Serum refeeding (15% FBS) affords transient stimulation of the c-fos promoter and transcription of the β-globin gene. As described previously (26Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), transcription from the c-fos promoter is terminated within 1 h after the serum addition, allowing subsequent tracking of the stability of newly transcribed β-globin transcripts through time. Furthermore, we have not observed serum-mediated effects on MnSOD transcript levels in any of our previous experiments in a wide variety of cell systems, indicating that this short term promoter activation system can be employed for kinetic measurements of MnSOD mRNA half-life. As shown in Fig. 2C, the β-globin reporter message is stable in L2 cells with a half-life of ∼11.3 h, a figure consistent with that observed in other cell lines (33Alberta J.A. Rundell K. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4532-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Schiavi S.C. Wellington C.L. Shyu A.B. Chen C.Y. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence establishing the effectiveness of the serum starvation/refeeding regimen in L2 cells is provided by the Northern analysis shown in the bottom panel of Fig.2B, where we have stripped and reprobed the pBBB4 time course for the endogenous c-fos transcript. As seen, the promoter is inactive in the absence of serum, whereas refeeding provides an impressive burst followed by rapid turnover of the c-fos mRNA. Of note, as first described by Shyu et al. (28Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), the β-globin transcript undergoes an initial polyadenylation event as evidenced by the slight increase in mRNA size within 0.5 h of serum refeeding. Adenylation of the β-globin transcript is followed by synchronous deadenylation for ∼6 h, at which time no further deadenylation is observed, and the message remains stable for at least another 5 h (Fig. 2B). In an effort to delineate the boundaries of the MnSOD stability element, we have inserted MnSOD cDNA sequences (Fig.3) into the c-fos/β-globin expression vector, pBBB4. To address either the potential of a position effect within the β-globin transcript or disruption of inherent β-globin stability sequences, most fragments were inserted either in the BamHI site (coding region) or the BglII site (3′-UTR downstream of the β-globin translation stop codon) within the β-globin gene (Fig. 2A). In addition, the insertion of the cDNA fragments both within the coding region and the 3′-UTR, has allowed us to assess the involvement of translation in the turnover of MnSOD/β-globin chimeric transcripts. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of an intact β-globin translation stop codon in each of the pBSOD vectors containing MnSOD sequences inserted in theBglII cloning site. We have therefore precluded the possibility of frameshifting and subsequent ribosome read-through into the β-globin 3′-UTR, events that lead to the rapid turnover of the human α-globin mRNA (35Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since each of the five rat MnSOD transcripts has been shown to be coordinately induced and degraded (29Hurt J. Hsu J.L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we began our study with the smallest MnSOD cDNA represented on steady state Northern analysis. This fragment, containing 8 bases of the 5′-UTR, the entire coding region, and 533 bases of the 3′-UTR, is denoted pBSOD−8/1199. This fragment also contains the MnSOD stop codon (position 666) and was inserted into the BglII site of the β-globin gene to avoid the potential for chimeric RNA destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay (36Hilleren P. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 229-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Engineered pBSOD (β-globin/MnSOD) vectors were co-transfected with pBBB4 into L2 cells. The transfected cells were then serum-starved (0.5%) for 24 h. To induce the serum-responsive c-fos promoter that drives expression of β-globin (denoted pBBB4) and the hybrid MnSOD/β-globin (pBSOD) mRNAs, transfected cells were then incubated with media containing 15% serum. Total RNA was isolated at various time points following refeeding, and Northern analysis was performed using fractionation on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. The membranes were then hybridized with a radiolabeled MluI-BamHI fragment of pBBB4 corresponding to exons 1 and 2 of β-globin (Fig.2A). Fig. 4A shows a representative Northern analysis of cells co-transfected with pBSOD−8/1199 and pBBB4. As shown, the insertion of MnSOD sequences −8/1199 destabilizes the normally stable β-globin mRNA. The presence of two chimeric transcripts (Fig. 4A,arrows) is a result of alternative polyadenylation occurring at the poly(A) site located at position 811 within the MnSOD cDNA (II) or the β-globin poly(A) site (I). Densitometric analysis and subsequent curve fitting of either transcript (I or II) reveals a chimeric mRNA t½ of 1.6 h (Fig.4C). The rat MnSOD mRNA 3′-UTR does not contain conventional components involved in mRNA stability, such as AREs, or structural determinants like those found in histone (37Marzluff W.F. Pandey N.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 49-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Stauber C. Schumperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9399-9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), IGFII (39van Dijk E.L. Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and transferrin (40Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) mRNAs. However, recent studies have identified elements within the 3′-UTR that may function as a translational enhancer (41Chung D.J. Wright A.E. Clerch L.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In an effort to explore and further map the destabilizing domain found in the −8/1199 fragment, we co-transfected L2 cells with pBSOD628/1199 and pBBB4. This fragment (628/1199) inserted into the BglII site of pBBB4 contains 37 bases of the coding region, the translation stop codon, and an additional 533 bases of the MnSOD 3′-UTR. As shown in Fig. 4B, the addition of bases 628/1199 had no affect on the stability of the resulting hybrid β-globin mRNA (t½ = 11.5 h; Fig.4C). Further, as the insertion of this fragment does not destabilize the reporter β-globin message in cis, we conclude that the t½ of 1.6 h for the pBSOD−8/1199-derived chimeras is not a result of a disruption of inherent β-globin sequence elements responsible for maintaining mRNA stability. To map the MnSOD stability element identified in pBSOD−8/1199, we generated the vector pBSOD−8/665, where the entire MnSOD coding region lacking only the translational stop codon was inserted in frame (BamHI) in pBBB4. In addition, we inserted the entire MnSOD coding region including 6 bases of the 3′-UTR into the BglII site (3′-UTR) of pBBB4 (pBSOD−8/672). As shown in Fig.5, the inclusion of the MnSOD coding region either in the β-globin coding region (Fig. 5A) or 3′-UTR (Fig. 5B), results in destabilization of the hybrid MnSOD/β-globin message, in a manner essentially identical to that of the full-length pBSOD−8/1199 construct. Densitometric measurements in conjunction with Enzfitter analysis of the decay curves provide half-lives of 1.6 h (coding region) and 1.7 h (3′-UTR) for the chimeric transcripts (Fig. 5D). To further establish that the insertion of cDNA fragments does not perturb inherent RNA stability elements within the rabbit β-globin mRNA, we have inserted an inverted −8/672 fragment (pBS672/−8) into theBglII site of pBBB4. As seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 5B, synthesis of this antisense mRNA does not destabilize the globin transcript in cis(t½ = 7.3 h), suggesting that the destabilizing element is intrinsic to the MnSOD mRNA and not a function of disrupting intrinsic β-globin mRNA stability. In an effort to explore the underlying mechanism controlling the observed destabilization, we treated cells that had been co-transfected with pBSOD −8/672 and pBBB4 with actinomycin D, 1 h after serum refeeding. The results in Fig. 5, C and D, demonstrate that this transcriptional inhibitor can prolong the half-life (t½ of 4.3 h) of chimeric transcripts derived from the pBSOD −8/672 vector, inferring a role forde novo transcription in the destabilization process. To further localize the cis-acting MnSOD CRD, we created a series of deletion constructs spanning the MnSOD coding region. Fig. 6, A,B, D, and E, shows representative Northern analysis of two 3′ deletions of the MnSOD coding region, pBSOD−8/463 and pBSOD−8/230, inserted in either the coding region (BamHI; Fig. 6, A and D) or 3′-UTR (BglII, Fig. 6, B and E) of β-globin. As shown, insertion of the 5′-half of the MnSOD coding region (−8/463) within the coding region of β-globin results in a chimeric half-life of 1.4 h (Fig. 6A). Deletion of sequence from positions 463–230 reduces the destabilizing effects of the MnSOD element (t½ = 5.8 h). In addition, the data in Fig. 6B demonstrate that thiscis-acting element retains its ability to function when positioned in the 3′-UTR of β-globin (t½ = 1.3 h). Graphical representations summarizing the half-lives for both of these constructs are depicted in Fig. 6, C andF. The inability of the −8/230 fragment to confercis-mediated destabilization when placed in the β-globin coding region provides evidence that the destabilization observed with pBSOD−8/665 and that −8/463 was not due to nonsense-mediated decay of the β-globin mRNA. In addition, we were able to induce nonsense-mediated decay by inserting two tandem stop codons within the coding region of β-globin immediately upstream of the −8/230 fragment (data not shown). 5′ deletions of the MnSOD cDNA were also generated in an effort to delineate the boundaries of the destabilizing element. Fig.7, A and B, demonstrates that insertion of sequences derived from the 3′-half of the MnSOD coding region (pBSOD181/665 and pBSOD181/672) retained the ability to direct destabilization when inserted in the coding region (t½ = 1.4 h) or the 3′-UTR (t½ = 1.3 h) of β-globin. However, removal of nucleotides between positions 181 and 409 resulted int½ values for the MnSOD/β-globin chimeras that were similar to that for β-globin alone (coding region (pBSOD409/665)t½ = 12.5 h, 3′-UTR (pBSOD409/672)t½ = 14.8 h; Fig. 7, D andE). The data summarized in Figs. 6 and 7 strongly implicate the importance of MnSOD sequences from 181 to 463 in mediating destabilization of β-globin mRNA. Fig.8 represents data generated from co-transfections of pBSOD181/463 and pBBB4 where this region has been evaluated in both the coding (Fig. 8A) and 3′-UTR of β-globin (Fig. 8B). The insertion of nucleotides 181–463 of MnSOD destabilizes the β-globin message"

A comparison was made with the intracellular distribution of endogenous cytochrome c based on Western blotting of cell fractions and immunocytochemistry. The release of endogenous cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm was detected in Bcl-2-negative cells treated with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine or the calcium-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. No release of endogenous cytochrome c was evident in Bcl-2-positive cells, consistent with earlier evidence that Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Cyt-c·EGFP appeared to be localized to the mitochondria in Bcl-2-negative cells and to be released into the cytoplasm following treatment with either staurosporine or thapsigargin. However, in Bcl-2-positive cells the pattern of distribution of cytochrome c-EGFP was inconsistent with that of endogenous cytochrome c, due to accumulation of both cyt-c·EGFP and free EGFP in the cytoplasm of both treated and untreated cells. In summary, cyt-c·EGFP may be useful for monitoring cytochromec release in living cells that do not express high levels of Bcl-2 but is an unreliable marker of cytochrome crelease in cells that overexpress Bcl-2.

Recent studies indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical step in apoptosis and that mitochondria are a major site of action of both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (1Kroemer G.

Many apoptotic signals induce the release of cytochrome c from its usual location between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes into the cytoplasm, where it binds to the cytoplasmic protein Apaf-1, thereby activating caspases involved in the execution phase of apoptosis (4Budihardjo I.

We have been investigating the role of calcium in apoptosis induction, using as a model system the induction of apoptosis by thapsigargin (TG),1 a selective inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated calcium-ATPase (9Thastrup O.

Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). The TG-sensitive ER calcium-ATPase functions as a pump to maintain the high calcium concentration in the ER lumen required for a number of vital cellular functions including protein processing through the secretory pathway, translation, and cell division (12Lodish H.F.

Moreover, calcium is released from the ER in response to physiologic stimuli, producing pulses and waves of elevated cytoplasmic calcium concentration that regulate cellular processes as diverse as mitochondrial enzyme activity, transcription, and apoptosis (15Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). By inhibiting the ER-associated calcium-ATPase, TG allows calcium to efflux from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm, producing an elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration and depleting the ER lumen of calcium (16Ghosh T.K.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to determine if TG-induced apoptosis is mediated by cytochrome c release from mitochondria using the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS) as a positive control and to determine the effect of Bcl-2 on cytochrome c release following treatment with these agents. Until recently, cytochromec release from mitochondria had been detected primarily by cell fractionation. Recently, a cytochrome c-green fluorescent protein chimera was reported as a method of monitoring cytochrome c release in living, unfractionated cells (24Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.-W. Ma M. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,25Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Therefore, a cytochrome c-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimera (cyt-c·EGFP) was used in the present study to monitor cytochrome c release in TG-treated cells. However, as reported here, the intracellular distribution of cyt-c·EGFP did not reflect that of endogenous cytochromec in cells that overexpress Bcl-2 and was therefore an unreliable marker of cytochrome c release under this condition. The MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line was cultured in IMEM (Biofluids) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated on a 12-well plate at 100,000 per well 1 day before treatment. TG, purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA), and STS, purchased from Sigma, were dissolved in Me2SO. Control cells were treated with an equal concentration of the Me2SO solvent (<0.2% final concentration). The proportion of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology was measured using acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining on an epifluorescence microscope. Assay of Caspase-3 activity was performed with the FluorAceTM Apopain Assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Assays were performed in a 96-well plate (Falcon) and fluorescence was read with a Cytofluor Multiwell Plate Reader Series 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Purified apopain (Bio-Rad) was used as a positive control and Ac-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (Ac-DEVD-fmk) as a negative control. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. During this time, fluorescence was read 4 times, and the linearity of the reactions was confirmed with purified apopain. The pSFFVneo expression vector was provided by Gabriel Nunez, University of Michigan, and the human Bcl-2 cDNA subcloned into pSFFVneo was provided by Roger Miesfeld, University of Arizona. Transfections were performed with FuGene 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Transfected cells were subjected to G418 (0.8 mg/ml) selection. The cDNA encoding wild-type rat cytochrome c was subcloned into the EGFP-N1 expression vector to generate a C-terminal-linked cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein as previously described (24Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.-W. Ma M. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-468 cells stably transfected with either the pSFFVneo vector or the pSFFVneo-Bcl-2 vector were secondarily transfected with the cyt-c·EGFP plasmid using FuGene 6. EGFP-positive cells were sorted and collected by flow cytometry. The EGFP-positive cells were cultured for 2 weeks, and then cells were sorted and collected again by flow cytometry to enrich for cyt-c·EGFP-expressing cells. Cells were fractionated as previously described (26Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modification. Subconfluent cells were gently scraped from 100-mm plates and pelleted along with the cells that were already floating in the medium. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of cold PBS, resuspended in 500 µl of fresh cytosolic extract buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm pepstatin A, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotonin) and incubated for 30 min on ice with frequent tube tapping. Cells were lysed with 50 strokes of a Dounce Homogenizer (2 ml, tight pestle) on ice, and then nuclei, unbroken cells, and cell debris were pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was spun again at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria. The supernatant (now containing the cytosolic extract) was carefully transferred away from the mitochondrial pellet in order to avoid contamination and assessed by Western blotting. Cells were either trypsinized or gently scraped, washed twice in cold PBS, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin) for 30–40 min with frequent vortexing on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10–20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent. Cell lysates (40–80 mg for Bcl-2 and cyt-c·EGFP) were boiled for 10 min in 3× sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% for Bcl-2 and 15% for cyt-c·EGFP), which was followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary or secondary antibodies diluted in 5% milk. Blots were washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following antibodies were employed in experiments described in the text: anti-Bcl-2 (BD Pharmingen, 15031A; 1:1000); anti-cytochromec (BD Pharmingen, 65891A; 1:2000); anti-EGFP Living Colors Peptide (CLONTECH, 8369-1; 1:1000); mammalian anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz, SC-8383; 1:100); and anti-EGFP (CLONTECH, 8362-1; 1:100). Cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (5 µg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS. Cells were then incubated at room temperature in PBS/0.05% saponin, followed by a 10-min incubation in ice-cold methanol. After two washes with PBS, the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-rat cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen, 65971A) at a 1:200 dilution for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with 1:1000 goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Both antibody incubations were performed in 5% goat serum in PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 epifluorescence microscope with a 63×/1.4 NA objective and a 1.6× optivar lens. Alexa 488 fluorescence was visualized using an XF67 filter cube (Omega Optical) ex:485/em:535. Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was visualized using the XF67 filter cube ex:380/em: 470. Fluorescence images were obtained using a Hamamatsu Orca-100 digital camera. Images were processed using Simple PCI (Compix Inc., Imaging Systems, Cranberry Twp., PA). Control and Bcl-2-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 cells expressing cyt-c·EGFP chimeric protein were plated on glass bottom Petri dishes (no. 1.5, MatTek, Ashland, MA) the day before each experiment. Cells were treated for the indicated times and then loaded immediately before imaging with a cell permeable nuclear dye, HOECHST 33342 (Molecular Probes) at 500 ng/ml for 20 min. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert S-100 inverted epifluorescence microscope with a 40× oil/1.3 NA objective (Thornwood, NY) and an InCyt Im 1 single wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The imaging system consisted of a 300 watt xenon light source, a Sutter Instrument Lambda 10C filter wheel for excitation filters (480 nm for EGFP and 380 nm for HOECHST 33342), a liquid light cable leading the excitation light to the specimen, and a triple filter cube (XF67, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) for emission wavelength selection (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas Red). Images were collected with a 4900 series COHU High Performance Integrating CCD camera (Cohu Inc., San Diego, CA). Images were pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop imaging software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). To investigate the localization of cyt-c·EGFP, cells were incubated with 150 nm tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM, Molecular Probes) in culture medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then placed on the microscope stage and incubated in medium containing 30 nm TMRM during the experimental period. Confocal images of cyt-c·EGFP were collected using a 488 nm excitation light from an argon/krypton laser, a 560 nm beam splitter, and a 500–550 nm band pass barrier filter using a Zeiss 410 laser scanning confocal microscope and a 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion planapochromat objective (Thornwood, NY). The images of TMRM fluorescence were collected using a 568 nm excitation light from the argon/krypton laser, a 560 nm beam splitter, and a 590 nm long pass filter. For measurements of cyt-c·EGFP and TMRM fluorescence, laser power was attenuated with neutral density filters by at least 90 and 99%, respectively, to avoid photodamage caused by laser illumination. The MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line was stably transfected with the empty pSFFVneo vector or the pSFFVneo-Bcl-2 vector. Bcl-2 was barely detected by Western blotting in untransfected cells and cells transfected with the empty vector but was expressed at high levels in two clones transfected with pSFFVneo-Bcl-2 (Fig.1A). We reported previously that MDA-MB-468 cells undergo apoptosis when treated with 100 nm TG (20Qi X.-M. He H. Zhong H. Distelhorst C.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis by TG is a slow process that evolves over 48–72 h, and is inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression (Fig. 1B). In contrast to TG-induced apoptosis, induction of apoptosis by STS was detected within a few hours of STS addition, but also was inhibited by Bcl-2 (Fig.2). The difference in kinetics of apoptosis induction by TG and STS was confirmed by measuring caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3). In TG-treated cells, caspase-3 was not activated until 48 h post-treatment, whereas in STS-treated cells, caspase-3 activation was detected within 6 h of treatment. Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited caspase-3 activation in both TG- and STS-treated cells.Figure 2Inhibition of STS-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2.

EGFP-positive cells were sorted and collected by flow cytometry. Expression of cyt-c·EGFP in vector control and Bcl-2 expressing cells was documented by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Cyt-c·EGFP displayed a punctate pattern of fluorescence that matches that of the mitochondrial marker TMRM (Fig.4B). The same pattern was observed in MDA-MB-468 cells coexpressing Bcl-2 and cyt-c·EGFP (not shown). The pattern of distribution of cyt-c·EGFP in cells was observed by fluoresence microscopy following treatment with STS or TG (Fig. 5). Within 4 h of adding 1 µm STS, the intracellular localization of cyt-c·EGFP changed from a punctate mitochondrial pattern to a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 5A). The change in cyt-c·EGFP distribution induced by STS was accompanied by the development of nuclear morphological changes typical of apoptosis, detected by Hoechst staining (Fig. 5B). Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited the staurosporine-induced change in cyt-c·EGFP distribution (Fig. 5C) and also inhibited nuclear apoptotic changes (Fig. 5D). These findings suggest that STS induces release of cyt-c·EGFP from mitochondria and that cyt-c·EGFP release is inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. TG treatment for 48 h also changed the intracellular distribution of cyt-c·EGFP from a punctate mitochondrial pattern to a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 5E). Over this time period, the intracellular distribution of cyt-c·EGFP did not appear to change in untreated cells. As with STS treatment, the change in cyt-c·EGFP distribution induced by TG was observed in cells undergoing apoptosis, detected by changes in nuclear morphology (Fig. 5F). Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited TG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5H). However, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent the appearance of a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of cyt-c·EGFP distribution following TG treatment (Fig. 5G). The preceding observations suggest that Bcl-2 may act downstream of cytochrome c release to inhibit apoptosis in TG-treated cells. However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that the intracellular distribution of cyt-c·EGFP corresponds to that of endogenous cytochrome c. Therefore, the effect of STS and TG on the intracellular distribution of endogenous cytochrome c was assessed by two independent methods. First, cells were fractionated according to a standard procedure to separate mitochondria from cytoplasm, and cytochromec in the cytosolic fraction was assessed by Western blotting. Release of endogenous cytochrome c into the cytosolic fraction was evident following both STS and TG treatment, and in each case was inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression (Fig.6). These findings were confirmed by immunocytochemistry in which a monoclonal antibody to cytochromec detected endogenous cytochrome c as a punctate pattern characteristic of mitochondrial localization (Fig.7). The location of cytochromec in mitochondria was confirmed by co-localization with the mitochondrial-specific dye Mitotracker. In neo-control cells, treatment with either STS or TG induced release of endogenous cytochromec into the cytoplasm, producing diffuse fluorescence and eliminating the punctate mitochondrial pattern (Fig. 7,panels A and E). Moreover, Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited release of endogenous cytochrome cinto the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, C and G). In summary, two independent assays of endogenous cytochrome c indicate that Bcl-2 inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cells treated with either STS or TG, whereas cyt-c·EGFP gave the misleading result that Bcl-2 did not inhibit cytochromec release following TG treatment.Figure 7Bcl-2 inhibits endogenous cytochromec release in STS - and TG-treated cells, detected by immunocytochemistry. Empty vector control (− Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-overexpressing (+ Bcl-2) MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with 1 µm STS for 4 h (panels A, B, C, andD), 100 nm TG for 48 h (panels E, F, G, and H), or not treated (panels I, J, K, and L). Cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry to detect cytochrome c, shown as green fluorescence inpanels A, C, E,G, I, and K, or staining of nuclei with Hoechst dye in panels B, D,F, H, J, and L.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate this discrepancy, cells that expressed cyt-c·EGFP were analyzed by cell fractionation and Western blotting to compare the intracellular distribution of cyt-c·EGFP with that of endogenous cytochrome c(Fig. 8, A and B). A polyclonal antibody that recognizes both endogenous cytochrome c and cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein was employed. Both STS (Fig.8A) and TG (Fig. 8B) induced endogenous cytochrome c release in neo-control cells, and this release was inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. In neo-control cells treated with either STS or TG, release of cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein into the cytoplasmic fraction was observed, fully consistent with the pattern of endogenous cytochrome c. However, the Western blotting pattern was distinctly different for endogenous cytochrome c versus cyt-c·EGFP in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells in which the cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of untreated cells (Fig. 8). Both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions are shown for comparison in Fig. 8B. The ratio of cytosolic cyt-c·EGFP to mitochondrial cyt-c·EGFP was much higher than the corresponding ratio for endogenous cytochromec. These findings suggest that cyt-c·EGFP is incompletely taken up by mitochondria of Bcl-2-positive cells or is released from mitochondria upon cell disruption and fractionation. To further investigate the cyt-c·EGFP expressing cells, Western blots of cytosolic fractions were reprobed with antibody to EGFP (Fig. 8C). Consistent with data obtained using cytochrome c antibody, the cyt-c·EGFP appeared to be redistributed into the cytoplasm following STS or TG treatment in neo-control cells, whereas in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells cyt-c·EGFP was detected in cytosolic fractions from both treated and untreated cells. Furthermore, an unexpected finding was the presence of free EGFP in cytosolic fractions. In summary, the use of cyt-c·EGFP as a marker of cytochrome c release in cells that overexpress Bcl-2 was complicated by the inappropriate accumulation of both free EGFP and cyt-c·EGFP in the cytoplasm. Note that the level of cyt-c·EGFP did not appear to increase following TG treatment in Bcl-2-positive cells (Fig. 8B). But examination of the same cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5G) suggested that cyt-c·EGFP was released from mitochondria of Bcl-2-positive cells following TG treatment. Based on the findings described in Fig. 8C, this misleading result was due to increased accumulation of free EGFP in the cytoplasm of Bcl-2-positive cells following TG treatment. Evidence that Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria originated with studies in which STS, etoposide, and ultraviolet radiation were employed as apoptosis inducers (27Yang J.

Also, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been reported to inhibit Bax-induced release of cytochrome c both in vitro from isolated mitochondria (32Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, there are at least two reports indicating Bcl-2/Bcl-xL may work downstream of cytochrome c release to inhibit caspase activation and apoptosis. In one case, cytochrome c release was induced by exogenous expression of Bax (36Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), while in the other case cytochrome c release was induced by a porphyrin-derived photosensitizer (37Carthy C.M. Granville D.J. Jiang H. Levy J.G. Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. McManus B.M. Hunt D.W. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these situations, caspase-3 activation and cell death were inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Thus, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL appear to act downstream of cytochrome c release to inhibit apoptosis in certain situations. Several additional findings suggest that the ability of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to inhibit cell death is not due solely to inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria. First, Bcl-xL inhibits cell death induction in cytochromec-insensitive MCF7 cells (38Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30299-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Second, Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis induction by microinjected cytochrome c (39Brustugun O.T. Fladmark K.E. Doskeland S.O. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Third, Bcl-2 inhibits caspase-3 activation induced by the addition of cytochrome c to cell extracts (40Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, the goal of the present study was to determine whether or not cytochrome c release occurs during TG-induced apoptosis, and, if so, the effect of Bcl-2 on cytochrome c release. To this end, we used three complementary assays of cytochrome crelease. Two of the assays were dependent upon detection of endogenous cytochrome c release, either by immunohistochemistry or by cell fractionation and Western blotting. The third assay used cyt-c·EGFP as a marker of cytochrome c release. Both assays of endogenous cytochrome c release indicated that TG-induced apoptosis is associated with cytochrome crelease, although apoptosis induction and release of cytochromec was delayed by about 48 h following TG addition to cell cultures. This was in striking contrast to the rapid induction of apoptosis and release of endogenous cytochrome c detected within 4 h of adding STS to cells. Nevertheless, Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited apoptosis as well as endogenous cytochromec release in both TG- and STS-treated cells. Unexpectedly, the behavior of cyt-c·EGFP was not fully consistent with the behavior of endogenous cytochrome c in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells, raising concern about the validity of cyt-c·EGFP as a marker of cytochrome c release. The discordance between endogenous cytochrome c and cyt-c·EGFP might not have been recognized if only cells lacking Bcl-2 (i.e. untransfected or neo-transfected MDA-MB-468 cells) were used in experiments. Indeed, release of cyt-c·EGFP from mitochondria into the cytoplasm was detected by both fluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation/Western blotting in both STS- and TG-treated Bcl-2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells, in accordance with the behavior of endogenous cytochrome cunder the same treatment conditions. Thus, the discordance between the intracellular distribution of cyt-c·EGFP and endogenous cytochrome c was mainly in cells that overexpress Bcl-2, where both cyt-c·EGFP and free EGFP were found to accumulate in the cytoplasm of untreated cells. Other laboratories have reported the use of cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein as a marker of endogenous cytochrome crelease (24Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.-W. Ma M. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). But cells that overexpress Bcl-2 were not employed in those studies. Furthermore, in the case of Bcl-2-negative cells in the present study, there was complete concordance between the intracellular distribution of endogenous cytochrome c and cyt-c·EGFP in cells treated with STS or TG. Hence, cyt-c·EGFP indeed appears to be a reliable marker of cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cells where Bcl-2 is not overexpressed. Why then might Bcl-2 overexpression lead to a discrepancy between the intracellular localization of cyt-c·EGFP compared with endogenous cytochrome c and also to the accumulation of free EGFP in the cytoplasm? Although the answer to this question is not known with certainty, there are at least two potential explanations. One possibility is that the presence of Bcl-2 on the outer mitochondrial membrane interferes with transport of cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein into the inner mitochondrial membrane space. As a consequence, some of the cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein might be loosely associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane and therefore readily released into the cytosol following cell disruption and fractionation. A second possibility is that Bcl-2, by inhibiting caspase activation and apoptosis induction, allows cells to accumulate high levels of cyt-c·EGFP in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic accumulation of cyt-c·EGFP might be toxic to the control (neo-transfected) cells; hence, the cyt-c·EGFP-positive control cell population may be selected for low or absent cytoplasmic cyt-c·EGFP accumulation. Indeed, this may have been the case in the present study since Bcl-2-positive cells had considerably higher basal level of cytosolic cyt-c·EGFP than Bcl-2-negative cells. Another vexing problem with the use of cyt-c·EGFP as a marker of cytochrome c release in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells was the accumulation of free EGFP in the cytoplasm. This was also observed in Bcl-2-negative cells when treated with TG. Most likely, cyt-c·EGFP that accumulates in the cytoplasm of Bcl-2-positive cells is cleaved by an unknown protease to produce free EGFP. Moreover, perhaps elevated cytosolic calcium following TG treatment increases the turnover and degradation of cyt-c·EGFP, producing free EGFP. In summary, both STS and TG induce release of endogenous cytochromec from mitochondria, and Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits this release. Unexpectedly, a dichotomy between the distribution of endogenous cytochrome c and cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein was revealed, requiring caution in the use cyt-c·EGFP fusion protein as a marker of endogenous cytochrome c release, particularly in cells that overexpress Bcl-2.

Lipophilic xenobiotics such as general anesthetics may act by competitive displacement of protein-bound lipids. A kinetic equation is now presented for various binding stoichiometries of lipid and xenobiotic, and microscopic binding constants of anesthetics and organic solvents are derived from two independent assay systems for the enhancement of agonist binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. These constants lead to the first available free energy estimate (−6.4 kcal/mol) for the binding of membrane lipid to an integral membrane protein."
