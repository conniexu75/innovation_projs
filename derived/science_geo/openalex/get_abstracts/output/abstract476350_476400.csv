https://openalex.org/W2035624358,"Even with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), patients are often ineligible for surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablation due to advanced cirrhosis, donor shortage, or difficult location. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been established as a standard treatment option for patients with stage I lung cancer, who are not eligible for surgery, and may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with small HCC who are not eligible for curative treatment.A registry database of 93 patients who were treated with SBRT for HCC between 2007 and 2009 was analyzed. A dose of 10-20 Gy per fraction was given over 3-4 consecutive days, resulting in a total dose of 30-60 Gy. The tumor response was determined using dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed 3 months after completion of SBRT.The median follow-up period was 25.6 months. Median size of tumors was 2 cm (range: 1-6 cm). Overall patients' survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 86.0% and 53.8%, respectively. Complete and partial tumor response were achieved in 15.5% and 45.7% of patients, respectively. Local recurrence-free survival rate was 92.1% at 3 years. Most local failures were found in patients with HCCs > 3 cm, and local control rate at 3 years was 76.3% in patients with HCC > 3 cm, 93.3% in patients with tumors between 2.1-3 cm, and 100% in patients with tumors ≤ 2 cm, respectively. Out-of-field intrahepatic recurrence-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 51.9% and 32.4%, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 hepatic toxicity was observed in 6 (6.5%).SBRT was effective in local control of small HCC. SBRT may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with small HCC which is unsuitable for other curative therapy."

However, trastuzumab treatment was recently linked to potentially irreversible serious cardiotoxicity, the mechanisms of which are largely elusive. This study reports that trastuzumab significantly alters the expression of myocardial genes essential for DNA repair, cardiac and mitochondrial functions, which is associated with impaired left ventricular performance in mice coupled with significant ultrastructural alterations in cardiomyocytes revealed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, trastuzumab treatment also promotes oxidative stress and apoptosis in myocardium of mice, and elevates serum levels of cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) and cardiac myosin light chain-1 (cMLC1). The elevated serum levels of cMLC1 in mice treated with trastuzumab highlights the potential that cMLC1 could be a useful biomarker for trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1998886288,"Dnmt1 is responsible for the maintenance DNA methylation during replication to propagate methylation patterns to the next generation. The replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS), which plugs the catalytic pocket, is necessary for recruitment of Dnmt1 to the replication site. In the present study we found that the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1 was DNA length-dependent and scarcely methylated 12-bp short hemi-methylated DNA. Contrarily, the RFTS-deleted Dnmt1 and Dnmt1 mutants that destroyed the hydrogen bonds between the RFTS and catalytic domain showed significant DNA methylation activity even toward 12-bp hemi-methylated DNA. The DNA methylation activity of the RFTS-deleted Dnmt1 toward 12-bp hemi-methylated DNA was strongly inhibited on the addition of RFTS, but to a lesser extent by Dnmt1 harboring the mutations that impair the hydrogen bond formation. The SRA domain of Uhrf1, which is a prerequisite factor for maintenance methylation and selectively binds to hemi-methylated DNA, stimulated the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1. The SRA to Dnmt1 concentration ratio was the determinant for the maximum stimulation. In addition, a mutant SRA, which had lost the DNA binding activity but was able to bind to Dnmt1, stimulated the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1. The results indicate that the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1 was stimulated on the direct interaction of the SRA and Dnmt1. The SRA facilitated acceptance of the 12-bp fluorocytosine-containing DNA by the catalytic center. We propose that the SRA removes the RFTS plug from the catalytic pocket to facilitate DNA acceptance by the catalytic center."
https://openalex.org/W2019744391,"Chronic kidney diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality in the population. During renal injury, kidney-localized proteinases can signal by cleaving and activating proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in inflammation and fibrosis that is highly expressed in renal tubular cells. Following unilateral ureteric obstruction, PAR2-deficient mice displayed reduced renal tubular injury, fibrosis, collagen synthesis, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and α-smooth muscle actin gene expression at 7 days, compared with wild-type controls. In human proximal tubular epithelial cells in vitro, PAR2 stimulation with PAR2-activating peptide (PAR2-AP) alone significantly up-regulated the expression of CTGF, a potent profibrotic cytokine. The induction of CTGF by PAR2-AP was synergistically increased when combined with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Consistent with these findings, treating human proximal tubular epithelial cells with PAR2-AP induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway. The Smad2 phosphorylation and CTGF induction required signaling via both the TGFβ-receptor and EGF receptor suggesting that PAR2 utilizes transactivation mechanisms to initiate fibrogenic signaling. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that PAR2 synergizes with the TGFβ signaling pathway to contribute to renal injury and fibrosis.

Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that PAR2 synergizes with the TGFβ signaling pathway to contribute to renal injury and fibrosis. Regardless of the underlying etiology, progressive renal fibrosis is a final common manifestation of all chronic kidney diseases that eventually leads to end-stage renal failure (1Ali T. Khan I. Simpson W. Prescott G. Townend J. Smith W. Macleod A. Incidence and outcomes in acute kidney injury. A comprehensive population-based study.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Renal fibrosis is characterized by excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells, increased proliferation of fibroblasts, deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. collagens), tubular atrophy, and microvasculature peritubular rarefaction (2Eddy A.A. Molecular basis of renal fibrosis.Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 15: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Despite the many therapeutic interventions that have been suggested, our current understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of renal fibrosis is limited and effective therapy is not yet available. There is extensive evidence that proteinases play an important role in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis. A pro-fibrotic role has been suggested for metalloproteinases, collagenases, and plasminogen activators all of which can degrade extracellular matrix components such as collagen IV, the major constituent of basement membrane (3Eddy A.A. Serine proteases, inhibitors and receptors in renal fibrosis.Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 101: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Beyond their digestive role, serine proteinases have now been identified as hormone-like molecules that can initiate cellular signaling by cleaving and activating proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), 3The abbreviations used are: PARproteinase-activated receptorHPTChuman proximal tubular epithelial cellUUOunilateral ureteric obstructionMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseCTGFconnective tissue growth factorα-SMAsmooth muscle actinEGFRepidermal growth factor receptor. which belong to a unique family of G-protein-coupled receptors. Serine proteinase such as trypsin can activate PARs proteolytically via cleavage within the extracellular N terminus of each receptor to unmask a unique “tethered ligand sequence” that triggers signaling by binding to the extracellular domains of the receptors. This event induces a conformational change of the receptor to initiate cell signaling (4Ramachandran R. Noorbakhsh F. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Targeting proteinase-activated receptors.

PAR2, recognized as playing a key role in inflammation, is widely expressed on many cell types of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, lung, and kidney, including smooth muscle cells, endothelium, epithelium, and fibroblasts (5Rothmeier A.S. Ruf W. Protease-activated receptor 2 signaling in inflammation.Semin. Immunopathol. 2012; 34: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Hyun E. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinhoff M. Vergnolle N. Protease-activated receptor-2 activation. A major actor in intestinal inflammation.Gut. 2008; 57: 1222-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PAR2 expression is up-regulated during inflammation in many organs, including the colon, airway, and joints and PAR2 activation leads to pronounced inflammatory responses in a variety of cells and tissues. For example, intraluminal administration of PAR2 agonists in wild-type mice induces colonic inflammation (7Cenac N. Coelho A.M. Nguyen C. Compton S. Andrade-Gordon P. MacNaughton W.K. Wallace J.L. Hollenberg M.D. Bunnett N.W. Garcia-Villar R. Bueno L. Vergnolle N. Induction of intestinal inflammation in mouse by activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2.Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1903-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), whereas PAR2-deficient mice exhibited a reduced and delayed inflammatory response in a disease model of colitis (8Lindner J.R. Kahn M.L. Coughlin S.R. Sambrano G.R. Schauble E. Bernstein D. Foy D. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Ley K. Delayed onset of inflammation in protease-activated receptor-2-deficient mice.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6504-6510Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the kidney, PAR2 is abundantly expressed in the proximal tubular cells of renal cortex, and renal PAR2 activation is associated with changes in renal hemodynamics, ion secretion, and inflammation (9Gui Y. Loutzenhiser R. Hollenberg M.D. Bidirectional regulation of renal hemodynamics by activation of PAR1 and PAR2 in isolated perfused rat kidney.Am. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2013; 288: 10124-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Studies have also indicated a proinflammatory role for PAR2 in the kidney, as receptor stimulation with PAR2-AP was found to augment MCP-1 production in human proximal tubular cell cultures (11Vesey D.A. Kruger W.A. Poronnik P. Gobé G.C. Johnson D.W. Proinflammatory and proliferative responses of human proximal tubule cells to PAR-2 activation.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1441-F1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to the inflammatory responses stimulated by PAR2, a role for PAR2 has been identified in tissue fibrosis. A recent study showed that PAR2 deficiency protected liver from the progression of fibrosis. A PAR2 agonist had a profibrogenic effect on hepatic stellate cells suggesting that PAR2 activation augments TGFβ and other profibrotic genes, which in turn promote hepatic fibrosis in both in vivo and in vitro (12Knight V. Tchongue J. Lourensz D. Tipping P. Sievert W. Protease-activated receptor 2 promotes experimental liver fibrosis in mice and activates human hepatic stellate cells.Hepatology. 2012; 55: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, an important role for PAR2 has been suggested in pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and fibroblast proliferation in vitro (13Frungieri M.B. Weidinger S. Meineke V. Köhn F.M. Mayerhofer A. Proliferative action of mast-cell tryptase is mediated by PAR2, COX2, prostaglandins, and PPARγ. Possible relevance to human fibrotic disorders.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(Hoboken). 2009; 292: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that PAR2 plays a role in chronic organ injury through the activation of proinflammatory and fibrogenic pathways. Given these effects on inflammation and fibrosis, it is likely that PAR2 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including chronic kidney disease. Given the abundant PAR2 expression in the kidney and emerging reports for the involvement of PAR2 in tissue fibrosis, we hypothesized that PAR2 plays a role in renal injury and fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we studied the progression of fibrosis in a murine unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model using both wild-type and PAR2-deficient mice. Additionally, using cultured primary human kidney-derived proximal tubular epithelial cells, we examined the mechanism of PAR2 signaling that regulates fibrosis and the production of the profibrotic cytokine, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Wild-type and PAR-2 (F2rl1)-deficient mice (a gift from Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development) on a C57BL/6 background were generated from our in-house breeding colony (15Damiano B.P. Cheung W.M. Santulli R.J. Fung-Leung W.P. Ngo K. Ye R.D. Darrow A.L. Derian C.K. de Garavilla L. Andrade-Gordon P. Cardiovascular responses mediated by protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) and thrombin receptor (PAR-1) are distinguished in mice deficient in PAR-2 or PAR-1.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar). Male mice age 8–12 weeks were subjected to unilateral ureteric obstruction surgery or sham surgery as described previously (16White L.R. Blanchette J.B. Ren L. Awn A. Trpkov K. Muruve D.A. The characterization of α5-integrin expression on tubular epithelium during renal injury.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F567-F576Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Renal function remains normal in these mice due to compensation from the contralateral kidney. All experiments were performed under the guidelines set forth by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee. In brief, mice were anesthetized using an intra-peritoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (125 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg), and a small abdominal midline incision was made under sterile conditions. The left ureter was ligated using 4-0 silk sutures and the mice were allowed to recover under analgesia, with the provision of standard food and water for the duration of the experiment. Animals were sacrificed at 7 and 14 days and both obstructed and unobstructed kidneys were harvested for further analysis. To determine morphologic renal tissue damage and fibrosis, paraffin-embedded kidney tissues were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), Masson trichrome, and picrosirius red using standard protocols. The sections in the kidney cortex area were randomly imaged with a Qcolor5 Olympus camera attached to an Olympus BX51 light microscopy using a ×10, ×20, and ×40 objective lenses and its accompanying software, QCapturePro 6.0. Five high-resolution images of the renal cortex were randomly captured and image analysis was done using the Volocity software. Morphometric analysis of the damaged tubular area in H & E-stained slides was quantified by measuring the area of intact non-injured tubules normalized to the total area of the tissue section surveyed. Fibrosis area identified in the in Masson trichrome-stained slides was quantified by counting total blue pixels normalized to the total area of the tissue section surveyed. Pixel values from the images were averaged to yield a final value expressed as a percentage relative to the total area analyzed. To evaluate renal type I collagen expression, red-yellow birefringence pattern of collagen fibers in the obstructed kidneys were captured from the picrosirius red-stained tissue using an Olympus polarized microscope. Collagen I was quantified by counting total birefringent pixels normalized to the total area of the tissue sections as described above. Paraffin-embedded kidney sections were deparaffinized and blocked with 0.2% gelatin in PBS. The tissue sections were incubated with mouse anti-α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (1:100, Sigma) followed by washing and incubation with Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG. After further washing, the sections were blocked in Sudan Black B (0.1% in 70% EtOH) for 25 min to reduce tissue autofluorescence. The sections were then mounted with ProLongGold antifade reagent in the presence of DAPI (Sigma). The expression and localization of α-SMA in the renal tissue was detected using an Olympus FV1000 confocal system on an Olympus IX-70 microscope with the Fluoview system software (Olympus). Images shown are representative of tissue sections in different groups. Acid and pepsin-soluble collagens in UUO-induced kidney samples were assayed and compared with control kidney samples using a Sircol collagen assay kit (Biocolor Life Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, air-dried samples were weighed and diced in 0.5 m acetic acid containing 0.1 mg/ml of pepsin overnight. After adding acid neutralizing reagent, non-dissolved or non-digested tissue was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of this solution was allowed to mix with 1 ml of Sircol dye reagent for 30 min on a gentle shaker. Unbound dye was carefully removed by a repeated addition of acid-salt wash reagent and centrifugation. Bound dye was dissolved in alkali solution, and absorbance at 535 mm was measured against collagen standard concentrations. Collagen values were normalized to kidney dry weight. Primary human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HPTCs) were isolated from surgical nephrectomy tissue as described previously (17Wuthrich R.P. Glimcher L.H. Yui M.A. Jevnikar A.M. Dumas S.E. Kelley V.E. MHC class II, antigen presentation and tumor necrosis factor in renal tubular epithelial cells.Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 783-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In summary, normal cortex segments of the nephrectomy samples from adults with renal carcinomas were finely dissected, minced, digested with collagenase IV (Worthington), and passed through a 75-μm mesh. The filtrate was then centrifuged and the resulting pellet was rinsed three times by centrifugation with fresh Hank's isotonic balanced salt solution, pH 7.4. The final pellet was then re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 125 ng/ml of prostaglandin E1 (Sigma), 25 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma), 1.8 μg/ml of l-thyroxine (Sigma), 3.38 ng/ml of hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml of insulin, 5 μg/ml of transferrin, and 5 ng/ml of sodium selenite (Sigma). HPTCs were established on a substratum of type IV collagen (human placenta, Sigma) and used at passage <3 to ensure epithelial phenotype in all experiments. All studies with human tissues were conducted with the approval of the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary. To evaluate the ability of PAR2 to induce a pro-fibrogenic mediator, CTGF, 90% confluent HPTCs grown on a collagen-coated 24-well plates were stimulated with either PAR-2-activating peptide (PAR-AP) SLIGRL-NH2 (100 μm) or 2f-LIGRLO-NH2 (2f-LI, 15 μm), in the presence or absence of TGFβ1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 24 h. Control PAR2-inactive reverse-sequence peptides sequences corresponding to the PAR2-activating peptides were also used. Additionally, 1 μm amastatin (Sigma) was also added to the buffer to prevent peptide degradation from aminopeptidase that might be secreted by the HPTC. To evaluate the ability of PAR2 to phosphorylate p42/44 MAP kinase (MAPK), R-Smads or phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), HTPC were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with 2f-LI (15 μm), in presence or absence of TGFβ1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. To evaluate signaling pathways involved in PAR2-mediated CTGF induction, selective inhibitors were preincubated prior to PAR2 activation. HPTCs were pretreated with inhibitors of TGFβ receptor I (SB431542, 10 μm, Sigma), a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (marimastat, 5 μm, Tocris), MEK1 (UO126, 10 μm, Sigma), EGF receptor kinase (AG1478, 1 μm, Sigma), or PI3K (LY294002, 20 μm, Sigma) for 1 h. To evaluate the impact of inhibitors in Smad2 and p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation, HPTCs were serum starved for 24 h before inhibitor incubation. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to the mRNA assess expression of PAR family members (PARs 1 to 4). Total RNA was extracted from HPTC using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following reverse transcription, routine PCR was performed to amplify all PAR members. Primer sequences used in our experiments were as follows: β-actin (forward primer, 5′-CGT GGG CCG CCC TAG GCA CCA-3′, reverse primer, 5′-TTG GCC TTA GGG TTC AGG GGG-3′, product size 237 bp), PAR1 (F2R) (forward primer, 5′-CAC GGA TCC TAT TTT TCC GGC AGT GAT TGG-3′, reverse primer, 5′-CAG GAA TTC TCA AAT GAT AGA CAC ATA ACA GAC CCT-3′, product size 450 bp), PAR2 (F2LR1) (forward primer, 5′-TGA AGA TTG CCT ATC ACA TAC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GGC TCT TAA TCA GAA AAT AAT GCA-3′, product size 550 bp), PAR3 (F2LR2) (forward primer, 5′-TCC CCT TTT CTG CCT TGG AAG-3′, reverse primer, 5′-AAA CTG TTG CCC ACA CCA GTC CAC-3′, product size 500 bp), PAR4 (F2LR3) (forward primer, 5′-GGC AAC CTC TAT GGT GCC TA-3′, reverse primer, 5′-TTC GAC CCA GTA CAG CCT TC-3′, product size 351 bp). Thermal cycling was performed in a GeneAmp PCR 2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the analysis of gene expression in vivo, total kidney RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA as described. Real-time PCR was performed to assess Ctgf and Tgfβ1 mRNA expression. In brief, cDNA was mixed with 2× TaqMAN Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 900 nm pre-designed primers and 200 nm probe. PCR were performed using a StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The sequences for primers and probes designed using Genescript software were as follows: Ctgf (forward primer, 5′-GAG TGT GCA CTG CCA AAG AT-3, reverse primer, 5′-GGC AAG TGC ATT GGT ATT TG-3′, probe 6-FAM-5′-CGC AGC GGT GAG TCC TTC CA-3′-MGB, product size 102 bp) and Tgfb1 (forward primer, 5′-GCC CTT CCT GCT CCT CAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCC CTT CCT GCT CCT CAT-3′; probe 6-FAM-5′-AAA GGG CCC AGC ACC TGC AC-3′-MGB, product size 107). Mouse 18S-FAM/MGB probe (Applied Biosystems) was used as the endogenous control. Fold-change for each gene was normalized to 18 S and compared with gene expression in contralateral kidneys. All assays were performed in triplicate. A monolayer of 90% confluent HPTCs were detached from the plate by trypsin-free EDTA and these cells were incubated for 30 min with Fluo-4 AM-No wash calcium indicator solution (Invitrogen) as previously described (18Ramachandran R.

Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration were done with suspensions of the Fluo-4-AM-loaded cells as described elsewhere (19Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)). Development of a ligand-binding assay correlating with activation of PAR(2) by PAR(1)- and PAR(2)-derived peptide ligands.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar) using a fluorescence excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm with an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Life Science). The fluorescence change caused by addition of agonists was measured and quantified as a percentage, relative to the signal generated by 2 μm A23187 (Sigma) (19Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)). Development of a ligand-binding assay correlating with activation of PAR(2) by PAR(1)- and PAR(2)-derived peptide ligands.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar). We selected SLIGRL-NH2 (100 μm) and 2f-LI (15 μm) as the main PAR2 agonists for our studies (>95% purity verified by HPLC and mass spectral analysis). Protein samples extracted from either mouse kidney tissue or from cultured HPTC were denatured and separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by protein transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 5% milk proteins in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (PBST). Primary antibodies in PBST were applied to the membrane and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies are as follows: polyclonal anti-rabbit phospho-Smad2 and -3 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-goat CTGF (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-rabbit phospho-p42/44 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-rabbit phospho-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-rabbit GAPDH (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-mouse β-tubulin (1:1000, Sigma), anti-mouse αSMA (1:1000, Sigma), and anti-mouse E-cadherin (1:1000, BD Bioscience). The blots were washed for 1 h at room temperature in PBST and then incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h in 5% milk proteins PBST, followed by 3–4 additional washes in PBST. The HRP-antibody signal was visualized using ECL Immunoblotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The intensities of the protein bands were quantified using Image J software. Western blot signals were normalized relative to the image of appropriate control samples. Results of a minimum of three independent Western blot analyses were averaged and pooled to yield the data shown in the histograms. Figures and statistical analyses were compiled using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 software. All in vitro studies were performed at least in triplicate and the data are represented as mean ± S.E. Multiple groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Dunn's multiple comparison tests of groups. Statistical comparisons between two groups were made with unpaired t tests. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all studies. Given that PAR2 is highly expressed in the renal epithelium (11Vesey D.A. Kruger W.A. Poronnik P. Gobé G.C. Johnson D.W. Proinflammatory and proliferative responses of human proximal tubule cells to PAR-2 activation.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1441-F1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we first assessed the impact of PAR2 on renal injury induced by UUO in wild-type versus PAR2-deficient mice. The levels of tubular injury and newly synthesized collagens were quantitatively analyzed in obstructed and non-obstructed control kidneys. Although renal histopathology was normal in both sham-operated wild-type and PAR2-deficient mice, sections from the obstructed kidneys from the wild-type mice showed an increase in morphologic tubular and interstitial injury (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, at day 7, kidney tissue from the PAR2-deficient mice showed a significant reduction in tubular injury compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). The reduction in tubular damage in the obstructed kidneys of PAR2-deficient mice was associated with decreased tissue fibrosis and collagen synthesis approaching levels observed in control sham-operated animals. Analysis of Masson trichrome and picrosirius red-stained sections specific for type I collagen revealed a significantly lower amount of fibrosis in the PAR2-deficient mice post UUO (Fig. 2, A–E). Similarly, total acid and pepsin-soluble collagens were reduced in obstructed PAR2 kidneys compared with wild-type controls as determined by Sircol collagen assay (Fig. 2C). Myofibroblast proliferation is a major component of renal fibrosis in the kidney. Consistent with the pathological findings, PAR2-deficient mice demonstrated substantially lower expression of the myofibroblast marker α-SMA in the obstructed kidneys at 7 days compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections revealed increased accumulation of α-SMA within tubular borders and interstitial areas in the wild-type compared with PAR2-deficient mice (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the reduced fibrosis, PAR2-deficient mice also displayed higher levels of E-cadherin, an epithelial (tubular) marker in the kidney and reduced tissue Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). Ctgf and Tgfb1 mRNA expression as determined by real time PCR was also reduced in PAR2-deficient mice compared with controls (Fig. 4, C and D). Although PAR2-deficient mice displayed a substantially improved phenotype at 7 days post-UUO, by day 14 differences in renal injury and the pathologic profiles between the wild-type and PAR2-deficient kidneys were no longer statistically significant. Taken together, these data indicate that PAR2 contributes to the early progression of renal fibrosis and extracellular matrix production during renal injury following UUO.FIGURE 2UUO-induced renal fibrosis in wild-type and PAR2−/− mice.

https://openalex.org/W2065371404,"A key transcriptional regulator of cell metabolism, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1-α (PPARGC-1-α or PGC-1α), also regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, but its role in antioxidant gene regulation is not well understood. Here, we asked whether genetic heterozygosity of PGC-1α modulates gene expression for the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD-2 during hepatic inflammatory stress. Using Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis in mice, we found significant Sod2 gene induction in WT mice, whereas PGC-1α heterozygotes (PGC-1α+/−) failed to augment Sod2 mRNA and protein levels. Impaired Sod2 regulation in PGC-1α+/− mice was accompanied by oxidative stress shown by elevated mitochondrial GSSG/GSH and protein carbonyls. In silico analysis of the mouse proximal Sod2 promoter region revealed consensus binding sites for the Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) transcription factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated diminished Nfe2l2 protein binding to the antioxidant response element promoter site proximal to the Sod2 start site in PGC-1α heterozygous mice, implicating PGC-1α in facilitation of Nfe2l2 DNA binding. Nuclear protein co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated an interaction between hepatic Nfe2l2 and PGC-1α in WT mice that was greatly reduced in PGC-1α+/− mice. The data indicate that PGC-1α promotes mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme expression through Nfe2l2-mediated SOD-2 expression in sepsis. The presence of this new PGC-1α-dependent signaling axis indicates that PGC-1α opposes mitochondrial oxidative stress by means of selective induction of one or more antioxidant response element-driven genes. By implication, exploitation of this axis could lead to new pharmacological interventions to improve the antioxidant defenses during oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage.

PGC-1α, one of three known co-activators of the family, partners with multiple transcription factors including nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), nuclear respiratory factor-2 (NRF-2; GABPA), MEF-2, estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, all of which regulate respiratory gene expression (5.Scarpulla R.C.

Given the importance of PGC-1α to the maintenance of metabolism and energy production for a broad range of conditions, it is not surprising that PGC-1α knock-out mice display a number of maladaptive phenotypes including miniature stature, exercise and cold intolerance, fasting hypoglycemia, hepatic steatosis, decreased cardiac reserve and heart failure, hyperactivity, and in the brain, evidence of axonal degeneration (18.Arany Z.

However, PGC-1α heterozygous knock-out (PGC-1α+/−) mice are viable and healthy, and they are capable of maintaining basal metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. During severe inflammatory stress, such as bacterial sepsis, mitochondrial damage can be extensive. Such damage leads to increased synthesis and activity of PGC-1α and its transcription factor partners, with the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and restoration of respiratory function (21.Haden D.W. Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Welty-Wolf K.E. Ali A.S. Shitara H. Yonekawa H. Piantadosi C.A. Mitochondrial biogenesis restores oxidative metabolism during Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.Am. J. Respir.

Differential regulation of the PGC family of genes in a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, using an established mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis and sepsis, we compared the impact of variable PGC-1α induction on the regulation of the mitochondrial antioxidant defenses in wild type (WT) and PGC-1α heterozygote knock-out (PGC-1α+/−) mice. We hypothesized that a single Ppargc1α (PGC-1α) allele would be insufficient for the transcriptional co-activation and maintenance of high expression levels of critical target antioxidant genes in a sentinel organ, the liver, under stress. This could lead to depressed enzyme function and decreased defenses against increased hepatic ROS production in sepsis. After a series of exploratory studies, we further evaluated the role of PGC-1α in the antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent expression of the key mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD-2. The mouse studies were conducted on a protocol approved by the Duke University (Durham, NC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Young adult C57Bl6/J mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) served as WT control animals. Heterozygote PGC-1α null mice (PGC-1α+/−) on a C57Bl6/J background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and bred at our institution. Healthy mice underwent sterile midline laparotomy after induction of anesthesia with a single injection of ketamine and xylazine. Using an established sepsis model (21.Haden D.W. Suliman H.B.

Closure was achieved using proline sutures. Mice were killed at 6 and 24 h by aortic transection under isoflurane anesthesia. The livers were harvested immediately for fresh use or flash-frozen for later use. Control livers were obtained from WT and PGC-1a heterozygote knock-out mice without clot implantation. Total protein extracts were prepared from flash-frozen liver using mechanical homogenization followed by sonication in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. High speed centrifugation (13,200 rpm for 18 min) was used to eliminate remaining heavy cellular components. Fresh liver nuclei were isolated immediately after organ harvest using Dounce homogenization (glass/glass) and low speed centrifugation (3000 rpm for 10 min) followed by resuspension and a 15-min incubation in cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors/PMSF). After low speed centrifugation (5000 rpm for 5 min), the pellet was stored at −80 °C. Before freezing, nuclear samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were treated with 1% formaldehyde followed by quenching with 2.5 m glycine for DNA-protein cross-linking. Mitochondria were isolated from fresh tissue by glass homogenization in isolation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris base, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% BSA at pH 7.4) (23.Clark J.B. Nicklas W.J. The metabolism of rat brain mitochondria. Preparation and characterization.J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4724-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by low speed centrifugation (4000 rpm for 4 min) to eliminate heavy aggregates. The supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (10,200 rpm for 8 min) to recover the mitochondrial fraction. After protein assay, individual proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on Novex Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Proteins were probed with primary antibodies to polyclonal rabbit anti-PGC-1α (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), rabbit anti-SOD-2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nfe2l2 H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-programmed cell death-1 (mPD-1, AnaSpec, Fremont, CA), rabbit anti-mitofusin-2 (Mfn-2, Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), and mouse anti-NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (QR1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies to NRF-1, NRF-2 (GABPA), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) developed in rabbits were characterized in our laboratory (24.Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Welty-Wolf K.E. Whorton A.R. Piantadosi C.A. Lipopolysaccharide stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of nuclear respiratory factor-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41510-41518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After application of primary antibodies and washing, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were developed with chemiluminescence reagent (Calbiochem RapidStep, EMD Chemicals; or luminol, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and proteins were quantified on digitized images using Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Densitometry measurements were normalized to β-actin or tubulin in the same samples. Genomic DNA was purified from flash-frozen tissue after tissue digestion, cell lysis, protein denaturation (proteinase K), and RNA degradation (RNase) using a silica-based membrane (GenElute mammalian genomic DNA miniprep kit, Sigma-Aldrich). The mtDNA copy number was determined using real-time PCR (quantitative PCR) (25.Suliman H.B. Welty-Wolf K.E. Carraway M.S. Schwartz D.A. Hollingsworth J.W. Piantadosi C.A. Toll-like receptor 4 mediates mitochondrial DNA damage and biogenic responses after heat-inactivated E. coli.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1531-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA purity was confirmed on 1.2% agarose, and the RNA was converted to cDNA using oligo(dT) (ImProm-II reverse transcription system; A3800). Real-time RT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 using gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). A ΔCt method was used to quantify mRNA levels for Ppargc1α, Nrf1, mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), Sod2, Hmox1, mitochondrial thioredoxin (Txn2), tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), C-C motif chemokine 2 (Ccl2), and interleukin-10 (IL10). Amplification efficiency was checked with an internal 18 S rRNA (AB PN 4332078) over a 0.9–90-ng range of RNA, and gene expression was quantified using ABI Prism 7000 SDS and MS Excel software. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Paraffin-embedded liver thin sections were used for the TUNEL assay. Samples from healthy control and 24-h post-sepsis livers were heated to 60 °C for 45 min and deparaffinized by two changes of xylene. Sections were rehydrated through a series of 5-min soaks in graded ethanol solutions. After washing for 10 min, sections were permeabilized for 30 min at 37 °C with proteinase K solution. A TUNEL reaction mixture (enzyme and label, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was then applied to the sections for 1 h at 37 °C. Negative and positive control sections were prepared with label solution only or by preinduction of strand breakage with recombinant DNase I. After incubation, samples were analyzed for the proportion of apoptotic cells using fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondria (1 μg of protein/μl) were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was removed, and protein was precipitated from the pelleted mitochondria via sonication in 5% metaphosphoric acid followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing mitochondrial GSH, was rapidly removed and stored at −80 °C until GSH assay. The total glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) content of the mitochondria was determined by an enzymatic recycling assay based on glutathione reductase (26.Baker M.A. Cerniglia G.J. Zaman A. Microtiter plate assay for the measurement of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in large numbers of biological samples.Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). GSSG levels were determined after derivatization of GSH by 2-vinylpyridine. Mitochondrial protein S-glutathionylation levels were measured using a bacterial glutaredoxin 1 (GRX1) reduction assay with S-biotinylation and chemiluminescence detection. Mitochondrial samples were treated with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide at room temperature for 30 min to alkylate free thiols. After repeated acetone precipitation, samples were resuspended in Tris buffer (pH 7.5), and S-glutathionylated proteins were reduced to free thiols by incubation with Escherichia coli GRX1 (Cayman Chemical), GSSG reductase (Sigma), 1 mm GSH, 1 mm NADPH, and 1 mm EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Reduced sulfhydryl groups were labeled by application of 2 mm biotin N-[6-(Biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-propionamide (Biotin-HPDP) for 1 h at room temperature. Negative controls were treated identically but without GRX1, whereas positive controls were treated with 2 mm DTT. Samples and controls were applied to an HSI vacuum slot blotter containing a PVDF membrane (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). Streptavidin HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied, and the membranes were developed using chemiluminescence detection (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and quantified on digitized images using Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Flash-frozen tissue was homogenized (glass/glass) on ice in Tris/HCl containing 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene, desferoxamine mesylate, and commercial protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Aliquots of 1.5 mg of protein were reacted with 10 mm DNPH in 2.5 m HCl. After mixing with cold TCA, the samples were centrifuged at high speed, and the pellets were again washed with TCA and then repeatedly washed (×6) with 1:1 ethanol/ethyl acetate to remove free DNPH. The final three washes were accompanied by sonication. The pellets were allowed to dry, dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, and diluted ×0.1 with sodium phosphate. After high speed centrifugation to clarify the supernatant, the protein content was adjusted to a standard concentration (5 μg/100 μl). Samples, along with a negative control (treated with NaBH4), were applied to an HSI vacuum slot blotter containing a PVDF membrane (Hoefer Scientific). An immunoassay was performed using a primary antibody (rabbit anti-dinitrophenol, 1:150 dilution, Millipore) followed by a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1:300 dilution, Millipore). The membranes were developed using chemiluminescence detection, and protein carbonyl concentration was quantified on digitized images using Quantity One (Bio-Rad). A myeloperoxidase activity assay was used as described to estimate the neutrophil content of liver tissue (27.Clayton C.E. Carraway M.S. Suliman H.B. Thalmann E.D. Thalmann K.N. Schmechel D.E. Piantadosi C.A. Inhaled carbon monoxide and hyperoxic lung injury in rats.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L949-L957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen liver tissue was mixed with 1% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide solution, homogenized, and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with o-dianisidine and 0.3% H2O2. Spectrophotometric measurement of change in optical density (406 nm) per minute per gram of liver was reported. In silico analysis of the mouse Sod2 promoter (Ensembl Gene ID ENSMUSG00000006818) was performed for consensus sequences for transcription factors NRF-1, GABPA, and Nfe2l2 binding sites using DNASIS (Hitachi Software; Alameda, CA) and confirmed with MatInspector (Genomatix Software; München, Germany). Nuclei for ChIP assays were sonicated in shearing buffer, and shearing effectiveness was confirmed by electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Samples were then processed for immunoprecipitation using a kit (ChIP IT assay kit, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) and antibodies to NRF-1 (Cayman), GABPA (Cayman), and Nfe2l2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After precipitation, cross-linking was reversed, and PCR was carried out using 1 μl of each sample (input DNA dilution 1:10, immunoprecipitated fractions undiluted) in PCR buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) containing dNTP (Invitrogen) and Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) with the primers 900CGCTTCGCTGTGTCCTTGC882 and 776TAATGTTGTGTCGGGCGGC794 to amplify NRF-1 site, 922CCGTCCTCCCCTCCGCTGAT941, and 774ACGCCGCCCGACACAACATT793 to amplify Nfe2l2 sites, and 1383GCTGCACCCGGAGTCCGCAA1364 and 1134TGGCTGTGAGTCGCAAAGCTTCC1156 to amplify GABPA sites for the Sod2 promoter. For the Hmox1 promoter, we used primers 1350CCTGAAGGGCTACTCCCGTCTTCC1327 and 1051TTGCAACATCCAGCCCGGAGGC1072. DNA concentration was measured and standardized across samples prior to PCR. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nuclear protein (500 μg) in Co-IP buffer (120 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Hepes [pH 7.5], anti-protease, and anti-phosphatase inhibitors) with 0.25% digitonin was incubated for 3 h with the primary antibody (10 μl of rabbit polyclonal PGC-1 primary antibody (Cayman Chemical)) for 3 h at 4 °C. A suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma E3403 EZview Red protein G affinity gel) was added for 30 min to select for proteins bound to PGC-1α. The captured immune complexes were layered on a 1-ml 1 m sucrose cushion (in Co-IP buffer with 0.5% w/w digitonin) and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 5 min) followed by washing at least three times with Co-IP buffer (containing 0.25% w/w digitonin). The beaded complex was washed once with Co-IP buffer lacking digitonin. After washing, 1× sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with DTT was added to the samples, which were denatured by heating to 95 °C for 10 min. Separate 20-μg nuclear samples were diluted 1:1 with 2× sample buffer and heated as input controls. Co-IP samples were magnetized after heating, and supernatant aliquots were analyzed for Nfe2l2 (66 kDa; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by Western blot analysis using bead and input control samples. All grouped data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using two way analysis of variance and Student's t test for post hoc analysis with JMP software (version 11, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Differences in hepatic Ppargc1α mRNA levels were detectable by real-time RT-PCR in WT and in PGC-1α+/− mice following S. aureus clot implantation. There were no differences between the groups in base-line Ppargc1α transcript levels, but after peritoneal inoculation, the mRNA levels increased by 6 h and returned toward base line by 24 h (Fig. 1A). As expected, the magnitude of the increase in Ppargc1α mRNA was significantly less in the PGC-1α+/− mice than in WT mice. Western blot analysis of total liver PGC-1α protein showed a significant increase from base line in WT mice at 24 h but no change in the PGC-1α+/− animals (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, PGC-1α heterozygosity significantly blunts hepatic Ppargc1α mRNA and protein induction in response to S. aureus sepsis. The redox-dependent induction of mitochondrial biogenesis is a key survival factor in sepsis (28.Brealey D. Brand M. Hargreaves I. Heales S. Land J. Smolenski R. Davies N.A. Cooper C.E. Singer M. Association between mitochondrial dysfunction and severity and outcome of septic shock.Lancet. 2002; 360: 219-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar); hence we evaluated mRNA and protein levels in our strains of mice for three key transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis: NRF-1, GABPA, and mtTFA. NRF-1 and GABPA are necessary for the up-regulation of mtTFA and other nucleus-encoded, mitochondria-targeted proteins involved in mtDNA transcription and replication. We found a progressive increase in Nrf1 and Tfam mRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR at 6 and 24 h in the WT mice, but nonsignificant changes in these mRNA levels in PGC-1α+/− animals (Fig. 2, A and B). Liver protein levels assessed at 0 and 24 h by Western blot revealed an increase in NRF-1, GABPA, and mtTFA levels by 24 h in WT and PGC-1α+/− mice, but equal induction of only GABPA in the PGC-1α+/− mice (Fig. 2, C–F). The mtDNA copy number was stable at 6 h, but we found an increase in both strains at 24 h that was significantly greater in the WT mice (Fig. 2G). These results support an adverse effect of impaired PGC-1α protein synthesis in the PGC-1α+/− mice on the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the bioenergetic response to sepsis. Moreover, hepatic nuclear protein levels for PGC-1α and NRF-1 were impressively elevated in WT mice when compared with PGC-1α+/− mice (Fig. 2, B and D). In addition, there were significant between strain differences in the nuclear levels of two other key redox-sensitive proteins involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, Nfe2l2 and SIRT2 (Fig. 3, C and E).FIGURE 3Western analysis for hepatic nuclear proteins.

Here, we investigated the anti-colitic mechanisms of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis JCM 1222T, focusing on the relationship between interleukin (IL)-17A secreting CD4+ T cells and intestinal epithelial costimulatory molecules in mice. Oral administration of JCM 1222T to mice alleviated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis. The expression of type 1 helper T (Th1)- and IL-17 producing helper T (Th17)-specific cytokines and transcriptional factors was suppressed by JCM 1222T treatment. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from colitic mice induced IL-17A production from CD4+ T cells in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner, and this was suppressed by oral treatment with JCM 1222T. Using blocking antibodies for costimulatory molecules, we revealed that epithelial costimulatory molecules including CD80 and CD40, which were highly expressed in IECs from colitic mice, were involved in IEC-induced IL-17A response. Treatment of mice and intestinal epithelial cell line Colon-26 cells with JCM 1222T decreased the expression of CD80 and CD40. Collectively, these data indicate that JCM 1222T negatively regulate epithelial costimulatory molecules, and this effect might be attributed, at least in part, to suppression of IL-17A in DSS-induced colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2123033654,"The currently prescribed tests for asthma diagnosis require compulsory patient compliance, and are usually not sensitive to mild asthma. Development of an objective test using minimally invasive samples for diagnosing and monitoring of the response of asthma may help better management of the disease. Raman spectroscopy (RS) has previously shown potential in several biomedical applications, including pharmacology and forensics. In this study, we have explored the feasibility of detecting asthma and determining treatment response in asthma patients, through RS of serum. Serum samples from 44 asthma subjects of different grades (mild, moderate, treated severe and untreated severe) and from 15 reference subjects were subjected to Raman spectroscopic analysis and YKL-40 measurements. The force expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values were used as gold standard and the serum YKL-40 levels were used as an additional parameter for diagnosing the different grades of asthma. For spectral acquisition, serum was placed on a calcium fluoride (CaF2) window and spectra were recorded using Raman microprobe. Mean and difference spectra comparisons indicated significant differences between asthma and reference spectra. Differences like changes in protein structure, increase in DNA specific bands and increased glycosaminoglycans-like features were more prominent with increase in asthma severity. Multivariate tools using Principal-component-analysis (PCA) and Principal-component based-linear-discriminant analysis (PC-LDA) followed by Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV), were employed for data analyses. PCA and PC-LDA results indicate separation of all asthma groups from the reference group, with minor overlap (19.4%) between reference and mild groups. No overlap was observed between the treated severe and untreated severe groups, indicating that patient response to treatment could be determined. Overall promising results were obtained, and a large scale validation study on random subjects is warranted before the routine clinical usage of this technique."
https://openalex.org/W1980558911,"The incidence of peanut allergy continues to rise in the United States and Europe. Whereas exposure to the major allergens Ara h 1, 2, 3, and 6 can cause fatal anaphylaxis, exposure to the minor allergens usually does not. Ara h 8 is a minor allergen. Importantly, it is the minor food allergens that are thought to be responsible for oral allergy syndrome (OAS), in which sensitization to airborne allergens causes a Type 2 allergic reaction to ingested foods. Furthermore, it is believed that similar protein structure rather than a similar linear sequence is the cause of OAS. Bet v 1 from birch pollen is a common sensitizing agent, and OAS results when patients consume certain fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and peanuts. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of Ara h 8, a Bet v 1 homolog. The overall fold is very similar to that of Bet v 1, Api g 1 (celery), Gly m 4 (soy), and Pru av 1 (cherry). Ara h 8 binds the isoflavones quercetin and apigenin as well as resveratrol avidly."
https://openalex.org/W2022656456,"Objectives To investigate the effect of phenolic environmental estrogens on uterine leiomyoma from the perspective of clinical epidemiology. Methods Urine and blood samples were collected from Han women with uterine leiomyoma and women without uterine leiomyoma, living in Nanjing, China, between September 2011 and February 2013. A total of 156 urine samples and 214 blood samples were collected from the uterine leiomyoma group and 106 urine samples and 126 blood plasma samples from the control group. Bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) concentrations were determined by solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Results Phenolic environmental estrogens in the uterine leiomyoma and control groups were compared based on: gravida>3 and gravida ≤ 3. In participants with gravida>3, urine OP concentration was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the uterine leiomyoma group than in the control group. In participants with gravida ≤ 3, urine NP concentration was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the uterine leiomyoma group compared to controls. Despite obstetric history, urine BPA mean exposure concentration was significantly (P<0.05) different between uterine leiomyoma group and control group. The urine BPA concentration was not significantly (P>0.05) different between gravida>3 and gravida ≤ 3 patients. There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in plasma concentrations of BPA, OP and NP between the leiomyoma group and control group. Mean exposure concentration and range of distribution of BPA, OP and NP plasma concentration differed between the uterine leiomyoma and control group. Conclusion Exposure level of phenolic environmental estrogens in human was related with leiomyoma tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012359871,"Background Skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. We studied the effect of Substance P (SP), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. Methodology/Principal Findings Bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. Exposure to SP strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of B. cereus (+553±3% with SP 10−6 M) and this effect was rapid (<5 min). Infection of keratinocytes with SP treated B. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. Secretome analysis revealed that SP stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the S-layer and the release of S-layer proteins. Meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of B. cereus was increased. The Thermo unstable ribosomal Elongation factor (Ef-Tu) was identified as the SP binding site in B. cereus. Other Gram positive skin bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to SP by an increase of virulence. Thermal water from Uriage-les-Bains and an artificial polysaccharide (Teflose®) were capable to antagonize the effect of SP on bacterial virulence. Conclusions/Significance SP is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. Our study suggests that a direct effect of SP on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2024079663,"High mobility group box (HMGB) proteins are abundant nonhistone proteins found in all eukaryotic nuclei and are capable of binding/bending DNA. The human HMGB1 is composed of two binding motifs, known as Boxes A and B, are L-shaped alpha-helix structures, followed by a random-coil acidic tail that consists of 30 Asp and Glu residues. This work aimed at evaluating the role of the acidic tail of human HMGB1 in protein stability and DNA interactions. For this purpose, we cloned, expressed and purified HMGB1 and its tailless form, HMGB1ΔC, in E. coli strain. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) experiments clearly showed an increase in protein stability promoted by the acidic tail under different conditions, such as the presence of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn.HCl), high temperature and low pH. Folding intermediates found at low pH for both proteins were denatured only in the presence of chemical denaturant, thus showing a relatively high stability. The acidic tail did not alter the DNA-binding properties of the protein, although it enhanced the DNA bending capability from 76° (HMGB1ΔC) to 91° (HMGB1), as measured using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique. A model of DNA bending in vivo was proposed, which might help to explain the interaction of HMGB1 with DNA and other proteins, i.e., histones, and the role of that protein in chromatin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1997219404,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) carries high early patient mortality. More women than men suffer from SAH and the average age of female SAH survivors is greater than that of male survivors; however, the overall mortality and neurological outcomes are not better in males despite their younger age. This pattern suggests the possibility of gender differences in the severity of initial impact and/or in subsequent pathophysiology. We explored gender differences in survival and pathophysiology following subarachnoid hemorrhage induced in age-matched male and female rats by endovascular puncture. Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood pressure (BP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were recorded at and after induction of SAH. Animals were sacrificed 3 hours after lesion and studied for subarachnoid hematoma size, vascular pathology (collagen and endothelium immunostaining), inflammation (platelet and neutrophil immunostaining), and cell death (TUNEL assay). In a second cohort, 24-hour survival was determined. Subarachnoid hematoma, post-hemorrhage ICP peak, BP elevation, reduction in CPP, intraluminal platelet aggregation and neutrophil accumulation, loss of vascular collagen, and neuronal and non-neuronal cell death were greater in male than in female rats. Hematoma size did not correlate with the number of apoptotic cells, platelet aggregates or neutrophil. The ICP peak correlated with hematoma size and with number of apoptotic cells but not with platelet aggregates and neutrophil number. This suggests that the intensity of ICP rise at SAH influences the severity of apoptosis but not of inflammation. Mortality was markedly greater in males than females. Our data demonstrate that in rats gender influences the initial impact of SAH causing greater bleed and early injury in males as compared to females."
https://openalex.org/W2002532837,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria of arthropods and nematodes. In arthropods, they manipulate the reproduction of their hosts to facilitate their own spread in host populations, causing cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis induction, feminization of genetic males and male-killing. In this study, we investigated Wolbachia infection and studied wsp (Wolbachia surface protein) sequences in three wasp species associated with the unisexual galls of A. mukaigawae with the aim of determining the transmission mode and the reason for multiple infections of Wolbachia. Frequency of Wolbachia infected populations for A. mukaigawae, Synergus japonicus (inquiline), and Torymus sp. (parasitoid) was 75%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Multiple Wolbachia infections were detected in A. mukaigawae and S. japonicus, with 5 and 8 Wolbachia strains, respectively. The two host species shared 5 Wolbachia strains and were infected by identical strains in several locations, indicating horizontal transmission of Wolbachia. The transmission potentially takes place through gall tissues, which the larvae of both wasps feed on. Furthermore, three recombination events of Wolbachia were observed: the strains W8, W2 and W6 apparently have derived from W3 and W5a, W6 and W7, W4 and W9, respectively. W8 and W2 and their respective parental strains were detected in S. japonicus. W6 was detected with only one parent (W4) in S. japonicus; W9 was detected in Torymus sp., suggesting horizontal transmission between hosts and parasitoids. In conclusion, our research supports earlier studies that horizontal transmission of Wolbachia, a symbiont of the Rickettsiales order, may be plant-mediated or take place between hosts and parasitoids. Our research provides novel molecular evidence for multiple recombination events of Wolbachia in gall wasp communities. We suggest that genomic recombination and potential plant-mediated horizontal transmission may be attributable to the high levels of multiple Wolbachia infections observed in A. mukaigawae and S. japonicus."

The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of serum CA 19-9 as a surrogate marker under no impress excluding other factors affecting CA 19-9 level other than tumor itself.We recruited 1,446 patients with PDACs and patients with Lewis antigen both negative or obstructive jaundice were excluded to eliminate the false effects on CA 19-9 level. The clinicopathologic factors were reviewed including initial and post-treatment CA 19-9, and statistical analysis was done to evaluate the association of clinicopathologic factors with overall survival (OS).The total of 944 patients was enrolled, and205 patients (22%) underwent operation with curative intention and 541 patients (57%) received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The median CA 19-9 levels of initial and post-treatment were 670 IU/ml and 147 IU/ml respectively. The prognostic factors affecting OS were performance status, AJCC stage and post-treatment CA 19-9 level in multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis was done for the patients who underwent R0 and R1 resection, and patients with normalized post-operative CA 19-9 (≤37 IU/mL) had significantly longer OS and DFS regardless of initial CA 19-9 level; 32 vs. 18 months, P<0.001, 16 vs. 9 months, P = 0.004 respectively.Post-treatment CA 19-9 and normalized post-operative CA 19-9 (R0 and R1 resected tumors) were independent factors associated with OS and DFS, however, initial CA 19-9 level was not statistically significant in multivariate analysis."

We used two criteria provided by the Chinese Diabetes Society (2004) and the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (2002) to define the metabolic syndrome and its individual components, respectively.Regardless of their similar ages (mean: 21 years) and exercise levels, athletes in the heaviest-weight-class with unlimited maximum body weight (UBW) boundaries (mean weight and BMI: 130 kg and 38 kg/m(2) for men, 110 kg and 37 kg/m(2) for women) had significantly higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome than did those in all other body-weight-class with limited body weight (LBW) boundaries (mean weight and BMI: 105 kg and 32 kg/m(2) for men, 70 kg and 26 kg/m(2) for women). Prevalence of metabolic syndrome using CDS criteria (UBW vs. LBW: 89% vs. 18% for men, 47% vs. 0% for women) and its individual components, including central obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and impaired fasting glucose, were all significantly higher in athletes at the heaviest weight group with UBW than all other weight groups with LBW.Our study suggests that professional athletes of strength sports at the heaviest-weight-class are at a significant increased risk of cardiometabolic disease compared with those at all other weight categories. The findings support the importance of developing and implementing the strategy of early screening, awareness, and interventions for weight-related health among young athletes."
https://openalex.org/W1998198526,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a key regulator of translation initiation, but its in vivo assembly and molecular functions remain unclear. Here we show that eIF3 from Neurospora crassa is structurally and compositionally similar to human eIF3. N. crassa eIF3 forms a stable 12-subunit complex linked genetically and biochemically to the 13(th) subunit, eIF3j, which in humans modulates mRNA start codon selection. Based on N. crassa genetic analysis, most subunits in eIF3 are essential. Subunits that can be deleted (e, h, k and l) map to the right side of the eIF3 complex, suggesting that they may coordinately regulate eIF3 function. Consistent with this model, subunits eIF3k and eIF3l are incorporated into the eIF3 complex as a pair, and their insertion depends on the presence of subunit eIF3h, a key regulator of vertebrate development. Comparisons to other eIF3 complexes suggest that eIF3 assembles around an eIF3a and eIF3c dimer, which may explain the coordinated regulation of human eIF3 levels. Taken together, these results show that Neurospora crassa eIF3 provides a tractable system for probing the structure and function of human-like eIF3 in the context of living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981640928,"Background Lutzomyia longipalpis is the vector of Leishmania infantum in the New World, and its saliva inhibits classical and alternative human complement system pathways. This inhibition is important in protecting the insect´s midgut from damage by the complement. L. longipalpis is a promiscuous blood feeder and must be protected against its host’s complement. The objective of this study was to investigate the action of salivary complement inhibitors on the sera of different host species, such as dogs, guinea pigs, rats and chickens, at a pH of 7.4 (normal blood pH) and 8.15 (the midgut pH immediately after a blood meal). We also investigated the role of the chicken complement system in Leishmania clearance in the presence and absence of vector saliva. Results The saliva was capable of inhibiting classical pathways in dogs, guinea pigs and rats at both pHs. The alternative pathway was not inhibited except in dogs at a pH of 8.15. The chicken classical pathway was inhibited only by high concentrations of saliva and it was better inhibited by the midgut contents of sand flies. Neither the saliva nor the midgut contents had any effect on the avian alternative pathway. Fowl sera killed L. infantum promastigotes, even at a low concentration (2%), and the addition of L. longipalpis saliva did not protect the parasites. The high body temperature of chickens (40°C) had no effect on Leishmania viability during our assays. Conclusion Salivary inhibitors act in a species-specific manner. It is important to determine their effects in the natural hosts of Leishmania infantum because they act on canid and rodent complements but not on chickens (which do not harbour the parasite). Moreover, we concluded that the avian complement system is the probable mechanism through which chickens eliminate Leishmania and that their high body temperature does not influence this parasite."

While hydrophobic ligand sites are known, sites for hydrophilic ligands such as the prevalent milk sugar, lactose, remain undetermined. Through the use of molecular docking we first, analyzed the known fatty acid binding sites in order to dissect their atomistic determinants and second, predicted the interaction sites for lactose with monomeric and dimeric BLG. We validated our approach against BLG structures co-crystallized with ligands and report a computational setup with a reduced number of flexible residues that is able to reproduce experimental results with high precision. Blind dockings with and without flexible side chains on BLG showed that: i) 13 experimentally-determined ligands fit the calyx requiring minimal movement of up to 7 residues out of the 23 that constitute this binding site. ii) Lactose does not bind the calyx despite conformational flexibility, but binds the dimer interface and an alternate Site C. iii) Results point to a probable lactolation site in the BLG dimer interface, at K141, consistent with previous biochemical findings. In contrast, no accessible lysines are found near Site C. iv) lactose forms hydrogen bonds with residues from both monomers stabilizing the dimer through a claw-like structure. Overall, these results improve our understanding of BLG's binding sites, importantly narrowing down the calyx residues that control ligand binding. Moreover, our results emphasize the importance of the dimer interface as an insufficiently explored, biologically relevant binding site of particular importance for hydrophilic ligands. Furthermore our analyses suggest that BLG is a robust scaffold for multiple ligand-binding, suitable for protein design, and advance our molecular understanding of its ligand sites to a point that allows manipulation to control binding."
https://openalex.org/W2046031269,"Many allergens share several biophysical characteristics, including the capability to undergo oligomerization. The dimerization mechanism in Bet v 1 and its allergenic properties are so far poorly understood. Here, we report crystal structures of dimeric Bet v 1, revealing a noncanonical incorporation of cysteine at position 5 instead of genetically encoded tyrosine. Cysteine polysulfide bridging stabilized different dimeric assemblies, depending on the polysulfide linker length. These dimers represent quaternary arrangements that are frequently observed in related proteins, reflecting their prevalence in unmodified Bet v 1. These conclusions were corroborated by characteristic immunologic properties of monomeric and dimeric allergen variants. Hereby, residue 5 could be identified as an allergenic hot spot in Bet v 1. The presented results refine fundamental principles in protein chemistry and emphasize the importance of protein modifications in understanding the molecular basis of allergenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2071214728,"Background One of the most challenging conditions in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients is the treatment of perianal fistulae. We have recently shown that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role during CD-fistulae development. Dickkopf-homolog 1 (DKK-1) is known to play a key role during EMT. Here, we investigated a role for DKK-1 in the pathogenesis of CD-associated fistulae. Methods Dkk-1 protein expression in CD-fistula specimens were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Colonic lamina propria fibroblasts (CLPF) were obtained from either non-IBD control patients or patients with fistulizing CD. HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were either grown as monolayers or spheroids. Cells were treated with either TNF-α, TGF-β or IL-13. Knock-down of DKK-1 or β-Catenin was induced in HT-29-IEC by siRNA technique. mRNA expression was determined by real-time-PCR. Results Dkk-1 protein was specifically expressed in transitional cells lining the fistula tracts. TGF-β induced DKK-1 mRNA expression in HT-29-IEC, but decreased it in fistula CLPF. On a functional level, DKK-1 knock-down prevented TGF-β-induced IL-13 mRNA expression in HT-29-IEC. Further, loss of β-Catenin was accompanied by reduced levels of DKK-1 and, again, IL-13 in IEC in response to TGF-β. In turn, treatment of HT-29-IEC as well as fistula CLPF with IL-13 resulted in decreased levels of DKK-1 mRNA. Treatment with TNF-α or the bacterial wall component, muramyl-dipeptide, decreased DKK-1 mRNA levels in HT-29-IEC, but enhanced it in fistula CLPF. Discussion We demonstrate that DKK-1 is strongly expressed in cells lining the CD-fistula tracts and regulates factors involved in EMT initiation. These data provide evidence for a role of DKK-1 in the pathogenesis of CD-associated perianal fistulae."
https://openalex.org/W1970210881,"Introduction Amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene has been described in tumors of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Prior reports showed conflicting rates of amplification frequency and clinical relevance. Materials and Methods We developed a reliable real-time quantitative PCR assay to assess the frequency of FGFR1 amplification and assessed the optimal cutoff level of amplification for clinical application. Results In a training cohort of 203 NSCLCs, we established that a 3.5-fold amplification optimally divided patients into groups with different survival rates with a clear threshold level. Those with FGFR1 amplification levels above 3.5-fold had an inferior survival. These data were confirmed in a validation cohort of 142 NSCLC. After adjusting for age, sex, performance status, stage, and histology, patients with FGFR1 amplification levels above 3.5 fold had a hazard ratio of 2.91 (95% CI- 1.14, 7.41; pvalue-0.025) for death in the validation cohort. The rates of FGFR1 amplification using the cutoff level of 3.5 were 5.1% in squamous cell and 4.1% in adenocarcinomas. There was a non-significant trend towards higher amplifications rates in heavy smokers (> 15 pack-years of cigarette consumption) as compared to light smokers. Discussion Our data suggest that a 3.5-fold amplification of FGFR1 is of clinical importance in NSCLC. Our cutpoint analysis showed a clear threshold effect for the impact of FGFR1 amplification on patients’ survival, which can be used as an initial guide for patient selection in trials assessing efficacy of novel FGFR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2100109177,"Curcumin attracts worldwide scientific interest due to its anti-proliferative and apoptosis inducing effects on different tumor cells at concentrations ranging from 10 to 150 µM (3.7-55 µg/ml). Unfortunately, because of a low oral bioavailability, only low and pharmacologically ineffective serum levels are achievable. In this study, an alternative treatment concept consisting of low concentration curcumin (0.2-5 µg/ml) and irradiation with UVA or visible light (VL) has been tested. The experimental results show clearly that this treatment decreases the proliferation and the viability of human melanoma cells while the cell membrane integrity remains intact. We identified the onset of apoptosis characterized by typical markers such as active caspases 8, 9 and 3 as well as DNA fragmentation accompanied by the loss of cell adhesion. The mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway is predominant due to an early activation of caspase-9. The present data indicate a higher efficacy of a combination of curcumin and VL than curcumin and UVA. Reduced effects as a result of light absorption by heavily pigmented skin are unlikely if VL is used. These results indicate that a combination of curcumin and light irradiation may be a useful additional therapy in the treatment of malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2029854837,"Currently, there are difficulties associated with the culturing of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and knowledge regarding their regulatory mechanisms is limited. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and have critical functions in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Moreover, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) are key activators of signaling in hESCs. Based on the identification of complementary binding sites in miR-223 and IGF-1R mRNA, it is proposed that miR-223 acts as a local regulator of IGF-1R. Therefore, levels of miR-223 were detected in differentiated versus undifferentiated hESCs. In addition, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation were assayed in these two hESC populations and were compared in the presence of exogenous miR-223 and miR-223 inhibitor. Inhibition of miR-223 was found to maintain the undifferentiated state of hESCs, while addition of miR-223 induced differentiation. Furthermore, these effects were found to be likely dependent on IGF-1R/Akt signaling."

Germination in the light/dark regime was higher at alternating day/night temperatures of 30/20 °C (98%) than at 35/25 °C (83%) or 25/15 °C (62%). Germination was completely inhibited by darkness. The osmotic potential and sodium chloride concentrations required for 50% inhibition of maximum germination were -0.7 MPa and 76 mM, respectively. The highest seedling emergence (69%) was observed from the seeds sown on the soil surface and no seedlings emerged from seeds buried at depths of 0.5 cm or more. The use of residue as mulches significantly reduced the emergence and biomass of feather lovegrass seedlings. A residue amount of 0.5 t ha-1 was needed to suppress 50% of the maximum seedlings. Because germination was strongly stimulated by light and seedling emergence was the highest for the seeds sown on the soil surface, feather lovegrass is likely to become a problematic weed in zero-till systems. The knowledge gained from this study could help in developing effective and sustainable weed management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1985822043,"Frizzled homolog 3 receptor was up-regulated in several gastrointestinal cancers such as esophageal and gastric cancers. Moreover, frizzled homolog 3 has recently reported to be expressed in colorectal adenoma specimens. In the present study, we investigated the clinical significance of frizzled homolog 3 protein in colorectal cancer patients. Using immunocytochemical staining, frizzled homolog 3 expression was examined in 186 colorectal cancer specimens, 79 colorectal adenoma specimens, 133 colorectal polyp specimens, 127 colorectal cancer specimens with lymph node and/or distant metastasis, 310 specimens of various non-colorectal cancer metastatic carcinomas and 40 specimens with simultaneous occurrence of colorectal cancer, colorectal adenoma and colorectal polyp. Statistical analysis was used to correlate frizzled homolog 3 protein expression to the clinicohistopathological factors, recurrence/metastasis and survival after follow-up for 42 months in colorectal cancer patients. Frizzled homolog 3 protein was expressed in 100% colorectal cancer specimens, 89% colorectal adenoma specimens, 75% colorectal polyp specimens and 69% normal colorectal epithelial tissues. Moreover, frizzled homolog 3 immunocytochemical scores were highly correlated with colorectal cancer progression. Furthermore, frizzled homolog 3 was expressed in a comparatively lower percentage of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma with focal and very weak staining than other metastatic tumor types. On the other hand, the frizzled homolog 3 immunocytochemical scores of colorectal adenomas with synchronous colorectal carcinomas were significantly higher than those of pure colorectal adenomas. Statistical analysis showed that frizzled homolog 3 immunocytochemical scores were associated with Dukes stage and lymph node status. Finally, stratified groups of colorectal cancer patients had significant differences in their recurrence/metastasis and survival. In conclusion, the present large-scale study has clearly showed that frizzled homolog 3 protein can generate clinically important information for colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2027771047,"The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether numerical effects (Numerical Distance Effect, Counting Effect and Subitizing Effect) are domain-specific predictors of mathematics development at the end of elementary school by exploring whether they explain additional variance of later mathematics fluency after controlling for the effects of general cognitive skills, focused on nonnumerical aspects. The second aim was to address the same issues but applied to achievement in mathematics curriculum that requires solutions to fluency in calculation. These analyses assess whether the relationship found for fluency are generalized to mathematics content beyond fluency in calculation. As a third aim, the domain specificity of the numerical effects was examined by analyzing whether they contribute to the development of reading skills, such as decoding fluency and reading comprehension, after controlling for general cognitive skills and phonological processing. Basic numerical capacities were evaluated in children of 3rd and 4th grades (n=49). Mathematics and reading achievements were assessed in these children one year later. Results showed that the size of the Subitizing Effect was a significant domain-specific predictor of fluency in calculation and also in curricular mathematics achievement, but not in reading skills, assessed at the end of elementary school. Furthermore, the size of the Counting Effect also predicted fluency in calculation, although this association only approached significance. These findings contrast with proposals that the core numerical competencies measured by enumeration will bear little relationship to mathematics achievement. We conclude that basic numerical capacities constitute domain-specific predictors and that they are not exclusively “start-up” tools for the acquisition of Mathematics; but they continue modulating this learning at the end of elementary school."
https://openalex.org/W2063851135,"IgM antibodies specific for a certain antigen can enhance antibody responses when administered together with this antigen, a process believed to require complement activation by IgM. However, recent data show that a knock-in mouse strain, Cμ13, which only produces IgM unable to activate complement, has normal antibody responses. Moreover, the recently discovered murine IgM Fc receptor (FcµR or TOSO/FAIM3) was shown to affect antibody responses. This prompted the re-investigation of whether complement activation by specific IgM is indeed required for enhancement of antibody responses and whether the mutation in Cµ13 IgM also caused impaired binding to FcµR. The results show that IgM from Cµ13 and wildtype mice bound equally well to the murine FcµR. In spite of this, specific Cμ13 IgM administered together with sheep red blood cells or keyhole limpet hemocyanine was a very poor enhancer of the antibody and germinal center responses as compared with wildtype IgM. Within seconds after immunization, wildtype IgM induced deposition of C3 on sheep red blood cells in the blood. IgM which efficiently enhanced the T-dependent humoral immune response had no effect on activation of specific CD4(+) T cells as measured by cell numbers, cell division, blast transformation, or expression of the activation markers LFA-1 and CD44 in vivo. These observations confirm the importance of complement for the ability of specific IgM to enhance antibody responses and suggest that there is a divergence between the regulation of T- and B-cell responses by IgM."
https://openalex.org/W2075701724,"Tristetraprolin (TTP), the best known member of a class of tandem (R/K)YKTELCX8CX5CX3H zinc finger proteins, can destabilize target mRNAs by first binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) and subsequently promoting deadenylation and ultimate destruction of those mRNAs. This study sought to determine the roles of selected amino acids in the RNA binding domain, known as the tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain, in the ability of the full-length protein to bind to AREs within the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) mRNA 3'-UTR. Within the CX8C region of the TZF domain, mutation of some of the residues specific to TTP, not found in other members of the TTP protein family, resulted in decreased binding to RNA as well as inhibited mRNA deadenylation and decay. Evaluation of simulation solution models revealed a distinct structure in the second zinc finger of TTP that was induced by the presence of these TTP-specific residues. In addition, mutations within the lead-in sequences preceding the first C of highly conserved residues within the CX5C or CX3H regions or within the linker region between the two fingers also perturbed both RNA binding and the simulation model of the TZF domain in complex with RNA. We conclude that, although the majority of conserved residues within the TZF domain of TTP are required for productive binding, not all residues at sequence-equivalent positions in the two zinc fingers of the TZF domain of TTP are functionally equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W2151530922,"Accurate fusion of late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electro-anatomical voltage mapping (EAM) is required to evaluate the potential of MRI to identify the substrate of ventricular tachycardia. However, both datasets are not acquired at the same cardiac phase and EAM data is corrupted with respiratory motion limiting the accuracy of current rigid fusion techniques. Knowledge of cardiac and respiratory motion during EAM is thus required to enhance the fusion process. In this study, we propose a novel approach to characterize both cardiac and respiratory motion from EAM data using the temporal evolution of the 3D catheter location recorded from clinical EAM systems. Cardiac and respiratory motion components are extracted from the recorded catheter location using multi-band filters. Filters are calibrated for each EAM point using estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate. The method was first evaluated in numerical simulations using 3D models of cardiac and respiratory motions of the heart generated from real time MRI data acquired in 5 healthy subjects. An accuracy of 0.6–0.7 mm was found for both cardiac and respiratory motion estimates in numerical simulations. Cardiac and respiratory motions were then characterized in 27 patients who underwent LV mapping for treatment of ventricular tachycardia. Mean maximum amplitude of cardiac and respiratory motion was 10.2±2.7 mm (min = 5.5, max = 16.9) and 8.8±2.3 mm (min = 4.3, max = 14.8), respectively. 3D Cardiac and respiratory motions could be estimated from the recorded catheter location and the method does not rely on additional imaging modality such as X-ray fluoroscopy and can be used in conventional electrophysiology laboratory setting."

We tested a train-the-trainer model that could be utilised in isolated rural hospitals.Eight selected rural hospital non-specialist doctors attended a 2-day instructor course. These ""trained trainers"" educated their colleagues in advanced cardiac life support at peripheral hospital workshops and we tested their students in resuscitation knowledge and skills pre and post training, and at 6- and 12-weeks. Knowledge was assessed through 30 multiple choice questions (MCQ), and resuscitation skills were assessed by performance in a video recorded simulated scenario of a cardiac arrest using a Resuci Anne Skill Trainer mannequin.Fifty seven doctors were trained. Pre and post training assessment was possible in 51 participants, and 6-week and 12-week follow up was possible for 43, and 38 participants respectively. Mean MCQ scores significantly improved over time (p<0.001), and a significant improvement was noted in ""average ventilation volume"", ""compression count"", and ""compressions with no error"", ""adequate depth"", ""average depth"", and ""compression rate"" (p<0.01). The proportion of participants with compression depth ≥40mm increased post intervention (p<0.05) and at 12-week follow up (p<0.05), and proportion of ventilation volumes between 400-1000mls increased post intervention (p<0.001). A significant increase in the proportion of participants who ""checked for responsiveness"", ""opened the airway"", ""performed a breathing check"", who used the ""correct compression ratio"", and who used an ""appropriate facemask technique"" was also noted (p<0.001). A train-the-trainer model of resuscitation education was effective in improving resuscitation knowledge and skills in Sri Lankan rural peripheral hospital doctors. Improvement was sustained to 12 weeks for most components of resuscitation knowledge and skills. Further research is needed to identify which components of training are most effective in leading to sustained improvement in resuscitation."

We examined if an increased level of child behavioural problems was associated with body size among a selected group of 2-6 year old children, who were all predisposed to develop overweight.Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using baseline data from the ""Healthy Start"" intervention study. A total of 3058 children were invited to participate, and data from 583 children who were all predisposed for obesity was analyzed. The Danish version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess child stress by the SDQ Total Difficulties (SDQ-TD) score and the Prosocial Behavior (PSB) score. Height and weight were measured, and BMI z-scores were calculated.A direct, but non-significant linear trend was found between SDQ-TD score and BMI z-score (β = 0.021, p = 0.11). Having an SDQ-TD score above the 90(th) percentile was associated with BMI z-score (β = 0.36, p = 0.05). PSB score was not associated with BMI z-score. Analyses were adjusted for parental socioeconomic status, parental BMI, family structure, dietary factors, physical activity, and family stress level.The results suggested a threshold effect between SDQ-TD score and BMI z-score, where BMI z-score was associated with childhood behavioural problems only for those with the highest scores of SDQ-TD. No significant association between PSB score and BMI z-score was found."
https://openalex.org/W2025688022,"Skeletal integrity in humans and animals is maintained by daily mechanical loading. It has been widely accepted that osteocytes function as mechanosensors. Many biochemical signaling molecules are involved in the response of osteocytes to mechanical stimulation. The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in the translation of mechanical stimuli into bone formation. The four-point bending model was used to induce a single period of mechanical loading on the right tibia, while the contra lateral left tibia served as control. Six hours after loading, the effects of mechanical loading on gene-expression were determined with microarray analysis. Protein expression of differentially regulated genes was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Nine genes were found to exhibit a significant differential gene expression in LOAD compared to control. MEPE, Garnl1, V2R2B, and QFG-TN1 olfactory receptor were up-regulated, and creatine kinase (muscle form), fibrinogen-B beta-polypeptide, monoamine oxidase A, troponin-C and kinesin light chain-C were down-regulated. Validation with real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the up-regulation of MEPE and the down-regulation of creatine kinase (muscle form) and troponin-C in the loaded tibia. Immunohistochemistry showed that the increase of MEPE protein expression was already detectable six hours after mechanical loading. In conclusion, these genes probably play a role during translation of mechanical stimuli six hours after mechanical loading. The modulation of MEPE expression may indicate a connection between bone mineralization and bone formation after mechanical stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2028260795,"Cell motility is a fundamental process crucial for function in many cell types, including T cells. T cell motility is critical for T cell-mediated immune responses, including initiation, activation, and effector function. While many extracellular receptors and cytoskeletal regulators have been shown to control T cell migration, relatively few signaling mediators have been identified that can modulate T cell motility. In this study, we find a previously unknown role for PKCθ in regulating T cell migration to lymph nodes. PKCθ localizes to the migrating T cell uropod and regulates localization of the MTOC, CD43 and ERM proteins to the uropod. Furthermore, PKCθ-deficient T cells are less responsive to chemokine induced migration and are defective in migration to lymph nodes. Our results reveal a novel role for PKCθ in regulating T cell migration and demonstrate that PKCθ signals downstream of CCR7 to regulate protein localization and uropod formation."
https://openalex.org/W2063531962,"Maintaining a balance between ATP synthesis and heat generation is crucial for adapting to changes in climate. Variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 13 subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, may contribute to climate adaptation by regulating thermogenesis and the use of bioenergy. However, studies looking for a relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and climate have obtained mixed results, leaving unresolved the role of mtDNA in climate adaptation. Since mtDNA content can regulate human bioenergy processes and is known to influence many physiological traits and diseases, it is possible that mtDNA content contributes to climate adaptation in human populations. Here, we analyze the distribution of mtDNA content among 27 Chinese ethnic populations residing across China and find a significant association between mtDNA content and climate, with northern populations having significantly higher mtDNA content than southern populations. Functional studies have shown that high mtDNA content correlates with an increase in the expression of energy metabolism enzymes, which may accelerate thermogenesis. This suggests that the significantly higher mtDNA content observed in northern populations may confer a selective advantage in adapting to colder northern climates."

This study examines the time trends in the socioeconomic patterning of generalised and abdominal obesity and overweight in English adults.Data were from core annual samples of the Health Survey for England 1993-2008, including 155 661 participants aged 18-75 years. The prevalence of generalised and abdominal obesity and overweight was reported as crude and age-adjusted estimates. Binomial regression was used to model measures of obesity and overweight with age, sex, survey years, and two indicators of socioeconomic position: Registrar General's Social Class (manual and non-manual occupational groups) and relative length of full time education. Trends in socioeconomic patterning were assessed by formal tests for interactions between socioeconomic position measures and survey periods in these models.The prevalence of generalised and abdominal overweight and obesity increased consistently between 1993 and 2008. There were significant differences in the four outcomes between the two socioeconomic position (SEP) groups in men and women, except for generalised and abdominal overweight with social class in men. The prevalence of obesity and overweight across the whole period was higher in subgroups with lower SEP (differences of 0.2% to 9.5%). There was no significant widening of the socioeconomic gradient of most indicators of greater body fat since the early 1990s, except for educational gradient in generalised obesity in men and women (P = 0.001).Substantial social class and education gradients in obesity and overweight are still present in both sexes. However, there is limited evidence that these socioeconomic inequalities have changed since 1993."

As few studies have evaluated HPV infections in young populations, further data are needed in order to improve and extend prophylactic policy and to monitor epidemiological changes. The present study aimed at evaluating overall and type-specific HPV prevalence in both female and male adolescents in Italy. HPV DNA detection and genotyping was performed on urine samples collected from 870 unvaccinated adolescents (369 females, 501 males, 11-18 years of age) in five cities in Italy. Following DNA extraction by means of a commercial kit (NucliSENS®-miniMAG®, bioMérieux), the L1 gene fragment was PCR amplified and genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. HPV DNA was detected in 1.5% of all samples, and in 3% and 0.4% of samples from females and males, respectively. In approximately 70% of HPV DNA positive adolescents, the infection was due to a single genotype, with 88.9% of genotypes belonging to the HR-clade. The only two HPV-positive boys (14 and 18 years old) had HPV-70 genotype. Only one of the 11 HPV-infected girls was in the 11-14 age-group. HPV prevalence was 4.2% in girls aged 15-18 years and 60% of infections were due to vaccine types HPV-16 or HPV-6/-11. This is one of the few studies, the first conducted in Italy, on HPV infection in adolescents. Urine testing is the easier way of detecting HPV infection in younger populations. Our data revealed a very low HPV prevalence, and no infections were observed in the 12-year-old vaccine target population. The majority of infections were seen in females aged 15-18 years. Overall, more than 50% and 30% of the potentially persistent HPV infections detected in this group could have been prevented by the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2081229027,"The replicative helicase for bacteriophage T4 is gp41, which is a ring-shaped hexameric motor protein that achieves unwinding of dsDNA by translocating along one strand of ssDNA while forcing the opposite strand to the outside of the ring. While much study has been dedicated to the mechanism of binding and translocation along the ssDNA strand encircled by ring-shaped helicases, relatively little is known about the nature of the interaction with the opposite, ‘occluded’ strand. Here, we investigate the interplay between the bacteriophage T4 helicase gp41 and the ss/dsDNA fork by measuring, at the single-molecule level, DNA unwinding events on stretched DNA tethers in multiple geometries. We find that gp41 activity is significantly dependent on the geometry and tension of the occluded strand, suggesting an interaction between gp41 and the occluded strand that stimulates the helicase. However, the geometry dependence of gp41 activity is the opposite of that found previously for the E. coli hexameric helicase DnaB. Namely, tension applied between the occluded strand and dsDNA stem inhibits unwinding activity by gp41, while tension pulling apart the two ssDNA tails does not hinder its activity. This implies a distinct variation in helicase-occluded strand interactions among superfamily IV helicases, and we propose a speculative model for this interaction that is consistent with both the data presented here on gp41 and the data that had been previously reported for DnaB."

Results There was an increase of adult obesity from 14.2% at age 42 to 23.6% at 50 years. Cohort members who were reported by teachers on overall clumsiness as “certainly applied” at age 7 were more likely to become obese at age 50. In addition, educational qualifications, traits Conscientiousness and Extraversion, psychological distress, and physical exercise were all significantly associated with adult obesity. The associations remained to be significant after controlling for birth weight and gestation, maternal and paternal BMI, childhood BMI, childhood intelligence and behavioural adjustment, as well as diet. Conclusion Neurological function in childhood, education, trait Conscientiousness, and exercise were all significantly and independently associated with adult obesity, each explained unique individual variability."

Recently, we identified DOK2 as a lung adenocarcinoma tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that genomic loss of DOK2 is associated with EGFR mutations in human lung adenocarcinoma, and we hypothesized that loss of DOK2 might therefore cooperate with EGFR mutations to promote lung tumorigenesis. We tested this hypothesis using genetically engineered mouse models and find that loss of Dok2 in the mouse accelerates lung tumorigenesis initiated by oncogenic EGFR, but not that initiated by mutated Kras. Moreover, we find that DOK2 participates in a negative feedback loop that opposes mutated EGFR; EGFR mutation leads to recruitment of DOK2 to EGFR and DOK2-mediated inhibition of downstream activation of RAS. These data identify DOK2 as a tumor suppressor in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma."

A fishery has been operating in New Zealand waters for the last six years, harvesting the bearded hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus. The fishery has thus far been unregulated. Based on samples collected dockside over a two-year period, this report expands the morphometric database for this species, provides information on the size and weight of the harvested animals, determines the sizes at the onset of gonadal development and the minimum sizes at sexual maturation for males and females, and indicates that E. cirrhatus, like most other hagfish species, has no specific breeding season. Although females appear in the population at smaller sizes, the sex ratio for mature animals is 1:1 and the sizes of the largest males and females are comparable. The changes observed in sex ratio as a function of TL suggest differences in the timing and rates of gonadal development in females versus males rather than protogyny. Based on the size of the eggs, the number of eggs per female, the proportion of the population that contains large eggs, and the number of postovulatory females, it is clear that E. cirrhatus, like other hagfish species, are potentially vulnerable to overexploitation."

Immunhistochemistry of mouse pancreas revealed nuclear expression of HCF-1 in pancreatic islets. Reducing HCF-1 expression in the INS-1 pancreatic β-cell line resulted in reduced cell proliferation, reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and reduced expression of the critical β-cell transcription factor Pdx1. HCF-1 is a known co-activator of the E2F1 transcription factor, and loss of E2F1 results in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and reduced expression of Pdx1. Therefore we wondered whether HCF-1 might be required for E2F1 regulation of Pdx1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HCF-1 and E2F1 co-localize to the Pdx1 promoter. These results indicate that HCF-1 represents a novel transcriptional regulator required for maintaining pancreatic β-cell function."

Human RR small subunit M2 exists in a homodimer form. However, the importance of the dimer form to the enzyme and the related mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we tried to identify the interfacial residues that may mediate the assembly of M2 homodimer by computational alanine scanning based on the x-ray crystal structure. Co-immunoprecipitation, size exclusion chromatography, and RR activity assays showed that the K95E mutation in M2 resulted in dimer disassembly and enzyme activity inhibition. In comparison, the charge-exchanging double mutation of K95E and E98K recovered the dimerization and activity. Structural comparisons suggested that a conserved cluster of charged residues, including Lys-95, Glu-98, Glu-105, and Glu-174, at the interface may function as an ionic lock for M2 homodimer. Although the measurements of the radical and iron contents showed that the monomer (the K95E mutant) was capable of generating the diiron and tyrosyl radical cofactor, co-immunoprecipitation and competitive enzyme inhibition assays indicated that the disassembly of M2 dimer reduced its interaction with the large subunit M1. In addition, the immunofluorescent and fusion protein-fluorescent imaging analyses showed that the dissociation of M2 dimer altered its subcellular localization. Finally, the transfection of the wild-type M2 but not the K95E mutant rescued the G1/S phase cell cycle arrest and cell growth inhibition caused by the siRNA knockdown of M2. Thus, the conserved Lys-95 charged residue cluster is critical for human RR M2 homodimerization, which is indispensable to constitute an active holoenzyme and function in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998587324,"Background Habitat fragmentation, associated with human population expansion, impedes dispersal, reduces gene flow and aggravates inbreeding in species on the brink of extinction. Both scientific and conservation communities increasingly realize that maintaining and restoring landscape connectivity is of vital importance in biodiversity conservation. Prior to any conservation initiatives, it is helpful to present conservation practitioners with a spatially explicit model of functional connectivity for the target species or landscape. Methodology/Principal Findings Using Przewalski’s gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) as a model of endangered ungulate species in highly fragmented landscape, we present a model providing spatially explicit information to inform the long-term preservation of well-connected metapopulations. We employed a Geographic Information System (GIS) and expert-literature method to create a habitat suitability map, to identify potential habitats and to delineate a functional connectivity network (least-cost movement corridors and paths) for the gazelle. Results indicated that there were limited suitable habitats for the gazelle, mainly found to the north and northwest of the Qinghai Lake where four of five potential habitat patches were identified. Fifteen pairs of least-cost corridors and paths were mapped connecting eleven extant populations and two neighboring potential patches. The least-cost paths ranged from 0.2 km to 26.8 km in length (averaging 12.4 km) and were all longer than corresponding Euclidean distances. Conclusions/Significance The model outputs were validated and supported by the latest findings in landscape genetics of the species, and may provide impetus for connectivity conservation programs. Dispersal barriers were examined and appropriate mitigation strategies were suggested. This study provides conservation practitioners with thorough and visualized information to reserve the landscape connectivity for Przewalski’s gazelle. In a general sense, we proposed a heuristic framework for species with similar biological and ecological characteristics."

PEL cell lines infected with KSHV, but negative for Epstein-Barr virus have a tumorigenic potential in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice and result in efficient engraftment and formation of malignant ascites with notable abdominal distension, consistent with the clinical manifestations of PEL in humans. Methodology/Principal Findings Using this preclinical mouse model, we demonstrate that the combination of arsenic trioxide and interferon-alpha (IFN) inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and downregulates the latent viral transcripts LANA-1, v-FLIP and v-Cyc in PEL cells derived from malignant ascites. Furthermore, this combination decreases the peritoneal volume and synergistically increases survival of PEL mice. Conclusion/Significance These results provide a promising rationale for the therapeutic use of arsenic/IFN in PEL patients."
https://openalex.org/W2011449735,"The extent to which different grazers are functionally redundant has strong implications for the maintenance of community structure and function. Grazing by red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) on temperate rocky reefs can initiate a switch from invertebrate or macroalgal dominance to an algal crust state, but can also cause increases in the density of molluscan mesograzers. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that red urchins and lined chitons (Tonicella spp.) are redundant in the maintenance of available space, defined as encrusting algae and bare rock. In a factorial field experiment replicated at three sites, we reduced the densities of urchins and chitons on subtidal rock walls for nine months. The effects of grazers were interpreted in the context of natural temporal variation by monitoring the benthic community one year before, during, and after grazer removal. The removal of each grazer in isolation had no effect on the epilithic community, but the removal of both grazers caused an increase in sessile invertebrates. The increase was due primarily to clonal ascidians, which displayed a large (∼75%) relative increase in response to the removal of both grazers. However, the observed non-additive responses to grazer removal were temporary and smaller than seasonal fluctuations. Our data demonstrate that urchins and chitons can be redundant in the maintenance of available space, and highlight the value of drawing conclusions from experimental manipulations within an extended temporal context."
https://openalex.org/W2056019751,"Previous studies show that the congruency sequence effect can result from both the conflict adaptation effect (CAE) and feature integration effect which can be observed as the repetition priming effect (RPE) and feature overlap effect (FOE) depending on different experimental conditions. Evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that a close correlation exists between the neural mechanisms of alertness-related modulations and the congruency sequence effect. However, little is known about whether and how alertness mediates the congruency sequence effect. In Experiment 1, the Attentional Networks Test (ANT) and a modified flanker task were used to evaluate whether the alertness of the attentional functions had a correlation with the CAE and RPE. In Experimental 2, the ANT and another modified flanker task were used to investigate whether alertness of the attentional functions correlate with the CAE and FOE. In Experiment 1, through the correlative analysis, we found a significant positive correlation between alertness and the CAE, and a negative correlation between the alertness and the RPE. Moreover, a significant negative correlation existed between CAE and RPE. In Experiment 2, we found a marginally significant negative correlation between the CAE and the RPE, but the correlation between alertness and FOE, CAE and FOE was not significant. These results suggest that alertness can modulate conflict adaptation and feature integration in an opposite way. Participants at the high alerting level group may tend to use the top-down cognitive processing strategy, whereas participants at the low alerting level group tend to use the bottom-up processing strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2059578363,"Many invasive species exploit the disturbed habitats created by human activities. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance on invasion success, and how disturbance interacts with other factors (such as biotic resistance to the invaders from the native fauna) may suggest new ways to reduce invader viability. In tropical Australia, commercial livestock production can facilitate invasion by the cane toad (Rhinella marina), because hoofprints left by cattle and horses around waterbody margins provide distinctive (cool, moist) microhabitats; nevertheless the same microhabitat can inhibit the success of cane toads by increasing the risks of predation or drowning. Metamorph cane toads actively select hoofprints as retreat-sites to escape dangerous thermal and hydric conditions in the surrounding landscape. However, hoofprint geometry is important: in hoofprints with steep sides the young toads are more likely to be attacked by predatory ants (Iridomyrmex reburrus) and are more likely to drown following heavy rain. Thus, anthropogenic changes to the landscape interact with predation by native taxa to affect the ability of cane toads in this vulnerable life-history stage to thrive in the harsh abiotic conditions of tropical Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2083713728,"Desktop virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly deployed to study the effects of environmental qualities and interventions on human behavior and safety related concerns in built environments. For these applications it is essential that users appraise the affective qualities of the VE similar to those of its real world counterpart. Previous studies have shown that factors like simulated lighting, sound and dynamic elements all contribute to the affective appraisal of a desktop VE. Since ambient odor is known to affect the affective appraisal of real environments, and has been shown to increase the sense of presence in immersive VEs, it may also be an effective tool to tune the affective appraisal of desktop VEs. This study investigated if exposure to ambient odor can modulate the affective appraisal of a desktop VE with signs of public disorder.Participants explored a desktop VE representing a suburban neighborhood with signs of public disorder (neglect, vandalism and crime), while being exposed to either room air or subliminal levels of unpleasant (tar) or pleasant (cut grass) ambient odor. Whenever they encountered signs of disorder they reported their safety related concerns and associated affective feelings.Signs of crime in the desktop VE were associated with negative affective feelings and concerns for personal safety and personal property. However, there was no significant difference between reported safety related concerns and affective connotations in the control (no-odor) and in each of the two ambient odor conditions.Ambient odor did not affect safety related concerns and affective connotations associated with signs of disorder in the desktop VE. Thus, semantic congruency between ambient odor and a desktop VE may not be sufficient to influence its affective appraisal, and a more realistic simulation in which simulated objects appear to emit scents may be required to achieve this goal."
https://openalex.org/W2169729278,"α1-Adrenergic stimulation increases blood vessel tone in mammals. This process involves a number of intracellular signaling pathways that include signaling via phospholipase C, diacylglycerol (DAG), and protein kinase C. So far, it is not certain whether signaling via phospholipase D (PLD) and PLD-derived DAG is involved in this process. We asked whether PLD participates in the α1-adrenergic-mediated signaling in vascular smooth muscle. α1-Adrenergic-induced contraction was assessed by myography of isolated aortic rings and by pressure recordings using the hindlimb perfusion model in mice. The effects of the PLD inhibitor 1-butanol (IC50 0.15 vol%) and the inactive congener 2-butanol were comparatively studied. Inhibition of PLD by 1-butanol reduced specifically the α1-adrenergic-induced contraction and the α1-adrenergic-induced pressure increase by 10 and 40% of the maximum, respectively. 1-Butanol did not influence the aortic contractions induced by high extracellular potassium, by the thromboxane analog U46619, or by a phorbol ester. The effects of 1-butanol were absent in mice that lack PLD1 (Pld1(-/-) mice) or that selectively lack the CaV1.2 channel in smooth muscle (sm-CaV1.2(-/-) mice) but still present in the heterozygous control mice. α1-Adrenergic contraction of vascular smooth muscle involves activation of PLD1, which controls a portion of the α1-adrenergic-induced CaV1.2 channel activity."
