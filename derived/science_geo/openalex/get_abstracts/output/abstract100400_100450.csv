https://openalex.org/W1970156673,"A high-capacity system was developed to monitor the expression of many genes in parallel. Microarrays prepared by high-speed robotic printing of complementary DNAs on glass were used for quantitative expression measurements of the corresponding genes. Because of the small format and high density of the arrays, hybridization volumes of 2 microliters could be used that enabled detection of rare transcripts in probe mixtures derived from 2 micrograms of total cellular messenger RNA. Differential expression measurements of 45 Arabidopsis genes were made by means of simultaneous, two-color fluorescence hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W4213387068,"The characteristics of an organism are determined by the genes expressed within it. A method was developed, called serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), that allows the quantitative and simultaneous analysis of a large number of transcripts. To demonstrate this strategy, short diagnostic sequence tags were isolated from pancreas, concatenated, and cloned. Manual sequencing of 1000 tags revealed a gene expression pattern characteristic of pancreatic function. New pancreatic transcripts corresponding to novel tags were identified. SAGE should provide a broadly applicable means for the quantitative cataloging and comparison of expressed genes in a variety of normal, developmental, and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2032139276,"On the basis of computational studies it has been proposed that the central nervous system internally simulates the dynamic behavior of the motor system in planning, control, and learning; the existence and use of such an internal model is still under debate. A sensorimotor integration task was investigated in which participants estimated the location of one of their hands at the end of movements made in the dark and under externally imposed forces. The temporal propagation of errors in this task was analyzed within the theoretical framework of optimal state estimation. These results provide direct support for the existence of an internal model."
https://openalex.org/W1974932989,"Nearly perfect speech recognition was observed under conditions of greatly reduced spectral information. Temporal envelopes of speech were extracted from broad frequency bands and were used to modulate noises of the same bandwidths. This manipulation preserved temporal envelope cues in each band but restricted the listener to severely degraded information on the distribution of spectral energy. The identification of consonants, vowels, and words in simple sentences improved markedly as the number of bands increased; high speech recognition performance was obtained with only three bands of modulated noise. Thus, the presentation of a dynamic temporal pattern in only a few broad spectral regions is sufficient for the recognition of speech."
https://openalex.org/W2041652393,"The complete nucleotide sequence (580,070 base pairs) of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome, the smallest known genome of any free-living organism, has been determined by whole-genome random sequencing and assembly. A total of only 470 predicted coding regions were identified that include genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism. Comparison of this genome to that of Haemophilus influenzae suggests that differences in genome content are reflected as profound differences in physiology and metabolic capacity between these two organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2048569323,"Stimulation of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) transiently increased the intracellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This increase could be blunted by increasing the intracellular concentration of the scavenging enzyme catalase or by the chemical antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. The response of VSMCs to PDGF, which includes tyrosine phosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase stimulation, DNA synthesis, and chemotaxis, was inhibited when the growth factor-stimulated rise in H2O2 concentration was blocked. These results suggest that H2O2 may act as a signal-transducing molecule, and they suggest a potential mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1522773084,"Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function, but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear. Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in mice and cultured cells. This inhibition is mediated by induction of the I kappa B alpha inhibitory protein, which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes. Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2083039650,A nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method is presented for quantitatively mapping the physical response of a material to harmonic mechanical excitation. The resulting images allow calculation of regional mechanical properties. Measurements of shear modulus obtained with the MRI technique in gel materials correlate with independent measurements of static shear modulus. The results indicate that displacement patterns corresponding to cyclic displacements smaller than 200 nanometers can be measured. The findings suggest the feasibility of a medical imaging technique for delineating elasticity and other mechanical properties of tissue.
https://openalex.org/W2008597649,"BAX, a heterodimeric partner of BCL2, counters BCL2 and promotes apoptosis in gain-of-function experiments. A Bax knockout mouse was generated that proved viable but displayed lineage-specific aberrations in cell death. Thymocytes and B cells in this mouse displayed hyperplasia, and Bax-deficient ovaries contained unusual atretic follicles with excess granulosa cells. In contrast, Bax-deficient males were infertile as a result of disordered seminiferous tubules with an accumulation of atypical premeiotic germ cells, but no mature haploid sperm. Multinucleated giant cells and dysplastic cells accompanied massive cell death. Thus, the loss of Bax results in hyperplasia or hypoplasia, depending on the cellular context."
https://openalex.org/W2032678451,"In 1990, a clinical trial was started using retroviral-mediated transfer of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into the T cells of two children with severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA− SCID). The number of blood T cells normalized as did many cellular and humoral immune responses. Gene treatment ended after 2 years, but integrated vector and ADA gene expression in T cells persisted. Although many components remain to be perfected, it is concluded here that gene therapy can be a safe and effective addition to treatment for some patients with this severe immunodeficiency disease."
https://openalex.org/W1965021019,"Local increases in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) resulting from activation of the ryanodine-sensitive calcium-release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of smooth muscle cause arterial dilation. Ryanodine-sensitive, spontaneous local increases in [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ sparks) from the SR were observed just under the surface membrane of single smooth muscle cells from myogenic cerebral arteries. Ryanodine and thapsigargin inhibited Ca2+ sparks and Ca(2+)-dependent potassium (KCa) currents, suggesting that Ca2+ sparks activate KCa channels. Furthermore, KCa channels activated by Ca2+ sparks appeared to hyperpolarize and dilate pressurized myogenic arteries because ryanodine and thapsigargin depolarized and constricted these arteries to an extent similar to that produced by blockers of KCa channels. Ca2+ sparks indirectly cause vasodilation through activation of KCa channels, but have little direct effect on spatially averaged [Ca2+]i, which regulates contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2008205524,"Marine records of African climate variability document a shift toward more arid conditions after 2.8 million years ago (Ma), evidently resulting from remote forcing by cold North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures associated with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glacial cycles. African climate before 2.8 Ma was regulated by low-latitude insolation forcing of monsoonal climate due to Earth orbital precession. Major steps in the evolution of African hominids and other vertebrates are coincident with shifts to more arid, open conditions near 2.8 Ma, 1.7 Ma, and 1.0 Ma, suggesting that some Pliocene (Plio)-Pleistocene speciation events may have been climatically mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2018562597,"The areas of the brain that mediate knowledge about objects were investigated by measuring changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET). Subjects generated words denoting colors and actions associated with static, achromatic line drawings of objects in one experiment, and with the written names of objects in a second experiment. In both studies, generation of color words selectively activated a region in the ventral temporal lobe just anterior to the area involved in the perception of color, whereas generation of action words activated a region in the middle temporal gyrus just anterior to the area involved in the perception of motion. These data suggest that object knowledge is organized as a distributed system in which the attributes of an object are stored close to the regions of the cortex that mediate perception of those attributes."
https://openalex.org/W1979815209,"Tyrosine-based signals within the cytoplasmic domain of integral membrane proteins mediate clathrin-dependent protein sorting in the endocytic and secretory pathways. A yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that bind to tyrosine-based signals. The medium chains (mu 1 and mu 2) of two clathrin-associated protein complexes (AP-1 and AP-2, respectively) specifically interacted with tyrosine-based signals of several integral membrane proteins. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding assays. Thus, it is likely that the medium chains serve as signal-binding components of the clathrin-dependent sorting machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2066271426,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency results in severe combined immunodeficiency, the first genetic disorder treated by gene therapy. Two different retroviral vectors were used to transfer ex vivo the human ADA minigene into bone marrow cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes from two patients undergoing exogenous enzyme replacement therapy. After 2 years of treatment, long-term survival of T and B lymphocytes, marrow cells, and granulocytes expressing the transferred ADA gene was demonstrated and resulted in normalization of the immune repertoire and restoration of cellular and humoral immunity. After discontinuation of treatment, T lymphocytes, derived from transduced peripheral blood lymphocytes, were progressively replaced by marrow-derived T cells in both patients. These results indicate successful gene transfer into long-lasting progenitor cells, producing a functional multilineage progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2069783643,"The global distribution of 22 potentially harmful organochlorine compounds was investigated in more than 200 tree bark samples from 90 sites worldwide. High concentrations of organochlorines were found not only in some developing countries but also in industrialized countries, which continue to be highly contaminated even though the use of many of these compounds is restricted. The distribution of relatively volatile organochlorine compounds (such as hexachlorobenzene) is dependent on latitude and demonstrates the global distillation effect, whereas less volatile organochlorine compounds (such as endosulfan) are not as effectively distilled and tend to remain in the region of use."
https://openalex.org/W2021943787,The baculovirus antiapoptotic protein p35 inhibited the proteolytic activity of human interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) and three of its homologs in enzymatic assays. Coexpression of p35 prevented the autoproteolytic activation of ICE from its precursor form and blocked ICE-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of enzymatic activity correlated with the cleavage of p35 and the formation of a stable ICE-p35 complex. The ability of p35 to block apoptosis in different pathways and in distantly related organisms suggests a central and conserved role for ICE-like proteases in the induction of apoptosis.
https://openalex.org/W2003381961,"Cdc2 is the cyclin-dependent kinase that controls entry of cells into mitosis. Phosphorylation of Cdc2 on threonine-14 and tyrosine-15 inhibits the activity of the enzyme and prevents premature initiation of mitosis. Although Wee1 has been identified as the kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine-15 in various organisms, the threonine-14-specific kinase has not been isolated. A complementary DNA was cloned from Xenopus that encodes Myt1, a member of the Wee1 family that was discovered to phosphorylate Cdc2 efficiently on both threonine-14 and tyrosine-15. Myt1 is a membrane-associated protein that contains a putative transmembrane segment. Immunodepletion studies suggested that Myt1 is the predominant threonine-14-specific kinase in Xenopus egg extracts. Myt1 activity is highly regulated during the cell cycle, suggesting that this relative of Wee1 plays a role in mitotic control."
https://openalex.org/W2118406111,"During stress, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is changed in a global fashion, leading to an increase in cardiovascular function and a release of adrenal catecholamines. This response is thought to be regulated by a common set of brain neurons that provide a dual input to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons regulating cardiac and adrenal medullary functions. By using a double-virus transneuronal labeling technique, the existence of such a set of central autonomic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem was demonstrated. These neurons innervate both of the sympathetic outflow systems and likely function in circumstances where parallel sympathetic processing occurs, such as in the fight-or-flight response."
https://openalex.org/W1989496524,"During pregnancy a semiallogeneic fetus survives despite the presence of maternal T cells specific for paternally inherited histocompatibility antigens. A mouse transgenic for a T cell receptor recognizing the major histocompatibility (MHC) antigen H-2Kb was used to follow the fate of T cells reactive to paternal alloantigens. In contrast to syngeneic and third-party allogeneic pregnancies, mice bearing a Kb-positive conceptus had reduced numbers of Kb-reactive T cells and accepted Kb-positive tumor grafts. T cell phenotype and responsiveness were restored after delivery. Thus, during pregnancy maternal T cells acquire a transient state of tolerance specific for paternal alloantigens."
https://openalex.org/W2032015542,"The genetic properties of the [URE3] non-Mendelian element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that it is a prion (infectious protein) form of Ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism. In extracts from [URE3] strains, Ure2p was partially resistant to proteinase K compared with Ure2p from wild-type extracts. Overexpression of Ure2p in wild-type strains induced a 20- to 200-fold increase in the frequency with which [URE3] arose. Overexpression of just the amino-terminal 65 residues of Ure2p increased the frequency of [URE3] induction 6000-fold. Without this ""prion-inducing domain"" the carboxyl-terminal domain performed the nitrogen regulation function of Ure2p, but could not be changed to the [URE3] prion state. Thus, this domain induced the prion state in trans, whereas in cis it conferred susceptibility of the adjoining nitrogen regulatory domain to prion infections."
https://openalex.org/W2029312116,"The effect of the v-abl oncogene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) on the Jak-STAT pathway of cytokine signal transduction was investigated. In murine pre-B lymphocytes transformed with A-MuLV, the Janus kinases (Jaks) Jak1 and Jak3 exhibited constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, and the STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) normally activated by interleukin-4 and interleukin-7 were tyrosine-phosphorylated in the absence of these cytokines. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that in these cells v-Abl was physically associated with Jak1 and Jak3. Inactivation of v-Abl tyrosine kinase in a pre-B cell line transformed with a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-abl resulted in abrogation of constitutive Jak-STAT signaling. A direct link may exist between transformation by v-abl and cytokine signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1963675471,"Tobacco and Arabidopsis plants, expressing a transgene for the calcium-sensitive luminescent protein apoaequorin, revealed circadian oscillations in free cytosolic calcium that can be phase-shifted by light-dark signals. When apoaequorin was targeted to the chloroplast, circadian chloroplast calcium rhythms were likewise observed after transfer of the seedlings to constant darkness. Circadian oscillations in free calcium concentrations can be expected to control many calcium-dependent enzymes and processes accounting for circadian outputs. Regulation of calcium flux is therefore fundamental to the organization of circadian systems."
https://openalex.org/W2160528924,"Fundamental chemical transformations for biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and nitrogen are catalyzed by sulfite and nitrite reductases. The crystallographic structure of Escherichia coli sulfite reductase hemoprotein (SiRHP), which catalyzes the concerted six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia, was solved with multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) of the native siroheme and Fe4S4 cluster cofactors, multiple isomorphous replacement, and selenomethionine sequence markers. Twofold symmetry within the 64-kilodalton polypeptide generates a distinctive three-domain alpha/beta fold that controls cofactor assembly and reactivity. Homology regions conserved between the symmetry-related halves of SiRHP and among other sulfite and nitrite reductases revealed key residues for stability and function, and identified a sulfite or nitrite reductase repeat (SNiRR) common to a redox-enzyme superfamily. The saddle-shaped siroheme shares a cysteine thiolate ligand with the Fe4S4 cluster and ligates an unexpected phosphate anion. In the substrate complex, sulfite displaces phosphate and binds to siroheme iron through sulfur. An extensive hydrogen-bonding network of positive side chains, water molecules, and siroheme carboxylates activates S-O bonds for reductive cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2016767984,"Direct inoculation of DNA, in the form of purified bacterial plasmids that are unable to replicate in mammalian cells but are able to direct cell synthesis of foreign proteins, is being explored as an approach to vaccine development. Here, a highly attenuated Shigella vector invaded mammalian cells and delivered such plasmids into the cytoplasm of cells, and subsequent production of functional foreign protein was measured. Because this Shigella vector was designed to deliver DNA to colonic mucosa, the method is a potential basis for oral and other mucosal DNA immunization and gene therapy strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1986748430,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MATa1 and MAT alpha 2 homeodomain proteins, which play a role in determining yeast cell type, form a heterodimer that binds DNA and represses transcription in a cell type-specific manner. Whereas the alpha 2 and a1 proteins on their own have only modest affinity for DNA, the a1/alpha 2 heterodimer binds DNA with high specificity and affinity. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the a1/alpha 2 homeodomain heterodimer bound to DNA was determined at a resolution of 2.5 A. The a1 and alpha 2 homeodomains bind in a head-to-tail orientation, with heterodimer contacts mediated by a 16-residue tail located carboxyl-terminal to the alpha 2 homeodomain. This tail becomes ordered in the presence of a1, part of it forming a short amphipathic helix that packs against the a1 homeodomain between helices 1 and 2. A pronounced 60 degree bend is induced in the DNA, which makes possible protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts that could not take place in a straight DNA fragment. Complex formation mediated by flexible protein-recognition peptides attached to stably folded DNA binding domains may prove to be a general feature of the architecture of other classes of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2011220564,"The accelerated pace of gene discovery and molecular medicine portend a future in which information about a plethora of disease genes can be readily obtained. As at-risk populations are identified, research can be done to determine effective prevention and treatment strategies that will lower the personal, social and perhaps the financial costs of disease in the future. We all carry genes that predispose to common illnesses. In many circumstances knowing this information can be beneficial, as it allows individualized strategies to be designed to reduce the risk of illness. But, as knowledge about the genetic basis of common disorders grows, so does the potential for discrimination in health insurance coverage for an ever increasing number of Americans."
https://openalex.org/W1985581256,"The oxidation of toluene by permanganate has been studied as a model for the oxidation of C-H bonds by metal reagents, metalloenzymes, and metal oxide surfaces. In water, the reaction proceeds by hydride (H-) transfer from toluene to a permanganate oxygen, whereas in toluene solution, permanganate abstracts a hydrogen atom (H⋅). The ability of permanganate to abstract a hydrogen atom is rationalized on the basis of the strong O-H bond formed on H⋅ addition to permanganate. This approach allows understanding and prediction of the rates of hydrogen atom transfer from substrates to metal active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2073087696,"Cell fate is determined by cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigma F after asymmetric division during sporulation by Bacillus subtilis. The activity of sigma F is governed by SpoIIAA, SpoIIAB, and SpoIIE, a membrane protein localized at the polar septum. SpoIIAB binds to and inhibits sigma F, and SpoIIAA inhibits SpoIIAB, which prevents SpoIIAB from binding to sigma F. SpoIIAB is also a serine kinase that inactivates SpoIIAA. Here, it is demonstrated that SpoIIE dephosphorylates SpoIIAA-P and overcomes SpoIIAB-mediated inhibition of sigma F. The finding that SpoIIE is a serine phosphatase links asymmetric division to the pathway governing cell-specific gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2045014974,"Recent physiological studies show that the spatial context of visual stimuli enhances the response of cells in primary visual cortex to weak stimuli and suppresses the response to strong stimuli. A model of orientation-tuned neurons was constructed to explore the role of lateral cortical connections in this dual effect. The differential effect of excitatory and inhibitory current and noise conveyed by the lateral connections explains the physiological results as well as the psychophysics of pop-out and contour completion. Exploiting the model's property of stochastic resonance, the visual context changes the model's intrinsic input variability to enhance the detection of weak signals."
https://openalex.org/W1974154835,"We have studied the roles of the homeobox genes orthodenticle (otd) and empty spiracles (ems) in embryonic brain development of Drosophila. The embryonic brain is composed of three segmental neuromeres. The otd gene is expressed predominantly in the anterior neuromere; expression of ems is restricted to the two posterior neuromeres. Mutation of otd eliminates the first (protocerebral) brain neuromere. Mutation of ems eliminates the second (deutocerebral) and third (tritocerebral) neuromeres. otd is also necessary for development of the dorsal protocerebrum of the adult brain. We conclude that these homeobox genes are required for the development of specific brain segments in Drosophila, and that the regionalized expression of their homologs in vertebrate brains suggests an evolutionarily conserved program for brain development."
https://openalex.org/W1965931492,"Furosemide, a chloride cotransport inhibitor, reversibly blocked synchronized burst discharges in hippocampal slices without reducing the pyramidal cell response to single electrical stimuli. Images of the intrinsic optical signal acquired during these slice experiments indicated that furosemide coincidentally blocked changes in extracellular space. In urethane-anesthetized rats, systemically injected furosemide blocked kainic acid-induced electrical discharges recorded from cortex. These results suggest that (i) neuronal synchronization involved in epileptiform activity can be dissociated from synaptic excitability; (ii) nonsynaptic mechanisms, possibly associated with furosemide-sensitive cell volume regulation, may be critical for synchronization of neuronal activity; and (iii) agents that affect extracellular volume may have clinical utility as antiepileptic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1971936537,"A physical map of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 4 was constructed in yeast artificial chromosome clones and used to analyze the organization of the chromosome. Mapping of the nucleolar organizing region and the centromere integrated the physical and cytogenetic maps. Detailed comparison of physical with genetic distances showed that the frequency of recombination varied substantially, with relative hot and cold spots occurring along the whole chromosome. Eight repeated DNA sequence families were found in a complex arrangement across the centromeric region and nowhere else on the chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1988000494,Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules bind peptides that are delivered from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by the MHC-encoded transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Peptide capture by immature heterodimers of class I heavy chains and beta 2-microglobulin may be facilitated by their physical association with TAP. A genetic defect in a human mutant cell line causes the complete failure of diverse class I heterodimers to associate with TAP. This deficiency impairs the ability of the class I heterodimers to efficiently capture peptides and results from loss of function of an unidentified gene or genes linked to the MHC.
https://openalex.org/W1985173600,"Conformational changes, including local protein folding, play important roles in protein-DNA interactions. Here, studies of the transcription factor Ets-1 provided evidence that local protein unfolding also can accompany DNA binding. Circular dichroism and partial proteolysis showed that the secondary structure of the Ets-1 DNA-binding domain is unchanged in the presence of DNA. In contrast, DNA allosterically induced the unfolding of an alpha helix that lies within a flanking region involved in the negative regulation of DNA binding. These findings suggest a structural basis for the intramolecular inhibition of DNA binding and a mechanism for the cooperative partnerships that are common features of many eukaryotic transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2094644908,"Asymmetric division in Bacillus subtilis generates progeny cells with dissimilar fates. SpoIIE, a membrane protein required for the establishment of cell type, was shown to localize near sites of potential polar division. SpoIIE initially localizes in a bipolar pattern, coalescing at marks in the cell envelope at which asymmetric division can take place. Then, during division, SpoIIE becomes restricted to the polar septum and is lost from the distal pole. Thus, when division is complete, SpoIIE sits at the boundary between the progeny from which it dictates cell fate by the activation of a cell-specific transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2074504531,"The activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) requires the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine (Thr160 in Cdk2) by CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Human KAP (also called Cdi1), a CDK-associated phosphatase, was shown to dephosphorylate Thr160 in human Cdk2. KAP was unable to dephosphorylate Tyr15 and only dephosphorylated Thr160 in native monomeric Cdk2. The binding of cyclin A to Cdk2 inhibited the dephosphorylation of Thr160 by KAP but did not preclude the binding of KAP to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. Moreover, the dephosphorylation of Thr160 by KAP prevented Cdk2 kinase activity upon subsequent association with cyclin A. These results suggest that KAP binds to Cdk2 and dephosphorylates Thr160 when the associated cyclin subunit is degraded or dissociates."
https://openalex.org/W1977032873,"The end states, R and T, of the allosteric transition in hemoglobin (Hb) are structurally well characterized, but there is little information on intermediate structures along the allosteric pathway. These intermediates were examined by means of time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy in the nanosecond-to-microsecond interval after HbCO photolysis. Complementary spectra of the heme group and of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues were recorded during laser excitation at 436 and 230 nanometers. These spectra reveal a sequence of interleaved tertiary and quaternary motions during the photocycle, motions involving the proximal and distal helices, and the alpha 1 beta 2 subunit interface. This sequence leads to a modified form of the T state, in which the alpha 1 beta 2 interface is deformed as a result of two carbon monoxide molecules binding to the same dimer within the tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W2007809227,"For virulence and transmission, the protozoan parasite Leishmania must assemble a complex glycolipid on the cell surface, the lipophosphoglycan (LPG). Functional complementation identified the gene LPG2, which encodes an integral Golgi membrane protein implicated in intracellular compartmentalization of LPG biosynthesis. Ipg2- mutants lack only characteristic disaccharide-phosphate repeats, normally present on both LPG and other surface or secreted molecules considered critical for infectivity. In contrast, a related yeast gene, VAN2/VRG4, is essential and required for general Golgi function. These results suggest that LPG2participates in a specialized virulence pathway, which may offer an attractive target for chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1981747897,"In mammals, odors are detected by approximately 1000 different types of odorant receptors (ORs), each expressed by a fraction of neurons in the olfactory epithelium. Neurons expressing a given OR are confined to one of four spatial zones but are distributed randomly throughout that zone. In the olfactory bulb, the axons of neurons expressing different ORs synapse at different sites, giving rise to a highly organized and stereotyped information map. An important issue is whether the epithelial and bulbar maps evolve independently or are linked, for example, by retrograde influences of the bulb on the epithelium. Here we examined the onset of expression and patterning of genes encoding ORs and sensory transduction molecules during mouse embryogenesis and in mice lacking olfactory bulbs. Our results argue for an independent development of epithelial and bulbar maps and an early functional development that may be pertinent to pattern development in the olfactory bulb."

https://openalex.org/W2030459292,"Apomyoglobin (apoMb) forms a stable compact partially folded state under acidic conditions. This {open_quotes}molten globule{close_quotes} intermediate is slightly expanded relative to the native form of the protein, with a radius of gyration (R{sub g}) of 23 ({plus_minus} 2) {Angstrom} versus 19 ({plus_minus}) {Angstrom}, and shows stable secondary structure in the A,G, and H helices. We demonstrated recently, with the use of stopped-flow circular dichroism and pulse-labeling hydrogen exchange measurements, that the earliest detectable intermediate (formed with 6 ms) in the apoMb kinetic refolding pathway closely resembles the equilibrium molten globule state populated under acid conditions. A key question remained as to how compact this kinetic intermediate is compared to the equilibrium and native states. The cooperative unfolding of the kinetic intermediate and the significant protection from amide proton exchange (as compared to corresponding isolated peptides in solution) led us to propose that the kinetic intermediate is also compact. Such a proposal could best be verified by direct determination of the size of the protein as it folds, but measurements of this nature were not feasible at the time. Newly developed improvements in time-resolved small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments allow direct measurement of the time-dependent change of R{sub g} ofmore » a protein as it folds in the millisecond to second time frame. We initiated studies of the refolding of apoMb using this technique, under conditions similar to those employed in our previous work. SAXS data collected during the first 100 ms after initiation of the refolding reaction are shown. 11 refs., 2 figs.« less"

Yeast axl1 mutants showed a defect in a-factor pheromone secretion, and a probable site of processing by Axl1p was identified within the a-factor precursor. In addition, Axl1p appears to function as a morphogenetic determinant for axial bud site selection. Amino acid substitutions within the presumptive active site of Axl1p caused defects in propheromone processing but failed to perturb bud site selection. Thus, Axl1p has been shown to participate in the dual regulation of distinct signaling pathways, and a member of the insulinase family has been implicated in propeptide processing."
https://openalex.org/W1998274407,"Chemical signals generated at synapses are highly limited in both spatial range and time course, so that experiments studying such signals must measure and manipulate them in both these dimensions. We describe an optical system that combines confocal laser scanning microscopy, to measure such signals, with focal photolysis of caged compounds. This system can elevate neurotransmitter and second messenger levels in femtoliter volumes of single dendrites within a millisecond. The method is readily combined with whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of electrical signals in brain slices. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, photolysis of caged IP3 causes spatially restricted intracellular release of Ca2+, and photolysis of a caged Ca2+ compound locally opens Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels. Furthermore, localized photolysis of the caged neurotransmitter GABA transiently activates GABA receptors. The use of focal uncaging can yield new information about the spatial range of signaling actions at synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2058716269,"In the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, initiation of DNA replication occurs at a discrete number of foci. One component of these foci is the DNA replication factor RP-A. Here, the process leading to the association of RP-A with foci was reconstituted with cytosolic fractions derived from Xenopus eggs. With the use of this fractionated system, a 170-kilodalton protein required for the assembly of RP-A into foci was identified and purified. The protein appears to be an integral component of the foci at which replication of DNA is initiated in eukaryotic nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2081346782,"The yeast MAT alpha 2 and MATa1 homeodomain proteins bind cooperatively as a heterodimer to sites upstream of haploid-specific genes, repressing their transcription. In the crystal structure of alpha 2 and a1 bound to DNA, each homeodomain makes independent base-specific contacts with the DNA and the two proteins contact each other through an extended tail region of alpha 2 that tethers the two homeodomains to one another. Because this extended region may be flexible, the ability of the heterodimer to discriminate among DNA sites with altered spacing between alpha 2 and a1 binding sites was examined. Spacing between the half sites was critical for specific DNA binding and transcriptional repression by the complex. However, amino acid insertions in the tail region of alpha 2 suppressed the effect of altering an a1/alpha 2 site by increasing the spacing between the half sites. Insertions in the tail also decreased DNA bending by a1/alpha 2. Thus tethering the two homeodomains contributes to DNA bending by a1/alpha 2, but the precise nature of the resulting bend is not essential for repression."

He argues that, in contrast to this statement being a continuation of a long-standing conflict between religion and science, religious bodies have historically been supportive of science and that new channels of communication are opening between the two communities."
