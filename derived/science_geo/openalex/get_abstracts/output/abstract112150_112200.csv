https://openalex.org/W2069953906,"Directed movement is a characteristic of many living organisms and occurs as a result of the transformation of chemical energy into mechanical energy. Myosin is one of three families of molecular motors that are responsible for cellular motility. The three-dimensional structure of the head portion of myosin, or subfragment-1, which contains both the actin and nucleotide binding sites, is described. This structure of a molecular motor was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction. The data provide a structural framework for understanding the molecular basis of motility."
https://openalex.org/W2044629144,Muscle contraction consists of a cyclical interaction between myosin and actin driven by the concomitant hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A model for the rigor complex of F actin and the myosin head was obtained by combining the molecular structures of the individual proteins with the low-resolution electron density maps of the complex derived by cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis. The spatial relation between the ATP binding pocket on myosin and the major contact area on actin suggests a working hypothesis for the crossbridge cycle that is consistent with previous independent structural and biochemical studies.

https://openalex.org/W2013755742,"Areas and pathways subserving object and spatial vision are segregated in the visual system. Experiments show that the primate prefrontal cortex is similarly segregated into object and spatial domains. Neurons that code information related to stimulus identity are dissociable, both by function and region, from those that code information related to stimulus location. These findings indicate that the prefrontal cortex contains separate processing mechanisms for remembering ""what"" and ""where"" an object is."
https://openalex.org/W2052639867,"Three DNA hypomethylation mutants of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana were isolated by screening mutagenized populations for plants containing centromeric repetitive DNA arrays susceptible to digestion by a restriction endonuclease that was sensitive to methylated cytosines. The mutations are recessive, and at least two are alleles of a single locus, designated DDM1 (for decrease in DNA methylation). Amounts of 5-methylcytosine were reduced over 70 percent in ddm1 mutants. Despite this reduction in DNA methylation levels, ddm1 mutants developed normally and exhibited no striking morphological phenotypes. However, the ddm1 mutations are associated with a segregation distortion phenotype. The ddm1 mutations were used to demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation in vivo is slow."
https://openalex.org/W2037480365,"Oncogenic Ras proteins transform animal cells to a malignant phenotype only when modified by farnesyl residues attached to cysteines near their carboxyl termini. The farnesyltransferase that catalyzes this reaction recognizes tetrapeptides of the sequence CAAX, where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a carboxyl-terminal methionine or serine. Replacement of the two aliphatic residues with a benzodiazepine-based mimic of a peptide turn generated potent inhibitors of farnesyltransferase [50 percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 1 nM]. Unlike tetrapeptides, the benzodiazepine peptidomimetics enter cells and block attachment of farnesyl to Ras, nuclear lamins, and several other proteins. At micromolar concentrations, these inhibitors restored a normal growth pattern to Ras-transformed cells. The benzodiazepine peptidomimetics may be useful in the design of treatments for tumors in which oncogenic Ras proteins contribute to abnormal growth, such as that of the colon, lung, and pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W2089889881,"Insulin-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ERKs, also known as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases] is mediated by Ras. Insulin activates Ras primarily by increasing the rate of guanine nucleotide-releasing activity. Here, we show that insulin-induced activation of ERKs was enhanced by stable overexpression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) but not by overexpression of GRB2 proteins with point mutations in the Src homology 2 and 3 domains. Moreover, a dominant negative form of Ras (with Ser17 substituted with Asn) blocked insulin-induced activation of ERKs in cells that overexpressed GRB2. GRB2 overexpression led to increased formation of a complex between the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos (the product of the mammalian homolog of son of sevenless gene) and GRB2. In response to insulin stimulation, this complex bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1) and Shc. In contrast to the activated epidermal growth factor receptor that binds the GRB2-Sos complex directly, activation of the insulin receptor results in the interaction of GRB2-Sos with IRS-1 and Shc, thus linking the insulin receptor to Ras signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2036082581,"To acquire transforming potential, the precursor of the Ras oncoprotein must undergo farnesylation of the cysteine residue located in a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide. Inhibitors of the enzyme that catalyzes this modification, farnesyl protein transferase (FPTase), have therefore been suggested as anticancer agents for tumors in which Ras contributes to transformation. The tetrapeptide analog L-731,735 is a potent and selective inhibitor of FPTase in vitro. A prodrug of this compound, L-731,734, inhibited Ras processing in cells transformed with v-ras. L-731,734 decreased the ability of v-ras-transformed cells to form colonies in soft agar but had no effect on the efficiency of colony formation of cells transformed by either the v-raf or v-mos oncogenes. The results demonstrate selective inhibition of ras-dependent cell transformation with a synthetic organic inhibitor of FPTase."

https://openalex.org/W2005400238,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. The pathways by which IL-8 activates inositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) were investigated by co-expression of different components of the guanosine triphosphate binding protein (G protein) pathway in COS-7 cells. Two distinct IL-8 receptors reconstituted ligand-dependent activation of endogenous PLC when transfected together with the G protein alpha subunits G alpha 14, G alpha 15, or G alpha 16. However, reconstitution was not observed with cells that overexpressed G alpha q or G alpha 11. Furthermore, IL-8 receptors interacted with endogenous pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins or with the recombinant G protein Gi to release free beta gamma subunits that could then specifically activate the beta 2 isoform of PLC. These findings suggest that IL-8 acts through signal-transducing pathways that are limited to specific heterotrimeric G proteins and effectors. These may provide suitable targets for the development of anti-inflammatory agents."
https://openalex.org/W1501988955,"Human 72-kDa type IV collagenase (72T4Cl) is secreted as a proenzyme that can form a specific stoichiometric complex with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases TIMP-2 via interaction with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme. Both complexed and free enzymes can be activated by treatment with organomercurials. The mechanism of the 72T4Cl activation under physiological conditions is not known. Here we describe a membrane-dependent activation of inhibitor-free 72T4Cl and identify the first conversion intermediate as a 64-kDa species resulting from cleavage of the Asn37-Leu peptide bond in the presence of plasma membranes from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced HT1080 cells. This reaction is specific for 72T4Cl in that a closely related proenzyme (92-kDa type IV collagenase) is resistant to activation under the same conditions. Formation of the 72T4Cl.TIMP-2 complex inhibits activation at the level of the initial Asn37-Leu cleavage. Addition of TIMP-1 has no effect on this reaction, but blocks the autocatalytic conversion of the Leu38 intermediate into a 62-kDa active enzyme with an amino-terminal Tyr81. Membrane-dependent activation of 72T4Cl is competitively inhibited in the presence of a 26-kDa peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme. The results suggest that interaction of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme with a membrane-associated component(s) causes initiation of enzyme activation through an autoproteolytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1987500506,"Arrestins have been implicated in the regulation of many G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Mutations in two Drosophila photoreceptor-specific arrestin genes, arrestin 1 and arrestin 2, were generated. Analysis of the light response in these mutants shows that the Arr1 and Arr2 proteins are mediators of rhodopsin inactivation and are essential for the termination of the phototransduction cascade in vivo. The saturation of arrestin function by an excess of activated rhodopsin is responsible for a continuously activated state of the photoreceptors known as the prolonged depolarized afterpotential. In the absence of arrestins, photoreceptors undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration as a result of the continued activity of the phototransduction cascade. These results demonstrate the fundamental requirement for members of the arrestin protein family in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors and signaling cascades in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1676269880,"This paper describes the purification and characterization of a sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) that recognizes the SRE-1 sequence in the 5' flanking region of the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. The protein was purified more than 38,000-fold from nuclear extracts of human HeLa cells by ion exchange, gel filtration, and DNA-affinity chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified preparation revealed a cluster of bands at 59-68 kDa, each of which bound to the SRE-1 element as revealed by cross-linking experiments. Binding of SREBP correlated perfectly with transcriptional activity in a series of 16 sterol regulatory elements with point mutations. In the LDL receptor promoter, the 10-base pair SRE-1 is embedded in a 16-base pair sequence designated Repeat 2, which is adjacent to Repeat 3, a binding site for nuclear factor Sp1. Oligonucleotides containing Repeat 2 + 3 bound SREBP and Sp1 as revealed by mobility shift assays. SREBP produced a DNase I footprint over the SRE-1 sequence, which was immediately adjacent to the footprint produced by Sp1. The current data are consistent with the concept that SREBP acts in concert with Sp1 to achieve high level, sterol-suppressible transcription of the gene for the LDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1578582539,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells using either the tumor promoter phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) or diacylglycerols increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) by 3.8-fold. PDB stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was detected within 1 min and reached a maximum within 5 min, considerably slower than PDB stimulation of 80K/MARCKS phosphorylation which was maximal within 1 min. In sharp contrast, bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK reached a maximum (8-fold stimulation) within 1 min after addition of the peptide and occurred with a half-maximal effect of 0.08 nM, 6-fold lower than the half-maximal effect of bombesin on 80K/MARCKS phosphorylation. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged treatment with PDB blocked the effect of PDB on p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation but had no effect on the response to bombesin. A selective inhibitor of PKC, GF 109203X, markedly inhibited the stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by PDB but had little effect on the response to bombesin, vasopressin, and endothelin. Bombesin stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation could also be dissociated from mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool by treatment with the tumor promoter thapsigargin completely blocked the ability of bombesin to transiently increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration but had no effect on bombesin stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, cytochalasin D, an agent which selectively disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, completely inhibited bombesin- and PDB-induced p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Within the same concentration range (0.3-2 microM), the drug had no effect on other early events stimulated by bombesin, including Ca2+ mobilization and activation of PKC. These findings demonstrate that neither the PKC nor Ca2+ pathways are responsible for the rapid stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by neuropeptide growth factors. Furthermore, the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the effects of both PDB and bombesin."
https://openalex.org/W2041497115,"The enhancer for the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene (IgH) activates a heterologous gene at the pre-B cell stage of B lymphocyte differentiation. A lymphoid-specific element, microB, is necessary for enhancer function in pre-B cells. A microB binding protein is encoded by the PU.1/Spi-1 proto-oncogene. Another sequence element, microA, was identified in the mu enhancer that binds the product of the ets-1 proto-oncogene. The microA motif was required for microB-dependent enhancer activity, which suggests that a minimal B cell-specific enhancer is composed of both the PU.1 and Ets-1 binding sites. Co-expression of both PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells trans-activated reporter plasmids that contained the minimal mu enhancer. These results implicate two members of the Ets family in the activation of IgH gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1990011421,"Mammalian striate and circumstriate cortical neurons have long been understood as coding spatially localized retinal luminance variations, providing a basis for computing motion, stereopsis, and contours from the retinal image. However, such perceptual attributes do not always correspond to the retinal luminance variations in natural vision. Recordings from area 17 and 18 neurons of the cat revealed a specialized nonlinear processing stream that responds to stimulus attributes that have no corresponding luminance variations. This nonlinear stream acts in parallel to the conventional luminance processing of single cortical neurons. The two streams were consistent in their preference for orientation and direction of motion but distinct in processing spatial variations of the stimulus attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2068958843,"During development of the nervous system, distinct populations of nerve cells extend specialized processes, axons and dendrites, over considerable distances to locate their targets. There is strong evidence for two general mechanisms by which these connections are made. The first involves attractive and repulsive interactions, both between cells and between them and their extracellular matrix. The second depends on the release of diffusible chemoattractants by target structures. Evidence is now provided for a mechanism of axon guidance in which diffusible chemorepulsive factors create exclusion zones for developing axons, causing them to turn away from inappropriate territory."
https://openalex.org/W1495390974,"Bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (LPL) induced binding, uptake, and degradation of 125I-labeled normal human triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by cultured mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors. The induction was dose-dependent and occurred whether LPL and 125I-lipoproteins were added to incubation media simultaneously or LPL was allowed to bind to cell surfaces, and unbound LPL was removed by washing prior to the assay. Lipolytic modification of lipoproteins did not appear to be necessary for increased catabolism because the effect of LPL was not prevented by inhibitors of LPL's enzymatic activity, p-nitrophenyl N-dodecylcarbamate or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. However, the effect was abolished by boiling LPL prior to the assay suggesting that major structural features of LPL were required. Also, LPL-induced binding to cells was blocked by an anti-LPL monoclonal antibody but not by antibodies that are known to block apolipoprotein E- or B-100-mediated binding to low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. This indicates that LPL itself mediated 125I-lipoprotein binding to cells. Cellular degradation of 125I-lipoproteins was partially or completely blocked by two previously described ligands for the LDL receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP): activated alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M*), and the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein. These data implicated LRP as mediating LPL-induced lipoprotein degradation and were confirmed by showing that LPL's effects were prevented by an immunoaffinity-isolated polyclonal antibody against LRP. Furthermore, LPL promoted binding of 125I-lipoproteins to highly purified LRP in a solid-phase assay. Heparin or heparinase treatment of cells markedly decreased LPL-induced binding, uptake, and degradation of lipoproteins, but had no effect on catabolism of alpha 2M*. Thus, cell-surface proteoglycans were obligatory participants in the effects of LPL but were not required for LRP-mediated catabolism of alpha 2M*. Taken together, these in vitro findings establish that through interaction with cell-surface proteoglycans, LPL induces catabolism of normal human triglyceride-rich lipoproteins via LRP."
https://openalex.org/W1584661703,"Neuronal growth is regulated by both extracellular and cellular determinants and is believed to proceed by the addition of new membrane material at the growth cone. To determine whether lipid synthesis is necessary to maintain neuronal growth, we have examined the effect of Fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthesis, on the development of cultured hippocampal neurons. Fumonisin B1 inhibits ceramide synthesis in hippocampal neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Ganglioside synthesis and content was reduced after Fumonisin B1 treatment, and ganglioside GD1b was not detectable at the cell surface by immunofluorescence. Inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis by Fumonisin B1 had a significant effect on axonal growth. Between days 2-3 in culture, mean axon length increased from 170 to 240 microns, but in Fumonisin-treated cells, no increase in axon length was observed. Addition of a fluorescent derivative of ceramide together with Fumonisin B1 reversed this effect, confirming that Fumonisin B1 acts via inhibition of ceramide synthase. Further, ceramide by itself caused a significant increase in axon length. We discuss three possible mechanisms by which inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis could disrupt axonal growth, among them the possibility that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is necessary to provide new membrane material to the growing axon."
https://openalex.org/W2036806964,"When do single cells in the early zebrafish embryo become irreversibly committed to a specific fate? Work with lineage tracing and fate mapping has shown that the marginal cells of the blastoderm give rise to hypoblast-derived fates (mesoderm and endoderm). However, experiments described here show that these marginal blastoderm cells remain pluripotent and uncommitted throughout the late blastula and early gastrula stages. Embryonic cells become committed to a hypoblast-derived fate at mid-gastrulation. Time-lapse photographic analysis reveals that committed cells, when transplanted heterotopically and heterochronically, can migrate along atypical pathways to reposition themselves within a more correct environment."
https://openalex.org/W1497990622,"In estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cells, anti-estrogens inhibit the mitogenic effect of growth factors in the absence of estrogens. As activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity is one of the first nuclear events following growth factor receptor activation, we studied the effects of estrogens and anti-estrogens on growth factor-induced AP-1 activity using transient transfection of the AP-1-responsive gene (AP-1)4-TK-CAT into MCF7 cells. The growth factor-induced AP-1 response was increased by estradiol and inhibited by anti-estrogens in conditions where growth factor-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels were unchanged by hormone and anti-hormone treatments. The same regulations were obtained when the AP-1 response was directly induced by co-transfection of c-fos and c-jun expression vectors. Co-transfection of the wild-type estrogen receptor HEGO amplified both effects. Inhibition of AP-1 activity by anti-estrogens was unlikely to be explained by the presence of residual estrogens in MCF7 cells. (i) anti-estrogens inhibited AP-1 activity in conditions where they had no effect on basal ERE-mediated activity levels, whereas estradiol was as efficient in stimulating both activities. (ii) The relative efficacy of the two anti-estrogens, OH-tamoxifen and ICI 164,384 in inhibiting these two activities was different; OH-tamoxifen was more efficient in inhibiting ERE-mediated activity, whereas ICI 164,384 was more efficient in trans-repressing AP-1-mediated activity. We conclude that in conditions where c-fos and c-jun syntheses were not affected, the estrogen receptor cooperated with growth factors to stimulate the AP-1 response when activated by estrogens but inhibited AP-1-mediated transcription when occupied by anti-estrogens."
https://openalex.org/W1498676607,"Chondroitin sulfate-rich proteoglycans secreted by arterial intima smooth muscle cells appear involved in low density lipoprotein entrapment and modification. Hypothetically, such a process may contribute to atherogenesis. We compared composition and size of those proteoglycans synthesized by proliferating and resting human arterial smooth muscle cells for which low density lipoprotein had affinity. Lipoprotein-binding proteoglycans secreted by proliferating cells were larger than those of resting cells (M(r) = 1.1 x 10(6) versus 0.8 x 10(6). This was primarily caused by increased M(r) of the chondroitin sulfate chains (6 x 10(4) versus 3.5 x 10(4)). The glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycans from both cells were made of more than 90% chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate in a 6:4 ratio. Affinity chromatography indicated that low density lipoprotein had a higher affinity with the proteoglycans synthesized by proliferating cells than those from resting cells. Measured with gel mobility shift assay, the apparent affinity constant of low density lipoproteins for proteoglycans from proliferating cells was 3-fold higher than that for proteoglycans from resting cells. This increased affinity appeared related to the higher relative proportion of proteoglycans with longer glycosaminoglycan chains secreted by the proliferating cells than those secreted by the resting cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120722077,"We reported previously that the presence of selenium in culture media of mammalian cells influences both the steady-state levels and distributions of two tRNA isoacceptors involved in the insertion of selenocysteine into protein in response to certain UGA codons. In this study, we demonstrate an increase in the levels of these isoacceptors in rats fed a selenium-adequate diet compared to animals fed a selenium-deficient diet, as well as a shift in the relative distribution toward the tRNA which elutes later from an RPC-5 column. These effects were found to occur in a tissue-specific manner. Both selenocysteine tRNAs were isolated from rat liver, sequenced, analyzed by mass spectrometry, and shown to differ only by ribose 2'-O-methylation of 5-methylcarboxymethyluridine that occurs in the wobble position of the anticodon. This modified nucleoside has been documented previously only in yeast tRNA while the corresponding 2'-O-methylribose derivative has not been observed. The structure of these nucleosides was established by mass spectrometry and confirmed by chemical synthesis. Although the role of methylation of the wobble nucleotide is not known, the differences in elution properties from RPC-5 columns are consistent with other experimental observations indicating that a change in tRNA conformation accompanies this methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1497885180,"Previously (Singer, B., and Riezman, H. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 1911-1922), we provided evidence for the existence of an endocytic intermediate(s) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is responsible for the transport of the pheromone alpha-factor from the plasma membrane to the vacuole. Here we show by kinetic analysis that the endocytic apparatus of yeast is composed of early and late endosomes, similar to what has been found in animal cells. We have developed a three-step isolation procedure to purify early and late endosomes, consisting of differential centrifugation, flotation on a Nycodenz density gradient, and sedimentation density gradient centrifugation on sucrose/D2O. Using internalized 35S-alpha-factor as a marker, the endosomal fractions were substantially enriched over other membranes, except for Golgi elements and a compartment containing binding protein. These contaminants could not be removed by other standard purification methods. We have analyzed the protein composition of our most pure early and late endosome fractions. By two-dimensional gel analysis we identified more than 20 proteins spots that are highly enriched in the early/late endosomal fractions. N-terminal protein sequencing resulted in the identification of four novel proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1534882737,"We have identified and characterized three human estrogen receptor (ER) mutants, which, at low concentrations, are capable of blocking the intracellular activity of wild type ER. The mutants, a truncated ER (ER1-530), a point mutant (L540Q), and a frameshift (S554fs), were generated by random chemical mutagenesis of the ER hormone binding domain and screened first for low activity in a yeast selection system. In transient co-transfection assays using ER-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, all three mutants exhibited less than 10% of the transcription activation activity of wild type ER, and when co-expressed with wild type ER, each of the mutants effectively suppressed the ability of wild type ER to activate transcription of an estrogen-regulated reporter plasmid. When equal amounts of plasmid encoding the ER mutants and wild type ER were used, S554fs, ER1-530, and L540Q suppressed the activity of wild type ER by 80, 55, and 75%, respectively. At a ratio of 1 part S554fs to 10 parts wild type ER, transcription was still inhibited by 40%. Western blot analysis showed that all three mutants were expressed at approximately the same level as wild type ER. Suppression of transcription was specific for ER, since the mutants did not inhibit progesterone receptor-mediated transcription. Not all mutations leading to inactive ER confer the dominant negative phenotype, as five ER mutants rendered transcriptionally inactive by point mutations between residues 516 and 524 of the ER hormone binding domain were poor inhibitors of wild type ER activity. Binding studies showed that the L540Q and S554fs dominant negative mutants bound 17 beta-estradiol with wild type affinity (Kd = 0.3-0.5 nM), whereas ER1-530 exhibited a 15-fold reduction in affinity for estradiol. The three dominant negative ERs showed significant ability to interact with the estrogen response element (ERE) in promoter interference assays, but ER1-530 and S554fs displayed little or no binding to the ERE in gel mobility shift assays where higher affinity for the DNA may be required for the receptor-ERE complex to remain associated during the electrophoresis. These data support the idea that, in all three mutants, it is loss of function of the COOH-terminal transactivation domain which leads to the dominant negative phenotype. S554fs, a powerful dominant negative mutant, is a good candidate for further studies aimed at suppressing the estrogen-dependent growth of human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999091274,"Experimental systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be induced in mice by immunization with a human monoclonal antibody to DNA that bears a common idiotype (16/6Id). These mice generate antibodies to 16/6Id, antibodies to DNA, and antibodies directed against nuclear antigens. Subsequently, manifestations of SLE develop, including leukopenia, proteinuria, and immune complex deposits in the kidney. In contrast, after immunization with 16/6Id, mice lacking major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules generated antibodies to 16/6Id but did not generate antibodies to DNA or to nuclear antigen. Furthermore, they did not develop any of the above clinical manifestations. These results reveal an unexpected function of MHC class I in the induction of autoimmune SLE."
https://openalex.org/W1492817730,"A great variety of cells, such as melanoma cells, fibroblasts, platelets, keratinocytes, and epithelial cells, adhere to and migrate on specific regions within the triple-helical domains of types I, III, and IV collagen. The relative importance of collagen primary, secondary, and tertiary structures on these cellular activities has not been ascertained, as no general synthetic methodology exists to allow for the study of peptides incorporating biologically active sequences in triple-helical conformation. We have thus developed a novel, generally applicable solid-phase branching methodology for the synthesis of aligned, triple-helical collagen-model polypeptides (i.e. mini-collagens). Three nascent peptide chains are carboxyl-terminally linked through one N alpha-amino and two N epsilon-amino groups of Lys, while repeating Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets induce triple helicity. A homotrimeric triple-helical polypeptide (THP) of 124 amino acids, incorporating residues 1263-1277 of alpha 1 (IV) collagen, was synthesized. Highly metastatic mouse melanoma cells showed a profound preference for adhesion to this THP as compared with a single-stranded peptide (SSP) incorporating the same type IV collagen sequence or a branched peptide containing eight repeats of Gly-Pro-Hyp (designated GPP*). Specifically, 50% cell adhesion occurred at a THP concentration of 1.12 microM, while comparable levels of adhesion required [SSP] = 170 microM or [GPP*] > 100 microM. Melanoma cells also spread on the THP to a greater extent than on the SSP or GPP*. These results are the first direct demonstrations of the significance of triple helicity for cell adhesion to and spreading on a specific collagen sequence and support earlier conclusions of conformational dependency for cell adhesion to and migration on types I and IV collagen. In addition, the melanoma cell THP activities support the concept that tumor cell adhesion and spreading on type IV collagen involves multiple, distinct domains in triple-helical conformation. The triple-helical peptide synthetic protocol developed here will allow eventually for the study of both structure and biological activity of specific, glycosylated collagen sequences in homotrimeric and heterotrimeric forms."
https://openalex.org/W1479988590,"The L3 immunotype lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Neisseria meningitidis was subjected to degradation procedures, which produced a number of different oligosaccharide fragments. The high resolution 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses of these oligosaccharides yielded structural information on a number of different regions of the LPS. For example, from one oligosaccharide, it was found that the endogenous sialylation of the meningococcal LPS occurs at O-3 of the terminal beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue of its lacto-N-neotetraose antenna in the alpha-D-configuration. From another, it was also established that the dominant structural feature responsible for L3 epitope specificity is the presence of a phosphorylethanolamine substituent at O-3 of the penultimate heptopyranosyl residue of its other antenna. In addition from information obtained with another oligosaccharide the structure of the 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid disaccharide region of the L3 LPS was also elucidated. From all the above cumulative data plus some published data, it was then possible to reconstruct the complete structure of the entire native L3 LPS."
https://openalex.org/W1596938063,"The beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4-GT) gene is unusual in that it specifies two mRNAs in somatic cells of 3.9 and 4.1 kilobases (kb). These two transcripts arise as a consequence of initiation at two different sets of start sites that are separated by approximately 200 base pairs. Translation of each mRNA results in the predicted synthesis of two related protein isoforms that differ only in the length of their NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Russo, R.N., Shaper, N. L., and Shaper, J.H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3324-3331). In this study we show that the cellular requirements for beta 1,4-GT correlate with the transcriptional start site used. In cells and tissues that express low transcript levels, the 4.1-kb transcriptional start site is apparently used exclusively. Increased transcription from the 4.1-kb start site plus low levels of transcription from the 3.9-kb start site result in the intermediate beta 1,4-GT transcript levels that are found in almost all somatic cell types. However, in mid- to late pregnant and lactating mammary glands very high transcript levels are observed, which correlate with the predominant use of the 3.9-kb transcriptional start site. To identify the cis-acting elements that regulate the use of the two transcriptional start sites, we constructed a series of beta 1,4-GT/CAT hybrids and carried out transient transfection assays using mouse L cells and Drosophila SL2 cells. These studies have delineated both a distal and proximal regulatory region just upstream of the 4.1- and 3.9-kb transcriptional start sites, respectively. In addition, a negative cis-acting regulatory region was identified that represses transcription from the proximal site. These results suggest a model of transcriptional regulation in which the distal region functions as a housekeeping promoter while the proximal region functions as a mammary cell-specific promoter. Differential initiation from the two promoters is a mechanism for regulation of beta 1,4-GT enzyme levels. The predictions from this model are consistent with the conclusion that both protein isoforms are functionally equivalent resident trans-Golgi membrane-bound enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1590739555,"We demonstrate that expression of yeast prepro-alpha-factor in GH3 rat pituitary cells results in its degradation in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or early Golgi compartment, suggesting that this wild-type prohormone is recognized as abnormal or misfolded in the context of a mammalian ER. In GH3 cells, as in yeast, the nascent polypeptide is efficiently targeted to the ER, where it undergoes cleavage of its amino-terminal signal peptide and core glycosylation to form glycosylated pro-alpha-factor (gp alpha f). Subsequently, however, this species disappears from cells with a half-time of 25-30 min (including a 10-20-min lag), and no alpha-factor- or proregion-derived products can be detected. Localization of the degradative process to the ER is suggested by its occurrence in the presence of brefeldin A or chloroquine and by the endoglycosidase H susceptibility of the substrate. We present evidence that Asn-linked oligosaccharide processing, which differs in extent between yeast and mammalian cells, may be an important factor in determining degradation in this heterologous circumstance. When GH3 cells are treated with deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of ER alpha-mannosidases, gp alpha f is essentially stable, suggesting that trimming of core oligosaccharides below Man8 (a process that does not occur in yeast) strongly promotes proteolysis. Inhibition of ER glucosidase activity by treatment with deoxynojirimycin, by contrast, considerably accelerates the disappearance of gp alpha f (t1/2 = 8-10 min). These data indicate that cell type-specific post-translational modifications of a secretory glycoprotein can substantially modify its recognition by the mammalian ER degradative apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1566004432,"Phagocytic white blood cells contain a multicomponent oxidase that generates microbicidal products by catalyzing electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen. Activation of this oxidase requires interactions of a unique membrane flavocytochrome with the cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, and p21Rac. This flavocytochrome, designated cytochrome b558, is a heteromer comprising a 22-kDa alpha-subunit (p22phox) and a glycosylated approximately 91-kDa beta-subunit (gp91phox). Cytochrome b558 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses carrying cDNAs for p22phox and gp91phox. Membranes of these cells contained a b-type cytochrome with a dithionite-reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum similar to that of neutrophil cytochrome b558. The recombinant cytochrome b558 beta-subunit was heterogeneously N-glycosylated as demonstrated by its susceptibility to cleavage with endoglycosidases F and H. In contrast to the neutrophil cytochrome b558, a portion of the N-linked oligosaccharide was of the high mannose type. Recombinant cytochrome b558 supported superoxide production in a cell-free assay containing recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and p21Rac. The enzymatic turnover of the partially purified recombinant cytochrome b558 and neutrophil cytochrome b558 were similar (approximately 100-160 mol of superoxide generated/s/mol of cytochrome heme, range of two experiments) and the native and recombinant cytochromes showed similar requirements for NADPH and exogenous FAD. These studies represent the first reconstitution of the NADPH oxidase solely from recombinant proteins and define a model system to explore the structure and function of cytochrome b558."
https://openalex.org/W1519570339,"A chimeric toxin has been constructed by fusion of a gene encoding human interleukin 4 (hIL4) to a gene encoding a mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) which cannot bind to its receptors (PE4E). The chimeric gene was expressed in Escherichia coli where large amounts of the chimeric toxin, hIL4-PE4E, was produced. Purified hIL4-PE4E was very cytotoxic to cancer cell lines of both hematopoietic and solid tumor origin. In the HUT 102 T cell leukemia and Daudi B cell lymphoma cell lines, protein synthesis was inhibited by 50% (ID50) at a hIL4-PE4E concentration of 2 and 7 ng/ml (25 and 86 pM, respectively). hIL4-PE4E was also very cytotoxic to cell lines derived from carcinomas of the colon, breast, stomach, liver, adrenals, and prostate, as well as melanoma and epidermoid carcinoma, indicating that hIL4 receptors are widely expressed on human malignancies. We also found that human phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes were extremely sensitive to hIL4-PE4E with an ID50 of 0.2 ng/ml (2.5 pM). The cytotoxic action of hIL4-PE4E was specific because it was blocked by an excess of hIL4 and not of human interleukin 2. In addition, hIL4-PE4ED553, an enzymatically inactive form of the chimeric toxin, was not cytotoxic. These results suggest that the hIL4 receptor may be a target for therapy in malignant and immunologic disorders using hIL4 chimeric toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1574286840,"Op18 is a widely expressed, cell cycle-regulated, phosphoprotein involved in signal transduction of a variety of stimuli. In actively proliferating Jurkat T cells which express Op18 at high level, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment induces a rapid increase in the level of several Op18 phosphorylated forms. To determine phosphorylation sites involved in the PMA effect, the major Op18 phosphorylated forms were resolved in Jurkat T cells, before and after treatment with PMA, using preparative immobilized pH gradient-based two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tryptic fragments of phosphorylated Op18 were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer peptide mapping and were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography prior to analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation sites were identified by further treatment of the proteolytic fragments with different enzymes and determination of the mass shifts by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Two major phosphorylation sites were identified. Low constitutive levels of phosphorylation at Ser25 and Ser38 in Op18a and Op18b was demonstrated. Treatment with PMA resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Ser25 in Op18a and of both Ser25 and Ser38 in Op18b. Taken together with prior studies of Op18 phosphorylation, the data suggest that Op18 phosphorylation occurs at identical sites in different tissues and organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1535517127,"The phosphate-binding domain of the ATP-binding site of tobacco Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) activase was elucidated by photo-affinity labeling with a monoanhydride of ADP with N-(4-(benzoyl)phenylmethyl)phosphoramide ([gamma-32P]ATP gamma BP). Covalent incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP gamma BP into the 42-kDa Rubisco activase subunit was dependent upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. Photolabelling of Rubisco activase with ATP gamma BP exhibited saturation kinetics; the apparent Kd for photolabeling was 5 microM. Two lines of evidence showed that ATP gamma BP modified Rubisco activase at the ATP-binding domain. First, physiological concentrations of ATP and ADP afforded complete protection against photolabeling of Rubisco activase by ATP gamma BP. Second, photolysis of Rubisco activase in the presence of ATP gamma BP decreased both the ATPase and the Rubisco activating activities. Inactivation of enzyme activity was dependent on ATP gamma BP concentration and could be prevented by including ADP during photolabeling. The region of Rubisco activase that was modified by ATP gamma BP was identified by isolating photolabeled peptides. Sequence analysis showed that ATP gamma BP modified Rubisco activase in two distinct regions; one region, S117-A136, is adjacent to the P-loop and the other region, V223-T234, exhibits homology to a region of adenylate kinase that ligates the essential metal ion. Photolabeling of these two regions of Rubisco activase was consistent with modification of the ATP gamma-phosphate-binding domain of Rubisco activase with ATP gamma BP."
https://openalex.org/W1571264094,"When expressed alone in fibroblasts, approximately 80% of newly made H2b subunits of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor are retained and degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas about 20% reaches the plasma membrane (1). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ER Ca2+ ATPase, blocks ER folding of the H1 (2) as well as of the H2b subunit, prevents maturation of H2b, and accelerates ER degradation of newly made H2b. The secretory pathway is normal in thapsigargin-treated cells, as monitored by maturation of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The protease inhibitors TLCK and TPCK block the first step in ER degradation of H2, an endoproteolytic cleavage just exoplasmic to the membrane-spanning domain. In protease inhibitor-treated cells, the approximately 80% of H2b that would normally be degraded remains in the ER; as judged by migration on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis this H2b is improperly folded. Thus, incorrectly folded H2b is normally subjected to ER degradation. In the presence of thapsigargin H2b cannot fold properly and is degraded within the ER. The preferential ER degradation of misfolded or unfolded membrane proteins demonstrated here, functions as a step in ER quality control."
https://openalex.org/W1555581044,"The Arg191-His305-Arg308 (the RHR triad) and Tyr343 of Flp site-specific recombinase correspond to the invariant tetrad residues of the integrase family of proteins. Flp mutants altered at these positions are blocked at the strand cleavage or the strand exchange step of recombination. Hybrid half-site-recombinase complexes formed by step-arrest mutants of Flp have revealed that an Flp monomer occupying a half-site does not cleave that half-site but rather cleaves a half-site occupied by a second Flp monomer. This trans-DNA cleavage is neatly accommodated by a model in which an Flp active site is assembled by contribution of amino acid residues from at least two protein monomers. Using a combination of wild type Flp, single, double, and triple step-arrest Flp mutants, critical predictions of the fractional active-site model have been verified. First, a wild type monomer paired with an RHR triad-Tyr343 double mutant is a catalytically inactive combination. Second, each pairwise combination of a single, double, or triple RHR mutant with Flp (Y343F) yields approximately equivalent levels of catalytic complementation. Half-site to half-site and half-site to full-site crosses suggest that execution of a strand transfer event within a half-site and between a half-site and a full site requires dimeric and tetrameric Flp configurations, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1633855707,"Circular single-stranded phage M13 DNA is used as a template for complementary strand synthesis in cytosolic extracts from proliferating HeLa cells. DNA synthesis is initiated by one or maximally two priming events and typically leads to covalently closed double-stranded reaction products. When carried out in the presence of the nuclear chromatin assembly factor CAF-1, complementary strand synthesis is accompanied by nucleosome assembly. This novel system is very useful for the study of basic biochemical aspects concerning the assembly of nucleosomes. The activity of CAF-1 completely depends on complementary strand synthesis and acts stoichiometrically to promote the assembly of nucleosomes in a noncooperative manner. Apparently, CAF-1 activity is coupled to DNA synthesis via a structural feature of replicating DNA, most likely its partial single strandedness."
https://openalex.org/W1597870924,"Two targeted photoaffinity cross-linking reagents, the monoanhydride of 8-N3ADP with N-(4-(benzoyl)phenylmethyl)phosphoramide ([gamma-32P]8-N3ATP gamma BP) and the monoanhydride of 8-N3GDP with N-(4-(benzoyl)phenylmethyl)-phosphoramide ([gamma-32P]8-N3GTP gamma BP), were developed for studying the inter- and intramolecular interactions of nucleotide-binding proteins. Experiments using these bidentate reagents with two photoactive groups led to specific cross-linking: [gamma-32P]8-N3GTP gamma BP and [gamma-32P]8-N3ATP gamma BP showed intersubunit cross-linking of glutamate dehydrogenase and [gamma-32P]8-N3GTP gamma BP appeared to cross-link the alpha- and beta-subunits of tubulin. The non-azido versions of these reagents, the monoanhydride of ADP with N-(4-(benzoyl)phenylmethyl)-phosphoramide ([gamma-32P]ATP gamma BP) and the monoanhydride of GDP with N-(4-(benzoyl)phenylmethyl)-phosphoramide ([gamma-32P]GTP gamma BP), were also synthesized and characterized. The ability of these monodentate reagents with one photoactive group to serve as photoaffinity probes was established by photolabeling specifically the exchangeable GTP-binding domain of tubulin with [gamma-32P]GTP gamma BP and the ATP-binding domain of purified adenylate kinase and several nucleotide-binding proteins in human brain homogenate with [gamma-32P]ATP gamma BP."
https://openalex.org/W1489490454,"The action of phospholipase C (PLC) from Bacillus cereus on phosphatidylglycerol (PG), derived from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC), was examined in an ether-water mixture. The PLC cleavage of PG and PC followed a Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent Vmax values per 1 microgram enzyme of 0.26 and 0.91 mumol.min-1 and Km values of 10 and 12 mM, respectively. When the same enzymic reaction was carried out in minimally buffered aqueous solution of 1% Triton X-100, the decrease in pH with respect to phospholipid cleavage was as expected with PC but much less pronounced with PG. This could be accounted for by the formation of a cyclic glycerophosphate, rather than alpha-glycerophosphate, in the PLC hydrolysis of PG. Examination of the chemical nature of the water-soluble product of PG by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) revealed a single band at 2.31 ppm, while the bands of alpha-glycerophosphate and beta-glycerophosphate appeared at 5.12 and 4.57 ppm, respectively. Basic hydrolysis of the phospholipase cleavage product of PG (0.1 M NaOH for 1 min at 80 degrees C) followed by neutralization shifted its 31P NMR band to 5.18 ppm, which practically coincided with that of alpha-glycerophosphate. Analogous experiments were carried out with PG labeled with 3H at the carbon 2 of the glycerol headgroup ([3H]PG). Autoradiography of thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the [3H]PG enzymic hydrolyzate displayed a single 3H-labeled compound, which could be converted to alpha-glycerophosphate by basic hydrolysis. These results strongly suggest that the phosphate headgroup of PG is cleaved off by PLC as 1,3-cyclic glycerophosphate. A series of PLC experiments with phosphatidyl dihydroxyacetone and phosphatidyl 1,3-propanediol as model substrates supported this assignment. Two-dimensional homonuclear 1H NMR correlated spectra as well as infrared spectra carried out on the isolated sodium salt of this product could further confirm such a structure. The unique structure and chemical nature of 1,3-cyclic glycerophosphate may bear a distinct physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W1559781420,"Since antibody against homogeneous mung bean glucosidase II cross-reacted with a 110-kDa protein from cultured soybean cells and also precipitated this activity from extracts of soybean cells, we used this antibody to examine the biosynthesis, turnover, and cellular localization of glucosidase II in soybean cells. Time course studies of [35S]methionine incorporation into glucosidase II (as well as pulse-chase studies) showed that this enzyme is synthesized as a 110-kDa protein that does not change in size from very early labeling times to those as late as 60 h, indicating the absence of a cleavable signal sequence or extensive modification of the carbohydrate. Furthermore, glucosidase II remained susceptible to digestion by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H throughout this time period, and the major oligosaccharide structure was a Man9(GlcNAc)2 with small amounts of Glc1Man9(GlcNAc)2. The half-life of the biosynthesized glucosidase II was about 36 h, and no secretion of this protein occurred. Membranes of gently disrupted cells were separated by sucrose-density gradient centrifugation, and fractions were tested for glucosidase II activity as well as for marker enzymes. The bulk of the glucosidase II activity fractionated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Detergent solubility studies with Triton X-114 suggested that glucosidase II did not have a hydrophobic domain and is probably a luminal endoplasmic reticulum protein."
