https://openalex.org/W2044282102,"Elucidating how and to what extent CpG islands (CGIs) are methylated in germ cells is essential to understand genomic imprinting and epigenetic reprogramming. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first integrated epigenomic analysis of mammalian oocytes, identifying over a thousand CGIs methylated in mature oocytes. We show that these CGIs depend on DNMT3A and DNMT3L but are not distinct at the sequence level, including in CpG periodicity. They are preferentially located within active transcription units and are relatively depleted in H3K4me3, supporting a general transcription-dependent mechanism of methylation. Very few methylated CGIs are fully protected from post-fertilization reprogramming but, notably, the majority show incomplete demethylation in embryonic day (E) 3.5 blastocysts. Our study shows that CGI methylation in gametes is not entirely related to genomic imprinting but is a strong factor in determining methylation status in preimplantation embryos, suggesting a need to reassess mechanisms of post-fertilization demethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2149924247,"Permanent damage to white matter tracts, comprising axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes, is an important component of brain injuries of the newborn that cause cerebral palsy and cognitive disabilities, as well as multiple sclerosis in adults. However, regulatory factors relevant in human developmental myelin disorders and in myelin regeneration are unclear. We found that AXIN2 was expressed in immature oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OLPs) in white matter lesions of human newborns with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic and gliotic brain damage, as well as in active multiple sclerosis lesions in adults. Axin2 is a target of Wnt transcriptional activation that negatively feeds back on the pathway, promoting β-catenin degradation. We found that Axin2 function was essential for normal kinetics of remyelination. The small molecule inhibitor XAV939, which targets the enzymatic activity of tankyrase, acted to stabilize Axin2 levels in OLPs from brain and spinal cord and accelerated their differentiation and myelination after hypoxic and demyelinating injury. Together, these findings indicate that Axin2 is an essential regulator of remyelination and that it might serve as a pharmacological checkpoint in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2145707775,"Genome-wide association studies have identified 32 loci influencing body mass index, but this measure does not distinguish lean from fat mass. To identify adiposity loci, we meta-analyzed associations between ∼2.5 million SNPs and body fat percentage from 36,626 individuals and followed up the 14 most significant (P < 10(-6)) independent loci in 39,576 individuals. We confirmed a previously established adiposity locus in FTO (P = 3 × 10(-26)) and identified two new loci associated with body fat percentage, one near IRS1 (P = 4 × 10(-11)) and one near SPRY2 (P = 3 × 10(-8)). Both loci contain genes with potential links to adipocyte physiology. Notably, the body-fat-decreasing allele near IRS1 is associated with decreased IRS1 expression and with an impaired metabolic profile, including an increased visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, risk of diabetes and coronary artery disease and decreased adiponectin levels. Our findings provide new insights into adiposity and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2077182790,"Ciliogenesis precedes lineage-determining signaling in skin development. To understand why, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of seven intraflagellar transport proteins (IFTs) and conditional ablation of Ift-88 and Kif3a during embryogenesis. In both cultured keratinocytes and embryonic epidermis, all of these eliminated cilia, and many (not Kif3a) caused hyperproliferation. Surprisingly and independent of proliferation, ciliary mutants displayed defects in Notch signaling and commitment of progenitors to differentiate. Notch receptors and Notch-processing enzymes colocalized with cilia in wild-type epidermal cells. Moreover, differentiation defects in ciliary mutants were cell autonomous and rescued by activated Notch (NICD). By contrast, Shh signaling was neither operative nor required for epidermal ciliogenesis, Notch signaling, or differentiation. Rather, Shh signaling defects in ciliary mutants occurred later, arresting hair follicle morphogenesis in the skin. These findings unveil temporally and spatially distinct functions for primary cilia at the nexus of signaling, proliferation, and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1990668812,"Naturally simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected sooty mangabeys do not progress to AIDS despite high-level virus replication. We previously showed that the fraction of CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells is lower in sooty mangabeys compared to humans and macaques. Here we found that, after in vitro stimulation, sooty mangabey CD4(+) T cells fail to upregulate CCR5 and that this phenomenon is more pronounced in CD4(+) central memory T cells (T(CM) cells). CD4(+) T cell activation was similarly uncoupled from CCR5 expression in sooty mangabeys in vivo during acute SIV infection and the homeostatic proliferation that follows antibody-mediated CD4(+) T cell depletion. Sooty mangabey CD4(+) T(CM) cells that express low amounts of CCR5 showed reduced susceptibility to SIV infection both in vivo and in vitro when compared to CD4(+) T(CM) cells of rhesus macaques. These data suggest that low CCR5 expression on sooty mangabey CD4(+) T cells favors the preservation of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis and promotes an AIDS-free status by protecting CD4(+) T(CM) cells from direct virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054172399,"There is emerging evidence that people with successfully treated HIV infection age prematurely, leading to progressive multi-organ disease, but the reasons for this are not known. Here we show that patients treated with commonly used nucleoside analog anti-retroviral drugs progressively accumulate somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, mirroring those seen much later in life caused by normal aging. Ultra-deep re-sequencing by synthesis, combined with single-cell analyses, suggests that the increase in somatic mutation is not caused by increased mutagenesis but might instead be caused by accelerated mtDNA turnover. This leads to the clonal expansion of preexisting age-related somatic mtDNA mutations and a biochemical defect that can affect up to 10% of cells. These observations add weight to the role of somatic mtDNA mutations in the aging process and raise the specter of progressive iatrogenic mitochondrial genetic disease emerging over the next decade."
https://openalex.org/W2069985409,"Several methods for characterizing DNA-protein interactions are available, but none have demonstrated both high throughput and quantitative measurement of affinity. Here we describe 'high-throughput sequencing'-'fluorescent ligand interaction profiling' (HiTS-FLIP), a technique for measuring quantitative protein-DNA binding affinity at unprecedented depth. In this approach, the optics built into a high-throughput sequencer are used to visualize in vitro binding of a protein to sequenced DNA in a flow cell. Application of HiTS-FLIP to the protein Gcn4 (Gcn4p), the master regulator of the yeast amino acid starvation response, yielded ~440 million binding measurements, enabling determination of dissociation constants for all 12-mer sequences having submicromolar affinity. These data revealed a complex interdependency between motif positions, allowed improved discrimination of in vivo Gcn4p binding sites and regulatory targets relative to previous methods and showed that sets of genes with different promoter affinities to Gcn4p have distinct functions and expression kinetics. Broad application of this approach should increase understanding of the interactions that drive transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1984071991,"Mammalian genomes contain numerous regulatory DNA sites with unknown target genes. We used mice with an extra β-globin locus control region (LCR) to investigate how a regulator searches the genome for target genes. We find that the LCR samples a restricted nuclear subvolume, wherein it preferentially contacts genes controlled by shared transcription factors. No contacted gene is detectably upregulated except for endogenous β-globin genes located on another chromosome. This demonstrates genetically that mammalian trans activation is possible, but suggests that it will be rare. Trans activation occurs not pan-cellularly, but in ‘jackpot’ cells enriched for the interchromosomal interaction. Therefore, cell-specific long-range DNA contacts can cause variegated expression. How regulatory elements spatially interact with their target DNA sequences is unclear. The β-globin locus control region (LCR) is found to take part in interchromosomal interactions with a few genes controlled by shared transcription factors, and to transcriptionally upregulate β-globin mRNA in a subset of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2156576798,"In response to cellular insult, several pathways can be activated, including necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Because glucocorticoids (GCs) have been shown to induce both osteocyte apoptosis and autophagy, we sought to determine whether osteocyte cell fate in the presence of GCs was dose dependent by performing in vivo and in vitro studies. Male Swiss-Webster mice were treated with slow-release prednisolone pellets at 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 mg/kg/d for 28 d. An osteocyte cell line, MLO-Y4 cells, was treated with various doses of dexamethasone. We found that GC treatments dose dependently decreased activation of antioxidant-, autophagy-, and antiapoptosis-focused RT-PCR gene pathways in mouse cortical bone. The activation of antioxidant genes was correlated with autophagy gene expression after the GC treatments. The presence of osteocyte autophagy, as detected by immunostaining for LC3, increased ∼50% at the distal femur cortical bone region but not at trabecular bone region at the 1.4 and 2.8 mg/kg/d GC dose levels. The number of apoptotic osteocytes was increased at the cortical bone region by ∼40% initially observed at the 2.8 mg/kg/d dose level. In addition, the presence of the osteocyte autophagy was associated with an increased protein level of cathepsin K in vitro after the GC treatments. In summary, we found that GC treatment dose-dependently decreased antioxidant gene expression, with lower GC doses activating autophagy, whereas a higher dose increased apoptosis. These data suggest that autophagy may provide a mechanism for osteocytes to survive the stress after GC exposure and provide further insight into how GCs alter bone cell fate."

Single-stranded DNA coated with replication protein A often mediates this recruitment (12Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Kinase reactions were performed as described previously (3Mordes D.A. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Cortez D. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Ball H.L. Ehrhardt M.R.

To identify phosphorylation sites on ATR, we purified endogenous ATR from HU-treated HeLa cells using a single-step immunoprecipitation. We separated the ATR protein from associated proteins by gel electrophoresis and subjected it to in-gel digestion followed by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry. This method identified several phosphorylation sites, including Ser-428 and Thr-1989 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). A phosphopeptide-specific antibody to ATR Ser-428 is available commercially (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). However, no data has been published to indicate how this site is regulated, what kinase is responsible, or whether it is functionally significant. Our data indicate that it is not a useful marker for active ATR because it does not correlate with ATR activity (supplemental Fig. 1). Phosphoproteomic screens also previously identified Thr-1989 as a phosphorylated residue (39Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M. Gnad F. Oppermann F.S. Körner R. Greff Z. Kéri G. Stemmann O. Mann M. Mol.

Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10762-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Thr-1989 is within the ATR FAT domain, which is composed of HEAT repeats and is generally highly conserved among ATR orthologues. However, sequence alignment revealed that Thr-1989 is only conserved in primates, changed to a serine in rodents, and not conserved in frogs or flies (Fig. 1B). The amino acids flanking Thr-1989 are also poorly conserved. To characterize phosphorylation of Thr-1989 further, we generated a phosphopeptide-specific antibody (pATR). This antibody recognizes an ATR peptide phosphorylated at position Thr-1989 but not the corresponding unmodified peptide (supplemental Fig. 2). The antibody recognizes ATR on immunoblots following immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). It is specific to ATR because excision of the floxed allele from ATRflox/−TR cells eliminated reactivity. Attempts to detect phosphorylated ATR by immunoblotting without prior immunoprecipitation were unsuccessful because of a cross-reacting protein near the same molecular weight as ATR. Treating cells with HU increased Thr-1989 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Time course experiments with HU, UV radiation, and ionizing radiation revealed increased phosphorylation of Thr-1989 in response to all of these agents within 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2C). We consistently observed the ∼2-fold induction of ATR phosphorylation in cells treated with HU for 1 h (Fig. 2D). A commonly used marker of ATR activation is phosphorylation of the ATR substrate CHK1. Although CHK1 Ser-317 and ATR Thr-1989 are both phosphorylated within 1 h of HU, UV, or IR exposure, CHK1 phosphorylation did not substantially increase at later times. In contrast, Thr-1989 phosphorylation continued to increase at least until 3 h after treatment (Fig. 2C). Importantly, λ phosphatase abolished detection of DNA damage-induced Thr-1989 phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). To determine whether the pATR antibody is specific to phosphorylated Thr-1989, we assessed its recognition of an ATR T1989A mutant protein. In contrast to wild-type ATR, the antibody did not recognize an HU-inducible phosphorylation on the ATR T1989A protein (Fig. 2F). We did note some residual antibody recognition of a protein at the molecular weight of ATR after immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ATR T1989A (Fig. 2F). To further characterize the Thr-1989 dependence of the antibody, we generated ATRflox/−TR cells stably expressing FLAG-HA-ATR or FLAG-HA-ATR T1989A, immunopurified these proteins, and blotted with the phosphorylation-specific antibody. In these circumstances there was significant recognition of the wild-type protein immunoprecipitated from HU-treated cells but no HU-inducible recognition of the T1989A mutant (Fig. 2G). We conclude that the antibody is largely specific to phosphorylated Thr-1989 and that Thr-1989 is hyperphosphorylated when ATR is activated. The antibody may have some cross-reactivity to another phosphoepitope on ATR that is not regulated in response to HU. ATM and DNA-PK undergo autophosphorylation, and ATR can autophosphorylate in vitro (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Most characterized ATM, DNA-PK, and ATR phosphorylation sites are Ser or Thr followed by Gln. Thr-1989 does not fit this consensus. However, there are several characterized ATM and DNA-PK autophosphorylation sites that also fail to conform to this consensus sequence (41Neal J.A. Dang V. Douglas P. Wold M.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Kozlov S.V. Graham M.E. Jakob B. Tobias F. Kijas A.W. Tanuji M. Chen P.

Therefore, we tested whether Thr-1989 phosphorylation in cells depends on ATR kinase activity. First, we assayed whether a kinase-dead ATR mutant can be phosphorylated on Thr-1989. Unlike wild-type ATR, the kinase-dead mutant did not exhibit HU-inducible Thr-1989 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). We next used small molecule inhibitors to the PIKK family of kinases. Selective ATM and DNA-PK inhibitors did not reduce Thr-1989 phosphorylation following HU treatment (Fig. 3B). However, the non-selective ATR and ATM inhibitor caffeine significantly decreased Thr-1989 phosphorylation in HU-treated cells and inhibited ATR signaling as measured by CHK1 phosphorylation. Finally, an agent that selectively inhibits ATR (AZ20) but not DNA-PK or ATM also abrogates HU-induced Thr-1989 phosphorylation on both exogenous (Fig. 3C) and endogenous ATR (D). These results indicate that Thr-1989 phosphorylation in cells requires ATR kinase activity. Immunopurified ATR·ATRIP complexes failed to phosphorylate a small, recombinant ATR fragment containing Thr-1989 purified from Escherichia coli. We also failed to observe a significant increase in Thr-1989 phosphorylation on purified full-length ATR subjected to in vitro conditions that allow autophosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, it remains possible that the in vivo dependence on ATR kinase activity is due to an ATR-activated kinase rather than autophosphorylation. However, treating cells with a selective CHK1 inhibitor did not significantly impair HU-induced Thr-1989 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 3) indicating if another kinase is involved, it is not CHK1-dependent. Unlike ATRIP Ser-224 phosphorylation (35Myers J.S. Zhao R. Xu X. Ham A.J. Cortez D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6685-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), treatment with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine also had no effect on Thr-1989 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 3). ATM and DNA-PK activation and autophosphorylation require their protein activators MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 and KU70/80, respectively (43Lovejoy C.A. Cortez D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, we first sought to determine whether Thr-1989 phosphorylation requires the ATR activator TOPBP1 (21Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Transfection with TOPBP1 siRNA alone caused increased Thr-1989 phosphorylation even in the absence of a DNA damaging agent. This level of phosphorylation did not change upon addition of HU and remained below the level seen in HU-treated cells transfected with a control non-targeting siRNA (supplemental Fig. 4). We were unable to achieve complete knockdown of TOPBP1 in these experiments and could still detect significant CHK1 phosphorylation in HU-treated TOPBP1 siRNA cells (supplemental Fig. 4). The incomplete silencing of TOPBP1 expression and increased basal Thr-1989 phosphorylation but lack of HU-inducible phosphorylation makes this siRNA experiment difficult to interpret. As an alternative approach, we examined Thr-1989 phosphorylation on the ATR PRD mutant, which contains the point mutation K2589E. This mutation disrupts the ability of ATR to interact with and be activated by TOPBP1 while retaining basal ATR kinase activity (3Mordes D.A. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Cortez D. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The ATR-PRD mutant is not phosphorylated on Thr-1989 in response to HU (Fig. 4A), suggesting that Thr-1989 phosphorylation depends on activation of ATR. Because Thr-1989 phosphorylation depends on ATR activation, phosphorylation is unlikely to be required for the activation process, and an ATR T1989A mutant should still be activated by TOPBP1 in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we assayed whether the AAD of TOPBP1 could activate immunopurified wild-type, T1989A, and T1989E ATR·ATRIP complexes. All three of these proteins were activated to similar extents by increasing concentrations of the GST-AAD protein but not by GST (Fig. 4B). A GST-TOPBP1 protein containing the AAD and the C-terminal BRCT domains of TOPBP1 also activated all three proteins (Fig. 4C). Therefore, at least under these in vitro conditions, Thr-1989 phosphorylation does not impact TOPBP1-mediated ATR activation. To examine the functional relevance of Thr-1989 phosphorylation, we employed a genetic complementation strategy (supplemental Fig. 5) using ATRflox/− cells harboring one conditional allele of ATR and a second allele disrupted by a neomycin cassette (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These cells were also engineered to express the tetracycline repressor, creating the parental ATRflox/−TR cell line. We then integrated either WT or ATR T1989A mutant expression vectors containing a tetracycline response promoter, creating the WT-ATRflox/−TR and T1989A-ATRflox/−TR cell lines. ATR cDNAs also contain an N-terminal FLAG-HA3 epitope tag to differentiate exogenous and endogenous proteins. After selection, we screened stable integrants for inducible expression of the ATR protein and selected only clones expressing similar protein levels for further analysis. In addition, we verified that the percentage of cells expressing tagged ATR in each clone was similar using immunofluorescence (Fig. 5A). We also confirmed that the tagged protein correctly localized to the nucleus and can localize to stalled replication forks in response to HU-treatment (Fig. 5B). This analysis confirms that the T1989A mutation does not interfere with the ATR-ATRIP complex, because ATRIP association is required for both the stability and localization of ATR (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 44Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments, we characterized two independent mutant cell lines to account for any possible clonal differences. Infecting the parental ATRflox/−TR cells with an adenovirus encoding the Cre recombinase nearly ablated ATR protein expression within 4 days post-infection (Fig. 5C). Tetracycline-induced expression of the exogenous ATR cDNAs restored ATR expression with both WT-ATR and T1989A-ATR expressed at similar levels (Fig. 5C). To compare the signaling activities of the T1989A and WT ATR proteins, we deleted the floxed allele, expressed the WT or T1989A mutant, and treated the cells with HU. Deletion of ATRflox in the parental cell line attenuates CHK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 5 and 13). WT-ATR restored CHK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, lane 14). Similarly, both T1989A-ATR clones also supported ATR-dependent CHK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, lanes 15 and 16), suggesting that Thr-1989 phosphorylation is not required for ATR signaling in response to replication stress. ATR promotes completion of DNA synthesis following an HU challenge (8Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). To test whether Thr-1989 phosphorylation regulates this activity, we monitored completion of DNA replication following a transient exposure to HU. After Cre-deletion of the floxed allele, both WT-ATR and T1989A-ATR cells have similar distributions of cells in each cell cycle phase (Fig. 5D). HU synchronizes the cells in early S-phase. Cre-infected parental ATRflox/−TR cells are unable to complete S-phase when released from the HU arrest. In contrast, both WT-ATRflox/−TR and T1989A-ATRflox/−TR cells complete replication with similar kinetics (Fig. 5D).

However, ABS-like phenotypes have also been reported in response to fluconazole, an inhibitor of fungal CYP51 used to treat fungal infections. High-dose fluconazole exposure during early pregnancy resulted in inhibition of the CYP51A1 gene product and ABS-like defects in four reported cases (11Lee B.E. Feinberg M. Abraham J.J. Murthy A.R.K.

To test whether Cyp51 deficiency can cause an ABS-like phenotype, and to assess the phenotypic effects of CYP51 ablation, we generated a Cyp51−/− mouse knock-out model. Cyp51 knock-out mice show ABS-like features with skeletal and cardiac malformations leading to embryonic lethality in the late-midgestation period. As the most likely downstream molecular mechanisms, we identified alterations in the SHH and RA signaling pathways. The Cyp51 homology arm fragments for the targeting construct were isolated from the bacterial artificial chromosome clone 519E21 that was identified in the mouse bacterial artificial chromosome library prepared from 129/Sv genomic DNA (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The targeting construct also contained a thymidine kinase negative selection cassette, a phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin positive selection cassette flanked by FRT sites (FRT-neo-FRT) inserted in intron 3, and loxP sites together with a new HindIII restriction site in introns 2 and 4 (Fig. 1A). The linearized construct was electroporated into ES cells isolated from mouse strain 129 (19Magin T.M. McWhir J. Melton D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3795-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After double selection with G418 and ganciclovir, targeted clones carrying the Cyp51flox-FRT-neo allele were identified using PCR in the 3LoxP, 5LoxP, and neo region as shown in Fig. 1A (primers used for genotyping: 3loxF, 5′-AACATAGCCCACTTTAAGCA-3′; 3loxR, 5′-TTCCGCACCTACTGTATTTT-3′; 5loxF, 5′-CAGACTTGATGGCAAGAGAT-3′; 5loxR, 5′-TTAGCTTTAGTCCGTTGCTC-3′; 3NeoF, 5′-AGGATTGGGAAGACAATAGC-3′; 3NeoR, 5′-CTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAG-3′; 5NeoF, 5′-CTGATCTTTGCTGTTGTGG-3′; 5NeoR, 5′-CTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAG-3′). Homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B) on HindIII- and BamHI-digested ES clone genomic DNA using probes located outside the 5′ and 3′ homology arms. Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP in a random priming reaction using the RediPrime II DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin cassette was excised from the Cyp51flox-FRT-neo ES clones by electroporating a eukaryotic expression vector encoding the FLP recombinase to generate a conditional Cyp51flox allele. Correct excision of the selection cassette in ES cells was confirmed by PCR (using the 5Neo and 3Neo primer pairs) and sequencing across all important elements. Mouse chimeras were generated by injecting two independently targeted Cyp51flox ES clones into C57BL/6JOlaHsd (C57BL/6; Harlan, Italy) mouse blastocysts. Heterozygous Cyp51+/flox offspring were backcrossed to C57BL/6 for at least four generations to generate the transgenic line B6;129SVCyp51tm1Bfro. The Cyp51flox allele was detected in segregating progeny by PCR from ear clips using the 3loxF and 3loxR primers (Fig. 1C). The knock-out mouse line B6;129SVCyp51tm1.1Bfro carrying the Cyp51− allele lacking exons 3 and 4 was generated by crossing homozygous Cyp51flox/flox females with transgenic males carrying EIIa-Cre (strain B6.FVB-Tg(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd/J, Jackson Laboratories). To obtain knock-out embryos, F1 Cyp51+/− mice were set up for mating at the end of the light cycle period. The day a vaginal plug was detected was designated embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Pregnant females at E9.5, E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, and E14.5 were sacrificed with cervical dislocation, and embryos were isolated in PBS. After photographing, leg tissue of the embryos was dissected away for PCR genotyping (Fig. 1, D and E), and the rest of the embryos were processed for paraffin embedding using standard protocols. Subsequent sections (5 μm) were used for hematoxylin and eosin staining and histology analysis. Alcian staining of E14.5–E15.0 embryos was performed as previously described (20Jegalian B.G.

The Chi-square test was used to compare the observed frequencies in genotypic classes with the expected 1:2:1 F2 Mendelian ratio.

Immunohistological studies using paraffin sections of staged mouse embryos were performed according to our previously published protocols (21Wagner N. Wagner K.D. Theres H. Englert C. Schedl A. Scholz H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using a goat polyclonal anti-platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or mouse monoclonal anti-connexin-43 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). BrdU incorporation as a measure of cell proliferation was detected as described (22Wagner K.D. Wagner N. Bondke A. Nafz B. Flemming B. Theres H. Scholz H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis was performed as described (21Wagner N. Wagner K.D. Theres H. Englert C. Schedl A. Scholz H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For in situ hybridization experiments, the GenPointTM Amplified Detection System (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was employed using a previously described protocol (24Wagner K.D. Wagner N. Wellmann S. Schley G. Bondke A. Theres H. Scholz H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1364-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All plasmids for SHH pathway in situ hybridization probes were kindly provided by G. Fishell. Quantitative analysis of nine cholesterol precursors and sterols was performed on F2 embryos of all three genotypes at E12.5 and E14.5 using a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric method exactly as described (25Acimovic J. Lovgren-Sandblom A. Monostory K. Rozman D. Golicnik M. Lutjohann D. Bjorkhem I. J. Chromatogr. B. 2009; 877: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Frozen E14.5 embryos were pulverized and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). The homogenate was centrifuged 15 min at 500 × g and 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged 15 min at 45,000 × g and 4 °C. The pelleted membrane fraction was resuspended in resuspension buffer (75 mm Tris, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture). Total protein was measured using the Bradford assay and 40 μg of total protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Isolated recombinant bovine CYP51A (55 kDa, ortholog of human CYP51A1 and mouse CYP51) was used as a positive control. Samples were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE for 60 min at 120 V and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) for 2 h at 200 mA (Bio-Rad). After blocking overnight with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBST containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 2 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-CYP51 antibodies (1:500) and anti β-actin antibodies (1:200, Sigma). The anti-CYP51 antibody against the CYP51 peptide QRLKDSWAERLDFNPDRY recognizes several mammalian CYP51 proteins. 4D. Rozman, M. Cotman, K. Fon-Tacer, and M. Seliskar, unpublished data. After three washes for 10 min each in PBST, the membrane was incubated for 2 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase, diluted 1:2000 with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST. The membrane was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL) and detected with a camera (Fujifilm LAS-400, Valhalla, NY). Total RNA was extracted from embryos or embryo hearts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (2.5 or 1 (in hearts) μg) was treated with amplification grade DNase I, and reverse transcribed with the SuperScript® VILOTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 detection system using SYBR Green I Master, Probes Master for SYBR Green, or TaqMan chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Primers were designed using the Primer Express 1.5 software and validated for PCR efficiency. PCR was performed with the following PCR parameters: 95 °C for 10 min, then 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 s for 45 cycles plus a dissociation step (60–95 °C). The relative expression ratios were calculated as described (26Vandesompele J. De Preter K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van Roy N. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0034)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin β (Actb), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt1) or Actb, ribosomal protein, large, P0 (Rplp0), UTP6, small subunit processome component, homolog (yeast) (Utp6c) were selected as described (27Kosir R. Acimovic J. Golicnik M. Perse M. Majdic G. Fink M. Rozman D. BMC Mol. Biol. 2010; 11: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and used as internal reference genes in embryo hearts and whole embryos, respectively. RNAs for three different mouse Cyp51 exons were also quantified using TaqMan® Assay-on-Demand gene expression assays and a β-actin TaqMan Pre-Developed Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used as internal controls. Relative expression was calculated with the standard ΔΔCt method and analyzed with GraphPad software. The list of primers and pre-developed assays used in quantitative RT-PCR is provided under supplemental Tables S2 and S3. We generated a conditional knock-out Cyp51tm1Bfro allele of the mouse Cyp51 gene, referred to here as the Cyp51flox allele (MGI: 4357830), by placing two loxP sites in introns 2 and 4 of Cyp51 (Fig. 1). A deletion of exons 3 and 4 should shift the reading frame in the Cyp51 transcript generating a premature stop codon and truncated CYP51 protein. There is no evidence for alternative splicing of Cyp51 or multiple CYP51 proteins in mice or other mammals, although an additional transcript in the testis arising from alternative poly(A) signal selection does exist in several mammalian species. Our knock-out strategy was designed to create null alleles for both the somatic and the shorter testis-specific transcript, because both Cyp51 poly(A) signals are located downstream from the chosen recombination event in exons 3 and 4. Germline founders carrying the Cyp51flox allele were backcrossed to C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice for at least four generations and then to the EIIa-Cre deleter line mice to generate knock-out Cyp51tm1.1Bfro allele mice, referred to here as the Cyp51− allele (MGI: 4836362). Heterozygous Cyp51+/− mice were intercrossed to obtain homozygous Cyp51−/− knock-out embryos. To test the pattern of RNA transcription from the Cyp51 knock-out allele in various parts of the Cyp51 locus, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with probes covering exons 1–2, 3–4, and 8–9 in embryos at E12.5 and E14.5 (Fig. 2A). Cyp51−/− embryos did not express exons 3 and 4, as expected, given that this segment should have been deleted. From the knock-out allele, there was ∼30% transcription of non-coding exons 1 and 2, and 20% of exons 8 and 9 compared with the 100% wild-type allele transcription level. However, as deletion of exons 3 and 4 generates a premature stop codon, any remnant read-through transcription would generate a truncated transcript, as well as a protein devoid of the cysteine-binding site in exon 10 that is crucial for CYP51 activity. Our Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B) supports the above Cyp51 mRNA analysis and demonstrates that there is no immunodetectable CYP51 protein, even in the truncated form, in Cyp51−/− embryos. Therefore, our assays at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels demonstrate that gene targeting was successful in generating a complete loss of function Cyp51 allele. We quantified mRNA expression of 11 genes from the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and nine intermediates from lanosterol to cholesterol. A deletion of one functional Cyp51 allele in embryos at E14.5 resulted in a statistically significant decrease of Cyp51 mRNA, whereas other cholesterogenic genes did not differ significantly between heterozygotes and wild-type (Fig. 3A). The sterol measurements in embryos at the same stage corroborate the above mRNA analyses in heterozygous embryos (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, in Cyp51−/− embryos, where both Cyp51 alleles were nonfunctional, expression of all cholesterogenic genes except 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr7) was significantly increased. The major accumulating sterol in Cyp51−/− embryos was confirmed to be 24,25-dihydrolanosterol. Cholesterol synthesis intermediates downstream of the CYP51 reaction step were not detected in Cyp51−/− embryos (Fig. 3B) demonstrating that a complete block in the cholesterol synthesis pathway occurred in Cyp51−/− knockouts. These embryos nevertheless contained measurable amounts of the final product, cholesterol, although significantly less than wild-type and heterozygotes. RNA expression analyses and sterol measurements showed similar trends at stage E12.5 (data not shown). No viable Cyp51−/− mice were identified among 185 weaned progeny derived from heterozygous matings. The ratio of Cyp51+/+ and Cyp51+/− adult mice did not deviate significantly from the expected 1:2 Mendelian ratio indicating that lethality did not occur among heterozygotes. To determine the developmental stage of lethality, embryos were genotyped at seven different embryonic stages from E9.5 to E15.5 (Table 1). The results presented in Table 1 were pooled for two lines derived from two independently targeted embryonic stem cell clones, as both lines gave identical outcomes (supplemental Table S1). Genotype ratios from E9.5 to E14.5 were in accordance with the expected F2 Mendelian ratios. At stage E15.5, however, all Cyp51−/− embryos were in an advanced stage of resorption. Examples of embryos in earlier stages of resorption from different developmental points are presented under supplemental Fig. S1. As the majority of Cyp51−/− embryos at E13.5 and E14.5 (37 out of 41) still had a beating heart, whereas none could be noted at E15.5, we conclude that lethality of the Cyp51−/− embryos occurred at E15. Loss of Cyp51 function resulted in several developmental malformations. Knock-out embryos were first distinguished at E10.5 by kinked, shortened tails (arrow in Fig. 4A) and embryos displayed an increased nuchal translucence most clearly distinguished at E14.5. Severe cases of nuchal translucence were accompanied by hematomas in the dorsolateral and pericardial regions (Fig. 4B). Transverse histological sections of nuchal regions demonstrated a highly expanded jugular lymph sac, up to 20 times larger compared with wild-type structures (Fig. 5A). Close examination of endothelial cells lining the lymph sacs showed no obvious changes in endothelial cell morphology, but an increase in the number of surrounding smooth muscle cells (Fig. 5B). Skeletal abnormalities assessed at E14.5 exhibited shortened fore and hind limbs in all examined specimens (micromelia). The radius and tibia were bowed and synostosis of the femur and tibia was observed (Fig. 4D). Tarsal and carpal elements were underdeveloped and distal phalanges were absent. Compared with the forelimbs, the abnormalities in hind limbs were more pronounced and variable in severity between Cyp51−/− embryos (Fig. 4C). Forelimbs displayed digital joint contractures (campodactyly) resulting in soft tissue syndactyly of the second and third fingers. A differential phenotype between the left and right hind limbs appeared in approximately half of embryos. The third distal tarsal element was absent from both hind limbs resulting in syndactyly of the second and third metatarsal bones on the left foot and the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones on the right foot. Bone syndactyly of the second and third right metatarsus was complete, whereas the fourth metatarsus was joined only proximally. Proximal hind limb phalanges bifurcated and formed additional fingers (Fig. 4E). Histological examination of embryos from different stages revealed an absence of the palatal shelf cartilage resulting in cleft palate (Fig. 4F). Knock-out embryos also exhibited some craniofacial abnormalities, including brachycephaly, micrognathia (shortened mandible), and shortened or absent tongue (Fig. 4, F and G).TABLE 1Genotype frequency analysis of F2 offspring from Cyp51+/− heterozygote crossesEmbryo age+/++/−−/−Totalp (chi square)ResorbedaGenotyping of most embryos in advanced stages of resorption was ambiguous because of small amount and degraded DNA and hence no genotype could be ascribed.E9.505380.2532E10.5183017650.8129E11.5194022810.8898E12.53277281370.30914E13.5193917750.8926E14.53260241160.53710E15.58200280.00817Postnatal6312201853.95 × 10−14NAbNA, not applicable.a Genotyping of most embryos in advanced stages of resorption was ambiguous because of small amount and degraded DNA and hence no genotype could be ascribed.b NA, not applicable.

In addition, Cyp51−/− embryos exhibited increased nuchal translucence that has been frequently associated with congenital heart defects or underdevelopment of the lymphatic system resulting in overdistension of the jugular lymphatic sacs in humans (reviewed in Ref. 28Hyett J.A. Prenat. Diagn. 2002; 22: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In agreement with the human situation, we observed a dramatic jugular lymph sac extension in the knock-out embryos (Fig. 5A). Whole mount analysis of the hearts at E14.5 revealed smaller hypoplastic hearts with dilation of the atria, a very prominent interventricular groove, which might result from abnormal development of the interventricular septum, but normal structure and positioning of the great arteries (Fig. 5C). Histological analysis of embryos at E12.5, E13.5, and E14.5 confirmed hypoplastic development of ventricles and showed enlarged endocardial cushion tissues in the knock-out embryos compared with wild-type littermate embryos (Fig. 5D). In serial transversal sections, we noted ventricle septum defects in the knock-out embryos at E14.5, which were further confirmed under high-power magnification by the presence of blood cells in the communicating opening between ventricles (arrow in Fig. 5E). Examination under high-power magnification supported not only the hypoplastic myocardium at E14.5 (arrows in Fig. 5F), but also revealed epicardial defects between E12.5 and E14.5 with a partial lack of cells in the epicardial layer. To investigate the potential underlying causes for the hypoplastic heart development, we analyzed proliferation and apoptosis. Proliferation was reduced in knock-out hearts at E12.5 (Fig. 6A), which became even more pronounced at E14.5 (Fig. 6B), whereas apoptosis was not different between wild-type and knock-out hearts at the investigated time points (data not shown). As histological analysis revealed abnormalities in the myocardium and epicardium, qRT-PCR analyses of several genes involved in epicardial-myocardial signaling (29Olivey H.E. Svensson E.C. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 818-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were performed. We found significantly decreased expression of retinoic X receptors (Rxra) and retinoic acid receptors (Rara) in knock-out hearts at E12.5 and E14.5 and of NK2 transcription factor related, locus 5 (Drosophila) (Nkx2–5) at E14.5. No significant change in expression levels was noted for forkhead box C1 (Foxc1), Wilms tumor 1 homolog (Wt1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa), or nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 2 (Nr1h2) (Fig. 6E).

In this report, we describe the reconstitution of the human four-subunit Pol ϵ and characterization of its catalytic properties in comparison with Pol α and Pol δ. Human Pol ϵ holoenzyme is a monomeric complex containing stoichiometric subunit levels of p261/Pol 2, p59, p17, and p12. We show that the Pol ϵ p261 N-terminal catalytic domain is solely responsible for its ability to catalyze DNA synthesis. Importantly, human Pol (hPol) ϵ was found more processive than hPol δ in supporting proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent elongation of DNA chains, which is in keeping with proposed roles for hPol ϵ and hPol δ in the replication of leading and lagging strands, respectively. Furthermore, GINS, a component of the replicative helicase complex that is composed of Sld5, Psf1, Psf2, and Psf3, was shown to interact weakly with all three replicative DNA Pols (α, δ, and ϵ) and to markedly stimulate the activities of Pol α and Pol ϵ. In vivo studies indicated that siRNA-targeted depletion of hPol δ and/or hPol ϵ reduced cell cycle progression and the rate of fork progression. Under the conditions used, we noted that depletion of Pol ϵ had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on cellular DNA replication than depletion of Pol δ. We suggest that reduction in the level of Pol δ may be less deleterious because of its collision-and-release role in lagging strand synthesis.

Macneill S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The initiation of DNA replication is catalyzed by the Pol α-primase complex, composed of the Pol α complex (p180-p70) associated with the primase complex (p58-p48). Primase synthesizes short oligoribonucleotide primers (∼10–15 nt) on both DNA strands at replication origins that are elongated (to ∼30–40 nt) by Pol α. The resulting primed templates are recognized by the RFC-PCNA complex, which displaces the Pol α-primase complex and catalyzes PCNA loading onto both strands. PCNA acts as a sliding clamp and tethers Pol δ and Pol ϵ to primed templates and increases their processivity. Recent studies suggest that Pol ϵ catalyzes leading strand synthesis, whereas Pol δ supports lagging strand replication (2Pursell Z.F. Isoz I. Lundström E.B. Johansson E. Kunkel T.A.

This proposed asymmetric distribution was based on genetic observations showing that mutations of the 3′ → 5′ proofreading activities of Pol δ and Pol ϵ affected opposite DNA strands (2Pursell Z.F.

Cell. 2008; 30: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Moreover, budding yeast containing either the error-prone Pol δ or Pol ϵ accumulated mutations in the lagging or leading strand, respectively (3Nick McElhinny S.A. Gordenin D.A. Stith C.M. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In both budding and fission yeasts, lagging strand maturation appears to require Pol δ but not Pol ϵ (summarized in Ref. 6Kang H.Y. Choi E. Bae S.H. Lee K.H. Gim B.S. Kim H.D. Park C. MacNeill S.A.

Although the mechanism contributing to the selective actions of Pol δ and Pol ϵ at the replication fork remains to be precisely defined, it is likely that factors within the replisome complex play a governing role in these processes. The initiation of eukaryotic replication is a stepwise process that is presently best understood in budding yeast (7Remus D. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this model system, replication is initiated by converting origins into prereplication complexes containing the ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm2–7 complex. Prereplication complexes are activated at the G1-S phase of the cell cycle by the marked increase in the levels of the S phase cyclin-dependent kinases and the Dbf4-dependent protein kinase activities. Cyclin-dependent kinase-phosphorylated Sld2 and Sld3 mediate interactions with Dpb11, Cdc45, Pol ϵ, and GINS, which are required for the concomitant interaction of Cdc45 and GINS with the Dbf4-dependent protein kinase-activated Mcm2–7 complex. These transactions are poorly understood and probably require additional proteins (minimally including Mcm10 and Ctf4) (8Wang J. Wu R. Lu Y. Liang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 395: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Im J.S. Ki S.H. Farina A. Jung D.S. Hurwitz J. Lee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, a prevailing thought is that these multifaceted protein-protein interactions result in the formation of the functional replicative helicase complex known as CMG, which contains Cdc45, Mcm2–7, and GINS, originally isolated from Drosophila (13Moyer S.E. Lewis P.W. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10236-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The CMG complex forms the core of a large macromolecular complex, the replisome progression complex (RPC), which includes a number of proteins that play roles in checkpoint regulation, nucleosome reorganization, cohesion, and DNA repair as well as replication (14Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Importantly, the RPC translocates with replication forks, and this movement, as well as the integrity of the complex, is lost following the targeted degradation of a single subunit component of the CMG complex (15Kanemaki M. Labib K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1753-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To date, Pol α appears to be the only replicative polymerase associated stably with the RPC, and this association is dependent on Ctf4 (16Gambus A. van Deursen F. Polychronopoulos D. Foltman M. Jones R.C. Edmondson R.D. Calzada A. Labib K. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2992-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the association of Pol δ and Pol ϵ with the RPC is likely to be weak and/or transient. In budding yeast, it has been reported that Pol ϵ associates with the preinitiation complex prior to Pol α (17Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 18Muramatsu S. Hirai K. Tak Y.S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pol ϵ is a component of a preloading complex (composed of Sld2, Dpb11, Pol ϵ, and GINS) (18Muramatsu S. Hirai K. Tak Y.S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that it interacts with a number of critical components involved in the generation of the preinitiation complex, particularly the four-subunit GINS complex. The replication protein Dpb11 was discovered because of its ability to suppress mutations of the Pol ϵ subunit Dpb2 (p59); the Sld proteins (Sld2, Sld3, and Sld5 (a subunit of the GINS complex)) were discovered because they suppressed mutations in Dpb11 (19Araki H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that in addition to its role as a Pol, Pol ϵ and its subunits may act as a scaffolding complex to help position other replication proteins prior to the initiation of replication. In contrast to our understanding of the initiation of replication in budding yeast, information about this process in higher eukaryotes is less advanced. Recent reports, however, identified higher eukaryotic homologs of the budding yeast Sld2 (RecQL4) (21Sangrithi M.N. Bernal J.A. Madine M. Philpott A. Lee J. Dunphy W.G. Venkitaraman A.R.

Cell. 2010; 140: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although the complete characterization of these proteins remains to be carried out, their action resembles that of their budding yeast homologs, suggesting that events leading to the DNA initiation may be similar in yeasts and higher eukaryotes. In this report, we describe the reconstitution and characterization of the human four-subunit Pol ϵ complex (p261-p59-p17-p12) as well as a number of its subcomplexes using the baculovirus-insect cell system. Like the budding yeast homolog, the holocomplex of hPol ϵ is monomeric, as are all other Pol ϵ complexes examined. All Pol ϵ preparations required PCNA and RFC for DNA synthesis on a singly primed M13 template, and hPol ϵ appears to be more processive than hPol δ. In addition, both hPol ϵ and hPol δ are stimulated by the GINS complex. Collectively, the in vitro properties of hPol ϵ described here are in keeping with it acting as a processive polymerase capable of supporting leading strand replication. We also examined the role of Pol δ and Pol ϵ in cell cycle progression and fork movement by siRNA-targeted depletion. Reduction of either Pol δ or Pol ϵ by 90% caused cells to traverse the S phase more slowly than control cells. These depleted cells also exhibited reduced rates in DNA replication fork movement. Under the conditions used, Pol ϵ depletion had more pronounced inhibitory effects in DNA replication in comparison with depletion of Pol δ. These findings are consistent with the expectation that Pol ϵ plays a critical role in governing leading strand synthesis. The cDNAs expressing DNA Pol ϵ subunits p59 (GenBankTM accession number NM_002692), p17 (GenBankTM accession number BC003166), and p12 (GenBankTM accession number NM_019896) were PCR-amplified from a HeLa cDNA library and subcloned into pET28a (Novagen), pFastBac1 (Invitrogen; for baculovirus expression of untagged proteins), and pFastBacHtbFLAG. All cDNAs were sequenced to verify that no mutations were introduced during PCR and cloning. The baculoviruses were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The baculovirus expressing the large catalytic subunit, p261, was a generous gift from Dr. S. Linn (University of California, Berkeley, CA) (24Li Y. Asahara H. Patel V.S. Zhou S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32337-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GINS subunits were cloned as previously described (25Chang Y.P. Wang G. Bermudez V. Hurwitz J. Chen X.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12685-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). hDNA Pol α-primase complex, hPol δ, hPCNA, and hRFC were prepared as indicated (26Bermudez V.P. Farina A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9493-9505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells (1.15 × 109 cells, 500 ml) grown in suspension culture in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 27 °C were infected with viruses expressing Pol ϵ subunits at multiplicities of infection of 2.5. Two days after infection, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS (yielding 9 ml of cells), and resuspended in 18 ml of Hypotonic Buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease inhibitors (2 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain and 0.1 mm benzamidine)). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization (Pestle B, 20 strokes). The mixture was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl and centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (23 ml, 191 mg of protein) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in QD25 buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm PMSF/protease inhibitors). The dialyzed material (16 ml, 155 mg of protein) was centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and applied to a 10-ml Q-Sepharose column (10 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with QD25 buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of Q25 buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of QE300 buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Elution of bound Pol ϵ was monitored by Coomassie Blue staining, Western blotting, and DNA synthesis assays using poly(dA)4000-oligo(dT)12–18 as the primer-template (1 unit = 1 nmol of nucleotide incorporation in 30 min at 37 °C). FLAG-M2 beads (2.0 ml of 50% suspension; Sigma) were added to fractions containing Pol ϵ (50 ml, 8.82 mg of protein, 3740 units, and 424 units/mg protein) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. The beads were washed three times with 10 ml of FLAG buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), and bound proteins were eluted with FLAG buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml FLAG3 peptide, yielding 0.98 mg of protein (2.5 ml, 2795 units, 2852 units/mg protein). Aliquots of the FLAG peptide eluate (0.2 ml) were layered onto a 5-ml 15–40% glycerol gradient (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors), and the mixture was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube; proteins and Pol ϵ activity were monitored by 10% SDS-PAGE and the poly(dA)4000-oligo(dT)12–18 assay, respectively. The coincidental peak of protein and Pol activity from the glycerol gradient was pooled. If all of the FLAG-eluted material were subjected to the glycerol gradient sedimentation step, 0.43 mg of protein (specific activity, 7552 units/mg) would have been obtained. The fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The hydrodynamic properties of the Pol ϵ complexes were determined as described previously (27Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Subcomplexes of Pol ϵ were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with viruses containing the indicated subunits and purified as described for the isolation of the holocomplex. After glycerol gradient centrifugation, protein yields of 0.67, 0.43, 0.30, 0.18, and 0.37 mg were obtained of the complexes p261-p59, p261-p12, p261-p17, p261FL, and p261N (aa 1–1305), respectively, from 0.5 liter of Sf9. The p59 subunit, which binds to the C terminus of p261, enhanced both the solubility and activity of the p261 subunit, as did truncation of p261 subunit to the p261N product. The four-subunit S. cerevisiae Pol ϵ was isolated as described by Chilkova et al. (28Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing these subunits were generously supplied by Dr. E. Johansson (Umea University, Sweden). Coupled in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) reactions followed by antibody precipitations were carried out to determine subunit interactions and assembly of the holoenzyme. Following the manufacturer instructions for the Promega TNT Quick in vitro transcription/translation system, three pET plasmids (0.25 mg), each expressing a different Pol ϵ subunit, were incubated with 40 μl of TNT Quick rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with 30 μCi of [35S]methionine and 1 μg of a purified FLAG-tagged DNA pol ϵ subunit that was not expressed by the pET plasmids. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) were incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C followed by the addition of 50 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science). After an additional 10-min incubation, reactions were divided into two 20-μl aliquots, and 30 μl of 50% FLAG-M2 beads were added to each aliquot. To one aliquot, 2.5 μl of 20 mg/ml FLAG3 peptide was added and labeled as “(+) peptide.” One hour after incubation at 4 °C with constant agitation, beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1% BSA and then twice with immunoprecipitation buffer alone; the beads were then resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to detect the radiolabeled Pol ϵ subunit adsorbed to the FLAG beads. A suspension culture of Sf9 cells (250 ml, 1.2 × 105 cells) was infected with viruses expressing hGINS subunits (Sld5, Psf2, Psf1, and Psf3). The Sld5 subunit was expressed with a FLAG tag. Two days after infection, cells were centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells (5 ml) were resuspended in 20 ml of Hypotonic Buffer supplemented with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, incubated on ice for 10 min, and lysed by Dounce homogenization (Pestle B, 20 strokes). The lysate was adjusted to 0.5 m potassium glutamate and centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C; the supernatant (27.5 ml; 227 mg of protein) was adjusted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and mixed with FLAG-M2 beads (1 ml, Sigma); and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. The beads were then washed with 14 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m potassium glutamate, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, PMSF, and protease inhibitors) for 15 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 600 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The collected beads, following three washes with wash buffer, were eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml FLAG3 peptide, yielding 2.3 mg of protein (2 ml). An aliquot (0.2 ml, 1.84 mg/ml) of the FLAG3 peptide-eluted material was layered onto 10 tubes containing a 5-ml 15–40% glycerol gradient (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 0.15-ml fractions were collected, and 20-μl samples were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The stoichiometric GINS complex peaked in the aldolase region (150 kDa); these fractions were pooled (>90% homogeneous, 1.2 ml, 3.08 mg of total protein), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. High Five insect cells (3 × 107 cells/T-150 flask) were grown as a monolayer in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 27 °C. Cells were infected with viruses expressing Pol α-primase subunits (or those of Pol δ or Pol ϵ) and the subunits of GINS at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 for each virus. The Sld5 subunit of GINS contained a Precission (GE Healthcare) cleavable GST tag. Two days after infection, cells (0.2 ml) were collected, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of Hypotonic Buffer. The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and lysed by Dounce homogenization (20 strokes). The sodium glutamate concentration of lysates was adjusted to 0.3 m, and extracts were centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Nonidet P-40 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1%. Lysates were divided into two identical aliquots (1 mg, 0.1 ml) and supplemented with DNase I (50 μg) and Benzonase (500 units) to completely digest contaminating DNA (as well as chromatin). Precission protease (10 units), which cleaved the GST tag from Sld5, was added to one aliquot and labeled “(−) control.” More than 95% of GST-Sld5 was digested by the protease (data not shown). Glutathione-Sepharose (50 μl; Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. The glutathione beads were centrifuged at 600 × g for 30 s at 4 °C, and the bound material was washed three times with 500 μl of wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.3 m sodium glutamate, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors). Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer, and 20 μl of the eluted proteins were subjected 10% SDS-PAGE analyses. Proteins were visualized by Western blotting using specific antibodies to detect Pol and GINS subunits. Reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 50 μm [α32-P]dTTP (3400 cpm/pmol), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 0.2 m sodium glutamate (not added with Pol δ), 6 nm RFC, 100 nm hPCNA, 350 nm Escherichia coli SSB, 25 μm (as nucleotides) poly(dA)4000-oligo(dT)12–18 (20:1), and variable levels of Pols were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and nucleotide incorporation was measured. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm [α-32P]dATP (1–2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 120 μm each of dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 10 nm hRFC, 100 nm PCNA, and a level of Pols as indicated. Following 20 min at 37 °C, aliquots were used to measure nucleotide incorporation and the size of DNA products following alkaline-agarose electrophoresis and autoradiography (or phosphorimaging). HeLa cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Duplex small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (21 bp) with 3′-dU overhangs targeting hPol ϵ (p261 subunit), hPol δ (p125 subunit), and a random sequence (AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT), which acted as a negative control, were synthesized by Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). siRNA sequences targeting hPol ϵ were GCG AGG AAC AGG CGA AAU A (siRNA ϵ#05), GGA GGA GGG UGC UUC GUA U (siRNA ϵ#06), GGA CAG GCG UUA CGA GUU C (siRNA ϵ#07), and CUC GGA AGC UGG AAG AUU A (siRNA ϵ#08); siRNA sequences targeting hPol δ were AGU UGG AGA UUG ACC AUU A (siRNA δ#06), CGA GAG AGC AUG UUU GGG U (siRNA δ#07), GCA AAG GCA UCU UCC CUG A (siRNA δ#08), and GCA CAG AAA CUG GGC CUG A (siRNA δ#09). Transfections were carried out as described previously (26Bermudez V.P. Farina A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9493-9505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). siRNAs were introduced into cells at a final concentration of 50 nm. Flow cytometry and DNA fiber analyses 48 h post-transfection were as described (26Bermudez V.P. Farina A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9493-9505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For synchronization, cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h and then washed in PBS, grown in fresh medium for 9 h, and incubated for an additional 16 h in 2 mm thymidine. siRNAs were added before the first thymidine arrest. Cells were released after the second arrest into complete medium containing 40 ng/ml nocodazole for the length of time indicated. Pol ϵ is essential for replication and cell growth. It is highly conserved in yeast, Xenopus, and humans and contains a large catalytic subunit and three small subunits. The large catalytic subunit, Pol 2, is divided into two regions, the N-terminal catalytic (aa 1–1305) and the C-terminal non-catalytic domains (aa 1306–2286). The N-terminal catalytic region includes the conserved Pol and exonuclease motifs, whereas the C-terminal non-catalytic region contains binding sites for the small subunits (Fig. 1A). Whereas the binding site of Dpb2 maps to the C-terminal end of Pol 2 (29Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30Shikata K. Sasa-Masuda T. Okuno Y. Waga S. Sugino A. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the sites at which the Dpb3 and Dpb4 subunits bind to Pol 2 differ among species. In yeast, Dpb3-Dpb4 was reported to bind near the C-terminal end of Pol 2 (29Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas the Xenopus homologs bind to the middle portion, distal from the C terminus (30Shikata K. Sasa-Masuda T. Okuno Y. Waga S. Sugino A. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to examine the biochemical properties of hPol ϵ, we reconstituted the polymerase complexes by co-expressing various combinations of Pol ϵ subunits or truncated forms of p261 in High Five insect cells. The purified complexes exhibited >90% homogeneity, as judged by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 1B) and Sepharose 6 sizing chromatography (Fig. 1C). The peak protein fractions of Pol ϵ contained stoichiometric levels of the four subunits and were active in supporting DNA synthesis (data not shown). Analysis of the hydrodynamic properties of the hPol ϵ complex showed that it is monomeric and has a moderately elongated shape (f/fo = 1.56) (Fig. 1E). These findings are consistent with those reported for Pol ϵ isolated from yeast (28Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Xenopus (30Shikata K. Sasa-Masuda T. Okuno Y. Waga S. Sugino A. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to the holocomplex, we also isolated subcomplexes of human Pol 2 (p261) that lacked one or all of the other subunits. Although the FLAG-tagged hp261 subunit was expressed and purified from insect cells, its yield and activity were low (compared with other Pol ϵ complexes), the protein tended to aggregate (shown by its distribution following glycerol gradient sedimentation), and its polymerase activity was unstable to freezing and thawing. The association of the p59 (Dpb2 subunit) stabilized the polymerase activity associated with the complex and increased the protein yield. The p261-p59 di"

This was examined in cultured rat aortas and in a model of vascular calcification in rats with renal failure. Both carboxylated (GlaMGP) and uncarboxylated (GluMGP) forms were present in aorta and disappeared during culture with warfarin. MGP was also released into the medium and removed by ultracentrifugation, and similarly affected by warfarin. In a high-phosphate medium, warfarin increased aortic calcification but only in the absence of pyrophosphate, another endogenous inhibitor of vascular calcification. Although GlaMGP binds and inactivates bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2, a proposed mediator of vascular calcification through up-regulation of the osteogenic transcription factor runx2, neither warfarin, BMP-2, nor the BMP-2 antagonist noggin altered runx2 mRNA content in aortas, and noggin did not prevent warfarin-induced calcification. Aortic content of MGP mRNA was increased 5-fold in renal failure but did not differ between calcified and noncalcified aortas. Immunoblots showed increased GlaMGP in noncalcified (5-fold) and calcified (20-fold) aortas from rats with renal failure, with similar increases in GluMGP. We conclude that rat aortic smooth muscle produces both GlaMGP and GluMGP in tissue-bound and soluble, presumably vesicular, forms. MGP inhibits calcification independent of BMP-2-driven osteogenesis and only in the absence of pyrophosphate, consistent with direct inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation. Synthesis of MGP is increased in renal failure and deficiency of GlaMGP is not a primary cause of medial calcification in this condition.

Synthesis of MGP is increased in renal failure and deficiency of GlaMGP is not a primary cause of medial calcification in this condition. Calcification of arterial smooth muscle (medial vascular calcification or Monckeberg arteriosclerosis) is a common finding in patients with advanced renal failure. The resulting decrease in vessel compliance is thought to contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality in this condition. Medial calcification is distinct from intimal calcification, which is an inflammatory lesion associated with atherosclerosis. Although hyperphosphatemia is usually present in advanced renal failure and can clearly drive calcification, medial calcification cannot be ascribed solely to physicochemical effects of hyperphosphatemia because it also occurs in elderly individuals without renal failure or hyperphosphatemia. Abundant data indicate that deficiencies of inhibitory factors produced by vascular smooth muscle play an important role (1Lomashvili K.A. Cobbs S. Hennigar R.A. Hardcastle K.I. O'Neill W.C. J. Am.

Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Humans with a mutant form of MGP (Keutel syndrome) also develop medial vascular calcification but it is not severe (12Meier M. Weng L.P. Alexandrakis E. Rüschoff J. Goeckenjan G. Eur. Respir.

The mechanism by which MGP inhibits medial calcification is not clearly established. Bone Gla protein (osteocalcin), a related protein, binds hydroxyapatite and inhibits its formation in vitro, and this inhibition is dependent on its γ-carboxylation (16Romberg R.W. Werness P.G. Riggs B.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). MGP also binds hydroxyapatite in vitro (17Roy M.E. Nishimoto S.K. Bone. 2002; 31: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and this is consistent with the fact that the content of MGP in calcified aortas is proportional to hydroxyapatite content (18Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and that MGP is concentrated around hydroxyapatite deposits (19Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Salisbury J.R. Proudfoot D. Weissberg P.L. Edmonds M.E. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Spronk H.M. Soute B.A. Schurgers L.J. Cleutjens J.P. Thijssen H.H. De Mey J.G. Vermeer C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, effects on hydroxyapatite formation are unknown. The MGP-fetuin complex in serum appears to prevent propagation of calcium phosphate precipitation (21Price P.A. Thomas G.R. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J.M. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) but the precise role of MGP in this is not clear. An alternative mechanism that has been proposed is the binding and inactivation of bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) (22Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D.C. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol.

Saab G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, the evidence that BMP-2 drives vascular calcification in a MGP-inhibitable manner is derived from studies in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Because these cells undergo a rapid and extensive phenotypic change in culture, their applicability to intact vascular smooth muscle is uncertain. The role of MGP deficiency in vascular calcification in renal failure is equally unclear. Although increased amounts of MGP are seen at sites of medial calcification (19Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Salisbury J.R. Proudfoot D. Weissberg P.L. Edmonds M.E. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Spronk H.M. Soute B.A. Schurgers L.J. Cleutjens J.P.

Hemost. 2003; 1: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), most of this stains with antibodies directed against uncarboxylated rather than carboxylated MGP (25Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Hemost. 2003; 1: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Schurgers L.J. Teunissen K.J. Knapen M.H. Kwaijtaal M. van Diest R. Appels A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cleutjens J.P. Vermeer C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that carboxylation of MGP is impaired in states associated with medial calcification. However, this conclusion is based solely on immunohistochemistry, which can be influenced by nonspecific binding and variable exposure of epitopes, particularly if MGP is bound to hydroxyapatite. Also, immunohistochemistry cannot distinguish between intact MGP and fragments. Whether a deficiency of carboxylated MGP causes vascular calcification in renal failure remains unknown. Despite the extensive investigation of MGP in vascular calcification, its synthesis and actions have never been studied in intact smooth muscle. In this study, a model of medial calcification in cultured rat aorta was used to examine the metabolism of MGP and its effect on calcification in the vessel wall. In addition, the role of MGP in pathologic calcification was examined in a model of vascular calcification in rats with renal failure by measuring the content of MGP mRNA and by assessing the content of carboxylated and uncarboxylated forms in aorta. Aortic culture was performed as previously described (1Lomashvili K.A. Cobbs S. Hennigar R.A. Hardcastle K.I. O'Neill W.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, aortas were removed under sterile conditions from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–300 g and adventitia was carefully removed. Adventitia was not completely removed as this leads to smooth muscle injury. The vessels were cut into 3–4-mm rings and placed in DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) without serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator with medium changes every 3 days. The concentrations of calcium and phosphate in this medium were 1.8 and 0.9 mm, respectively. The vascular smooth muscle remains viable for at least 2 weeks under these conditions, continuing to transport ions and respond to hormones (27Jiang G. Cobbs S. Klein J.D. O'Neill W.C. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and showing normal histology without apoptosis (1Lomashvili K.A. Cobbs S. Hennigar R.A. Hardcastle K.I. O'Neill W.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To induce calcification, the phosphate concentration was increased to 3.8 mm and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added at a concentration of 3.75 units/ml. To measure calcification, 0.05–0.1 μCi of 45Ca (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was included in the culture medium. After 9 days, the aortic rings were washed 6 times in buffered salt solution and the remainder of the adventitia was removed under a dissecting microscope. The rings were extracted in 1 m HCl for 30 min and the extract was neutralized with an equal volume of 1 m NaOH. The rings were removed and dried, and radioactivity in the neutralized extract was counted by liquid scintillation. Results are expressed per dry weight of extracted aorta. Aortas were frozen and then powdered in liquid nitrogen, and the powder homogenized in 300 μl of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 17% glycerol, 1.3% EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.06 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, on ice. The homogenate was boiled for 5 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured using the RC DC assay (Bio-Rad). Approximately 15–25 μl of supernatant (100 μg of protein) was electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide gels (unless otherwise indicated) using the Tris-Tricine buffer system (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon PDVF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and incubated with antibodies in Tris-buffered saline without calcium. Culture medium was concentrated at least 10-fold using a Microcon 3-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 8% SDS, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 24% glycerol prior to electrophoresis. Several antibodies were used to detect MGP. A monoclonal antibody directed against γ-carboxyglutamyl residues (nonspecific Gla antibody) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT). An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody specific for uncarboxylated bovine MGP was raised against a synthetic peptide containing residues 38–57 of the Gla-containing region of MGP where the 4 Gla residues were replaced with Glu residues and does not recognize Gla MGP (25Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Hemost. 2003; 1: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody directed against a portion of MGP that does not contain Gla residues was raised against a synthetic peptide comprising residues 6–37 (25Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Hemost. 2003; 1: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and was used to detect total MGP. Bands were identified with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 680; Invitrogen) and an infrared detector (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Relative abundance was estimated by densitometry using software provided with the detector. Aortas were frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered, and then extracted with a guanidinium and phenol solution on ice with additional homogenization. Chloroform was added, and RNA was extracted by centrifugation. cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA from each sample using a ThermoscriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen), and quantitative PCR was performed with an iCycler iQ Detection System using iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). To avoid amplification of genomic DNA, primers were designed to flank at least one intron. Partial length cDNAs for QPCR standards were synthesized using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Sequences of the primer pairs (F: forward; R: reverse) were as follow: MGP, AGGCAGACTCACAGGACACC (F), CATTTCTCCGGTTGGTGAAG (R); runx2, CTTCACAAATCCTCCCCAAG (F), GAGGCGGTCAGAGAACAAAC (R); osteopontin, CTGTCTCCCGGTGAAAGTG (F), GTCATCCGTTTCTTCAGAGG (R); osteocalcin, GCATTCTGCCTCTCTGACCT (F), CTCCAGGGGATCTGGGTAG (R); osterix, TCTCCATCTGCCTGACTCCT (F), TTCTTTGTGCCTCCTTTTCC (R); 18S RNA, GGGAGGTAGTGACGAAAAATA (F), TTGCCCTCCAATGGATCCT (R). Aortic rings were incubated in Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 and alkaline phosphatase and ectonucleotide pyrophosphorylase were measured spectrophotometrically as hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate and thymidine monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester, respectively. Chronic renal failure and vascular calcification were produced by feeding adenine to rats (29Yokozawa T. Zheng P.D. Oura H. Koizumi F. Nephron. 1986; 44: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 30Okada H. Kaneko Y. Yawata T. Uyama H. Ozono S. Motomiya Y. Hirao Y. Clin. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 3: 82-88Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This results in crystallization of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine in the tubules and interstitium with resulting interstitial inflammation and fibrosis and all the metabolic abnormalities of chronic renal failure (29Yokozawa T. Zheng P.D. Oura H. Koizumi F. Nephron. 1986; 44: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Rats were fed a 2.5% protein diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) with added sodium phosphate for final concentrations of 1.06% calcium and 0.92% phosphorus. Adenine was added at a concentration of 0.75% for a total of 4 weeks. Control rats were fed the same diet without adenine but the quantity was limited so that their weight loss matched that of the adenine-fed rats. Aortas were perfused with saline, harvested, and cleaned. A small section (3 mm) was removed for measurement of calcium and the remainder was frozen in liquid nitrogen for measurement of MGP or extraction of RNA as described above. The segments for calcium determination were dried, weighed, and extracted overnight in 1 m HCl. Calcium in the extract was measured colorimetrically by the cresolphthalein method (31Moorehead W.R. Biggs H.G. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1458-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Plasma urea was measured colorimetrically by the urease-glutamate dehydrogenase method (ThermoDMA, Arlington, TX), plasma phosphate was measured colorimetrically by the molybdate method (32Cogan E.B. Birrell G.B. Griffith O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and plasma calcium was measured by the cresolpthalein method (31Moorehead W.R. Biggs H.G. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1458-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody directed against γ-carboxyglutamyl residues was purchased from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT). Polyclonal antibodies specific for uncarboxylated bovine MGP (gluMGP) and a portion of MGP that does not contain Gla residues were raised against synthetic peptides and affinity purified as previously described (25Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Hemost. 2003; 1: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Human recombinant noggin and BMP-2 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Statistical significance was determined by Student's two-tailed t test except as indicated otherwise. Identification of MGP in aorta proved to be challenging because of its tissue binding and poor solubility. This required electrophoresis of samples containing large amounts of protein, often resulting in a number of extraneous bands. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against the γ-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residue present in all γ-carboxylated proteins (33Brown M.A. Stenberg L.M. Persson U. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19795-19802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) recognized a 14-kDa protein in rat aortas that corresponded to GlaMGP purified from bone (Fig. 1A). The intensity of this band increased slightly when aortas were cultured with vitamin K1 and disappeared completely during culture with warfarin (Fig. 1B). The increase with vitamin K1 was not consistently observed, and large amounts of vitamin K1 only slightly reversed the effect of warfarin. None of the other bands observed on the immunoblots were affected by warfarin. An identical band was observed using an antibody directed specifically against the uncarboxylated form of MGP (GluMGP) and also disappeared after culture with warfarin (Fig. 1, C and D). This antibody occasionally recognized an additional band at ∼25 kDa that was not sensitive to warfarin and is of uncertain identity. Messenger RNA for MGP was also detected in rat aortas. The abundance increased ∼3.5-fold after 3 days in culture and was not affected by vitamin K1 or warfarin, or by raising the phosphate concentration (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2MGP mRNA in rat aorta. RNA was quantified by QPCR in fresh aortas (n = 14) and in aortas cultured in DMEM for 3 days without (n = 12) or with (n = 6) 10 μg/ml of vitamin K1, 25 μm warfarin (n = 6), or added phosphate to 3.8 mm (n = 7). There was no significant difference between mRNA content in any of the culture conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both forms of MGP were also present in the culture medium and showed the same response to warfarin (Fig. 3, A and B). Detection of MGP required that the medium be concentrated at least 10-fold. The apparent molecular weight of this band was the same as in aortic extracts, indicating that it is not a fragment of MGP. Based on the relative intensity of the staining compared with that in the aortic extract, the medium accounted for approximately half of the total MGP in the aortic cultures after 3 days. The additional band just above 20 kDa observed with the anti-Gla antibody was not affected by warfarin and remains unidentified. To determine the form of this “soluble” MGP, the culture medium was filtered through a 30-kDa cut-off cellulose filter (Amicon YM30, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and the filtrate was concentrated using a 3-kDa cut-off cellulose filter (Amicon PLCC). As shown in Fig. 3C, the medium MGP was retained by the 30-kDa filter and absent in the filtrate. The high molecular weight bands in the medium and retentate presumably represent protein aggregates that formed during concentration of the medium, but these were not routinely observed (Fig. 3, A and D, left-hand lanes). Most of the MGP was removed by ultracentrifugation and appeared in the pellet (Fig. 3D). To examine the role of MGP in medial calcification, aortas were cultured in a high-phosphate medium for 9 days with and without warfarin (Fig. 4). Normal aortas do not calcify in this medium and warfarin had no effect. The small amount of 45Ca incorporated represents equilibration with existing aortic calcium (1Lomashvili K.A. Cobbs S. Hennigar R.A. Hardcastle K.I. O'Neill W.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because these aortas also make pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification, alkaline phosphatase was added to remove pyrophosphate as previously described (1Lomashvili K.A. Cobbs S. Hennigar R.A. Hardcastle K.I. O'Neill W.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Under this condition, calcification was substantially increased by warfarin but was not reduced by vitamin K1 (not shown). Warfarin did not alter the activity of ectonucleotide pyrophosphorylase (Enpp1), the ectoenzyme that synthesizes pyrophosphate from extracellular ATP (0.96 ± 0.08 versus 1.12 ± 0.08 μmol/min/g in controls; n = 9) or tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, the ectoenzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular PPi (0.071 ± 0.011 versus 0.090 ± 0.007 μmol/min/g in controls; n = 6). Previous studies have proposed that MGP inhibits vascular calcification by binding and inactivating BMP-2 (22Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D.C. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a protein thought to drive osteogenic transformation of smooth muscle cells (24Hruska K.A. Mathew S. Saab G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, additional studies were performed to determine the role of BMP-2 and the downstream osteogenic transcription factor runx2. Runx2 mRNA was present at a very low level in freshly isolated aortas and increased during culture (Fig. 5A) but its content was not altered by warfarin, BMP-2, or the BMP-2 antagonist noggin (34Rosen V. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1068: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), indicating that it is not under the control of MGP or BMP-2. Addition of noggin to aortic cultures did not decrease warfarin-induced calcification (Fig. 5B). Despite the increase in runx2 expression during culture, there was no detectable mRNA for osterix, another bone-specific transcription factor or for osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein, and expression of alkaline phosphatase decreased (data not shown). The role of MGP in vascular calcification in vivo was examined in rats with renal failure induced by feeding adenine. When fed a high-phosphate diet, some of these rats develop severe medial calcification of the aorta (35Price P.A. Roublick A.M. Williamson M.K. Kidney Int. 2006; 70: 1577-1583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Lomashvili K.A. Monier-Faugere M.C. Wang X. Malluche H.H. O'Neill W.C.

This is further evidence that vascular calcification in renal failure cannot be ascribed solely to hyperphosphatemia. However, this provided the opportunity to examine independently the effects of renal failure and calcification on aortic MGP. Also, some aortas were harvested at 16 days, after the development of renal failure but prior to the onset of calcification. Aortas were deemed calcified based on a calcium content >50 nmol/mg in a sample prior to processing for immunoblotting, a content that is not associated with staining for calcification by microscopy. Aortic calcium content and plasma chemistries are presented in Table 1. Although calcium content was significantly higher in aortas from rats with renal failure that were not considered to be calcified, the increase was minuscule compared with calcified aortas. This probably represents intracellular sequestering of calcium related to the hyperphosphatemia, which is also observed in cultured aortas (1Lomashvili K.A. Cobbs S. Hennigar R.A. Hardcastle K.I. O'Neill W.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, or urea did not differ between rats with or without visible calcification. Immunoblotting revealed a substantial increase in total MGP (Fig. 6A) and"

In mammals, ceramide is synthesized de novo by N-acylation of a sphingoid long chain base, which is catalyzed by a family of six enzymes, the ceramide synthases (CerS), each of which uses a restricted subset of acyl-CoAs for N-acylation. Thus, CerS1 uses C18-CoA (7Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

CerS2 utilizes very long acyl chain CoAs (i.e. C22–C24) and is expressed at the highest levels and displays the widest tissue distribution of all CerS (12Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I.

Although CerS2 mRNA expression levels are significantly lower in the whole brain than in the liver (12Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I. Epstein S. Park H. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J.

Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and SLs containing very long acyl chain fatty acids are abundant in white matter and in myelin (17Baumann N. Pham-Dinh D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 871-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 18Ben-David O. Futerman A.H. Neuromolecular Med. 2010; 12: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting a key role for CerS2 in these cells and brain regions. A previous report demonstrated that CerS2-null mice exhibit myelin defects as well as cerebellar degeneration at 9 months of age and cell loss in the hippocampus (19Imgrund S. Hartmann D. Farwanah H.

However, no changes in other brain regions were described, and no systematic evaluation of the lesions was performed such that the relationship between very long acyl chain SLs and brain dysfunction could not be ascertained. We now show that CerS2-null mice exhibit profound alterations in lipid composition in both whole brain and purified myelin and in particular reduced levels of non-hydroxy-C22–C24-GalCer and 2-hydroxy-C22–C24-GalCer. These changes are accompanied by pronounced bilateral and symmetrical astrogliosis and by mild bilateral and symmetrical vacuolization in various white and gray matter regions along with microglial activation in defined brain areas. In addition, CerS2-null mice exhibit neurological abnormalities originating from a subcortical region and accumulation of unidentified storage materials in lysosomes of astrocytes. d-erythro-[4,5-3H]Sphinganine was synthesized as described (20Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fatty acyl-CoAs, C6-NBD-sphingomyelin (SM), C6-NBD-GalCer, and the internal standards for liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) were from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). A ganglioside standard was from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), rat anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-proteolipid protein (PLP) (Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), rat anti-Mac2 (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada), and mouse anti-neuronal nucleus antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA).

For 2-hydroxyhexosylceramide (2-hydroxy-HexCer), the same method was used as for determining glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide but with addition of the precursor-product ion pairs for 2-hydroxy-HexCer. Total glycerolipid (pmol/mg dry weight) and cholesterol levels were measured by nano-ESI MS/MS (22Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Gangliosides were identified using authentic ganglioside standards. Brain tissue was homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation (3 min at 800 × gav at 4 °C) and placed on top of a sucrose gradient comprising 2, 1.4, 0.85, and 0.25 m sucrose. After centrifugation (20 h at 70,000 × gav at 4 °C), the crude myelin fraction was collected from the gradient, and its identity was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-MBP antibody. The crude myelin fractions underwent four consecutive osmotic shocks followed by centrifugation (15 min at 75,000 × gav at 4 °C one time and then three times for 10 min at 12,000 × gav at 4°) (34Norton W.T. Poduslo S.E. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and then resuspension in water. Tissues were collected at necropsy and fixed by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissues were processed routinely, embedded in paraffin, trimmed at 4–5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with toluidine blue. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraformaldehyde-perfused tissues using an immunoperoxidase procedure with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen (35Farfel-Becker T. Vitner E.B. Pressey S.N.

Rabbit anti-GFAP (1:4,000 dilution) and rat anti-Mac2 (1:1,000 dilution) antibodies were used to detect astrocytes and microglia, respectively. For X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactoside) staining, tissues were frozen at −20 °C and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) Tissue-Tek. 20-μm sections were fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed three times in wash buffer (100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet-P40), and stained with β-galactosidase substrate buffer (as above but supplemented with 5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6], 5 mm K4[Fe(CN)6], and 1 mg/ml X-Gal) overnight at 37 °C in the dark. Mice were perfused with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Brains were removed, fixed for 30 min prior to cutting with a Vibratome into 200-μm slices, and fixed again for 2 h at room temperature and for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing, tissue slices were postfixed in osmium tetroxide, 0.5% potassium dichromate, 0.5% potassium hexacyanoferrate in cacodylate buffer for 1 h and embedded in EMbed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Epon blocks were cut into small pieces, re-embedded followed by preparation of 70–100-nm ultrathin slices, and mounted onto grids for analysis in a Philips CM-12 FEI electron microscope. Images were captured with an Eagle 2kx2k FEI camera (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands). Western blotting was performed (15Pewzner-Jung Y. Brenner O. Braun S. Laviad E.L. Ben-Dor S. Feldmesser E.

Densitometry was performed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), and expression levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Brain sections were stained with an anti-neuronal nucleus antibody (1:250). Twenty images were captured at different magnifications, and cells were counted using ImageJ. Mice were implanted with a telemetric system for EEG monitoring (Data Science International; Ref. 36Pitsch J. Schoch S. Gueler N. Flor P.J. van der Putten H. Becker A.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 26: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A transmitter (TA10EA-F20) was placed subcutaneously on the right dorsal side of a stereotactically fixed, deeply anesthetized animal (0.8–1.2% isoflurane). In each hemisphere, a hole was drilled through the skull using a surgical drill, and stainless steel screws serving as electrodes were inserted through the drilled holes to the epidural space. The epicranial side of each screw was connected to a transmitter lead and secured with bone cement. Mice were allowed 1 week to recover from the acute affects of surgery. Starting from day 7, the freely moving mice were monitored for 1 week. EEG was recorded at 1 KHz and analyzed off line using Matlab® scripts. Power spectral density was calculated (37Welch P.D. IEEE Trans. Audio Electroacoustics. 1967; 15: 70-73Crossref Scopus (7860) Google Scholar) and normalized to maximum power for each mouse. 7,200 1-s windows with 0.5-s overlap were randomly selected and analyzed from six different time periods for each mouse (n = 5). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 9.4-tesla BioSpec Magnet 94/20 USR system (Bruker). The MRI protocol included a transverse relaxation time (T2) map, which was acquired using the multislice spin echo imaging sequence with the following parameters: time of repetition of 3000 ms, 16 time echo increments (linearly from 10 to 160 ms), matrix dimension of 256 × 128, and two averages. Twenty continuous slices with a slice thickness of 1 mm were acquired with a field of view of 22 × 22 mm2. In vivo brain MRI (five control mice and five CerS2-null mice) was performed. During the MRI scanning, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction and 1–2% for maintenance) mixed with O2 (1 liter/min) delivered through a nasal mask. A quantitative T2 map was produced from multiecho T2-weighted images. The multiecho signal was fitted to a monoexponential decay to extract the T2 value for each image pixel. Processing and analysis of the MRI data were performed using different in-house programs in Matlab, producing an averaged value for the entire brain. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired, one-tailed, Student's t test with a p value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. CerS2 activity is much lower in brain homogenates (50 ± 9 pmol/min/mg) than in liver (∼200–300 pmol/min/mg) (12Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I. Epstein S. Park H. Merrill Jr., A.H.

As a consequence, the CerS2-null mouse has very low levels of C22–C24-ceramide and C22–C24-SM (14Pewzner-Jung Y. Park H. Laviad E.L. Silva L.C. Lahiri S. Stiban J. Erez-Roman R. Brügger B.

In newborn (P0) wild type (WT) mice, most of the ceramide and SM contains C18-acyl chains (presumably synthesized by CerS1 (7Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C.

Substantial levels of C16-ceramide and C16-SM are found immediately after birth and decrease during development in both CerS2-null and WT mice, consistent with the decreased expression of CerS6 during brain development (38Novgorodov S.A. Chudakova D.A. Wheeler B.W. Bielawski J. Kindy M.S. Obeid L.M. Gudz T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4644-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, the acyl chain composition of HexCer (which consists of both glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and galactosylceramide (GalCer)) changes dramatically during development. WT mice have mainly C18-HexCer at birth, but C22–C24-HexCer becomes the dominant species by 1 month of age (39Sastry P.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 69-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and by 4 months, C18-HexCer comprises <10% of the total HexCer (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). This suggests that any pathological changes resulting from the altered HexCer acyl chain composition (Fig. 1) might begin between P0 and 1 month, a period of active myelination (40Muse E.D. Jurevics H. Toews A.D. Matsushima G.K. Morell P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The elevation in C18-ceramide and in C18-SM in the CerS2-null mice compensates for the loss of C22–C24-ceramide and C22–C24-SM, respectively, such that total levels of ceramide and SM are essentially unaltered (Fig. 1) (19Imgrund S. Hartmann D. Farwanah H. Eckhardt M. Sandhoff R. Degen J. Gieselmann V. Sandhoff K. Willecke K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33549-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast, HexCer levels were reduced by ∼85% in CerS2-null mice (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). Most brain HexCer consists of GalCer with a ratio of GalCer to GlcCer of ∼100:1 in adult mice (Refs. 39Sastry P.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 69-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar and 41Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R. Blight A. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Popko B. Cell. 1996; 86: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). GalCer consists of two major species, 2-hydroxy-GalCer (OH-GalCer) (42van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and non-hydroxy-GalCer (non-OH-GalCer), with the former comprising ∼50% of the total GalCer (43Hama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). No LC-ESI MS/MS standards are currently available for OH-GalCer, precluding rigorous quantification of its amounts, but because Gal-based HexCer comprises the vast majority of HexCer in adult brain (see above), we assume that most of the OH-HexCer measured in the LC-ESI MS/MS analyses consists of OH-GalCer (referred to hereafter as OH-Gal(Hex)Cer). Levels of OH-Gal(Hex)Cer were only reduced by ∼40% (Fig. 2B). The difference in the reduction of OH-Gal(Hex)Cer levels compared with non-OH-GalCer can be explained by elevation of C18-OH-Gal(Hex)Cer (Fig. 2, A and B), which compensates to some extent for the loss of C22–C24-OH-Gal(Hex)Cer, whereas there was a much lower elevation of C18-non-OH-GalCer (Fig. 2, A and B). No changes in total GlcCer levels were apparent (Fig. 2C) due to compensation by elevated levels of C18/C18:1-GlcCer (Fig. 2C); also in contrast to the ceramide-UDP galactosyltransferase (CGT)−/− mouse, GlcCer levels were not elevated upon reduction in GalCer (41Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R. Blight A. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Popko B. Cell. 1996; 86: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 44Zöller I. Büssow H. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. Glia. 2005; 52: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the major changes in the SL composition of the CerS2-null mouse brain are (i) a loss in C22–C24-non-OH-GalCer, (ii) a loss in C22–C24-OH-Gal(Hex)Cer, and (iii) an increase in C18-OH-Gal(Hex)Cer. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of CerS1, which synthesizes C18-ceramide, can alter levels of downstream glycosphingolipids such as neutral glycosphingolipids and gangliosides (7Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35642-35649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, despite changes in the acyl chain composition of glycosphingolipids, the CerS2-null mouse displayed similar levels of gangliosides GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b and a small but inconsistent reduction in GM1 levels (supplemental Fig. 1) (67Svennerholm L.

Moreover, there were no major changes in levels of sphingoid long chain bases (Fig. 2D) with a 2–3-fold elevation of sphinganine levels.

Because major changes in GalCer acyl chain composition occur during the 1st month of life (Fig. 1) and because GalCer is a major lipid component of oligodendrocytes and myelin (45Dupree J.L. Suzuki K. Popko B. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we analyzed SL levels and acyl chain composition in purified myelin by LC-ESI MS/MS. A similar pattern was observed as in whole brain with no change in ceramide, SM, GlcCer, and lactosylceramide and a reduction in GalCer (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 2). Elevated levels of C18-ceramide and C18-SM accounted for the lack of change of total ceramide and SM levels (Fig. 3B). Although some C22–C24-GlcCer and C22–C24-GalCer were detectable in myelin (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table 2), their levels were extremely low (Fig. 3A). Thus, changes in brain SL levels and in their acyl chain composition appear to largely reflect changes in myelin. Finally, we analyzed cholesterol and glycerolipid levels. No changes were detected in sterol levels with the exception of a small increase in cholesterol esters. However, because levels of cholesterol esters are extremely low in brain (∼1 pmol/mg dry weight compared with 130 pmol/mg dry weight for cholesterol), this change is unlikely to be of any pathological cons"

The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of ARV entry and subsequent infection. Cholesterol mainly affected the early steps of the ARV life cycle, because the presence of cholesterol before and during viral adsorption greatly blocked ARV infectivity. Although we have demonstrated that ARV facilitating p38 MAPK is beneficial for virus replication, its mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that ARV-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Tyr(14)), dynamin-2 expression, and Rac1 activation through activation of p38 MAPK and Src in the early stage of the virus life cycle is beneficial for virus entry and productive infection. The strong inhibition by dynasore, a specific inhibitor of dynamin-2, and depletion of endogenous caveolin-1 or dynamin-2 by siRNAs as well as the caveolin-1 colocalization study implicate caveolin-1-mediated and dynamin-2-dependent endocytosis as a significant avenue of ARV entry. By means of pharmacological inhibitors, dominant negative mutants, and siRNA of various cellular proteins and signaling molecules, phosphorylation of caveolin-1, dynamin-2 expression, and Rac1 activation were suppressed, suggesting that by orchestrating p38 MAPK, Src, and Rac1 signaling cascade in the target cells, ARV creates an appropriate intracellular environment facilitating virus entry and productive infection. Furthermore, disruption of microtubules, Rab5, or endosome acidification all inhibited ARV infection, suggesting that microtubules and small GTPase Rab5, which regulate transport to early endosome, are crucial for survival of ARV and that exposure of the virus to acidic pH is required for productive infection."

Cyclic strain-induced TNC expression depends on RhoA-actin signaling, the pathway that regulates transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF) by its coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1). Therefore, we tested whether MKL1 controls TNC transcription. We demonstrate that overexpression of MKL1 strongly induces TNC expression in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and normal HC11 and transformed 4T1 mammary epithelial cells. Part of the induction was dependant on SRF and a newly identified atypical CArG box in the TNC promoter. Another part was independent of SRF but required the SAP domain of MKL1. An MKL1 mutant incapable of binding to SRF still strongly induced TNC, while induction of the SRF target c-fos was abolished. Cyclic strain failed to induce TNC in MKL1-deficient but not in SRF-deficient fibroblasts, and strain-induced TNC expression strongly depended on the SAP domain of MKL1. Promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments unraveled a SAP-dependent, SRF-independent interaction of MKL1 with the proximal promoter region of TNC, attributing for the first time a functional role to the SAP domain of MKL1 in regulating gene expression.—Asparuhova, M.

The potency of TSH for cAMP signaling is higher than for phosphoinositide signaling, and it was suggested that there are ""spare receptors"" for cAMP signaling. In a human embryonic kidney macrophage scavenger receptor-expressing (HEK-EM) 293 model system, there are no spare receptors, but the cells still exhibited 100-fold differences in potencies. Dose responses for TSH-stimulated dissociation of prebound (125)I-TSH (negative cooperativity; EC(50)=70 mU/ml), which requires TSH binding to both sites of the TSH receptor (TSHR) homodimer, and TSH-stimulated IP1 production (EC(50)=50 mU/ml) were indistinguishable. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using tagged receptors showed that TSHR formed homodimers and heterodimers with two binding-deficient mutant TSHRs, L252P and C41S. When L252P or C41S was expressed with TSHR, that is, when TSHR/L252P or TSHR/C41S heterodimers could only bind one TSH, TSH-stimulated IP1 production was decreased relative to cAMP production. The slopes of linear regression analyses comparing fold stimulation by TSH of IP1 vs. cAMP production were 0.044 ± 0.0047, 0.0043 ± 0.0041, and 0.0059 ± 0.0014 for cells expressing TSHR alone, TSHR and L252P, or TSHR and C41S, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the mouse Spink2 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 2) gene, which belongs to the SPINK family of proteins characterized by the presence of a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor-pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor domain. We showed that recombinant mouse SPINK2 has trypsin-inhibitory activity. Distribution analyses revealed that Spink2 is transcribed strongly in the testis and weakly in the epididymis, but is not detected in other mouse tissues. Expression of Spink2 is specific to germ cells in the testis and is first evident at the pachytene spermatocyte stage. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that SPINK2 protein is present in male germ cells at all developmental stages, including in testicular spermatogenic cells, testicular sperm, and mature sperm. To elucidate the functional role of SPINK2 in vivo, we generated mutant mice with diminished levels of SPINK2 using a gene trap mutagenesis approach. Mutant male mice exhibit significantly impaired fertility; further phenotypic analyses revealed that testicular integrity is disrupted, resulting in a reduction in sperm number. Moreover, we found that testes from mutant mice exhibit abnormal spermatogenesis and germ cell apoptosis accompanied by elevated serine protease activity. Our studies thus provide the first demonstration that SPINK2 is required for maintaining normal spermatogenesis and potentially regulates serine protease-mediated apoptosis in male germ cells."

Here, we studied the involvement of membrane lipid components of human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells in formation of membrane protrusions. Depletion of cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibited protrusion formation in a concentration-dependent manner but had no major effect on the toxin-catalyzed modification of actin in target cells. Repletion of cholesterol reconstituted formation of protrusions and increased velocity and total amount of protrusion formation. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin had no effect on the CDT-induced changes in the dynamics of microtubules. Formation of membrane protrusions was also inhibited by the cholesterol-binding polyene antibiotic nystatin. Degradation or inhibition of synthesis of sphingolipids by sphingomyelinase and myriocin, respectively, blocked CDT-induced protrusion formation. Benzyl alcohol, which increases membrane fluidity, prevented protrusion formation. CDT-induced membrane protrusions were stained by flotillin-2 and by the fluorescent-labeled lipid raft marker cholera toxin subunit B, which selectively interacts with GM1 ganglioside mainly located in lipid microdomains. The data suggest that formation and especially the initiation of CDT-induced microtubule-based membrane protrusions depend on cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid microdomains."

A balance of fusion and division controls mitochondrial morphol-ogy; imbalanced dynamics leads to altered morphology, which is associated with a variety of pathological conditions.

When division is inhibited, tubular mitochondria fuse, generating elongated mitochondrial tubules with increased connectivity. In some neurons, however, decreased division leads to enlarged, spherical mitochondria.Highlighting the importance of mitochondrial fusion and division in human health and disease, mutations in mitochondrial dynamics components have recently been linked to several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including a birth defect with multiple neurological disorders (Drp1), Parkinson’s disease (Parkin and Pink1), autosomal dominant optic atrophy type 1 (Opa1), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (Mfn2 and GDAP1).

https://openalex.org/W2042281196,"Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein) is a critical mediator of metabolism and adipogenesis in vivo. The mechanisms of action of Txnip are believed to operate at least in part by inhibiting the redox signaling functions of thioredoxin. We tested here whether Txnip suppressed adipogenesis by inhibiting thioredoxin and discovered a reversal of roles; Txnip inhibits adipogenesis directly, and thioredoxin binding regulates Txnip by enhancing Txnip protein stability. Unlike Txnip, a Txnip mutant that cannot bind thioredoxin (C247S) did not prevent adipocyte differentiation, but was degraded more quickly by proteasomal targeting. Finding that endogenous Txnip protein is also rapidly degraded at the onset of adipogenesis suggested that Txnip degradation is required for adipocyte differentiation. Thioredoxin overexpression stabilized Txnip protein levels to inhibit adipogenesis, and adipogenic stimulants such as insulin promoted Txnip-thioredoxin dissociation to the more labile free Txnip state. As an α-arrestin protein, Txnip has two C-terminal tail PPXY motifs that mediate E3 ubiquitin ligase binding and Txnip protein stability. Mutating the PPXY motifs prevented Txnip degradation, even when thioredoxin binding was lost, and restored the ability of C247S Txnip to inhibit adipogenesis. These studies present a novel reconsideration of Txnip-thioredoxin signaling by showing that thioredoxin regulates the intrinsic function of Txnip as an inhibitor of adipogenesis through protein stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2067843473,"According to the ""free radical theory"" of aging, premature senescence induced by oxidative stress contributes to organismal aging. Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF)/cavin-1 is a structural protein component of caveolae, invaginations of the plasma membrane involved in signal transduction. We show that oxidative stress up-regulates PTRF/cavin-1 protein expression and promotes the interaction between PTRF/cavin-1 and caveolin-1, another structural protein component of caveolae. Consistent with these data, the number of caveolae is dramatically increased in cells subjected to oxidative stress. We demonstrate that down-regulation of PTRF/cavin-1 by shRNA significantly inhibits oxidative stress-induced premature senescence. Mechanistically, we found that PTRF/cavin-1 expression is necessary for the oxidant-induced sequestration of Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, into caveolar membranes, away from p53, and activation of the p53/p21(Waf1/Cip1) pathway. Expression of a mutant form of PTRF/cavin-1, which fails to localize to caveolar membranes after oxidative stress, inhibits oxidative stress-induced activation of p53 and induction of premature senescence. Thus, PTRF/cavin-1 is a novel regulator of oxidative stress-induced premature senescence by acting as a link between free radicals and activation of the p53/p21(Waf1/Cip1) pathway."

In this study, we showed that MnSOD protein expression was elevated in response to TPA or TNF-α, but not to hydrogen peroxide treatment. TPA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was blocked by pretreatment of the PKC inhibitor BIM and NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments indicated that knocking down the NADPH oxidase components e.g. Rac1, p22(phox), p67(phox), and NOXO1 in A549 cells impaired TPA-induced MnSOD expression. To identify the PKC isozyme involved, we used a sod2 gene response reporter plasmid, pSODLUC-3340-I2E-C, capable of sensing the effect of TNF-α and TPA, to monitor the effects of PKC isozyme-specific inhibitors and siRNA-induced knockdown of specific PKC isozyme. Our data indicate that TPA-induced MnSOD expression was independent of p53 and most likely mediated by PKC-α-, and -ε-dependent signaling pathways. Furthermore, siRNA-induced knock-down of CREB and Forkhead box class O (FOXO) 3a led to a reduction in TPA-induced MnSOD gene expression. Together, our results revealed that TPA up-regulates, in part, two PKC-dependent transcriptional pathways to induce MnSOD expression. One pathway involves PKC-α catalyzed phosphorylation of CREB and the other involves a PKC-mediated the PP2A catalyzed dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) which in turn leads to FOXO3a Ser(253) dephosphorylation and its activation."

In Escherichia coli, synthesis and transport of LPS are essential processes. Neisseria meningitidis, conversely, can survive without LPS and tolerates inactivation of genes involved in LPS synthesis and transport. Here, we analyzed whether the LptA, LptB, LptC, LptE, LptF, and LptG proteins, recently implicated in LPS transport in E. coli, function similarly in N. meningitidis. None of the analyzed proteins was essential in N. meningitidis, consistent with their expected roles in LPS transport and additionally demonstrating that they are not required for an essential process such as phospholipid transport. As expected, the absence of most of the Lpt proteins resulted in a severe defect in LPS transport. However, the absence of LptE did not disturb transport of LPS to the cell surface. LptE was found to be associated with LptD, and its absence affected total levels of LptD, suggesting a chaperone-like role for LptE in LptD biogenesis. The absence of a direct role of LptE in LPS transport was substantiated by bioinformatic analyses showing a low conservation of LptE in LPS-producing bacteria. Apparently, the role of LptE in N. meningitidis deviates from that in E. coli, suggesting that the Lpt system does not function in a completely conserved manner in all gram-negative bacteria."

In a search for Gag-interacting proteins that are involved in late stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening against a human cDNA library and identified the non-muscle actin filament cross-linking protein filamin A as a novel Gag binding partner. The 280-kDa filamin A regulates cortical actin network dynamics and participates in the anchoring of membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Recent studies have shown that filamin A facilitates HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission by binding to HIV receptors and coreceptors and regulating their clustering on the target cell surface. Here we report a novel role for filamin A in HIV-1 Gag intracellular trafficking. We demonstrate that filamin A interacts with the capsid domain of HIV-1 Gag and that this interaction is involved in particle release in a productive manner. Disruption of this interaction eliminated Gag localization at the plasma membrane and induced Gag accumulation within internal compartments. Moreover, blocking clathrin-dependent endocytic pathways did not relieve the restriction to particle release induced by filamin A depletion. These results suggest that filamin A is involved in the distinct step of the Gag trafficking pathway. The discovery of the Gag-filamin A interaction may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of HIV infection."

Previously, we showed an abundance of inactive GSK-3 in the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line. CML is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by an oncogenic Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. In Bcr-Abl signaling, the role of GSK-3 is not well defined. Here, we report that enforced expression of constitutively active GSK-3 reduced proliferation and increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced apoptosis by nearly 1-fold. Bcr-Abl inhibition activated GSK-3 and GSK-3-dependent apoptosis. Inactivation of GSK-3 by Bcr-Abl activity is, therefore, confirmed. To reactivate GSK-3, we used glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor PDMP to accumulate endogenous ceramide, a tumor-suppressor sphingo-lipid and a potent GSK-3 activator. We found that either PDMP or silence of GCS increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced GSK-3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, PDMP sensitized the most clinical problematic drug-resistant CML T315I mutant to Bcr-Abl inhibitor GNF-2-, imatinib-, or nilotinib-induced apoptosis by >5-fold.

The Spir/formin cooperativity has been identified to direct two essential steps in mammalian oocyte maturation, the asymmetric spindle positioning and polar body extrusion during meiosis. Understanding the nature and regulation of the Spir/Fmn cooperation is an important requirement to comprehend mammalian reproduction. Recently we dissected the structural elements of the Spir and Fmn family proteins, which physically link the two actin nucleation factors. The trans-regulatory interaction is mediated by the Spir kinase non-catalytic C-lobe domain (KIND) and the C-terminal formin Spir interaction motif (FSI). The interaction inhibits formin nucleation activity and enhances the Spir activity. To get insights into the molecular mechanism of the Spir/Fmn interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the KIND domain alone and in complex with the C-terminal Fmn-2 FSI peptide. Together they confirm the proposed structural homology of the KIND domain to the protein kinase fold and reveal the basis of the Spir/formin interaction. The complex structure showed a large interface with conserved and positively charged residues of the Fmn FSI peptide mediating major contacts to an acidic groove on the surface of KIND. Protein interaction studies verified the electrostatic nature of the interaction. The data presented here provide the molecular basis of the Spir/formin interaction and give a first structural view into the mechanisms of actin nucleation factor cooperativity."

Within the tail apparatus of P22-like phages, a dedicated fiber known as the ""tail needle"" likely functions as a cell envelope-penetrating device to promote ejection of viral DNA inside the host. In Sf6, a P22-like phage that infects Shigella flexneri, the tail needle presents a C-terminal globular knob. This knob, absent in phage P22 but shared in other members of the P22-like genus, represents the outermost exposed tip of the virion that contacts the host cell surface. Here, we report a crystal structure of the Sf6 tail needle knob determined at 1.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals a trimeric globular domain of the TNF fold structurally superimposable with that of the tail-less phage PRD1 spike protein P5 and the adenovirus knob, domains that in both viruses function in receptor binding. However, P22-like phages are not known to utilize a protein receptor and are thought to directly penetrate the host surface. At 1.0 Å resolution, we identified three equivalents of l-glutamic acid (l-Glu) bound to each subunit interface. Although intimately bound to the protein, l-Glu does not increase the structural stability of the trimer nor it affects its ability to self-trimerize in vitro. In analogy to P22 gp26, we suggest the tail needle of phage Sf6 is ejected through the bacterial cell envelope during infection and its C-terminal knob is threaded through peptidoglycan pores formed by glycan strands."
https://openalex.org/W2057302775,"It is widely assumed that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)-mediated specific inhibition of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) response involves GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation followed by β-arrestin binding and subsequent uncoupling from the heterotrimeric G protein. It has recently become evident that GRK2-mediated GPCRs regulation also involves phosphorylation-independent mechanisms. In the present study we investigated whether the histamine H2 receptor (H2R), a Gα(s)-coupled GPCR known to be desensitized by GRK2, needs to be phosphorylated for its desensitization and/or internalization and resensitization. For this purpose we evaluated the effect of the phosphorylating-deficient GRK2K220R mutant on H2R signaling in U937, COS7, and HEK293T cells. We found that although this mutant functioned as dominant negative concerning receptor internalization and resensitization, it desensitized H2R signaling in the same degree as the GRK2 wild type. To identify the domains responsible for the kinase-independent receptor desensitization, we co-transfected the receptor with constructions encoding the GRK2 RGS-homology domain (RH) and the RH or the kinase domain fused to the pleckstrin-homology domain. Results demonstrated that the RH domain of GRK2 was sufficient to desensitize the H2R. Moreover, disruption of RGS functions by the use of GRK2D110A/K220R double mutant, although coimmunoprecipitating with the H2R, reversed GRK2K220R-mediated H2R desensitization. Overall, these results indicate that GRK2 induces desensitization of H2R through a phosphorylation-independent and RGS-dependent mechanism and extends the GRK2 RH domain-mediated regulation of GPCRs beyond Gα(q)-coupled receptors. On the other hand, GRK2 kinase activity proved to be necessary for receptor internalization and the resulting resensitization."

Instead, MppA, a homologous substrate-binding protein, forms a functional transporter with OppBCDF for uptake of this unusual tripeptide. Here we have purified MppA and demonstrated biochemically that it binds Mtp with high affinity (KD ∼ 250 nm). The crystal structure of MppA in complex with Mtp has revealed that Mtp is bound in a relatively extended conformation with its three carboxylates projecting from one side of the molecule and its two amino groups projecting from the opposite face. Specificity for Mtp is conferred by charge-charge and dipole-charge interactions with ionic and polar residues of MppA. Comparison of the structure of MppA-Mtp with structures of conventional tripeptides bound to OppA, reveals that the peptide ligands superimpose remarkably closely given the profound differences in their structures. Strikingly, the effect of the d-stereochemistry, which projects the side chain of the d-Glu residue at position 2 in the direction of the main chain in a conventional tripeptide, is compensated by the formation of a γ-linkage to the amino group of diaminopimelic acid, mimicking the peptide bond between residues 2 and 3 of a conventional tripeptide.

The crystal structure of MppA in complex with Mtp has revealed that Mtp is bound in a relatively extended conformation with its three carboxylates projecting from one side of the molecule and its two amino groups projecting from the opposite face. Specificity for Mtp is conferred by charge-charge and dipole-charge interactions with ionic and polar residues of MppA. Comparison of the structure of MppA-Mtp with structures of conventional tripeptides bound to OppA, reveals that the peptide ligands superimpose remarkably closely given the profound differences in their structures. Strikingly, the effect of the d-stereochemistry, which projects the side chain of the d-Glu residue at position 2 in the direction of the main chain in a conventional tripeptide, is compensated by the formation of a γ-linkage to the amino group of diaminopimelic acid, mimicking the peptide bond between residues 2 and 3 of a conventional tripeptide."

LHCs increase the light-harvesting cross-section of photosystems I and II and catalyze photoprotective reactions that prevent light-induced damage in an oxygenic environment. The genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens contains two genes encoding LHCb9, a new antenna protein that bears an overall sequence similarity to photosystem II antenna proteins but carries a specific motif typical of photosystem I antenna proteins. This consists of the presence of an asparagine residue as a ligand for Chl 603 (A5) chromophore rather than a histidine, the common ligand in all other LHCbs. Asparagine as a Chl 603 (A5) ligand generates red-shifted spectral forms associated with photosystem I rather than with photosystem II, suggesting that in P. patens, the energy landscape of photosystem II might be different with respect to that of most green algae and plants. In this work, we show that the in vitro refolded LHCb9-pigment complexes carry a red-shifted fluorescence emission peak, different from all other known photosystem II antenna proteins.

Each photosystem has two moieties: (i) the core complex and (ii) the peripheral antenna system. The core complex contains mostly plastid-encoded subunits, which are responsible for charge separation and for the first steps of electron transport and are also active in light harvesting. An additional antenna system, made of nucleus-encoded subunits binding Chl a, Chl b, and xanthophylls, is localized peripherally in photosystems and is responsible for most light harvesting, transfer of excitation energy to the reaction centers, and photoprotective reactions like ROS scavenging and quenching of triplet and singlet excited states (1Mozzo M.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, six different polypeptides were identified for PSI (LHCa1 to -6) and a total of eight for PSII (LHCb1 to -8), including the more recent proposed addition of LHCb7 and LHCb8 (7Jansson S.

In the genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens, two sequences encoding an additional LHCb protein, named LHCb9, were also identified (9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T.

The fluorescence emission spectrum of plant thylakoids at low temperature shows two main emission peaks (i.e. 685 and 735 nm), which originate from the grana domains containing PSII-LHCII complexes and the stroma-exposed domains containing PSI-LHCI, respectively. The PSI emission originates from Chl a molecules absorbing at wavelengths higher than 700 nm, thus strongly red-shifted with respect to Chl a molecules in organic solvents. For this reason, they are often called “red Chls” or “red (spectral) forms.” Red Chls have been localized in the PSI antenna system, particularly in LHCa3 and LHCa4 (10Zhang H. Goodman H.M.

The nature of the ligand of Chl 603 plays a key role in the origin of “red” forms by determining the distance between the α-carbon chain and the bound chlorophyll. In fact, an asparagine coordinates Chl 603 in LHCa3 and LHCa4 and it holds the chromophore in a position allowing its strong interaction with Chl 609, which leads to formation of a charge transfer state and the appearance of red emission forms (18Morosinotto T.

In LHCa1 and LHCa2, the coordination by the bulkier histidine puts Chls 603 away from Chl 609, leading to a weaker interaction and a strong reduction of red forms (18Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). LHCb1 to -8 polypeptides, composing the antenna system of photosystem II, all have a histidine as Chl 603 ligand and do not show red-shifted emissions. LHCb9 is an exception because it carries an asparagine residue as the ligand for this chlorophyll (9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this work, we report on the characterization of the two LHCb9 isoforms encoded in the P. patens genome. The cDNA sequence was overexpressed in bacteria and reconstituted in vitro with pigments. The holoprotein showed a fluorescence emission peak red-shifted with respect to any other LHCb protein thus far described. We also show that LHCb9 is found in P. patens thylakoids and is indeed associated with PSII, in agreement with its overall sequence similarity to LHCb proteins. The possible function of red-shifted spectral forms in PSII and the reason for their presence in P. patens is discussed with reference to the adaptation of antenna systems to environmental growth conditions. LHCb9 and other LHC sequences from P. patens were retrieved from expressed sequence tag (PHYSCObase) and genome (Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute) databases as described (9Alboresi A.

Sequence information from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and The Plant Transcript Assemblies were mainly used for TBLASTN searches. Sequence alignments were generated by ClustalW and manually corrected using BioEdit. The regions of the three transmembrane helices were considered in the analysis, as described previously in similar works (22Durnford D.G. Deane J.A. Tan S. McFadden G.I. Gantt E. Green B.R. J. Mol.

Phylogenetic trees were inferred using parsimony, neighbor-joining distance, and maximum likelihood approaches using the Phylogenetic Inference Package (PHYLIP) version 3.67 and the PHYML program (24Guindon S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W557-W559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), as described previously (9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). LHCb9.1 (XM_001756491) and LHCb9.2 (XM_001779101) were amplified by PCR from total P. patens cDNA and cloned in a modified pET-28a(+) (26Caffarri S. Passarini F. Bassi R. Croce R. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4704-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The apoprotein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as inclusion bodies. Pigment-protein complexes were refolded in vitro and purified from excess free pigments (27Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The N164H mutant for LHCb9.2 (numbers refer to the precursor sequence) was obtained using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 300 (Varian Inc.) spectrophotometer, in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sucrose, and 0.06% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Cary Eclipse (Varian Inc.) and corrected for the instrumental response. Samples were excited at 440, 475, and 500 nm. The spectral bandwidth was 5 nm (excitation) and 3 nm (emission). Chlorophyll concentration was about 0.02 μg/ml in 60% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. Chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratio were independently measured by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (28Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and by HPLC analysis (29Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Protonemal tissue of P. patens, Gransden wild-type strain, was grown on PpNO3 minimum medium (30Ashton N.W. Grimsley N. Cove D.J. Planta. 1979; 144: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) solidified by 1% purified agar agar (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France). Plants were propagated under sterile conditions on minimum medium in 9-cm Petri dishes overlaid with a cellophane disk (Cannings, Bristol, UK) as described (31Trouiller B. Schaefer D.G. Charlot F. Nogué F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plates containing plant samples were placed in a growth chamber under controlled conditions: 22 °C day/21 °C night temperature, 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod, and a light intensity of 40 microeinsteins m−2 s−1 (10 microeinsteins m−2 s−1 for low light and 400 microeinsteins m−2 s−1 for high light). Thylakoids from 2-week-old plants (protonemal tissue) were prepared following the same protocol used for higher plants with minor modifications. Tissues were harvested and freshly homogenized in cold extraction buffer (0.5% milk powder, 0.4 m NaCl, 20 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8, and 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid). After filtration, samples were precipitated by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1500 × g for 15 min and then resuspended in an ipotonic buffer (15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8). After centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g, thylakoids were resuspended in a buffer containing 50% glycerol, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5. Thylakoids were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Purification of pigment-binding proteins from thylakoids was performed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation upon solubilization of membranes with final 0.8% n-dodecyl-α-d-maltopyranoside. SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as in Ref. 32Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. After SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Sartorious AG, Gottingen, Germany) using a blot system from Bio-Rad and detected with specific homemade antibodies (supplemental Fig. 1). To verify the identity of the LHCb9 band, antibody was preincubated for 1 h with total 35 μg of LHCb9.1 and LHCb9.2 inclusion bodies (17.5 μg each). In order to evaluate protein stoichiometry, we loaded 0.05, 0.03, 0.02, and 0.01 μg of Chl reconstituted protein together with 1.5, 1, 0.75, and 0.5 μg of Chl from thylakoids. Antibody signal was quantified by densitometry after checking its linearity with gel loading as in Ref. 33Ballottari M. Dall'Osto L. Morosinotto T. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8947-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar. In order to estimate LHCb9/PSII stoichiometry, we assumed that LHCb9 binds 10 ± 2 Chls/monomer. We also estimated Physcomitrella PSII antenna size using fluorescence induction in 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, whose kinetics are known to depend on the PSII functional antenna size. As a comparison, we used barley plants, WT and clorina f2 mutants, where PSII antenna size is known to be 300 and 50 Chls/PSII, respectively (34Melis A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1989; 323: 397-409Crossref Google Scholar). With this method, we could estimate PSII antenna size in Physcomitrella to be 529 ± 89 Chls/PSII. Final estimation is derived from green gels, like the ones in Ref. 9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, showing that 68% of thylakoid Chls are associated with PSII core or antenna complexes. The latter two values led to the calculation that in Physcomitrella thylakoids, there are 788 ± 132 Chls present for each PSII. The LHCII structure from Ref. 14Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank accession code 1RWT, was mutated using Swiss-PdbViewer (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). After mutating histidine into asparagine, the distance between Chl and protein backbone was manually corrected and fixed equal to Chl 612, which is also coordinated by asparagine. LHCb9 was identified in the P. patens genome as carrying peculiar sequence properties with respect to any other previously known LHC isoform (9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The polypeptide sequence showed a similarity to PSII antenna polypeptides and was thus called LHCb9. We identified two isoforms, LHCb9.1 and LHCb9.2, with 80% sequence identity. We observed that the number of expressed sequence tag clones identified in P. patens databases is particularly high for both LHCb9 isoforms; LHCb9.1 is the most abundant transcript among antenna proteins (9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Assuming that the number of expressed sequence tag clones retrieved is roughly indicative of gene expression levels (8Klimmek F. Sjödin A. Noutsos C. Leister D. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), LHCb9.1 is thus presumably a highly expressed LHC gene in P. patens, suggesting a relevant functional role for the corresponding polypeptide in the moss photosynthetic apparatus. In Fig. 1, the sequence of LHCb9 is compared with those of other LHCb proteins. In the phylogenetic tree, LHCb9 sequences are located between monomeric LHCb proteins (LHCb4, LHCb5, and LHCb6) and the components of the major LHCII antenna complex (named LHCbm1 to -13 in P. patens). In fact, although LHCb9 sequences cluster with major antenna polypeptides, the consistency of this configuration is low, ranging from 32 to 56–100, depending on the algorithm employed. In fact, LHCb9.1 has 50% similarity and 30% identity with both sequences encoding major antenna polypeptides (i.e. PpLHCbm1 and -2 and PpLHCb3) and the minor antenna protein PpLHCb5. Similarity is instead lower when compared with PpLHCb4 and PpLHCb6 sequences. Sequence analysis is useful to infer information on protein biochemistry and activity. We therefore looked closer at Chl-binding residues highly conserved in LHCs (14Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 15Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 36Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandonà D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and found that they are all conserved in LHCb9 (Fig. 2). An LHCb9 peculiarity is that Chl 603 is coordinated by an asparagine rather than a histidine as in all other LHCb polypeptides. Because both asparagine and histidine can coordinate the Mg2+ in Chl rings, pigment binding is probably unaffected (Fig. 2). A further characteristic of LHCb9 is the non-conservation of the histidine residue, as reported for LHCb6 polypeptide (7Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It should be noticed, however, that an extra histidine is found in a nearby position in helix D and could coordinate Chl 614 according to the hypothesis that helix D assumes a different orientation than in other LHC proteins (Fig. 2). Xanthophyll coordination in LHC proteins is most likely due to multiple interactions with the polypeptide, and sequence motifs for carotenoid binding are not well defined yet. Sites L1 and L2 are conserved in all LHC members analyzed so far (37Morosinotto T. Caffarri S. Dall'Osto L. Bassi R. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 347-354Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Schmid V.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3619-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and are likely to be present in LHCb9 as well. A conserved tyrosine residue in LHCb1, LHCb4, and LHCb5 has been shown to be fundamental for neoxanthin binding to site N1 (26Caffarri S. Passarini F. Bassi R. Croce R. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4704-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This tyrosine is also conserved in LHCb9 (position 209; Fig. 2), suggesting that it binds neoxanthin. The capacity of LHCII polypeptides to form trimers depends on the presence of residues in the N-terminal domain WYR (indicated as a trimerization motif in Fig. 2) (39Hobe S. Förster R. Klingler J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10224-10228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A WYR motif is also found in LHCb5, although this is normally associated with PSII as a monomer (40Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and only trimerizes in LHCII-depleted plants (41Ruban A.V. Solovieva S. Lee P.J. Ilioaia C. Wentworth M. Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Chow W.S. Anderson J.M. Jansson S. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In LHCb9, the first tryptophan of the motif is substituted by a tyrosine, suggesting a low probability of finding trimers, including LHCb9, in P. patens WT thylakoids. The presence of an asparagine replacing the more common histidine as a ligand for Chl 603 is typical of LHC members associated with PSI, such as A. thaliana LHCa3 and LHCa4 (9Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Bassi R. Morosinotto T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 42Elrad D. Grossman A.R. Curr.

In order to verify if the asparagine ligand can induce red-shifted Chl spectral forms even within a LHCb-like sequence, we cloned and expressed the two LHCb9 isoforms in E. coli using total P. patens cDNA as a template. LHCb9 apoproteins were purified from inclusion bodies and refolded in vitro in the presence of pigments using a well established procedure (27Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both LHCb9 polypeptides yielded stable monomeric pigment-binding proteins. Pigment compositions of the reconstituted complexes are reported in Table 1, together with reference data from Hordeum vulgare LHCb2 reconstituted in vitro using the same procedure (44Caffarri S. Croce R. Cattivelli L. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9467-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). HvLHCb2 was chosen because its primary sequence is the most similar to LHCb9 among the LHCb isoforms characterized previously. Chl a/b ratios are very similar in all complexes (from 1.4 to 1.5; Table 1), suggesting that LHCb9 has a high affinity for Chl b, similar to LHCII members and different from monomeric LHCs, which have a higher Chl a/b ratio (i.e. a Chl a/b ratio of 2.0–2.2 and 3.0 for LHCb5 and LHCb4, respectively) (26Caffarri S.

In contrast, xanthophyll-binding properties of LHCb9 are more similar to those of minor LHCbs because it preferentially binds violaxanthin and lutein, whereas neoxanthin content is low with respect to LHCb2, a component of the major LHCII trimeric antenna.TABLE 1Pigment binding properties of LHCb9 reconstituted in vitroChl a/Chl bCarotenoidsNeoxanthinViolaxanthinLuteinPpLHCb9.11.3524.93.74.416.7PpLHCb9.21.3427.45.35.316.8HvLHCb21.3623.68.21.214.1 Open table in a new tab Chl/protein binding stoichiometry of LHCb9 is not known, but it is most likely comprised between 9 and 12 Chls/monomer, as found experimentally in LHCb5 and LHCb2, respectively, reconstituted in vitro.

Absorption spectra showed a Chl a Qy peak at 675.5 nm (Fig. 3, A and B), and an efficient energy transfer from xanthophylls and Chl b to Chl a, typical for all functional LHC proteins, was observed by the constancy of fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation at 430 nm (Chl a), 470 nm (Chl b), and 500 nm (xanthophylls) (not shown). LHCb9 absorption spectra are similar to that of HvLHCb2 (Fig. 3A), in agreement with their similar pigment content (44Caffarri S. Croce R. Cattivelli L. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9467-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the red-most part of the spectra showed differences, and both LHCb9 isoforms have a more red-shifted absorption with respect to HvLHCb2 (Fig. 3B). The fitting of the Qy region of the spectrum with spectral forms of Chl a in a protein environment yields information on pigment composition and protein structure (28Croce R. Canino G. Ros F.

Hice1 possesses direct microtubule binding activity at its N-terminal region and contributes to intraspindle microtubule nucleation as a subunit of the Augmin complex. However, whether microtubule binding activity of Hice1 is modulated by mitotic regulators remains unexplored. Here, we found that Aurora-A kinase, a major mitotic kinase, specifically binds to and phosphorylates Hice1. We identified four serine/threonine clusters on Hice1 that can be phosphorylated by Aurora-A in vitro. Of the four clusters, the Ser/Thr-17–21 cluster was the most critical for bipolar spindle assembly, whereas other phospho-deficient point mutants had a minimal effect on spindle assembly. Immunostaining with a phospho-Ser-19/20 phospho-specific antibody revealed that phosphorylated Hice1 primarily localizes to spindle poles during prophase to metaphase but gradually diminishes after anaphase. Consistently, the phospho-mimic 17–21E mutant reduced microtubule binding activity in vitro and diminished localization to spindles in vivo. Furthermore, expression of the 17–21E mutant led to decreased association of Fam29a, an Augmin component, with spindles. On the other hand, expression of the phospho-deficient 17–21A mutant permitted intraspindle nucleation but delayed the separation of early mitotic spindle poles and the timely mitotic progression.

https://openalex.org/W2154614960,"Induction of endotoxin tolerance leads to a reduced inflammatory response after repeated challenge by LPS and is important for resolution of inflammation and prevention of tissue damage. Enterobacterial LPS is recognized by the TLR4 signaling complex, whereas LPS of some non-enterobacterial organisms is capable of signaling independently of TLR4 utilizing TLR2-mediated signal transduction instead. In this study we report that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS, a TLR2 agonist, fails to induce a fully endotoxin tolerant state in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. In contrast to significantly decreased production of human IL-8 and TNF-α and, in mice, keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and TNF-α after repeated challenge with Escherichia coli LPS, cells repeatedly exposed to P. gingivalis LPS responded by producing less TNF-α but sustained elevated secretion of IL-8, KC, and MIP-2. Furthermore, in endotoxin-tolerant cells, production of IL-8 is controlled at the signaling level and correlates well with NF-κB activation, whereas TNF-α expression is blocked at the gene transcription level. Interferon β plays an important role in attenuation of chemokine expression in endotoxin-tolerized cells as shown in interferon regulatory factor-3 knock-out mice. In addition, human gingival fibroblasts, commonly known not to display LPS tolerance, were found to be tolerant to repeated challenge by LPS if pretreated with interferon β. The data suggest that the inability of the LPS-TLR2 complex to induce full endotoxin tolerance in monocytes/macrophages is related to diminished production of interferon β and may partly explain the involvement of these LPS isoforms in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases."

The helix-turn-helix structure in the C-terminal domain of the β subunit containing the conserved DELSEED motif, termed “DELSEED-loop,” was suggested to be involved in coupling between catalysis and rotation. If this is indeed the role of the loop, it must have a critical length, the minimum length required to sustain its function. Here, the critical length of the DELSEED-loop was determined by functional analysis of mutants of Bacillus PS3 ATP synthase that had 7–14 amino acids within the loop deleted. A 10 residue deletion lost the ability to catalyze ATP synthesis, but was still an active ATPase. Deletion of 14 residues abolished any enzymatic activity. Modeling indicated that in both deletion mutants the DELSEED-loop was shortened by ∼10 Å; fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed the modeling results. This appears to define the minimum length for DELSEED-loop required for coupling of catalysis and rotation. In addition, we could demonstrate that the loss of high-affinity binding to the catalytic site(s) that had been observed previously in two deletion mutants with 3–4 residues removed was not due to the loss of negative charged residues of the DELSEED motif in these mutants.

F1Fo-ATP synthase catalyzes the final step of oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation, the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. F1Fo-ATP synthase consists of the membrane-embedded Fo subcomplex with, in most bacteria, a subunit composition of ab2c10, and the peripheral F1 subcomplex, with a subunit composition of α3β3γδϵ. The energy necessary for ATP synthesis is derived from an electrochemical transmembrane proton (or, in some organisms, sodium ion) gradient. Proton flow, down the gradient, through Fo is coupled to ATP synthesis on F1 by a unique rotary mechanism. The protons flow through (half) channels at the interface of a and c subunits, which drives rotation of the ring of c subunits. The c10 ring, together with F1 subunits γ and ϵ, forms the rotor. Rotation of γ leads to conformational changes in the catalytic nucleotide binding sites on the β subunits, where ADP and Pi are bound. The conformational changes result in formation and release of ATP. Thus, ATP synthase converts electrochemical energy, the proton gradient, into mechanical energy in form of subunit rotation, and back into chemical energy as ATP. In bacteria, under certain physiological conditions, the process runs in reverse. ATP is hydrolyzed to generate a transmembrane proton gradient which the bacterium requires for such functions as nutrient import and locomotion (for reviews, see Refs. 1Noji H. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

F1 (or “F1-ATPase”) has three catalytic nucleotide binding sites, located on the β subunits, at the interface to the adjacent α subunit. The catalytic sites have pronounced differences in their nucleotide binding affinity. During rotational catalysis, the sites switch their affinities in a synchronized manner; the position of γ determines which catalytic site is the high-affinity site (Kd1 in the nanomolar range), which site is the medium-affinity site (Kd2 ≈ 1 μm), and which site is the low-affinity site (Kd3 ≈ 30–100 μm; see Refs. 7Weber J.

Hence, the β subunits are referred to βTP, βDP, and βE. The occupied β subunits, βTP and βDP, were in a closed conformation, the empty βE subunit was in an open conformation. The main difference between these two conformations is found in the C-terminal domain. Here, the “DELSEED-loop,” a helix-turn-helix structure containing the conserved DELSEED motif, is in an “up” position when the catalytic site on the respective β subunit is filled with nucleotide, and in a “down” position when the site is empty. When all three catalytic sites are occupied by nucleotide, the previously open βE subunit assumes an intermediate, half-closed (“βHC”) conformation. It cannot close completely because of steric clashes with γ (11Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W.

The finding that an AALSAAA mutant was able to drive rotation of γ upon ATP hydrolysis with the same torque as the wild-type enzyme (14Hara K.Y. Noji H. Bald D. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14260-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that the negatively charged amino acid residues of the DELSEED motif are not essential. In agreement with this result, there is increasing evidence that it is the bulk of the DELSEED-loop that makes γ rotate, more so than individual interactions. A molecular dynamics (20Pu J. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) study implicated mainly the region around several hydrophobic residues upstream of the DELSEED motif (specifically βI386 and βL387) 3Bacillus PS3 numbering is used throughout. as being responsible for making contact with γ during the large rotation substep. We could recently show (12Mnatsakanyan N. Krishnakumar A.M. Suzuki T. Weber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that no individual residue at the β/γ interface is essential, using deletion mutants of Bacillus PS3 ATP synthase that had their DELSEED-loops shortened by 3–7 residues. Every residue between βL380 and βR402 was included in at least one of the deletion mutants. According to the crystal structures, residues between βD382 and βD394 are involved in β/γ contacts. The deletion mutants covering this latter stretch were all active ATPases and ATP synthases, albeit most of them were less well coupled than the wild-type (12Mnatsakanyan N. Krishnakumar A.M. Suzuki T. Weber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If the DELSEED-loop drives rotation of γ during ATP hydrolysis, it should not be possible to reduce its length beyond a certain limit. In the present study, our main goal was to define the critical length of the DELSEED-loop, the minimal length necessary to sustain catalysis. For this purpose, we generated deletion mutants where longer stretches of between 7 and 14 residues in the DELSEED-loop of PS3 ATP synthase were removed. A deletion of 10 residues essentially abolished ATP synthesis; a deletion of 14 residues resulted in the additional loss of ATPase activity. According to modeling data, in these mutants the DELSEED-loop is shortened by 10 Å or more. This was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). A reduction by 10 Å appears to define the critical length of the loop; beyond this point the capability to catalyze ATP synthesis and hydrolysis ceases. In the previous study (12Mnatsakanyan N. Krishnakumar A.M. Suzuki T. Weber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that two deletions encompassing residues of the DELSEED motif itself resulted in “loss” of the high-affinity catalytic nucleotide binding site. Here we show that this loss is not due to the associated removal of the negative charges. The quintuple point mutation, AALSAAA, exhibited normal binding behavior, with the high-affinity catalytic site clearly present. The functional role of the DELSEED-loop will be discussed in light of the new information. Plasmid pTR19-ASDS, which carries the genes for the F1Fo-ATP synthase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (21Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was used to generate deletion mutants. All deletion mutations investigated here were based on combinations of mutants from a previous study. In addition, we generated the quintuple point mutant, β390AALSAAA396. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed in such a way that, in addition to the desired mutation, a restriction site would be eliminated or generated, to facilitate screening. Deletions were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type and mutated plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain DK8 which does not express E. coli ATP synthase (22Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AALSAAA mutation was also introduced in plasmid pNM2. Plasmid pNM2 is a derivative of plasmid pKAGB1 (23Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pKAGB1 is used to express a Cys- and Trp-less form of the α3β3γ subcomplex of PS3. pNM1 contains an additional mutation to generate a His10 tag at the N terminus of the β subunits, to facilitate protein purification. pNM2 is pNM1 with a βY341W mutation, allowing to monitor nucleotide binding to the three catalytic sites. For expression, pNM2 and the derived AALSAAA mutant were transformed into E. coli strain JM103 Δ(uncB-uncD). For construction of a plasmid that only expresses the β subunit, a TAA stop codon and an NheI restriction site were inserted immediately downstream of the ATG start codon for the α subunit gene. The presence of a natural NheI site at the end of the gene encoding γ subunit allowed us to remove the genes for α and γ by removing the NheI- NheI fragment. The resultant plasmid was named pNM1A6. The same construct was made in plasmid encoding the Δ381QDIIAIL387+392LSD394 (“Δ10”) deletion mutant. Additional point mutations (βY364W, βM389C, and βL398C) were introduced into the wt and Δ10 pNM1A6 plasmids to enable the fluorescence energy transfer measurements in isolated β subunits. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression, the plasmids were transformed into strain DK8. E. coli strain DK8 harboring wild-type or mutated pTR19-ASDS plasmids was aerobically cultivated at 37 °C for 18 h in 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Inverted membrane vesicles from E. coli cells expressing thermophilic F1Fo were prepared as described (21Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

The relative amount of mutant F1Fo the membranes was estimated via Western blots, using an anti-β antibody (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden). The staining intensity was quantified using a Photodyne imaging system and Image J acquisition software (NIH). The purification method of α3β3γ subcomplex is modified from a previously described procedure (25Adachi K. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in terrific broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After cell lysis by French Press the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing complex was applied to a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm imidazole and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and the enzyme was eluted with 500 mm imidazole and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The preparation of the isolated β subunit followed the same protocol. The proteins were stored as precipitate in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. Growth of strains expressing wild-type or mutant PS3 ATP synthase in limiting glucose, ATPase activities (including temperature dependence), ATP synthase activities, NADH- and ATP-driven H+-pumping, and nucleotide binding to the catalytic sites were determined as described previously (12Mnatsakanyan N.

FRET experiments were performed to measure the distance between a Trp in position β364 and an IAEDANS-labeled Cys in positions β389 and β398 in an isolated β subunit. (To simplify the nomenclature, we will refer to the extrinsic probe as IAEDANS even after its reaction with Cys, which removes the “I” standing for “iodo”.) A stock solution of IAEDANS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Isolated β subunit was passed through a 1 ml Sephadex G-50 centrifuge column, equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0. The protein was labeled by incubation with 1 mm IAEDANS for 1 h at 23 °C in the dark. Τhe reaction was stopped by passing the protein through two Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 8.0. Unlabeled β subunit was passed through two Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns, equilibrated with the same buffer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 23 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 8.0, using a spectrofluorometer type Fluorolog 3 (HORIBA Jovin Yvon, Edison, NY). In the FRET experiments, the fluorescence of the donor βW364 was measured in absence and in presence of the acceptor, the IAEDANS-labeled βC389 or βC398. From the decrease in fluorescence intensity (λexc = 295 nm; λem = 340 nm) the energy transfer efficiency was calculated. For determination of the critical transfer distance, R0, where the transfer efficiency is 50%, the quantum yield of βW364 was determined to be 0.10, using N-acetyl-tryptophanamide as standard (Φ = 0.14; Ref. 27Szabo A.G. Rayner D.M. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 554-563Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Assuming values of 2/3 and 1.4 for the orientation factor, κ2, and the refractive index, n, respectively, the R0 value for the donor/acceptor pair Trp/IAEDANS was calculated to be 20 Å. This is close to the value of 22 Å frequently cited in the literature (28Matsumoto S. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Obviously, the value will vary for different Trp donors, based on their quantum yield and wavelength position (which affects the overlap integral). From the transfer efficiency and R0, the distance between donor and acceptor was calculated (Ref. 29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Edition. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17915) Google Scholar; see also supplemental Fig. S1). For anisotropy measurements, the instrument was equipped with Glan-Thompson polarizers. For determination of the anisotropy of βW364, λexc was 300 nm and λem was 340 nm; for determination of the anisotropy of β-bound IAEDANS, λexc was 360 nm and λem was 480 nm. Anisotropies were measured as described in Ref. 29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Edition. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17915) Google Scholar, using the L-format method. For estimation of the rotational mobility of the protein-bound fluorophors, the values used were as follows. Trp: fundamental anisotropy, r0, 0.31; fluorescence lifetime, τ, 3 ns (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Edition. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17915) Google Scholar). IAEDANS: r0, 0.33 (30Hudson E.N. Weber G.

The rotational correlation time of the isolated β subunit was assumed to be 30 ns (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Edition. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17915) Google Scholar). Homology modeling including energy minimization refinement was performed using the program PRIME (Schroedinger Inc.). The template was the structure of bovine mitochondrial enzyme, Protein Data Bank file 1h8e (11Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In a previous study (12Mnatsakanyan N. Krishnakumar A.M. Suzuki T. Weber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we had removed stretches of 3–4 contiguous residues from the helix-turn-helix structure known as “DELSEED-loop” in the C-terminal domain of the β subunit of ATP synthase: Δ380LQDI383, Δ384IAIL387, Δ388GMDE391, Δ392LSD394, Δ395EDKL398, and Δ399VVHR402 (it should be noted that in Bacillus PS3 the DELSEED motif is actually 390DELSDED396). In addition, we could obtain one longer deletion mutant with 7 residues removed, Δ381QDIIAIL387. Modeling of these deletion mutants suggested that in all cases, including the 7 residue deletion, Δ381QDIIAIL387, the overall length of the DELSEED-loop was hardly affected (reduced by ≤ 3 Å). Thus, it was obvious that longer deletion were necessary to shorten the loop significantly. In the present study, we combined several of the previous deletions, Δ380LQDI383+392LSD394 (termed “Δ7” in the following), Δ381QDIIAIL387+392LSD394 (“Δ10”), and Δ381QDIIAILGMDELSD394 (“Δ14”). We also included the quintuple point mutant β390AALSAAA396 in the investigation. It had been shown that an α3β3γ subcomplex containing AALSAAA was able to rotate γ with the same torque as the wild-type (14Hara K.Y. Noji H. Bald D. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14260-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In growth yield assays in limiting glucose strain pTR19-ASDS/DK8, expressing wild-type PS3 F1Fo in E. coli, grew to a turbidity (measured as absorbance at 590 nm) of 62% of that of the control strain pBWU13.4/DK8, expressing “native” wild-type E. coli ATP synthase. The negative (unc−) control, strain pUC118/DK8, reached 38% of the value for strain pBWU13.4/DK8 and 62% of the value for strain pTR19-ASDS/DK8. One deletion mutant, Δ7, showed growth yields significantly higher than the negative control, but clearly below the value for the wild-type PS3 enzyme (Table 1). One of the other deletion mutants, Δ10, exhibited growth yields similar to those of the negative control, indicating loss of the capability of oxidative phosphorylation. Δ14 grew less well than the negative control, which might be the result of severe uncoupling and/or of proton leaks through the membrane, possibly due to an incorrectly assembled enzyme. In contrast, the AALSAAA mutant was only slightly impaired in its ability to catalyze ATP synthesis in vivo.TABLE 1Oxidative phosphorylation in vivo and ATP synthesis activities in vitroStrain/mutationGrowth yields in limiting glucoseAmount of F1Fo on membranesNADH-driven ATP synthesis activityTurnover rate kcat% wild-type% total proteinmU/mgs−1Wild-type100 ± 320 ± 549 ± 122.2pUC118/DK8 (unc−)62 ± 300.2 ± 2.3Δ7 (Δ380LQDI383+392LSD394)76 ± 313 ± 314 ± 41.0Δ10 (Δ381QDIIAIL387+392LSD394)60 ± 320 ± 40.4 ± 2.4< 0.1Δ14 (Δ381QDIIAILGMDELSD394)47 ± 30.9 ± 0.8−0.6 ± 3.00aSee text.390AALSAAA39689 ± 422 ± 391 ± 113.7a See text. Open table in a new tab In addition to the in vivo growth assay to monitor oxidative phosphorylation, we measured NADH-driven ATP synthesis in vitro. At 42 °C, the wild-type PS3 enzyme in E. coli membrane vesicles showed an ATP synthesis activity of 49 mU per mg membrane protein. As in the in vivo assay, the deletion mutant Δ7 exhibited some ATP synthesis activity, while Δ10 and Δ14 had no significantly higher activity than the negative control lacking ATP synthase (Table 1). Besides being a direct consequence of a mutation, lack of activity can be due to lack of expression or to oligomeric instability of the enzyme; thus, it was necessary to quantify the amount of enzyme on the membranes. The amount of wild-type PS3 F1Fo in E. coli membrane preparations was found to be ∼20% of the total membrane protein (this study, and Ref. 21Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Membrane preparations containing PS3 ATP synthase with the deletions Δ7 and Δ10 had at least 65% of the amount of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1), demonstrating that the lack of ATP synthesis activity observed for Δ10 is indeed a characteristic of the enzyme and not due to expression or stability problems. The Δ14 deletion mutant exhibited only a small amount of ATP synthase on the membranes. Whereas the mutant appears to have lost its capability to catalyze ATP synthesis, it should be noted that even wild-type-like activity of the remaining ATP synthesis molecules would not have resulted in activity values significantly higher than the standard deviation. The AALSAAA mutant synthesized ATP at a higher rate than the wild-type enzyme. As can be seen in Table 2, 2 deletion mutants, Δ7 and Δ10, showed ATPase activity roughly similar to wild-type. Δ14 had no ATPase activity beyond the background, even when the assay was performed using a high concentration of membranes (0.5 mg protein per ml instead of 0.05–0.15 mg/ml) and an extended incubation time (20 min instead of 1–5 min). We estimated that under these conditions we would have been able to detect an activity of ∼5 mU/mg over background. Even taking the low amount of ATP synthase in the membranes into account, this means that the Δ14 mutant has a turnover rate of less than 5 s−1, i.e. less than 5% of the activity of the wild-type. The AALSAAA mutant reached Vmax turnover rates similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). When the ATPase assay was performed at lower MgATP concentrations (20 μm MgSO4 and 50 μm ATP instead of 4 mm MgSO4 and 10 mm ATP), the activity of the AALSAAA mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (3.8 s−1 for AALSAAA, 1.7 s−1 for wild-type). It should be noted that a mutant where the C-terminal domain of the ϵ subunit was removed, ϵI88stop, behaved similar to the AALSAAA mutant: increased ATP synthesis activity compared with wild-type, no effect on ATPase activity at saturating MgATP concentrations (26Mnatsakanyan N. Hook J.A. Quisenberry L. Weber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26519-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and increased ATPase at lower MgATP concentrations (2.7 s−1 at 20 μm MgSO4 and 50 μm ATP).TABLE 2ATPase activities of membrane vesicles of deletion mutantsStrain/mutationMembrane ATPase activityTurnover rate kcatActivation energy Eaunit/mgs−1kJ/molWild-type2.6 ± 0.411470.1pUC118/DK8 (unc−)0.018 ± 0.014Δ7 (Δ380LQDI383+392LSD394)2.0 ± 0.213673.0Δ10 (Δ381QDIIAIL387+392LSD394)1.6 ± 0.27154.9Δ14 (Δ381QDIIAILGMDELSD394)0.016 ± 0.0220aSee text.390AALSAAA3963.2 ± 0.412941.4a See text.

The oxyimino-cephalosporin-specific fluorescence profile of our engineered β-lactamase also demonstrates the possibility of designing substrate-selective biosensing systems. Numerous β-lactamases (over 400) have emerged in the past decades; as a result of rapid molecular evolution under the selective pressure of extensive usage of β-lactam antibiotics (reviewed in Refs. 1Drawz S.M.

Sci. 2009; 10: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These enzymes are divided into four classes (A–D) based on the homology of their amino acid sequence and catalytic mechanism. The catalytic mechanisms of Classes A, C, and D are highly similar, consisting of an acylation step catalyzed by Ser-70 leading to the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate with the β-lactam acylated to the side chain Ser-70 (E + S → ES*), and a subsequent deacylation step catalyzed by Glu-166 to release the hydrolyzed antibiotics in the form of “opened” β-lactam ring and restore the enzyme to its free form (ES* → E + P) (residue numbering according to the clinically significant TEM-1 β-lactamase). Class B employs a distinct metal-dependent acylation and deacylation process (1Drawz S.M. Bonomo R.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 23: 160-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 2Fisher J.F.

While sharing a common catalytic mechanism, the various β-lactamases differ significantly in their substrate profile toward the large number of clinically available β-lactam antibiotics (1Drawz S.M.

Sci. 2009; 10: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These enzymes undergo rapid molecular evolution on a time scale of several years by acquiring single or multiple mutations at certain strategic “hot-spots” that result in drastic expansion of their substrate profile toward newer generation antibiotics (1Drawz S.M.

Sci. 2009; 10: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One such hot spot for evolutionary mutation is the Ω-loop, a short stretch of residues on the surface of the β-lactamase structure that folds back to form part of the enzyme active site (1Drawz S.M.

For the narrow-spectrum β-lactamases such as PenP and PenPC used in our study as well as the clinically significant TEM-1 and SHV-1 enzymes the Ω-loop is tightly packed onto the enzyme active site through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, posing as steric hindrance for the binding of second or third generation cephalosporins with bulky side chains attached onto the cephem nucleus (1Drawz S.M.

Mutation at one residue of the Ω-loop, i.e. residue Arg-164, is found in over 50% of TEM-1 variants (1Drawz S.M. Bonomo R.A. Clin. Microbiol.

For certain Class C β-lactamases that are generally ESBLs, the corresponding region of the Ω-loop is significantly extended as compared with that of Class A β-lactamases, resulting in an enlarged active site that readily binds to and hydrolyzes almost all cephalosporins (1Drawz S.M.

We are interested in the molecular mechanism of how enhanced structural flexibility in the Ω-loop of a β-lactamase affects its substrate profile. So far among the large number of experimentally determined β-lactamase structures, the Ω-loop appears to adopt a well-defined conformation that is little affected by different substrates. No experimental data are yet available that clearly demonstrate the range of possible dynamic conformations of the Ω-loop and correlate such flexibility to the substrate profile. To address this issue we set out to engineer a β-lactamase that allows us to probe its structural dynamics and substrate binding at the active site. The principle of our design is to conjugate an environment-sensitive fluorophore reporter group to residue 166 on the Ω-loop after E166C mutation. Such an engineered β-lactamase enzyme would lose its critical residue (E166) for the deacylation step of the catalysis and becomes an acylation-competent but deacylation-impaired β-lactam-binding protein that readily forms the stable ES* acyl-enzyme intermediate. The fluorophore molecule, with its proximity to the active site and the Ω-loop, could potentially report the event of substrate binding as well as any conformational change in the Ω-loop induced by such binding, if these events lead to changes in the polarity of the local environment (4Chan P.H.

For our design we decided to use the naphthalene-type fluorophore molecules because of their exceptional solvachromatic properties that can reflect the polarity of the local environmental at the molecule level, as well as their relative small size comparable to the amino acid, tryptophan, to allow them to be positioned close to the protein structure (7Loving G.

The expression and purification of PenP-E166C are described under supplemental data. Before BADAN labeling, the purified PenP-E166C protein was mixed with 2 m guanidine HCl (GdHCl) (pH adjusted to 7–7.5 with KOH), and the final concentration of protein was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. The protein solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. A 10-fold molar excess of BADAN at the concentration of 20 mm was dissolved in DMF and added to the protein solution drop by drop. The mixture was shaken at 300 rpm at room temperature for 2 h in darkness, and then dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 4 °C overnight by dialysis tubing with the cut-off size of 12 kDa to remove excess dyes or GdHCl. Buffer exchanges were carried out regularly during dialysis. After three buffer exchanges the protein solution was concentrated by Amicon® Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore NMWL = 10,000) to less than 1 ml and loaded into the SuperdexTM 75 gel filtration column from GE Healthcare. The running buffer contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl with a pH value of 7.5. The flow-rate was 1 ml/min. The eluted protein was pooled and concentrated by Amicon Ultra to 20 mg/ml. Assessment of the labeling efficiency by ESI-MS is described under supplemental data. The expression, purification, and BADAN labeling of PenP-E166C-E168L protein were identical to those of PenP-E166C. The E168L mutation was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Measurement of the fluorescence scanning spectra (from 410 to 600 nm) of PenP-E166Cb and PenP-E166Cb-E168L in the presence of six cephalosporins and in the presence of cefotaxime at various concentrations were performed in the same procedure as previously published (6Chan P.H. Liu H.B. Chen Y.W. Chan K.C. Tsang C.W. Leung Y.C. Wong K.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4074-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and are described in detail under supplemental data. The binding kinetics of PenP and PenPC, both in wild-type form, the E166C mutant form and the BADAN-labeled E166Cb form in the presence of cefotaxime and penicillin G were measured by ESI-MS following the same procedure as reported in our previous study (4Chan P.H. So P.K. Ma D.L. Zhao Y. Lai T.S. Chung W.H. Chan K.C. Yiu K.F. Chan H.W. Siu F.M. Tsang C.W. Leung Y.C. Wong K.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 6351-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzyme-substrate binding reaction was initiated by mixing 70 μl of 5 μm His6-tagged PenP-E166C and His6-tagged PenP-E166Cb (in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0) with 70 μl of 10 μm antibiotic (penicillin G and cefotaxime, in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0) at room temperature. At desired time intervals, the reaction was quenched, and the reaction mixture was subjected to ESI-MS characterization. Mass spectra identified two major peaks that corresponded to the free enzyme E and the enzyme-substrate complex ES*, respectively. The relative amount of ES* can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of ES* to the total amount of the enzyme, [ES*]/[Etotal], where [ES*] is the peak intensity of ES* and [Etotal] (= [E] + [ES*]) is the sum of peak intensities of ES* and E. Further technical details can be found under the supplemental data. Crystals of PenP-E166Cb were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. A concentrated solution of PenP-E166Cb protein (∼20 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer with 50 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m Hepes at pH 7.2. Crystals grew to ∼100 μm size after 2 weeks. The presence of the BADAN fluorophore in the crystals was confirmed by their fluorescence signal (supplemental Fig. S6). For data collection, crystals were harvested and cryoprotected in reservoir solution plus 20% ethylene glycol for 1 min before mounted to the Rigaku MicroMaxTM-007HF x-ray machine. Data sets were collected and processed by CrystalClearTM 1.3.5 SP2. The crystals belonged to the monoclinic group P21 with a cell parameter of a = 43.8 Å, b = 91.3 Å, c = 66.5 Å and diffracted to 1.86 Å. There were two molecules per asymmetric unit. Cefotaxime and cephaloridine were soaked into crystals of PenP-E166Cb by incubating crystals in reservoir solution with addition of cefotaxime and cephaloridine respectively at final concentration of 0.01 m for 20 min. A summary of the data collection and soaking conditions is presented in supplemental Table ST1. When crystals were initially mounted to the x-ray machine after quick cryoprotection, the electron density for BADAN was rather poor, while that for the rest of the protein structure was excellent. The electron density for BADAN was greatly improved after the crystals had been subjected to a long period of stabilization (1–3 h) in the cryoprotection step. Finally an electron density map of high quality was obtained for BADAN to allow us to build the BADAN molecule with confidence. For one data set the maps were sufficiently good to allow fitting of the whole BADAN molecule into the electron density for both PenP-E166Cb molecules in the asymmetric unit. Subsequent structure refinement confirmed the coordinates for BADAN molecule were stable after several rounds of refinement. Data processing and structure determination were done using the CCP4i software package. COOT program was used for manual structure rebuilding. The coordinates and structure factors from this study have been deposited into Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession codes 3KGM (PenP-E166Cb), 3KGN (PenP-E166Cb-cefotaxime), and 3KGO (PenP-E166Cb-cephaloridine). Mutation of E166C for PenP and subsequent expression and purification of PenP-E166C were carried out following standard protocols. BADAN labeling of PenP-E166Cb was performed by mixing the purified PenP-E166C protein with BADAN solution in excess at a molar ration of 1:10 under mildly denaturing conditions of 2 m GdHCl (Fig. 1a) to achieve best efficiency and the labeled PenP-E166Cb protein was subsequently refolded by dialysis. Labeling efficiency was significantly enhanced by this denaturing step as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) (supplemental Fig. S1). The denaturing and refolding steps in the process of BADAN labeling induced little overall structural change of the enzyme as measured by CD spectrum (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm that the engineered PenP-E166Cb was indeed acylation-competent and deacylation-impaired, its enzyme kinetics as well as that of a related β-lactamase with the same BADAN labeling (PenPC-E166Cb), were measured by ESI-MS. The ESI-MS spectra demonstrate that PenP-E166Cb can readily form stable ES* acyl adducts with two representative substrates of penicillin G and cefotaxime (Fig. 1b). The binding profile of PenP-E166Cb toward cefotaxime, a third-generation extended-spectrum cephalosporin and a naturally poor substrate for the wild-type PenP, is significantly improved as compared with that of PenP-E166C (Fig. 1b). For the related enzyme PenPC from Bacillus cereus, the BADAN-labeled PenPC-E166Cb is acylation-competent, with slightly improved acylation kinetics (Km) of ∼6 times as compared with that of the wild-type and unlabeled mutant PenPC-E166C toward its natural substrate penicillin G (Fig. 1c). Yet PenPC-E166Cb is deacylation-impaired with the deacylation kinetics (kcat) drastically reduced by ∼5 orders of magnitude as compared with that of the wild-type (Fig. 1c). PenPC shows a noteworthy improvement in kinetics toward cefuroxime, a cephalosporin highly similar to cefotaxime and a naturally poor substrate for PenPC. The acylation kinetics (k2/Kd) of PenPC-E166Cb is actually ∼2 orders of magnitude faster than that of the unlabeled PenP-E166C mutant. The deacylation kinetics (k3) is also slightly improved by ∼10 times (Fig. 1d), suggesting that BADAN-labeled β-lactamases may have a distinct binding mode for extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and cefuroxime as compared with that for the naturally good substrates of penicillins. To understand the dynamic properties of the Ω-loop and the distinct binding modes of PenP-E166Cb toward different substrates, the profile of fluorescence emission by PenP-E166Cb in the presence of various cephalosporins was measured by both scanning and time-dependent spectrum at steady state. We mainly focused on cephalosporins because of the improved binding kinetics toward this group of substrates as measured by ESI-MS. Nearly 20 cephalosporins were tested and six of them are reported as representatives of first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins containing diverse side chain groups conjugated onto the C3 and C7 positions of the cephem nucleus (Fig. 2a). The R1 group conjugated onto the C3 position is usually named the “leaving” group because this group is quickly rearranged and released when the cephalosporin is acylated to β-lactamase (14Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frère J.M. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Several R1 groups including the acetoxymethyl group in cefotaxime, the carbamoyloxymethyl group in cefoxitin and the pyridine group in cephaloridine were chosen. For the R2 group at the C7 position two major types were chosen, namely the non-branched thiozoldine-only group as seen in cefoxitin and cephaloridine (non-oxyimino-cephalosporins) and the branched side chains that contains a methoxyimini group in addition to the thiozoldine ring as in cefotaxime (oxyimino-cephalosporins). Ceftazidime represents an oxyimino-cephalosporin with the most complicated R2 group containing two additional methyl groups and one additional carboxylic group at the methoxy moiety. PenP-E166Cb demonstrated a selective fluorescence response toward the six representative cephalosporins. Only oxyimino-cephalosporins with a bulky branched R2 group at the C7 position containing the methoxyimini moiety, including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone, produced measurable fluorescence change, (Fig. 2, a and b). For the case of cefotaxime, a noticeable increase of ∼20% in the intensity of emitted fluorescence was detected in the scanning fluorescence spectra at near nanomolar concentrations (2 × 10−8 m), while at a concentration of 10−7 m, >70% (Fig. 2c). Non-oxyimino-cephalosporins including cefoxitin, cephaloridine, and cephalothin that contain non-branched R2 groups at the C7 position induced weak (less than 10%) or no measurable fluorescence changes, even at concentration as high as 10−4 m (Fig. 2b). The different R1 groups at the C3 position did not affect the fluorescence signal. To investigate the structural properties of the Ω-loop, we solved the structure of PenP-E166Cb by molecular replacement using the known structure of PenP (PDB ID 4BLM) as a search model (supplemental Table ST1). The overall folding of the mutant enzyme PenP-E166Cb is largely identical to that of the wild type PenP. The RMSD between these two structures is just ∼1.5 Å for all atoms and only 0.8 Å for the main chain atoms. Key residues lining the catalytic site, including Ser-70, Lys-73, Ser-130, and Lys-234 are virtually in identical positions as that in the wild-type enzyme and the PenP-E166C mutant (Fig. 3a). The only region that has undergone distinct reconfiguration in the E166Cb structure is the Ω-loop region consisting of residues 166–172. In the wild-type PenP structure, this segment is a short 2-turn helix closely packed toward the active site of the enzyme. In the PenP-E166Cb structure this helical element is unwound and adopts a new extended loop-like conformation to accommodate the bulky BADAN fluorophore linked to Cys-166 (Fig. 3a). All residues within this segment are displaced accordingly by ∼5 Å. Most notably the side chain of Glu-168, a highly conserved residue in Class A β-lactamases, is flipped nearly 180° from the original solvent-exposed orientation to point into the interior of the PenP active site, occupying a position approximate to Asn-170 in the wild-type structure (Fig. 3a). In this new conformation the carboxylate of Glu-168 is largely shielded from bulk solvent with a Solvent Accessible Area (SAA) of ∼20 Å2, exerting a strong electrostatic effect on the local environment. The structure of the Ω-loop of PenP-E166Cb is largely less stabilized than that of the wild type. Several distinct features that contribute to the structural stabilization of the Ω-loop, including the salt bridge and the hydrogen bonds between residue Arg-164 and Asp-179, and the hydrophobic packing of Leu-169 against the PenP enzyme, are all disrupted in the PenP-E166Cb structure (Fig. 3b). The BADAN fluorophore is clearly visible in the fo-fc map (supplemental Fig. S7). The fluorophore is located on the surface of the protein at the outer edge of the antibiotic binding site. The naphthalene plane is lodged into a surface groove formed by residues 166–170 of the Ω-loop on one side and by residues 103–104 of a loop segment on the other side (Fig. 3c). No specific interactions were found between BADAN and the protein atoms of PenP-E166Cb. The local environment of BADAN is highly polar. Atoms located within 4.5 Å from BADAN molecule include the charged carboxylate side chain of Glu-168, the polar side chains of Asn-132 and Asn-104, and 5 water molecules. Two symmetry-related BADAN molecules in the asymmetric unit adopt largely identical orientation, with one BADAN molecule nudged a little closer to the active site by crystallographic contact and both molecules are in close proximity to the active site, being ∼10.0 Å away from the -OH of Ser-70 (Fig. 3c). The crystallographic B-factor of the BADAN molecule is noticeably higher than the rest of the protein, suggesting high thermodynamic mobility. In the PenP-E166Cb-cefotaxime structure both cefotaxime and BADAN are clearly visible on the fo-fc map (Fig. 4a). The binding and acylation of cefotaxime exerts little effect on the position of the BADAN molecule (Fig. 4a). No specific interaction was observed between BADAN and cefotaxime. Thus the BADAN molecule is not directly involved with the acylation kinetics of E166Cb, but serves solely as a probe of the local environment instead. Cefotaxime is covalently linked to the Oγ atom of Ser-70 through C8 of its β-lactam ring. The bulky and branched side chain group containing the methoxyimino moiety is inserted into the PenP active site, occupying a location that overlaps with the position of Glu-168 in the apo structure (Fig. 4b). This binding mode of cefotaxime shows distinct difference as compared with that of Toho-1, an extended spectrum Class A β-lactamase with a tightly packed Ω-loop that poses steric hindrance (15Shimamura T. Ibuka A. Fushinobu S. Wakagi T. Ishiguro M. Ishii Y. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46601-46608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Instead it resembles the binding mode seen in GC1, a Class C extended-spectrum β-lactamase with a loosely packed Ω-loop that does not pose any steric hindrance (16Crichlow G.V. Nukaga M. Doppalapudi V.R. Buynak J.D. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6233-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4b). In the Toho-1 structure the methoxyimino side chain points away from the active site and is solvent-exposed. Such an orientation packs the methoxyimino side chain tightly against the thiozolyl ring, leading to a distorted configuration of the cephem nucleus that is catalytically incompetent for deacylation (15Shimamura T. Ibuka A. Fushinobu S. Wakagi T. Ishiguro M. Ishii Y. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46601-46608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the GC1 structure the transition analog of cefotaxime binds to GC1 in a fully extended conformation, with the oxyimino group inserted to the active site and extended away from the thiozolyl ring. This conformation is regarded as catalytically competent to facilitate deacylation because the distortion on the cephem nucleus is released (16Crichlow G.V. Nukaga M. Doppalapudi V.R. Buynak J.D. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6233-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus PenP-E166Cb preferentially interacts with cefotaxime in a manner that resembles an ESBL. To confirm the new binding mode of oxyimino-cephalosporins observed here we also solved the structure of PenP-E166Cb in acyl adduct complex with cefuroxime. The binding mode for cefuroxime is essentially the same as cefotaxime, with the oxyimino group inserted into the protein body of PenP-E166Cb (supplemental Fig. S8). The new binding mode of cefotaxime with its methoxyimino group inserted into the PenP active site leads to significant conformational change for a segment of the Ω-loop (residues 168–172). To avoid steric clash with the inserted methoxyimino group the side chain carboxylate of residue Glu-168 is flipped 180° from its solvent-shielded position adjacent to the antibiotic binding site as seen in the PenP-E166Cb structure to become completely solvent exposed in juxtaposition to the BADAN fluorophore (Fig. 4c). The rest of the Ω-loop region becomes highly dynamic and we were not able to build the side chain conformation for a few residues on the Ω-loop because of the relatively poor electron density in this region. The polarity of the local environment for BADAN is likely significantly decreased when the charged carboxylic side chain of Glu-168 relocates from the interior of the protein molecule to become fully solvent exposed because the electrostatic effect Glu-168 exerts on local environment is weakened when its side chain is fully solvated. In the PenP-E166Cb-cephaloridine structure the electron density unambiguously reveals a covalent acyl-enzyme adduct connected at C7 of cephem nucleus with the C-3 leaving group lost (Fig. 5a). The interaction mode of cephaloridine with PenP-E166Cb is nearly identical to that observed in another Class A β-lactamase PC1 (Fig. 5b) (17Powers R.A. Caselli E. Focia P.J. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9207-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Chen C.C. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The acylamide of cephaloridine forms one extra hydrogen bond with the polar side chain of Asn-104, a bond that is absent in PC-1 structure due to a slightly different conformation of the 103–105 loop region (Fig. 5b). The Ω-loop in the PenP-E166Cb-cephaloridine complex retains a conformation largely similar to that seen in the PenP-E166Cb structure (Fig. 5b). Residue E168 is not displaced by the acylated cephaloridine at the active site because cephaloridine lacks the branched oxyimino group to extend deep into the PenP active site. However the quality of electron density for residues beyond Glu-168 on the Ω-loop was poor, rendering it impossible to build a reliable structural model. Furthermore there was no continuous electron density visible beyond the thiol group of the mutated residue Cys-166 to account for the BADAN fluorophore despite our extensive efforts in crystal optimization and structural refinement. Yet electron density for the rest of the PenP-E166Cb-cephaloridine structure is of excellent quality typical of a structure determined at high resolution. The fact that the poor electron density is localized to BADAN and the residues of the Ω-loop surrounding the fluorophore likely suggests that the BADAN fluorophore and the segment of peptide it attaches to become highly dynamic upon acylation of cephaloridine to the active site. To confirm our structural findings that the Ω-loop in the engineered PenP-E166Cb enzyme readily undergoes conformational changes involving displacement of residue Glu-168 and change of local polarity, we mutated Glu-168 to leucine and measured the fluorescence profile of PenP-E166Cb-E168L. We reasoned that by mutating the charged carboxylic side chain of Glu-168 to the hydrophobic side chain of leucine the local polarity for BADAN is likely to be reduced; furthermore the displacement of mutated L168 by the methoxyimino moiety of oxyimino-cephalosporins from the interior solvent-excluded position to the exterior solvent-exposed position should not affect the local polarity as much as Glu-168 did. Indeed the fluorescence profile for PenP-E166Cb-E168L against the oxyimino-cephalosporins showed a trend of reduced enhancement (Fig. 6, a and b). For cefotaxime the PenP-E166Cb-E168L displayed an enhancement of ∼10% as compared with the ∼70% enhancement by PenP-E166Cb at concentrations between 2 × 10−8 m and 10−6 m. For non-cephalosporins with a non-branched R2 group, the fluorescence response from PenP-E166Cb-E168L was slightly improved as compared with PenP-E166Cb. For cephaloridine the enhancement for PenP-E166Cb-E168L mutant was ∼21% as compared with the ∼3% in PenP-E166Cb. It has long been perceived that the well-ordered Ω-loop of various β-lactamases can become structurally flexible upon acquiring certain destabilizing mutations, and such enhanced flexibility affords the enzyme expanded substrate profile. Yet no experimental data that demonstrates a flexible Ω-loop and confirms its impact on enzyme kinetics and substrate profile are available. Our studies on PenP-E166Cb aim to provide such vital information. We observed a distinct conformation of the Ω-loop in each of the three crystal structures, including the BADAN-labeled PenP β-lactamase, its acyl adduct complex with cefotaxime (oxyimino-cephalosporin), and another acyl adduct complex with cephaloridine (non-oxyimino-cephalosporin). In all three structures the Ω-loop has lost the stabilizing interactions that would pack the Ω-loop close to the active site to pose as steric hindrance as seen in wild type enzyme. As a result, the Ω-loop becomes highly flexible and readily adopts new conformations to accommodate the acylated cephalosporin substrates. Particularly the oxyimino-cephalosporins can now bind in a catalytically competent form to facilitate their hydrolysis. Furthermore kinetic studies reveal that PenP-E166Cb, with its structurally flexible Ω-loop, possesses improved binding kinetics toward extended-spectrum oxyimino-cephalosporins. Thus our data confirms that the Ω-loop is indeed capable of adopting highly flexible conformations and such dynamic properties correlate with extended substrate profile. The multiple conformations of the Ω-loop seen in the structures of PenP-E166Cb and its acyl adduct with cefotaxime and cephaloridine could serve as prototypes to investigate the various mutant β-lactamases with evolutionary substitutions in the Ω-loop region. Fluorescence-based biosensing has become a powerful and popular tool to probe complex and dynamic biological and chemical events at both in vitro and in vivo levels (19Weiss S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 20Michalet X. Weiss S. Jäger M. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1785-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 21Weiss S.

Environment-sensitive fluorophores strategically placed near the functional sites of proteins or small molecules have been employed to report a wide range of biological interactions (12Cohen B.E.

An intriguing question particularly related to β-lactam antibiotics is whether a fluorophore conjugated β-lactamase enzyme can give substrate-differentiated signals toward the wide-spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics. Such a design, if successful, would add a new dimension to fluorescence-based biosensing, where the engineered reporter cannot only detect the event of substrate binding, but also indicate the biochemical properties of the bound substrate. Our engineered PenP-E166Cb can indeed yield differentiated fluorescence signals between oxyimino-cephalosporins and non-oxyimino-cephalosporins. The structural flexibility of the Ω-loop plays an essential role in this substrate-specific biosensing process. The Ω-loop adopts distinctively different conformations depending on the type of the substrate bound, inducing different environmental polarity characteristics near the BADAN fluorophore to influence its fluorescence emission. Our engineered β-lactamase thus provides a new possibility of designing substrate-selective biosensing tools to glean structural and functional information from biological systems that engage a large number of diverse ligands.

https://openalex.org/W1970438062,"In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the synthesis of the major and essential membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, occurs via the CDP-choline and the serine decarboxylase phosphoethanolamine methylation (SDPM) pathways, which are fueled by host choline, serine, and fatty acids. Both pathways share the final two steps catalyzed by two essential enzymes, P. falciparum CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (PfCCT) and choline-phosphate transferase (PfCEPT). We identified a novel class of phospholipid mimetics, which inhibit the growth of P. falciparum as well as Leishmania and Trypanosoma species. Metabolic analyses showed that one of these compounds, PG12, specifically blocks phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis from both the CDP-choline and SDPM pathways via inhibition of PfCCT. In vitro studies using recombinant PfCCT showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme by PG12. The potent antimalarial of this compound, its low cytotoxicity profile, and its established mode of action make it an excellent lead to advance for further drug development and efficacy in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2047640173,"Prostate-derived sterile 20-like kinases (PSKs) 1-α, 1-β, and 2 are members of the germinal-center kinase-like sterile 20 family of kinases. Previous work has shown that PSK 1-α binds and stabilizes microtubules whereas PSK2 destabilizes microtubules. Here, we have investigated the activation and autophosphorylation of endogenous PSKs and show that their catalytic activity increases as cells accumulate in G(2)/M and declines as cells exit mitosis. PSKs are stimulated in synchronous HeLa cells as they progress through mitosis, and these proteins are activated catalytically during each stage of mitosis. During prophase and metaphase activated PSKs are located in the cytoplasm and at the spindle poles, and during telophase and cytokinesis stimulated PSKs are present in trans-Golgi compartments. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PSK1-α/β or PSK2 expression inhibits mitotic cell rounding as well as spindle positioning and centralization. These results show that PSK catalytic activity increases during mitosis and suggest that these proteins can contribute functionally to mitotic cell rounding and spindle centralization during cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2038483000,"Myeloma cells are dependent on IL6 for their survival and proliferation during the early stages of disease, and independence from IL6 is associated with disease progression. The role of the NF-κB pathway in the IL6-independent growth of myeloma cells has not been studied. Because human herpesvirus 8-encoded K13 selectively activates the NF-κB pathway, we have used it as a molecular tool to examine the ability of the NF-κB pathway to confer IL6 independence on murine plasmacytomas. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of K13, but not its NF-κB-defective mutant or a structural homolog, protected plasmacytomas against IL6 withdrawal-induced apoptosis and resulted in emergence of IL6-independent clones that could proliferate long-term in vitro in the absence of IL6 and form abdominal plasmacytomas with visceral involvement when injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic mice. These IL6-independent clones were dependent on NF-κB activity for their survival and proliferation but were resistant to dexamethasone and INCB018424, a selective Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor. Ectopic expression of human T cell leukemia virus 1-encoded Tax protein, which resembles K13 in inducing constitutive NF-κB activation, similarly protected plasmacytoma cells against IL6 withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Although K13 is known to up-regulate IL6 gene expression, its protective effect was not due to induction of endogenous IL6 production but instead was associated with sustained expression of several antiapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family upon IL6 withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NF-κB activation cannot only promote the emergence of IL6 independence during myeloma progression but can also confer resistance to dexamethasone and INCB018424."

Whereas the core transmembrane segments (TMs) of SSSs share high structural similarity with other transporters of LeuT-like fold, TM1 does not correspond to any TM in those structural homologs and was only resolved for the backbone atoms in the initial vSGLT structure (Protein Data Bank code 3DH4). To assess the role of TM1 in Na(+)-coupled substrate symport by the SSSs, here we have studied the role of a conserved residue in TM1 by computational modeling in conjunction with radiotracer transport and binding studies. Based on our sequence alignment and much topological data for homologous PutP, the Na(+)/proline transporter, we have simulated a series of vSGLT models with shifted TM1 residue assignments. We show that in two converged vSGLT models that retained the original TM1 backbone conformation, a conserved residue, Tyr-19, is associated with the Na(+) binding interaction network. In silico and in vitro mutagenesis of homologous Tyr-14 in PutP revealed the involvement of this conserved residue in Na(+)-dependent substrate binding and transport. Thus, our combined computational and experimental data provide the first clues about the importance of a conserved residue in TM1, a unique TM in the proteins with LeuT-like fold, in the Na(+)-coupled symport mechanism of SSSs."
