https://openalex.org/W2074157036,"Direct and indirect carbon fluxes in lakes Marion (British Columbia), Findley (Washington), Wingra (Wisconsin), and Mirror (New Hampshire) are compared, using budgets and input-output analysis. Overall differences in carbon flow between the lakes are shown with cycling indices of .031, .108, .572, and .661, respectively. The results suggest that lake ecosystems may be considered unique aggregations of similar components."
https://openalex.org/W2074852088,Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) initially associated with microparticulates are incorporated into marine diatom cells. The time course of transfer is rapid; equilibrium is attained within several hours. Assays with chlorophyll a fluorescence in vivo indicate that the transferred PCB's reach sites in the photosynthetic machinery that are sensitive to the effects of these compounds.
https://openalex.org/W2073859348,A curious and unambiguous event of excess ozone formation downwind of a power plant has been analyzed. A kinetic model used to simulate the event indicates that the excess ozone can be reconciled entirely on the basis of excess nitrogen oxides in the polluted air.
https://openalex.org/W2051897442,"Two marine sediment cores from a basin on the southeastern Labrador Shelf penetrate a mud sequence extending back to 21,000 carbon-14 years before the present (B.P.). The benthic foraminifera are dominated by subartic nearshore species indicative of ice-free summer waters. The pollen record indicates the presence of a sedge-shrub tundra in eastern Labrador as early as 21,000 years B.P. Both sources of evidence suggest less extensive continental ice than has previously been reported for this subarctic region."
https://openalex.org/W1978394620,Resource gathering is depending on leaner crude ores. Iron ore mining typifies this trend. To make lean taconite iron ores useful required a technologic breakthrough—pelletization. The shift to iron ore pellets has the advantage that they require less energy and labor per ton of molten iron than high-grade naturally concentrated ores. Increased reliance on pellets causes a geographic shift of some jobs and environmental effects from blast furnaces to iron ore mines.

https://openalex.org/W2019259307,"Peridotitic and highly magnesian pyroxenitic komatiites, thus far known to occur almost exclusively in the Archean (before 2.5 x 10(9) years ago) terranes, are reported from an Ordovician (0.5 x 10(9) years) ophiolite suite in Newfoundland. Their occurrence as pillow lavas or as chilled dikes, their possession of quench textures and geochemical parameters such as high contents of magnesium oxide, nickel, and chromium and low contents of titanium dioxide and potassium monoxide, low ratios of iron to iron plus magnesium, and values of the ratio of calcium oxide to aluminum oxide of close to unity demonstrate that they were formed through the rapid cooling of a highly mobile komatiitic melt. These features resemble those of many Archean peridotitic-pyroxenitic komatiites and indicate that the Archean-type magmatism did prevail in the younger segments of the earth's history although perhaps in a more erratc manner."

https://openalex.org/W2015890269,"The main reason for the erosion of the coast of the Nile delta is even more simple than that presented in the Random Samples item “Irrigation speeds Nile delta erosion” (8 Mar., p. 1369) and is known in Egypt. In 1983, I was on a United Nations advisory panel that looked into the shore erosion of the Nile delta. Our activities included a site visit, the review of many studies, and discussions with Egyptian engineers and scientists. It was known at that time that the causes were not directly related to the Aswan high dam. Many years ago, a low dam was built a few miles upstream from the Nile's Damietta mouth, and another one was built a few miles upstream from its other mouth (Rosetta). We were told that no water flows into the Mediterranean Sea through either of the two mouths, except for a week or so each year when water is discharged to flush wastes from the river in this region. Thus, very little sediment can be transported to the littoral. It was our understanding that all of the water in the Nile River is either used or lost as a result of evaporation or leakage through the bottom and sides of the irrigation systems ([1][1]).
