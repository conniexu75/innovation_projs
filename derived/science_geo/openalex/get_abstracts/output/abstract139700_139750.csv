https://openalex.org/W2036614475,"The 41-kDa and 43-kDa mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases play a pivotal role in the mitogenic signal transduction pathway and are essential components of the MAP kinase cascade, which includes MAP kinase kinase (MEK) and Raf-1. As aberrant activation of signal transducing molecules such as Ras and Raf-1 has been linked with cancer, we examined whether constitutive activation of the 41-/43-kDa MAP kinases is associated with the neoplastic phenotype of 138 tumor cell lines and 102 primary tumors derived from various human organs. Constitutive activation of the MAP kinases was observed in 50 tumor cell lines (36.2%) in a rather tissue-specific manner: cell lines derived from pancreas, colon, lung, ovary and kidney showed especially high frequencies with a high degree of MAP kinase activation, while those derived from brain, esophagus, stomach, liver and of hematopoietic origin showed low frequencies with a limited degree of MAP kinase activation. We also detected constitutive activation of the 41-/43-kDa MAP kinases in a relatively large number of primary human tumors derived from kidney, colon and lung tissues but not from liver tissue. Many tumor cells, in which point mutations of ras genes were detected, showed constitutive activation of MAP kinases, however, there were also many exceptions to this observation. In contrast, the activation of the 41-/43-kDa MAP kinases was accompanied by the activation of Raf-1 in the majority of tumor cells and was completely associated with the activation of MEK and p90rsk in all the tumor cells examined. These results suggest that the constitutive activation of 41-/43-kDa MAP kinases in tumor cells is not due to the disorder of MAP kinases themselves, but is due to the disorder of Raf-1, Ras, or some other signaling molecules upstream of Ras."

https://openalex.org/W2314469790,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in cell death induced by many different stimuli. This study shows that hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in T-cells did not require tyrosine kinase p56lck, phosphatase CD45, the CD95 receptor and its associated Caspase-8. H2O2-triggered cell death led to the induced cleavage and activation of Caspase-3. Hydrogen peroxide-treatment of T-cells resulted in the formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, a rapid decrease of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential ΔΨm and the release of Cytochrome C. Inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition by bongkrekic acid (BA), or interference with the mitochondrial electron transport system by rotenone or menadione prevented the cytotoxic effect of H2O2. Antimycin A, a mitochondrial inhibitor that increases the release of mitochondrial ROS (MiROS), enhanced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and the viral anti-apoptotic proteins BHRF-1 and E1B 19K counteracted H2O2-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of transcription factor NF-κB protected cells from hydrogen peroxide-elicited cell death. This detrimental effect of NF-κB mediating hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death presumably relies on the induced expression of death effector genes such as p53, which was NF-κB-dependently upregulated in the presence of H2O2."

https://openalex.org/W2040360122,"Basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancer in Caucasians. It has been reported that the patched gene is inactivated in 30 – 40% sporadic BCCs and 20% sporadic medulloblastomas via loss of heterozygosity and nonsense mutations. Recently, two activating smoothened mutations have been found in the sporadic basal cell carcinomas. One, at base pair 1604 (G-to-T transversion) of exon 9, changes codon 535 from tryptophan to leucine, and the other, at base pair 1685 (G-to-A transition) of exon 10, changes codon 562 from arginine to glutamine (Xie et al., 1998). In our study, 1604G→T was found in 20 out of 97 (20.6%) sporadic BCCs. The high prevalence indicates that 1604G is the mutation hot spot in our tumor samples. This mutation was detected in all three histological subtypes of BCCs, suggesting that smoothened mutation is an early event during the development of the tumor. Our finding of a high smoothened mutation rate, together with high frequent patched gene mutations reported recently, indicates that activation of the hedgehog signal transduction pathway is the most common and early event in the development of sporadic BCCs. Additionally, to determine whether smoothened, like patched, is also involved in the carcinogenesis of medulloblastomas, we screened medulloblastoma samples for these two mutations by restriction analysis. We have found the 1604G→T mutation in 1 out of 21 medulloblastomas. This result confirmed smoothened gene involvement in the carcinogenesis of medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2313904043,"The tumor suppressor gene p16 (CDKN2/MTS-1/INK4A) is an important component of the cell cycle and inactivation of the gene has been found in a variety of human cancers. In order to investigate the role of p16 gene in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 48 cases of HCC were analysed for p16 alterations by: methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to determine the methylation status of the p16 promoter region; comparative multiplex PCR to detect homozygous deletion; PCR – SSCP and DNA sequencing analysis to identify mutation of the p16 gene. We found high frequency of hypermethylation of the 5′ CpG island of the p16 gene in 30 of 48 cases (62.5%) of HCC tumors. Moreover, homozygous deletion at p16 region were present in five of 48 cases (10.4%); and missense mutation were detected in three of 48 cases (6.3%). The overall frequency of p16 alterations, including homozygous deletion, mutation and hypermethylation, in HCC tumors was 70.8% (34 of 48 cases). These findings suggest that: (a) the inactivation of the p16 is a frequent event in HCC; (b) the p16 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms including homozygous deletion, promoter hypermethylation and point mutation; (c) the most common somatic alteration of the p16 gene in HCC is de novo hypermethylation of the 5′ CpG island; and (d) in contrast to other studies, high frequency of genomic alterations are not uncommon in the 9p21 of the p16 gene. Our results strongly suggest that the p16 gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2329356826,"The death mediator caspase acts as the dominant regulator during cell death induction. The CPP32 subfamily, including caspase 3 (CPP32/Yama/Apopain), is essential for the cell death signaling. We recently reported that activation of caspase 3 is regulated by complex formation with p21 or ILP. In the present study, we investigated the binding domain with p21 and ILP to further characterize the caspase 3 inactivation machinery. Our results show that caspase 3 contains p21 binding domain in the N-terminus and ILP binding domain in the active site. Further, the caspase 3 binding domain in p21 was independent of the Cdk- or PCNA-binding domain. We also found caspase 3 protection by p21 from the p3-site cleavage serineproteinase contributes to the suppression machinery. Here, we propose the caspase 3 inactivation system by p21 and ILP as new essential system in the regulation of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2324803135,"Amplification of genes in the 12q13-15 region occurs frequently in several malignancies including osteosarcoma. The products of these amplified genes are thought to provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage; however, the specific gene(s) driving this amplicon is unknown. We have previously shown that the SAS gene is amplified in most parosteal osteosarcomas. In this study we analysed additional putative growth regulatory genes in this chromosomal region in 24 primary osteosarcoma specimens. CDK4 and SAS were co-amplified in 6/6 parosteal tumors, and MDM2 was also amplified in 4/5 parosteal cases. In comparison, amplification occurred in only 2/16 classical intramedullary osteosarcomas and involved the SAS gene. Each amplified gene had a correspondingly elevated mRNA level. Four high grade intramedullary tumors had elevated mRNA expression of SAS, but did not exhibit gene amplification. Gene amplification/overexpression was not associated with metastatic disease and did not change markedly with tumor progression, as evidenced by analysis of sequential tumor specimens from eight patients. Three other genes in the 12q13-15 region (CDK2, WNT1 and WNT10b) were not amplified in any of the tumors. The different patterns of gene amplification and overexpression of CDK4, SAS and MDM2 in parosteal and intramedullary osteosarcomas may help explain the disparity in the biological behaviour of these two types of osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2322330727,"The aetiology of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma is unknown. About 50% harbour a somatic mutation at codon 918 of RET (M918T). To investigate whether other RET sequence variants may be associated with or predispose to the development of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma, we analysed genomic DNA from the germline and corresponding tumour from 50 patients to identify RET sequence variants. In one patient, tumour DNA showed a novel somatic 12 bp in-frame deletion in exon 15. More interestingly, we found that the rare polymorphism at codon 836 (c.2439C>T; S836S) occurred at a significantly higher frequency than that in control individuals without sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (Fisher's exact test, P=0.03). Further, among the nine evaluable cases with germline c.2439C/T, eight also had the somatic M918T mutation in MTC DNA which was more frequent than in patients with the more common c.2439C/C (89% vs 40%, respectively; Fisher's exact test, P=0.01). These findings suggest that the rare sequence variant at codon 836 may somehow play a role in the genesis of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2021861300,"Overexpression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and HER2 (p185neu) may both contribute to the growth of human cancers. A humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4D5 and a human-mouse chimeric anti-EGF receptor mAb C225 are currently being investigated in clinical trials for their anti-tumor activities. In the present study, we have examined the effect of concurrent treatment of OVCA 420 human ovarian cancer cells with mAb C225 and mAb 4D5. Exposure of OVCA420 cells to saturating concentrations of C225 (20 nM) for 7 days resulted in 40 – 50% growth inhibition, and exposure to 20 nM mAb 4D5 also resulted in 30 – 40% growth inhibition. The growth inhibition of OVCA420 cells by mAb C225 or 4D5 was associated with an increased G1 cell population; an increased level of a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 with increased association of p27Kip1 with CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6; and decreased activities of these CDKs. Combination treatment with concurrent exposure to mAbs C225 and 4D5 resulted in additive anti-proliferative effects on these cells, which was accompanied by enhanced G1 cell distribution, a greater increase in the levels of p27Kip1 and a greater decrease in the activities of CDK kinases. The anti-proliferative effects and related changes in cell cycle regulators induced by mAb 4D5, mAb C225 or the combination of the two mAbs could be reversed by concurrent exposure to exogenous EGF. Our data suggest the potential fruitful cooperation of anti-EGF receptor mAb and anti-HER2 mAb in the treatment of human cancers stimulated by EGF receptor and HER2 signals."

https://openalex.org/W2314823541,"We have constructed a molecular phylogeny of the ETS gene family. By distance and parsimony analysis of the ETS conserved domains we show that the family containing so far 29 different genes in vertebrates can be divided into 13 groups of genes namely ETS, ER71, GABP, PEA3, ERG, ERF, ELK, DETS4, ELF, ESE, TEL, YAN, SPI. Since the three dimensional structure of the ETS domain has revealed a similarity with the winged-helix – turn – helix proteins, we used two of them (CAP and HSF) to root the tree. This allowed us to show that the family can be divided into five subfamilies: ETS, DETS4, ELF, TEL and SPI. The ETS subfamily comprises the ETS, ER71, GABP, PEA3, ERG, ERF and the ELK groups which appear more related to each other than to any other ETS family members. The fact that some members of these subfamilies were identified in early metazoans such as diploblasts and sponges suggests that the diversification of ETS family genes predates the diversification of metazoans. By the combined analysis of both the ETS and the PNT domains, which are conserved in some members of the family, we showed that the GABP group, and not the ERG group, is the one most closely related to the ETS group. We also observed that the speed of accumulation of mutations in the various genes of the family is highly variable. Noticeably, paralogous members of the ELK group exhibit strikingly different evolutionary speed suggesting that the evolutionary pressure they support is very different."

https://openalex.org/W2166921147,"Par-4 is a widely expressed leucine zipper protein that confers sensitization to apoptosis induced by exogenous insults. Because the expression of genes that promote apoptosis may be down-regulated during tumorigenesis, we sought to examine the expression of Par-4 in human tumors. We present here evidence that Par-4 protein levels were severely decreased in human renal cell carcinoma specimens relative to normal tubular cells. Replenishment of Par-4 protein levels in renal cell carcinoma cell lines conferred sensitivity to apoptosis. Because apoptosis may serve as a defense mechanism against malignant transformation or progression, decreased expression of Par-4 may contribute to the pathophysiology of renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2313054549,"Elevated levels of Src kinase activity have been reported in a number of human cancers, including colon and breast cancer. We have analysed four human breast tumor cell lines that exhibit high levels of Src kinase activity, and have determined that these cell lines also exhibit a high level of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity that recognizes the Src carboxy-terminal P-Tyr530 negative regulatory site. Total Src kinase activity in these cell lines is elevated as much as 30-fold over activity in normal control cells and specific activity is elevated as much as 5.6-fold. When the breast tumor cells were grown in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate, Src kinase activity was reduced in all four breast tumor cell lines, suggesting that Src was being activated by a phosphatase which could recognize the Tyr530 negative regulatory site. In fractionated cell extracts from the breast tumor cells, we found elevated levels of a membrane associated tyrosine phosphatase activity that preferentially dephosphorylated a Src family carboxy-terminal phosphopeptide containing the regulatory tyrosine 530 site. Src was hypophosphorylated in vivo at tyrosine 530 in at least two of the tumor cell lines, further suggesting that Src was being activated by a phosphatase in these cells. In preliminary immunoprecipitation and antibody depletion experiments, we were unable to correlate the major portion of this phosphatase activity with several known phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W2329515361,"In COS cells, Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS)-induced Ral activation was stimulated by RasG12V or a Rap1/Ras chimera in which the N-terminal region of Rap1 was ligated to the C-terminal region of Ras but not by Rap1G12V or a Ras/Rap1 chimera in which the N-terminal region of Ras was ligated to the C-terminal region of Rap1, although RalGDS interacted with these small GTP-binding proteins. When RasG12V, Ral and the Rap1/Ras chimera were individually expressed in NIH3T3 cells, they localized to the plasma membrane. Rap1Q63E and the Ras/Rap1 chimera were detected in the perinuclear region. When RalGDS was expressed alone, it was abundant in the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with RasG12V or the Rap1/Ras chimera, RalGDS was detected at the plasma membrane, whereas when coexpressed with Rap1Q63E or the Ras/Rap1 chimera, RalGDS was observed in the perinuclear region. RalGDS which was targeted to the plasma membrane by the addition of Ras farnesylation site (RalGDS-CAAX) activated Ral in the absence of RasG12V. Although RalGDS did not stimulate the dissociation of GDP from Ral in the absence of the GTP-bound form of Ras in a reconstitution assay using the liposomes, RalGDS-CAAX could stimulate it without Ras. RasG12V activated Raf-1 when they were coexpressed in Sf9 cells, whereas RasG12V did not affect the RalGDS activity. These results indicate that Ras recruits RalGDS to the plasma membrane and that the translocated RalGDS induces the activation of Ral, but that Rap1 does not activate Ral due to distinct subcellular localization."

https://openalex.org/W2171746392,"The Met tyrosine kinase – the HGF receptor – induces cell transformation and metastasis when constitutively activated. Met signaling is mediated by phosphorylation of two carboxy-terminal tyrosines which act as docking sites for a number of SH2-containing molecules. These include Grb2 and p85 which couple the receptor, respectively, with Ras and PI 3-kinase. We previously showed that a Met mutant designed to obtain preferential coupling with Grb2 (Met2xGrb2) is permissive for motility, increases transformation, but – surprisingly – is impaired in causing invasion and metastasis. In this work we used Met mutants optimized for binding either p85 alone (Met2xPI3K) or p85 and Grb2 (MetP13K/Grb2) to evaluate the relative importance of Ras and PI 3-kinase as downstream effectors of Met. Met2xPI3K was competent in eliciting motility, but not transformation, invasion, or metastasis. Conversely, MetP13K/Grb2 induced motility, transformation, invasion and metastasis as efficiently as wild type Met. Furthermore, the expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase in cells transformed by the Met2xGrb2 mutant, fully rescued their ability to invade and metastasize. These data point to a central role for PI 3-kinase in Met-mediated invasiveness, and indicate that simultaneous activation of Ras and PI 3-kinase is required to unleash the Met metastatic potential."

https://openalex.org/W2110105604,"Fusion of TLS/FUS and CHOP gene by reciprocal translocation t(12;16)(q32;q16) is a common genetic event found in myxoid and round-cell liposarcomas. Characterization of this genetic event was performed by three methods, Southern blot, RT-PCR, and genomic long-distance PCR in nine myxoid and three round-cell liposarcomas. All but one tumors showed genetic alternations indicating the fusion of TLS/FUS and CHOP gene. Two novel types of fusion transcripts were found, of which one lacked exon 2 sequence of CHOP gene, and the other lacked 3' half of exon 5 of TLS gene. The latter case was caused by a cryptic splicing site which was created by the genomic fusion. Detailed analyses genomic fusion points revealed several sequence characteristics surrounding the fusion points. Homology analyses of breakpoint sequences with known sequence motifs possibly involve in the process of translocation uncovered Translin binding sequences at both of TLS/ FUS and CHOP breakpoints in two cases. Translocations were always associated with other genetic alterations, such as deletions, duplications, or insertions. Short direct repeats were almost always found at both ends of deleted or duplicated fragments some of which had apparently been created by joining of sequences that flank the rearrangement. Finally, consensus topoisomerase II cleavage sites were found at breakpoints in all cases analysed, suggesting a role of this enzyme in creating staggered ends at the breakpoint. These data suggested that sequence characteristics may play an important role to recruit several factors such as Translin and topoisomerase II in the process of chromosomal translation in liposarcomas."

https://openalex.org/W2046714061,"Due to their growth arrest- and apoptosis-inducing ability, glucocorticoids (GC) are widely used in the therapy of various lymphoid malignancies. Cell death is associated with activation of members of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) protease/caspase family and, is presumably prevented by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. To further address the role of Bcl-2 in GC-mediated cytotoxicity, we generated subclones of the GC-sensitive human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line CCRF-CEM, in which transgenic Bcl-2 expression is regulated by tetracycline. Up to about 48 h, exogenous Bcl-2 almost completely protected these cells from apoptosis, digestion of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and generation of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp cleaving (DEVDase) activity. However, when the cells were cultured for another 24 h in the continuous presence of GC, they underwent massive apoptosis that was associated with DEVDase activity and PARP cleavage. Bcl-2 did not markedly affect GC-mediated growth arrest, thereby separating the anti-proliferative from the apoptosis-inducing effect of GC. Moreover, Bcl-2 did not prevent the dramatic reduction in the levels of several mRNAs observed during GC treatment, including the transgenic Bcl-2 mRNA. Thus, Bcl-2 can be placed upstream of effector caspase activation, but downstream of other GC-regulated events, such as growth arrest and the potentially critical repression of steady state levels of multiple mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2331929872,"The t(8;21) is associated with 12 – 15% of acute myelogenous leukemias of the M2 subtype. The translocation results in the fusion of two genes, AML1 (CBFA2) on chromosome 21 and ETO (MTG8) on chromosome 8. AML1 encodes a DNA binding factor; the ETO protein product is less well characterized, but is thought to be a transcription factor. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of ETO-2, a murine cDNA that encodes a new member of the ETO family of proteins. ETO-2 is 75% identical to murine ETO and shares very high sequence identities over four regions of the protein with ETO (domain I – III and zinc-finger). Northern analysis identifies ETO-2 transcripts in many of the murine tissues analysed and in the developing mouse embryo. ETO-2 is also expressed in myeloid and erythroid cell lines. We confirmed the nuclear localization of ETO-2 and demonstrated that domain III and the zinc-finger region are not required for nuclear localization. We further showed that a region within ETO, containing domain II, mediates dimerization among family members. This region is conserved in the oncoprotein AML-1/ETO. The recent identification of another ETO-like protein, myeloid translocation gene-related protein 1, together with the data presented here, demonstrates that at least three ETO proteins exist with the potential to form dimers in the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2322283509,"B-MYB is an ubiquitous protein required for mammalian cell growth. In this report we show that B-MYB transactivates its own promoter through a 120 bp segment proximal to the transcription start site. The B-MYB-responsive element does not contain myb-binding sites and gel-shift analysis shows that SP1, but not B-MYB, protein contained in SAOS2 cell extracts binds to the 120 bp B-myb promoter fragment. B-MYB-dependent transactivation is cooperatively increased in the presence of SP1, but not SP3 overexpression. When the SP1 elements of the B-myb promoter are transferred in front of a heterologous promoter, an increased response to B-MYB results. In contrast, c-MYB, the prototype member of the Myb family, is not able to activate the luciferase construct containing the SP1 elements. With the use of an SP1-GAL4 fusion protein, we have determined that the cooperative activation occurs through the domain A of SP1. These observations suggest that B-MYB functions as a coactivator of SP1, and that diverse combinations of myb and SP1 sites may dictate the responsiveness of myb-target genes to the various members of the myb family."
https://openalex.org/W2013170090,"In response to UV irradiation, mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts transiently arrest predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here, we investigate the role of the retinoblastoma-related pocket proteins in this biological process. We report here that UV induces an increase in p107/E2F complexes, shown previously to be repressors of E2F-dependent transcriptional activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that the increase of p107/E2F complexes following UV irradiation is a consequence of rapid dephosphorylation of p107. First, UV-mediated p107 dephosphorylation could be abolished by pretreatment of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid. Second, alteration of protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme composition by over-expression of specific B subunits interfered with UV-mediated dephosphorylation of p107. Consistent with this, p107 could be dephosphorylated in vitro with PP2A. Moreover, dephosphorylation of p107 was shown to be independent of the activity of p53 and p21, as it occurred also in UV-treated p53-null as well as p21-null mouse fibroblasts. We observed a close correlation between the UV dosages required for G1 cell cycle arrest and p107 dephosphorylation. Our data suggest a model in which UV radiation-induced cell cycle arrest depends, at least in part, on the induction of a PP2A-like phosphatase that acts on p107."
https://openalex.org/W1971499386,"Recent cytogenetic and molecular studies with highly polymorphic microsatellite markers have implicated allele loss involving chromosome 4 in several human cancers, which suggests the presence of multiple tumor suppressor gene (TSG) loci. However, there has been no detailed analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To determine the location of a putative TSG associated with OSCC on chromosome 4, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of microsatellite polymorphisms corresponding to 17 loci was performed to screen 32 patients with OSCC. LOH was observed in the majority of the tumors (75%) in at least one of the loci. The loci on the long arm exhibited a significantly higher frequency of deletions (66%) than those of the short arm (25%). Among the loci tested, frequent LOH was centered at D4S1573 on 4q25, which represents a region of about 4 centimorgans (cM). However, no commonly deleted regions were found on the short arm of the chromosome. We detected microsatellite instability (MI) in 31% of the cases. MI was also observed more frequently on the long arm (28%) than the short arm (6%). Thus, our data indicate that alterations of chromosome 4 regions, especially the long arm, are associated with OSCC tumorigenesis and that the 4q25 region may harbor at least one putative TSG."
https://openalex.org/W1974271424,"We examined the basis of the all or none difference in inducing melanocytic tumor development among three transgenic mouse lines (304, 192 and 242) to which the same promoter-enhancer (metallothionein-I) and oncogene (ret) were introduced. We initially demonstrated that both skin melanosis and Ret protein expression in skin, thymus and brain first became detectable before or immediately after birth in the mice of the tumor developing lines (304 and 192), whereas they became detectable a few days after birth in the mice of the non-tumor developing line (242) by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. Interestingly, the Ret protein expression in skin developed rapidly after birth as a burst with peak levels on 0.5-1.5 day newborns of lines 304 and 192 and on 7.0-7.5 day-old mice of line 242. The levels of autophosphorylation of Ret kinase in skin were, however, invariable among these three transgenic mouse lines. The mice of line 242, but not those of lines 192 and 304, responded to Ret protein immunization by increased antigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation and T-cell-mediated tumor growth suppression in vitro. Furthermore, ret-transgenic mice of line 242, but not line 304, rejected the subcutaneously transplanted tumors that had originally developed in a mouse of line 304. These results suggest that whether oncogene product-specific-tolerance is established or not to antitumor immunity may be decided by the dynamics of ret oncogene expression before and after delivery and this is the primary factor determining development or non-development of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1998861687,"We have previously demonstrated that normal human oral keratinocytes immortalized by transfection with human papillomavirus type-16 Dna became tumorigenic after exposure to a chemical carcinogen. In an effort to detect differentially regulated genes associated with this transition from the immortal to the malignant phenotype, we employed representational differences analysis (a PCR-coupled subtractive hybridization technique). After analysing 50 colonies, 12 putative messages were identified. Northern analysis comparison using the identified cDNAs as probes was made between normal human oral keratinocyte, papillomavirus-immortalized human oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B), a neoplastic cell line derived from HOK-16B (HOK-16B-BaP-T) and the human oral cancer cell lines Hep-2, SCC-9 and Tu-177. We found that mRNAs encoding for cyclophilin A, c-myc binding protein 1, the heat shock protein 90alpha and one unknown transcript were up-regulated in the oral cancer cell lines analysed as well as in HOK-16B cells. We also detected a downregulation of the mRNAs encoding the skin-derived antileukoproteinase SKALP/elafin, the translationally regulated p23 protein and one unknown transcript. Whether these messages are associated to the neoplastic conversion of human keratinocytes remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2334881962,"Interferons (IFNs) can exert cytostatic and immunomodulatory effects on carcinoma cells. In particular, growth inhibition of human prostate carcinoma by IFNs has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. p202 is a 52 kd nuclear phosphoprotein known to be induced by IFNs. In this report, we showed that the expression of p202 was associated with an anti-proliferative effect on human prostate cancer cells. More importantly, cells that expressed p202 showed reduced ability to grow in soft-agar, indicating a loss of transformation phenotype. Our data suggest that p202 is a growth inhibitor gene in prostate cancer cells and its expression may also suppress transformation phenotype of prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2321602063,"Surface plasmon resonance measurements were used for detecting and quantifying protein-protein interactions between the tumorsuppressor protein p53, the SV40 large T antigen (T-ag), the cellular DNA polymerase α-primase complex (pol-prim), and the cellular single-strand DNA binding protein RPA. Highly purified p53 protein bound to immobilized T-ag with an apparent binding constant of 2×108 M−1. Binding of p53 to RPA was in the same order of magnitude with a binding constant of 4×108 M−1, when RPA was coupled to the sensor chip via its smallest subunit, and 1×108 M−1, when RPA was coupled via its p70 subunit. Furthermore, p53 bound human DNA polymerase α-primase complex (pol-prim) with a KA value of 1×1010 M−1. Both the p68 subunit and the p180 subunit of pol-prim could interact with p53 displaying binding constants of 2×1010 M−1 and 5×109 M−1, respectively. Complex formation was also observed with a p180/p68 heterodimer, and again with a binding constant similar. Hence, there was no synergistic effect when p53 bound to higher order complexes of pol-prim. A truncated form of p53, consisting of amino acids 1 – 320, bound pol-prim by four orders of magnitude less efficiently. Therefore, an intact C-terminus of p53 seems to be important for efficient binding to pol-prim. It was also tried to measure complex formation between p53, pol-prim, and T-ag. However there was no evidence for the existence of a ternary complex consisting of T-ag, pol-prim, and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2312409531,"The relationship between P-glycoprotein expression and malignancy is controversial. We have recently found that, in osteosarcoma, multidrug resistance (MDR) is associated with a less aggressive behavior, both in vitro and in clinical settings. In this study, we evaluated whether P-glycoprotein overexpression has a cause-effect relationship with the reduced metastatic potential of MDR cells, or rather reflects a more complex phenotype. MDR1 gene-transfected osteosarcoma cell clones, showing different levels of P-glycoprotein expression, were analysed for their in vitro characteristics and their tumorigenic and metastatic ability in athymic mice. Apart from the different levels of P-glycoprotein, no significant change in the expression of surface antigens or in the differentiative features were observed in the MDR1 gene transfectants compared to the parental cell lines or control clones, obtained by transfection with neo gene alone. In contrast to controls, however, MDR1 transfectants showed a significantly lower ability to grow in semi-solid medium and were completely unable to grow and give lung metastases in athymic mice. These findings indicate that P-glycoprotein overexpression is causally associated with a low malignant potential of osteosarcoma cells, and open new insights on the role and functions of P-glycoprotein activity."
https://openalex.org/W2313398875,"Inheritable mutations in nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes cause cancer-prone human disorders, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, which are also characterized by symptoms of accelerated ageing. To study the impact of NER deficiency on mutation accumulation in vivo, mutant frequencies have been determined in liver and brain of 2 – 16 month old NER deficient XPA−/−, lacZ hybrid mice. While mutant frequencies in liver of 2-month old XPA−/−, lacZ mice were comparable to XPA+/−, lacZ and the lacZ parental strain animals, by 4 months of age mutant frequencies in the XPA-deficient mice were significantly increased by a factor of two and increased further until the age of 16 months. In brain, mutant frequencies were not found to increase with age. These results show that a deficiency in the NER gene XPA causes an accelerated accumulation of somatic mutations in liver but not in brain. This is in keeping with a higher incidence of spontaneous liver tumors reported earlier for XPA−/− mice after about 15 months of age."

https://openalex.org/W2329620064,"Genotoxic stress triggers the activation of several sensor molecules, such as p53, JNK1/SAPK and c-Abl, and occasionally promotes the cells to apoptosis. We previously reported that JNK1/SAPK regulates genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in p53-negative U937 cells by activating caspases. c-Abl is expected to act upstream of JNK1/SAPK activation upon treatment with genotoxic stressors, but its involvement in apoptosis development is still unclear. We herein investigated the kinase activities of c-Abl and JNK1/SAPK during apoptosis elicited by genotoxic anticancer drugs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in U937 cells and their apoptosis-resistant variant UK711 cells. We found that the activation of JNK1/SAPK and c-Abl correlated well with apoptosis development in these cell lines. Unexpectedly, however, the JNK1/SAPK activation preceded the c-Abl activation. Moreover, the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp suppressed c-Abl activation and the onset of apoptosis but not the JNK1/SAPK activation. Interestingly, c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibition by CGP 57148 reduced apoptosis without interfering with JNK1/SAPK activation. These results indicate that c-Abl acts not upstream of JNK1/SAPK but downstream of caspases during the development of p53-independent apoptosis and is possibly involved in accelerating execution of the cell death pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2335393709,"MMAC1, also known as PTEN or TEP-1, was recently identified as a gene commonly mutated in a variety of human neoplasias. Sequence analysis revealed that MMAC1 harbored sequences similar to those found in several protein phosphatases. Subsequent studies demonstrated that MMAC1 possessed in vitro enzymatic activity similar to that exhibited by dual specificity phosphatases. To characterize the potential cellular functions of MMAC1, we expressed wild-type and several mutant variants of MMAC1 in the human glioma cell line, U373, that lacks endogenous expression. While expression of wild-type MMAC1 in these cells significantly reduced their growth rate and saturation density, expression of enzymatically inactive MMAC1 significantly enhanced growth in soft agar. Our observations indicate that while wild-type MMAC1 exhibits activities compatible with its proposed role as a tumor suppressor, cellular expression of MMAC1 containing mutations in the catalytic domain may yield protein products that enhance transformation characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2335713345,"Malignant glial tumors (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas multiforme) arise mostly either from the progression of low grade precursor lesions or rapidly in a de novo fashion and contain distinct genetic alterations. There is, however, a third subset of malignant gliomas in which genetic lesions remain to be identified. Following surgical resection, all gliomas appear to have an inherent tendency to recur. Comparative molecular analysis of ten primary malignant gliomas (three anaplastic astrocytomas and seven glioblastomas multiforme) with their recurrences identified two distinct subgroups of recurrent tumors. In one group, primary tumors harbored genetic aberrations frequently associated with linear progression or de novo formation pathways of glial tumorigenesis and maintained their genetic profiles upon recurrence. In the other subset with no detectable known genetic mutations at first presentation, the recurrent tumors sustained specific abnormalities associated with pathways of linear progression or de novo formation. These included loss of genes on chromosomes 17 and 10, mutations in the p53 gene, homozygous deletion of the DMBTA1 and p16 and/or p15 genes and amplification and/or overexpression of CDK4 and alpha form of the PDGF receptor. Recurrent tumors from both groups also displayed an abnormal expression profile of the metalloproteinase, gel A, and its inhibitor, TIMP-2, consistent with their highly invasive behavior. Delineation of the molecular differences between malignant glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences may have important implications for the development of rational clinical approaches for this neoplasm that remains refractory to existing therapeutic modalities."

https://openalex.org/W1973780890,"Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) inhibits the proliferation of most cells, but stimulates some mesenchymal cell types, including murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We show here that TGF-β1 growth stimulation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts is reversed when these cells are transformed by SV40 or are transfected with a plasmid encoding the SV40 Large T antigen. Inversion of the TGF-β1 growth stimulation of NIH3T3 cells is not observed when these cells are transfected with plasmids expressing either a mutant Large T, unable to bind P53, or the E1A adenovirus oncoprotein which binds the retinoblastoma protein pRB but not P53. But when the TGF-β1-growth stimulated cells are transfected with a plasmid expressing a mutant form of Large T capable of binding to P53, but not to pRB, or with one expressing the E1B-55 kD adenovirus oncoprotein, which also binds to P53 but not to pRB, the cells are growth-inhibited by TGF-β1. The cdk inhibitor p21Waf is decreased in TGF-β1-stimulated NIH3T3 fibroblasts and increased in TGF-β1-inhibited SV40-transformed cells. Finally, we show that T12 fibroblasts, from a P53 knockout mouse, are growth inhibited by TGF-β1 and that they remain so upon transfection with a P53 which is mutant at restrictive temperature, but become growth-stimulated by this factor at permissive temperature when P53 is functional. These data strongly suggest that growth-stimulation of fibroblasts by TGF-β1 depends on the presence of a functional P53 protein and that inversion of this response occurs if P53 is absent or inactivated."

https://openalex.org/W2320660131,"This study investigates the chromosomal alterations involved in the acquisition of PALA resistance of LoVo colorectal cancer cells homozygous for wild-type TP53 before and after transfection with a 143Ala-mutated TP53 gene. PALA resistance was always associated with an increased number of CAD gene copies, but gene amplification sensu stricto was rarely observed. Interestingly, distinct chromosome patterns were found in relation to the TP53 status of the cells. In parental LoVo cells, the CAD copy number was increased through gains of normal chromosome 2 whereas in transfectant clones, resistance mostly occurred through chromosome rearrangements. The relationship with the two different cytogenetic patterns described in colorectal tumors is discussed."
