The method depends upon the equilibration of a bubble of gas with blood at 37C and the analysis of the bubble for carbon dioxide and oxygen. The Roughton-Scholander syringe is used both as the equilibration chamber and bubble analyzer, thus eliminating the necessity for transfer of the bubble. At sea-level, the accuracy of the technique was tested by comparison of results with those of a tonometer technique. At simulated altitudes of 7700 to 14,200 feet (low pressure chamber), the accuracy of the technique was evaluated by comparing arterial tensions with alveolar tensions. Agreement was good in both cases. The carbon dioxide tension of shed blood containing 0.01 to 0.02 per cent sodium fluoride usually increased after 1/2 hour, probably because the blood was treated with an insufficient quantity of sodium fluoride. The oxygen tension of arterial blood dropped several mm. after 1/2 hour at room temperature, and this tendency persisted when the blood was chilled. The oxygen tension of chilled venous blood remained comparatively constant. (Author)"

This fluorescence was localized to the hepatic cells, and, when severe, could involve the entire lobule. When the fluorescent material was dissolved in the fat droplets in the hepatic cells, these assumed an intense crimson colour."

https://openalex.org/W1992376209,"IN the course of experiments on the metabolism of acetylphosphate in rats, an enzyme which catalyses the hydrolysis of this substrate was found. The enzyme is present in homogenates as well as in cell-free extracts of liver, muscle, kidney, brain, but not in blood serum. Acetylphosphate M/20/20 (prepared according to Lipmann and Tuttle1) was incubated with liver homogenate and sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7·3) at 38° C. More than 80 per cent cleavage was observed in five minutes, and total cleavage was obtained in fifteen minutes. The spontaneous cleavage of acetylphosphate in the same conditions but in the absence of liver was 33 per cent in 180 minutes. The enzyme activity was found to be of the same order of magnitude in extracts of liver, kidney, brain and muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2077824880,PROF. HARTRIDGE has suggested1 a comparison between radar and acoustic range- and direction-finding in bats. He suggests that the interrupted supersonic note may be used to measure the range to obstacles. The note emitted lasts about 0·01 sec. During this time the first waves of the sound will travel about 10 ft. To determine range with any accuracy either the onset (leading edge) or the ending (trailing edge) of the echo must be used as a point of reference.

https://openalex.org/W2041699293,"THE scientific men of the world now have before them the task of readjustment which, we may hope, will mean the whole-hearted devotion of the available resources of scientific research and development to their proper and beneficent uses. It has become a commonplace that the urgent needs of war have greatly accelerated discoveries and inventions which will now promote the advancement of science and its applications in peace. Some of these scientific swords and spears will be thus immediately applicable as peaceful implements, or with only a minimum of beating and bending—radar, for example, to the safety of transport by sea and air, and all the new wealth of chemotherapeutic agents and insecticides to peace-time hygiene and agriculture. There will certainly be many others of a less direct and obvious kind—discoveries and developments arising as side-issues from the urgent uses of science in war, but capable now of applications which may open new possibilities of scientific advance for its own sake, or for a whole range of peaceful purposes. The Royal Society has recently agreed to collaborate with the Service Departments concerned, in setting up committees to organize such peaceful uses of the special facilities for purely scientific observation and experiment as are presented by Service flying, including aerial photography, by the voyages undertaken by the ships and officers of the Royal Navy in the course of their normal duties, and by the large surplus of explosives—of the pre-atomic type, be it understood —which a great war leaves in hand."

https://openalex.org/W1995662738,"ALTHOUGH uncertainties in detail may still exist, the general structure of the prehistoric story of Kenya as laid down by Dr. L. S. B. Leakey is now accepted by most prehistorians. The various climatic changes that have occurred and their correlations with the more important cultures found are also clear. Following on a major pluvial phase called Gamblian and correlated with the Kenya upper palæolithic, there were two merely wet phases separated by a dryer period. These are known respectively as the Makalian and the Nakuru wet phases. They are post-palæolithic in age, and the latter is not of great antiquity."

As it happens, the subject allotted to me was an investigation of the radioactive properties of uranium, a curious coincidence in view of certain activities in which I have recently been engaged."

Since then there has been much constructive criticism. There has been so much demand for the Fund's first memorandum that the Committee on Hospital Diet which it appointed, the chairman of which is Sir Jack Drummond, has now issued a second memorandum (obtainable from G. Barber and Sons, Ltd., 23 Furnival Street, E.C.4, 9d.). Everyone who has to cater for groups of people should read it. The housewife, also, will learn much from it."
