https://openalex.org/W2075513979,"A neutral templating route for preparing mesoporous molecular sieves is demonstrated based on hydrogen-bonding interactions and self-assembly between neutral primary amine micelles (S degrees ) and neutral inorganic precursors (l degrees ). The S degrees l degrees templating pathway produces ordered mesoporous materials with thicker framework walls, smaller x-ray scattering domain sizes, and substantially improved textural mesoporosities in comparison with M41S materials templated by quaternary ammonium cations of equivalent chain length. This synthetic strategy also allows for the facile, environmentally benign recovery of the cost-intensive template by simple solvent extraction methods. The S degrees 1 degrees templating route provides for the synthesis of other oxide mesostructures (such as aluminas) that may be less readily accessible by electrostatic templating pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2063580659,Widespread basalts and rhyolites were erupted in Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous. These are considered to be related to the Marion hot spot and the breakup of Madagascar and Greater India. Seventeen argon-40/argon-39 age determinations reveal that volcanic rocks and dikes from the 1500-kilometer-long rifted eastern margin of Madagascar were emplaced rapidly (mean age = 87.6 +/- 0.6 million years ago) and that the entire duration of Cretaceous volcanism on the island was no more than 6 million years. The evidence suggests that the thick lava pile at Volcan de l'Androy in the south of the island marks the focal point of the Marion hot spot at approximately 88 million years ago and that this mantle plume was instrumental in causing continental breakup.
https://openalex.org/W2078396547,"A language-independent means of gauging topical similarity in unrestricted text is described. The method combines information derived from n-grams (consecutive sequences of n characters) with a simple vector-space technique that makes sorting, categorization, and retrieval feasible in a large multilingual collection of documents. No prior information about document content or language is required. Context, as it applies to document similarity, can be accommodated by a well-defined procedure. When an existing document is used as an exemplar, the completeness and accuracy with which topically related documents are retrieved is comparable to that of the best existing systems. The results of a formal evaluation are discussed, and examples are given using documents in English and Japanese."
https://openalex.org/W2034778340,"In experimentally heated plots that each span a soil moisture gradient in a Rocky Mountain meadow, aboveground biomass of Artemisia tridentata (a sagebrush) increased in the drier habitat and that of Pentaphylloides floribunda (a shrub cinquefoil) increased in the wetter habitat relative to control plots. In contrast, aboveground forb biomass decreased in the wet and dry habitats of the heated plots. These results, combined with evidence for enhanced sagebrush seedling establishment rates in the heated plots, suggest that the increased warming expected under an atmosphere with a concentration of carbon dioxide twice that of pre-industrial levels could change the dominant vegetation of a widespread meadow habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2028061703,"The electrochemical behavior of a single molecule can be observed by trapping a small volume of a dilute solution of the electroactive species between an ultramicroelectrode tip with a diameter of ∼15 nanometers and a conductive substrate. A scanning electrochemical microscope was used to adjust the tip-substrate distance (∼10 nanometers), and the oxidation of [(trimethylammonio)methyl] ferrocene (Cp2FeTMA+) to Cp2FeTMA2+ was carried out. The response was stochastic, and anodic current peaks were observed as the molecule moved into and out of the electrode-substrate gap. Similar experiments were performed with a solution containing two redox species, ferrocene carboxylate (Cp2FeCOO-) and Os(bpy)32+ (bpy is 2,2′-bipyridyl)."
https://openalex.org/W1997541643,"A finite-element formulation of faults has been incorporated into time-dependent models of mantle convection with realistic rheology, continents, and phase changes. Realistic tectonic plates naturally form with self-consistent coupling between plate and mantle dynamics. After the initiation of subduction, trenches rapidly roll back with subducted slabs temporarily laid out along the base of the transition zone. After the slabs have penetrated into the lower mantle, the velocity of trench migration decreases markedly. The inhibition of slab penetration into the lower mantle by the 670-kilometer phase change is greatly reduced in these models as compared to models without tectonic plates."
https://openalex.org/W2074385899,The properties of excitable media are exploited to find minimum-length paths in complex labyrinths. Optimal pathways are experimentally determined by the collection of time-lapse position information on chemical waves propagating through mazes prepared with the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. The corresponding velocity fields provide maps of optimal paths from every point in an image grid to a particular target point. Collisions of waves that were temporarily separated by obstacles mark boundary lines between significantly different paths with the same absolute distance. The pathfinding algorithm is tested in very complex mazes with a simple reaction-diffusion model.
https://openalex.org/W2021705491,"Simultaneous global measurements of nitric acid (HNO(3)), water (H(2)O), chlorine monoxide (CIO), and ozone (O(3)) in the stratosphere have been obtained over complete annual cycles in both hemispheres by the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. A sizeable decrease in gas-phase HNO(3) was evident in the lower stratospheric vortex over Antarctica by early June 1992, followed by a significant reduction in gas-phase H(2)O after mid-July. By mid-August, near the time of peak CIO, abundances of gas-phase HNO(3) and H(2)O were extremely low. The concentrations of HNO(3) and H(2)O over Antarctica remained depressed into November, well after temperatures in the lower stratosphere had risen above the evaporation threshold for polar stratospheric clouds, implying that denitrification and dehydration had occurred. No large decreases in either gas-phase HNO(3) or H(2)O were observed in the 1992-1993 Arctic winter vortex. Although CIO was enhanced over the Arctic as it was over the Antarctic, Arctic O(3) depletion was substantially smaller than that over Antarctica. A major factor currently limiting the formation of an Arctic ozone ""hole"" is the lack of denitrification in the northern polar vortex, but future cooling of the lower stratosphere could lead to more intense denitrification and consequently larger losses of Arctic ozone."
https://openalex.org/W2003397470,"Detailed data on the momentum-resolved temperature dependence of the superconducting gap of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+x) are presented, complemented by similar data on the intensity of the photoemission superconducting condensate spectral area. The gap anisotropy between the Gamma-Mand Gamma-X directions increases markedly with increasing temperature, contrary to what happens for conventional anisotropic-gap superconductors, such as lead. Specifically, the size of the superconducting gap along the Gamma-X direction decreases to values indistinguishable from zero at temperatures for which the gap retains virtually full value along the Gamma-M direction. These data rule out the simplest type of d-wave order parameter."
https://openalex.org/W2135375759,"The quantitative morphological classification of galaxies is important for understanding the origin of type frequency and correlations with environment. However, galaxy morphological classification is still mainly done visually by dedicated individuals, in the spirit of Hubble's original scheme and its modifications. The rapid increase in data on galaxy images at low and high redshift calls for a re-examination of the classification schemes and for automatic methods. Here are shown results from a systematic comparison of the dispersion among human experts classifying a uniformly selected sample of more than 800 digitized galaxy images. These galaxy images were then classified by six of the authors independently. The human classifications are compared with each other and with an automatic classification by an artificial neural network, which replicates the classification by a human expert to the same degree of agreement as that between two human experts."

https://openalex.org/W2094395382,"The maximum size of thrust earthquakes at the world's subduction zones appears to be limited by anelastic deformation of the overriding plate. Anelastic strain in weak forearcs and roughness of the plate interface produced by faults cutting the forearc may limit the size of thrust earthquakes by inhibiting the buildup of elastic strain energy or slip propagation or both. Recently discovered active strike-slip faults in the submarine forearc of the Cascadia subduction zone show that the upper plate there deforms rapidly in response to arc-parallel shear. Thus, Cascadia, as a result of its weak, deforming upper plate, may be the type of subduction zone at which great (moment magnitude ≈ 9) thrust earthquakes do not occur."

https://openalex.org/W1988170465,Guinea pigs infected with a virulent strain of spotted fever received large doses of penicillin intramuscularly every 4 hours. The injections were begun 48 hours after the onset of fever. Controls included untreated animals and others that received one dose of spotted fever rabbit immune globulin. The penicillin had no effect on the classic symptoms of this disease and all the treated animals died. (The toxicity of penicillin for guinea pigs probably was a contributing factor.) Eight out of 16 controls died; all guinea pigs receiving globulin survived. Penicillin plasma determinations led to the belief that the treatment was adequate to bring about recovery had the agent been of any value.

https://openalex.org/W2007612850,"In a study of the Konig reaction, it was found that nicotinic acid, on reacting with CNBr and certain substituted aromatic amines, yields glutaconic dialdehyde derivatives which fluoresce with a greenish-yellow light in visible violet light of about 440 millimicrons wave-length. A procedure was described which is applicable to 0.1 to 6 micrograms in 5 cc of solution or extract. It is suggested that the principle of preparing fluorescing ""tagged"" derivatives be applied to other vitamins of the B-complex."
