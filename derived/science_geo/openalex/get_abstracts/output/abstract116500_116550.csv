https://openalex.org/W1528145379,"Iron regulatory protein (IRP) is a cytosolic bifunctional [Fe-S] protein which exhibits aconitase activity or binds iron responsive elements (IREs) in untranslated regions of specific mRNA. The modulators of these activities are the intracellular concentration of iron and, as recently described, NO synthase activity. In this study, we attempted to establish in in vitro experiments whether peroxynitrite (ONOO−, the product of the reaction between NO and O−2), as well as oxygen-derived radicals (O−2 and H2O2) and various NO donors, allow IRP to bind IREs using cytosol extract of macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells. Neither the addition of a bolus of ONOO− or H2O2 nor O−2 generation significantly affected IRE binding even though they inhibited its aconitase activity. Moreover, we show that 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a chemical which releases both NO and O−2, enhanced IRE binding activity of IRP only in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD). S-Nitrosothiols and the NONOate sper/NO plus glutathione (GSH) activated IRE binding by IRP whereas oxyhemoglobin prevented enhancement of this binding by SIN-1/SOD and sper/NO plus GSH. cis-Aconitate, an aconitase substrate, also abolished the effect of SIN-1/SOD on IRE binding by IRP. These results imply that neither O−2 nor ONOO− can convert [4Fe-4S] IRP into IRE-binding protein but rather suggest that an active redox form of NO converts IRP into its IRE binding form by targeting the [Fe-S] cluster.

But the mechanisms by which individual HOX genes are themselves targeted for expression in different cell types remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that STF-1, a homeodomain protein that functions in pancreatic morphogenesis and in glucose homeostasis is encoded by an “orphan” homeobox gene on mouse chromosome 5. When fused to a β-galactosidase reporter gene, a 6.5-kilobase genomic fragment of 5′-flanking sequence from the STF-1 gene shows pancreatic islet specific activity in transgenic mice. Two distinct elements within the STF-1 promoter are required for islet-restricted expression: a distal enhancer sequence located between −3 and −6.5 kilobases and a proximal E-box sequence located at −104, which is recognized primarily by the helix loop helix/leucine zipper nuclear factor USF. As point mutations within the −104 E-box that disrupt USF binding correspondingly impair STF-1 promoter activity, our results demonstrate that USF is an important component of the regulatory apparatus which directs STF-1 expression to pancreatic islet cells.

DNase I footprinting and gel shift analysis revealed that this region can bind a protein present in nuclei of liver and spleen, organs that express high and undetectable levels of FAS, respectively. This protein is not a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, C/EBP. Thus, the FAS gene appears unusual in that the sequence element required for transcriptional regulation by cAMP is neither a cAMP response element (CRE) nor a binding site for AP-1, AP-2, or C/EBP. These results suggest that essential to the regulation of FAS transcription by cAMP is the interaction of an inverted CCAAT box motif with a constitutively produced trans-acting factor that either itself undergoes modification in response to cAMP or associates with a protein that is produced or modified by cAMP exposure.

To test the hypothesis that microtubular disruption should promote transgene persistence by interrupting endosomal translocation to lysosomes, plasmids containing bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (pSV2-CAT) or human bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 (pSVK3-hBUGT1) genes were complexed with asialoglycoprotein-polylysine conjugates, and 1 mg of the complexed DNA was injected intravenously into bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-deficient Gunn rats. 30 min before DNA injection, one group received 0.75 mg of colchicine/kg of body weight intraperitoneally, which was shown by immununofluorescent confocal microscopy to disrupt the microtubular network. Control rats received normal saline. In colchicine-pretreated rats receiving pSV2-CAT, hepatic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity persisted for 9-14 weeks, whereas in the saline-pretreated group the activity was detectable for 48 h only. In colchicine-pretreated Gunn rats receiving pSVK3-hBUGT1, the DNA persisted in liver for 10 weeks, bilirubin glucuronides were excreted in bile, and serum bilirubin levels declined by 25-35% in 2-4 weeks and remained reduced for 8 weeks. Without colchicine pretreatment, the DNA was detectable in liver for 2 days only, and serum bilirubin levels were not reduced.

https://openalex.org/W2030515956,"We present a method for solubilizing and purifying UDP-Glc:ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80; glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)) from rat liver and present data on its substrate specificity. A Golgi membrane fraction was isolated, washed with N-lauroylsarcosine, and subsequently treated with 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate to solubilize the enzyme. GCS activity was monitored throughout purification using UDP-Glc and a fluorescent ceramide analog as substrates. Purification of GCS was achieved via a two-step dye-agarose chromatography procedure using UDP-Glc to elute the enzyme. This resulted in an enrichment >10,000-fold relative to the starting homogenate. The enzyme was further characterized by sedimentation on a glycerol gradient, 125I labeling, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which demonstrated that two polypeptides (60-70 kDa) corresponded closely with GCS activity. Purified GCS was found to require exogenous phospholipids for activity, and optimal results were obtained using dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. Studies of the substrate specificity of the purified enzyme demonstrated that it was stereospecific and dependent on the nature and chain length of the N-acyl-sphingosine or -sphinganine substrate. UDP-Glc was the preferred hexose donor, but TDP-glucose and CDP-glucose were also efficiently used.

The biochemical pathways for GSL synthesis are well established (reviewed in (6.Sweeley C.C. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes.

Plenum Press, New York1983: 167-247Google Scholar)), but not all of the enzymes involved in GSL synthesis have been purified and/or cloned (for review, see (10.Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Google Scholar)). One such enzyme is UDP-Glc:ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80; glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)), which catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) from ceramide and UDP-Glc(11.Basu S. Kaufman B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5802-5807Google Scholar). This enzyme is of particular interest for a number of reasons. First, it has been shown that there is a correlation between tumor progression and cell surface GSLs(1.Hakomori S.-I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 103-126Google Scholar, 12.Hakomori S. Svennerholm L. Asbury A.K. Reisfeld R.A. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Tettamanti G. Toffano G. Progress in Brain Research. 101. Elsevier, Cambridge, UK1994: 241-250Google Scholar). Since many complex acidic and neutral GSLs are derived from GlcCer, regulation of GCS activity could have a profound effect on cell growth activity. Indeed, Radin and colleagues (13.Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Inokuchi J. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Advances in Lipid Research. 26. Academic Press, New York1993: 183-213Google Scholar) have developed a GCS inhibitor (1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP)) and demonstrated some remarkable effects of this compound both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, a defect in GCS activity was also characterized in a mutant melanoma cell line and associated with altered growth properties(14.Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Google Scholar). Second, GCS activity is concentrated at the Golgi complex(15.Coste H. Martel M.-B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Google Scholar, 16.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Google Scholar), but its precise distribution is not known. Unlike sphingomyelin synthesis, which occurs principally at the cis/medial Golgi apparatus, GlcCer synthesis is more widely distributed within the Golgi. Thus, it is of interest to learn what parts of the GCS molecule are responsible for its unique intracellular distribution. Finally, it should be noted that GlcCer synthesis occurs at the cytosolic surface of intracellular membranes(15.Coste H. Martel M.-B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Google Scholar, 16.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Google Scholar, 17.Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Google Scholar). However, formation of complex GSLs from GlcCer is believed to occur by glycosylation reactions taking place on the lumenal surface of the Golgi apparatus. Thus, GlcCer synthesis must be accompanied by transbilayer movement or “flip-flop” of the lipid during or after its synthesis. To further study some of these problems, it will be necessary to purify, characterize, and eventually clone and sequence GCS. In the present paper, we describe methods for the solubilization and purification of GCS from rat liver Golgi membranes as a step toward this goal. We also provide novel information about the enzymatic properties of GCS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). N-[7-(4-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-6-aminocaproyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C6-NBD-Cer) and N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY)-1-pentanoyl]-D-erythro-sphingosine (C5-DMB-Cer) were obtained from Molecular Probes. The four steroisomers of C6-NBD-Cer were synthesized and purified as described(18.Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Google Scholar). Other fluorescent and radioactive ceramide analogues were prepared by N-acylation of sphingosine (or sphinganine) using N-hydoxysuccinimidyl fatty acids(18.Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Google Scholar, 19.Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 319-341Google Scholar). D-threo-PDMP was from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). CHAPSO was from Pierce. Green dye-Sepharose CL-2B, hereafter referred to as “dye-agarose,” was prepared from active Green 19 dye (Sigma) and Sepharose CL-2B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described(20.Stellwagen E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 343-357Google Scholar). Phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Bovine liver catalase, equine heart cytochrome C, rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, and porcine heart malate dehydrogenase were obtained from Calbiochem. 125I was from DuPont NEN. Organic solvents were from Burdick & Jackson Laboratories Inc. (Muskegon, MI). All other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. Golgi-enriched membranes from rat liver were prepared as described (21.Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Google Scholar, 22.Bergeron J.J.M. Rachubinski R.A. Sikstrom R.A. Posner B.I. Paiement J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 139-146Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Livers were minced with a razor blade in homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl containing 1 μg/ml each of antipain and leupeptin, 25 μM amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Additional homogenization buffer was added to make a 20% (w/v) suspension, and the minced livers were then homogenized by passing the suspension through a ball bearing homogenizer four times (Berni-Tech Engineering, Saratoga, CA) with a clearance of 0.0054 inches(23.Balch W.E. Rothman R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Google Scholar). The homogenate was adjusted to 1.07 M sucrose by addition of 2.0 M sucrose. The homogenate (19 ml) was loaded into ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid in succession with 4 ml of 1.02 M sucrose and a 14-ml linear gradient of 1.02 M to 0.2 M sucrose. After centrifugation (Beckman SW28 rotor, 83,000 × g, 4°C, 210 min), a prominent white band at ∼0.75 M sucrose was harvested. These Golgi-enriched fractions were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use. Under these conditions, GCS activity was stable for several months. All purification steps were performed at 4°C. All buffers used throughout the purification contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 mM amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 130 mM bestatin, 1 mM pepstatin). Golgi-rich fractions from rat liver were thawed and mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine in buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% NaN3) with 25 mM KCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g (Beckman 50.2Ti rotor). GCS activity was recovered in the N-lauroylsarcosine-insoluble pellet. The pellet was suspended at ∼1 mg of protein/ml in buffer A supplemented with 1% CHAPSO, 1 mM UDP-Glc, and 1 mM dithiothreitol and stirred for 1 h. The CHAPSO-soluble supernatant and insoluble pellet were separated after centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Preliminary studies showed that GCS bound to dye-agarose but was eluted from the dye column in the presence of UDP-Glc. These observations suggested a two-step procedure to enrich for GCS. First, CHAPSO-soluble supernatant (∼50 ml) was loaded (flow rate of 12 ml/h) onto a dye-agarose column (1 × 20 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 0.5% CHAPSO and 1 mM dithiothreitol) plus 1 mM UDP-Glc. The unbound fraction (42 ml) from the first column containing ∼70% of the total applied GCS activity was concentrated to 4 ml by using Centriprep-50 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). UDP-Glc was then removed from the unbound fraction by gel filtration through Biogel P2 (Bio-Rad) columns (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer B using a centrifugation method(24.Fry D.W. White J.C. Goldman I.D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 809-815Google Scholar). The unbound fraction was then slowly applied (12 ml/h) onto a second dye-agarose column (1 × 4 cm) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B and sequentially eluted with 20 ml of 0.15 M KCl in buffer C (buffer B plus 0.1 mM 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC)), 15 ml of 20 mM UDP-Glc, and 20 mM NADH in buffer C followed by 15 ml of 1 M KCl in buffer C. 2-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots (20 μl) of each fraction were assayed for GCS activity. Purified GCS samples were first chromatographed through a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 1% glycerol in buffer D (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.6% CHAPSO, 0.5 mM UDP-Glc, and 100 mM KCl) as described above for the gel filtration procedure to reduce glycerol concentration. The fractions (250 μl) were then loaded on top of 6-25% (v/v) linear glycerol gradients in 5 ml of buffer D and centrifuged in a Beckman SW 55Ti rotor at 250,000 × g for 12 h. After centrifugation, 30 fractions of 170 μl were collected starting from the top of the gradient and were assayed for enzymatic activity. The sedimentation coefficient of the native enzyme was estimated as described previously (25.Haga T. Haga K. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5776-5782Google Scholar) using catalase, cytochrome C, malate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase as calibrating enzymes. For polypeptide visualization, an aliquot of the enzyme fraction was prelabeled with 125I (see below) and added as a tracer to the sample loaded onto the glycerol gradient. The radioactive polypeptides in the glycerol gradient fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see below). GCS activity was assayed as described previously(16.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Enzyme fractions were preincubated in screw cap tubes in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM UDP-Glc in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 5 min at 37°C. The enzyme reaction was initiated by addition of 5 nmol of C6-NBD-Cer•bovine serum albumin complex prepared as described(18.Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Google Scholar, 26.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 437-446Google Scholar). After 15 min at 37°C with constant stirring, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2 (v/v)). Lipids were extracted (27.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography(26.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 437-446Google Scholar). Individual spots on the TLC plates were identified by comparison with fluorescent standards and quantified by image analysis as described(28.Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2169-2181Google Scholar). In some cases, the reaction tubes were precoated with phospholipids (usually 0.1 mM DOPC) by first adding phospholipid dissolved in chloroform to screw cap tubes and evaporating the chloroform under a stream of N2. For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, the reaction tubes were also precoated with D-threo-PDMP using an ethanolic stock solution of the inhibitor. The polypeptide composition of various fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE(29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). In some cases, the enzyme fractions were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid in the presence of sodium deoxycholate prior to electrophoresis(30.Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Google Scholar). Polypeptides were visualized using a silver staining kit (Bio-Rad) as described(31.Merrill Jr., A.H. Stevens V.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 131-139Google Scholar). To visualize the polypeptides in samples with very low protein concentrations, samples were prelabeled with 0.5-1 mCi of 125I by the chloramine-T method(32.Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Google Scholar). Radioactive gels were analyzed using a phosphorimager (Molecular Analyst GS-363, Bio-Rad) and by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation of rat albumin was performed as described (33.Larkin J.M. Palade G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 205-216Google Scholar) using a polyclonal anti-rat albumin antiserum from Cappell/Organon Teknika (Durham, NC). The Golgi marker enzyme, galactosyltransferase, was measured as described(35.Bretz R. Staübli W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 181-192Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of Golgi membranes was performed as described(21.Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using Coomassie Blue dye reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard(36.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Preliminary studies showed that GCS in Golgi membranes could be solubilized with CHAPSO (1% (w/v)) with recovery of ∼70% of the activity in the extract (data not shown). We also found that addition of 0.1-1.0 mM DOPC and 0.1 mM UDP-Glc to the solubilized GCS improved its stability at 4°C (data not shown). Thus, these protective agents were added during some purification steps. Finally, we noted that after chromatographic procedures, GCS had specific phospholipid requirements for optimal activity (see below). Thus, most activity assays of solubilized GCS fractions were performed in the presence of 0.1 mM DOPC. We used rat liver Golgi membranes as a starting material for the purification of GCS because our previous studies showed that these membranes were highly enriched in GCS activity(16.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Google Scholar). The Golgi fractions prepared in the present work were enriched 60-80-fold in galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi marker protein, with ∼35% recovery of this enzyme. In addition, electron microscopy of the Golgi samples revealed numerous intact stacks comprised of 4 and 5 cisternae (data not shown). Thus, these Golgi preparations were similar in enrichment and morphology to highly purified Golgi fractions prepared by established methods (for review, see (37.Andersson G. Glaumann H. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosomes: Their Role in Protein Breakdown. Academic Press, New York1987: 61-113Google Scholar)). Golgi membrane fractions were enriched >60-fold in GCS activity compared to crude rat liver homogenate with a yield of >50% (Table 1). Since our enzyme assay used a fluorescent ceramide analog, which is also a substrate for sphingomyelin synthase(18.Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Google Scholar, 38.Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2608-2612Google Scholar, 39.Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 27-34Google Scholar), we were also able to determine that the Golgi membranes were enriched 35-40-fold in sphingomyelin synthase activity with a recovery of ∼40% (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with the differential location of GCS and sphingomyelin synthase in the Golgi apparatus(16.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Google Scholar, 17.Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Google Scholar, 21.Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 155-157Google Scholar).Tabled 1 We found that pretreatment of Golgi-enriched fractions with 0.05% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine followed by ultracentrifugation resulted in the removal of 75% of the total Golgi protein in the supernatant, while most GCS activity (80%) was recovered in the pellet (Table 1). The enrichment achieved by this step was ∼200-fold relative to homogenate (Table 1) or 3.15-fold compared to Golgi membranes. GCS activity in the pellet was then solubilized with 1% CHAPSO. The solubilized GCS was not apparently further enriched (Table 1). However, activity of the solubilized enzyme was tested in the presence of CHAPSO (final concentration, 0.05%), a condition that suppresses GCS activity in intact Golgi membranes by ∼30% (data not shown). Thus, the % recovery and enrichment values shown in Table 1 are underestimates. We attempted to purify GCS by affinity chromatography using various bound ligands (UDP-hexanolamine, UDP-GlucUA, ceramide, sphingosine, and PDMP), but these efforts were unsuccessful. We next explored dye adsorption chromatography and found that GCS activity could be released from a dye-agarose column by UDP-Glc, while most other dye-binding proteins were elutable only with salt. Thus, we devised a two-step purification procedure. First, CHAPSO-solubilized Golgi membranes were loaded onto the dye-agarose column in the presence of 1 mM UDP-Glc. GCS activity was then recovered (70% of total applied activity) in the unbound fractions with a 2.3-fold enrichment relative to the CHAPSO extract or a 474-fold relative to the homogenate (Table 1; Fig. 1A). After gel filtration to remove UDP-Glc, the unbound fractions from the first dye-agarose column were loaded onto a second dye-agarose column, which was equilibrated with buffer without UDP-Glc. Although most proteins passed through the second column, almost all the GCS activity was bound and was eluted successively with 0.15 M KCl, 20 mM UDP-Glc plus 20 mM NADH, and 1 M KCl (Fig. 1B). The 0.15 M KCl-eluted fraction was enriched ∼5000-fold in GCS activity with a 1.15% recovery relative to homogenate (Table 1). The amount of protein recovered in the UDP-Glc-eluted fraction was at the lower limits of detectibility (∼1 μg/ml), resulting in a ≥10,000-fold enrichment of GCS with a recovery of ≤0.5% (Table 1). The 1 M KCl-eluted fraction was also significantly enriched (3300-fold) in GCS activity (Table 1). Furthermore, since CHAPSO partially inhibits GCS activity as noted above, the true enrichment of GCS in the purified fractions is greater than the values cited above (see Table 1). The polypeptide composition of GCS fractions during different steps of purification was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Initial steps (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4) were visualized by silver staining. To visualize the fractions eluted from the second dye-agarose column, which were very low in protein, aliquots were radioiodinated. When a radiolabeled aliquot of the 0.15 M KCl-eluted fraction was electrophoresed and visualized by autoradiography, the profile obtained (Fig. 2, lane 5) showed a similar pattern to that of the same sample visualized by silver staining in lane 4. Three major bands (45, ∼60, and 66 kDa) were visible in this fraction (Fig. 2, lane 5). The 45-kDa polypeptide was noticeably diminished in the UDP-Glc-eluted fraction, while the 60- and 66-kDa forms continued to predominate on the gel (Fig. 2, lane 6). In an attempt to further purify GCS following dye-agarose chromatography, UDP-Glc-eluted GCS, including a radiolabeled aliquot, was centrifuged through a glycerol gradient. Preliminary experiments showed that only ∼50% of the starting GCS activity was preserved after a 12-h ultracentrifugation in a glycerol gradient with 0.5 mM UDP-Glc present, preventing a quantitative evaluation of GCS enrichment. Nevertheless, the discrete peak of GCS activity in the glycerol gradient allowed us to assess the apparent relative size of the enzyme under nondenaturing conditions. Based on a standard curve of marker enzymes sedimented in the same tube, we estimated the sedimentation coefficient of GCS as ∼4.2 s (Fig. 3A). The peak of GCS activity migrated to position immediately preceding malate dehydrogenase, which has a molecular mass of 70 kDa. Fig. 3B shows the glycerol gradient distribution of the radiolabeled 45-, 60-, and 66-kDa polypeptides present in dye-agarose purified GCS. The intensity of the 45-kDa polypeptide peaked earlier in the glycerol gradient than the peak of GCS activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Most of the radioactivity associated with the 66-kDa band was found to be rat albumin by immunoprecipitation; however, this technique did not completely remove the radioactivity in this region of the gel (data not shown). Furthermore, both the 60- and the 66-kDa bands peaked in intensity at fraction 11, which coincided with the peak of GCS activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that another polypeptide is responsible for GCS activity, our data suggest that the ∼60- and/or ∼66-kDa polypeptides are the GCS protein. Purified fractions obtained after the second dye-agarose column were used to examine the enzymatic characteristics and substrate specificity of GCS. GCS activity was previously reported to be stimulated by phospholipids(41.Vunnam R.R. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 73-82Google Scholar, 42.Cestelli A. White F.V. Costantino-Ceccarini E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 283-292Google Scholar). Thus, we first investigated effects of phospholipids on GCS activity. Purified GCS showed an almost absolute requirement for phospholipids for activity (Table 2, Fig. 4). In contrast, GCS activity in the Golgi and crude CHAPSO extract was not stimulated significantly by phospholipids (data not shown). The optimal phospholipid concentration for stimulating GCS activity in purified fractions was 0.1 mM, with higher concentrations causing a relative suppression of activity (Fig. 4). Of the phospholipids tested, phosphatidylcholines showed the greatest ability to stimulate GCS activity, although phosphatidylethanolamine was almost as effective (Table 2). Among phosphatidylcholines with different fatty acid moieties, GCS activity was maximally stimulated by those containing unsaturated fatty acids, with C16:1 and C18:1 fatty acids being the most effective (Table 2).Tabled 1Figure 4:Effect of phospholipid concentration on GCS activity. Dye-agarose-purified GCS, eluted in the absence of exogenous phospholipids, was incubated in the presence of various concentrations of synthetic (di-C18:1, di-C16:1 and C16:0, C18:1) phosphatidylcholines as described in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next we examined the specificity of GCS for various acceptor substrates. Among the ceramide analogs tested, the D-erythro- and L-erythro- isomers of C6-NBD-Cer were the best substrates (Table 3). Glucosylation of C6-NBD-Cer from a commercial source, which contains a mixture of both isomers, gave similar results to the pure stereoisomers (Table 3). Neither D- nor L-threo-NBD-Cer were used as substrates by the enzyme, showing that the enzyme is stereospecific. D-erythro-C6-NBD-dihydroceramide was glucosylated to about 25% of control values obtained with C6-NBD-Cer (Table 3). Among the different Cn-NBD-Cer tested, the hexanoyl- and octanoyl- analogs were the best GCS substrates, while little or no measurable activity was found toward shorter (propanoyl- and pentanoyl-) and longer (tetradecanoyl-) ceramide analogs (Table 3). Similarly, GCS was ∼4.5 times more active toward short chain [14C]C6-Cer than toward a longer chain [14C]C10-Cer (data not shown). 2We were unable to test the activity of purified GCS using long-chain, naturally occurring ceramides because of their insolubility in our assay solution. However, the glucosylation yield of the radioactive C6-Cer was only ∼25% of that of C6-NBD-Cer (data not shown). By contrast, C5-DMB-Cer containing a different fluorophore was a poor substrate with 21% glucosylation compared to C6-NBD-Cer (Table 3). We also tested the effects of D-threo-PDMP, a known specific inhibitor of GCS (43.Inokuchi J.-I. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Google Scholar). PDMP inhibited the activity of purified GCS ∼45% at 1 μM and 85% at 10 μM (Fig. 5).Tabled 1 Finally, we evaluated the ability of GCS to use various donor substrates to glycosylate C6-NBD-Cer. Of the UDP-hexoses, GCS was able to utilize UDP-Glc efficiently but had little or no activity using UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-mannose, or UDP-xylose as hexose donors (Table 4). UDP-Glc was the best glucose donor among diphosphoglucose nucleotides, but TDP-glucose and CDP-glucose also were efficient glucose donors (Table 4). Surprisingly, ADP-glucose was also used as a substrate by GCS, leading to about 6% glucosylation of C6-NBD-Cer compared to UDP-Glc.Tabled 1 We report here for the first time a method for the purification of GCS. Several features of the method were critical for the successful purification of this enzyme. First, the modifications that we introduced in the homogenization and Golgi fractionation procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”) significantly improved the enrichment and recovery of GCS activity relative to our previous work(16.Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Google Scholar). Second, we found that inclusion of UDP-Glc and DOPC as protective agents improved the stability of GCS. Similarly, UDP and phospholipids were reported to stabilize UDP-Glc:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase(44.Matern H. Bolz R. Matern S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 99-105Google Scholar); however, UDP had no protective effect on GCS activity (data not shown). Finally, we found that green dye-agarose could be used in a two-step procedure to purify GCS based on the selective binding of GCS to the dye-agarose in the absence, but not in the presence, of UDP-Glc. This procedure led to a ∼20-fold enrichment of GCS in the UDP-Glc-eluted fractions and was the only chromatographic procedure that we tried that produced any enrichment in the enzyme. Dye-agaroses have been used previously in the purification of numerous proteins such as dehydrogenases, kinases, and serum proteins (for review, see (45.Lowe C.R. Small D.A.P. Atkinson A. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 33-40Google Scholar)) as well as UDP-Glc:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase(46.Gold P. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12967-12975Google Scholar). The observation that the binding of GCS to dye-agarose is inhibited by UDP-Glc suggests a competition between UDP-Glc and dye molecules for the active site of the enzyme. Similar results were described for another glycosyltransferase purified on dye-agarose(47.Bar-Peled M. Lewinsohn E. Fluhr R. Gressel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20953-20959Google Scholar). Using the solubilized and purified GCS, we also obtained new information about the enzymatic characteristics of this protein. First, we found that purified GCS had almost no activity in the absence of exogenous phospholipid. Activity was restored by the addition of phospholipids, with the highest enhancement of activity observed with low concentrations (0.1 mM) of unsaturated, long chain (C16:1 or C18:1) phosphatidylcholine (Table 2, Fig. 4). In contrast, phospholipids had little effect on GCS activity in the Golgi or CHAPSO-solubilized Golgi membranes. Presumably, endogenous phospholipids present in Golgi membranes were sufficient to stimulate maximal activity in the Golgi fractions. These endogenous phospholipids may have been depleted during purification of the enzyme by dye-agarose chromatography, causing an almost complete loss of GCS activity, which could be restored by exogenous phospholipids. A stimulating effect of exogenous phospholipids on glycosyltransferase activities was documented previously(42.Cestelli A. White F.V. Costantino-Ceccarini E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 283-292Google Scholar, 48.Costantino-Ceccarini E. Suzuki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 167: 646-654Google Scholar, 49.Holmes E.H. Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1095-1105Google Scholar, 50.Neskovic N.M. Sarlieve L.L. Mandel P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 334: 301-315Google Scholar). More recently, stimulation of solubilized GCS activity by phosphatidylcholine was reported(51.Durieux I. Martel M.B. Got R. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 709-715Google Scholar); however, the concentrations reported for optimal activity were ∼100-fold higher (8-10 mM) than the value that we report here (0.1 mM). Our results on the specificity of purified GCS toward ceramide analogs are in good agreement with previously published studies concerned with GCS activity in cultured cells or membrane preparations. First, we found that GCS is stereospecific, utilizing erythro- but not threo-C6-NBD-Cer as a substrate, similar to results reported using cultured fibroblasts(18.Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Google Scholar). We also found that D-erythro-C6-NBD-dihydroceramide was glucosylated to about 25% of control values obtained with C6-NBD-Cer (Table 3). This result supports recent observations on the metabolism of C6-Cer analogs in Chinese hamster ovary cells(52.Ridgway N.D. Merriam D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 57-70Google Scholar). Second, we found that C6- and C8-ceramides were better substrates than ceramides with longer or shorter N-acyl chains, confirming observations reported for GCS activity in microsomal preparations(41.Vunnam R.R. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 73-82Google Scholar). Finally, we found that C6-NBD-Cer is a better substrate for GCS than is [14C]C6-Cer. By contrast, C5-DMB-Cer, containing a different fluorophore, was poorly glucosylated relative to C6-NBD-Cer (Table 3), consistent with previous findings in cultured cells(53.Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Google Scholar). We also examined the nucleotide specificity of GCS and found that, surprisingly, GCS is able to efficiently utilize CDP-Glc and TDP-Glc as glucose donors (see Table 4). While CDP-Glc and TDP-Glc are not naturally occurring glucose donors, earlier studies have also described UDP-Glc:glucosyltransferases that are able to utilize CDP-Glc and TDP-Glc(54.Schmid G. Griesbach H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 363-370Google Scholar, 55.Wojciechowski Z.A. Zimowski J. Zimowski J.G. Lyznik A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 570: 363-370Google Scholar). In summary, we have presented for the first time a method for the purification of GCS, applied this method to isolate a ∼10,000-fold enriched GCS fraction from rat liver, identified two polypeptides (60-70 kDa) as likely candidates for the GCS protein, and further characterized the purified enzyme. This information provides a basis for future molecular studies of this key enzyme in GSL biosynthesis. -We thank the members of the Pagano laboratory for encouragement and critical reading of the manuscript. Note Added in Proof-Recently Ichikawa et al. (34) have isolated a cDNA encoding human GCS by expression cloning using GM-95 cells lacking the enzyme as a recipient. The open reading frame encodes a protein containing 394 amino acids (predicted molecular mass of 44.9 kDa)."

The first was located in the extracellular domain and was sufficient to confer apical localization on the fusion protein. The second was the Cys-Gln-Cys (CQC) motif at the junction of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. This sequence was necessary for surface expression.

The mechanism by which MUC1 is targeted and maintained on the apical surface is not known; correct localization, however, would be predicted to be crucial for function. Because of the important role of mucin glycoproteins in cancer, more information regarding the expression and trafficking of this molecule is needed. The MUC1 gene encodes a protein that consists of three distinct domains, namely a large extracellular domain and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains(10.Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A.

The extracellular domain consists predominantly of variable numbers of a 20-amino acid tandem repeat, making the gene encoding MUC1 highly polymorphic, with each allele encoding a product containing different numbers of repeats(10.Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.-N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15286-15293Google Scholar, 14.Swallow D.M. Gendler S.J. Griffiths B.

Each tandem repeat contains several potential sites for O-linked glycosylation, and the mature molecules expressed by the mammary gland have been estimated to be composed of 50-60% carbohydrate(10.Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.-N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15286-15293Google Scholar). The extensive glycosylation of MUC1, combined with the presence of many proline residues, contributes to the extended and rigid structure of MUC1 on the cell surface(15.Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 15: 291-294Google Scholar, 16.Hilkens J. Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Litvinov S.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 359-363Google Scholar). It is thought that the cytoskeleton has an important role in maintaining the cytoarchitecture of epithelia and in defining membrane specializations such as junctional complexes and microvilli. Previous work showing that actin-disrupting drugs selectively led to a disruption of the apical localization of MUC1 suggested that interaction with the actin cytoskeleton may be important for its localization(17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar). Moreover, MUC1 appears to localize to microvilli, and it is possible that it may play a role in organizing the cytoskeleton(17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar). This is also suggested from the observation that MUC1 is expressed early in developing epithelia before the glands are active, while morphogenesis is still occurring(18.Braga V.M.M. Pemberton L.F. Duhig T. Gendler S.J. Development. 1992; 115: 427-437Google Scholar). In this paper we attempt to determine if a particular domain of MUC1 contains a signal to specify its apical localization. Discrete domains in the cytoplasmic region of some proteins have been shown to target these proteins to the basolateral domain, although such signals have not yet been identified for apical targeting(19.Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Google Scholar, 20.Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Google Scholar).

Gendler S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 167-175Google Scholar), we postulated that the cytoplasmic tail is functionally important, and we chose to dissect this domain carefully. One possible function for the cytoplasmic tail is to target MUC1 to the apical membrane. Our results indicated that the cytoplasmic domain was not involved in the apical localization; however, two cysteine residues at the end of the transmembrane/beginning of the cytoplasmic tail appeared to be important for membrane localization. Using chimeric molecules composed of different domains of CD2 and MUC1, we have demonstrated that the extracellular domain of MUC1 can confer apical localization on the CD2 molecule. The results suggest that MUC1 contains two discrete motifs important in its apical localization.

Madin-Darby canine kidney cells fluorescence-activated cell sorter base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. Cell lines were cultured at 37°C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were passaged every 2-3 days, and early passages were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cells were grown in flasks and transferred to 3-cm plastic dishes (Nunc) or 16-mm glass coverslips for further processing. MDCK cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Briefly, cells were grown to 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes. Twenty μg of plasmid DNA was precipitated with calcium phosphate and added to the growth medium. Cells were incubated with above for 4 h at 37°C, followed by incubation with 15% glycerol for 2 min before returning them to normal growth conditions. After 72 h, 0.7 mg/ml G418 was added to the growth medium. Panc-1 cells were transfected by DEAE-dextran precipitation. Cells at 70% confluence were incubated with 20 μg of DNA and 50 μg/ml DEAE-dextran in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were osmotically shocked with glycerol as above and returned to normal growth conditions. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were grown in selection medium containing 0.6 mg/ml G418. From both cell lines, discrete colonies were isolated and expanded for further testing. Cells were grown to confluence on 3-cm plastic dishes or glass coverslips. Cells were either fixed for 10 min in methanol:acetone at −20°C or fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. For “live” staining, cells were left unpermeabilized and unfixed and only fixed with methanol:acetone as above at the end of the antibody-labeling procedures. Cells that were solubilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 were grown previously in 3-cm plastic dishes for 3-4 days. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 10 mM Hepes, 0.17 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2. After a brief washing, cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 min and then further fixed with methanol at −20°C for 15 min. Immunofluorescent staining was as described (23.Pemberton L. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 167-175Google Scholar). Stained cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope or a Nikon Optiphot Confocal Microscope. Cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 106 cells were processed in microtiter plates for FACS analysis as described(5.Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Epith. Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 155-162Google Scholar). Five thousand cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACS scan. Cells from a 75-cm2 flask were scraped gently into a tube and pelleted by centrifugation. For pre-embedding labeling, cells were either unfixed or lightly fixed in 1% monomeric glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline and quenching in 50 mM glycine, cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4°C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with antibody at 10-50 mg/ml for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed and incubated with colloidal gold conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (1:20) for 60 min at 4°C. After washing, cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and silver enhancement was carried out using Intensive M. Silver Enhancement Kit (Amersham). Cells were postfixed in osmium tetroxide in Sorenson buffer at room temperature for 2 h, dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions (70-100%), followed by propylene-oxide, and then impregnated with propylene-oxide:Epon at decreasing concentrations of propylene-oxide until embedding in pure Epon overnight. Ultrathin (80-100 nm) sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate, and viewed with a Zeiss 10C microscope. For postembedding labeling, cells were fixed in 1% monomeric glutaraldehyde, dehydrated as above, and infiltrated with Lowicryl rather than Epon. Ultrathin sections were taken as above and then reacted with antibodies as described.

A BamHI fragment containing the entire coding sequence of MUC1 including 30 tandem repeats was ligated into the BamHI site of pBS (Stratagene) from which the polylinker sites between SalI and KpnI had been removed by digestion, filled in with Klenow, and religated (creating pBSΔAA). This construct had unique AccI and ApaI sites in the MUC1 cDNA located 5′ and 3′ of the transmembrane and CT region (see Fig. 1A for position of restriction sites). MUC1 cDNAs with deletions in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) were created as follows: PCR fragments were generated from the full-length cDNA with a 5′ primer spanning the AccI site and 3′ primers located at various positions within the CT. The 3′ primers contained a translation termination codon and a 3′ ApaI site. PCR products were subcloned into pBSΔAA MUC1 using AccI and ApaI. The cDNAs with different length CTs were transferred to pHβAPr-1-neo using BamHI (25.Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteines proximal to the cytoplasmic tail region to alanine was performed using a two-stage PCR method. Overlapping primers containing the necessary nucleotide substitutions were made in both orientations. Using these in combination with a primer at the AccI site (primer A) and a primer at the stop codon (MUC-D), two separate PCR reactions were performed. The PCR products formed the template for the second PCR reaction using the AccI and stop codon primers. The cysteines were mutated singly (using oligonucleotides CQA M1, CQA M2, or AQC M1, AQC M2) and together (using oligonucleotides AQA M1, AQA M2). After verifying the sequence by sequencing, the PCR product was digested with AccI and BamHI and ligated into similarly cut MUC1 to replace the existing region. All constructs were transferred to pHβAPr-1-neo vector. Full-length CD2 was subcloned into pHβAPr-1-neo. Constructs containing domains from both CD2 and MUC1 were generated by PCR. Restriction sites were included at the 5′ of the PCR primers to allow coligation of domains from the two molecules without changing the amino acid sequence. All constructs were then ligated into the pHβAPr-1-neo expression vector. To create NOTR and 3TR, an XmnI to MscI fragment of the MUC1 cDNA encompassing the translational start and the entire tandem repeat domain was ligated into the SmaI site of pBS in which the AccI site had been destroyed previously (creating pBSTR). Following partial digestion of pBSTR with SmaI (which cuts in every tandem repeat), plasmids were recircularized by ligation. Resulting plasmids were analyzed for the number of remaining tandem repeats. DNA fragments containing 3 or 0 tandem repeats were removed by digestion with HindIII and AccI and ligated into pBSΔMUC1 replacing the original tandem repeat-containing fragment. Full-length MUC1 cDNAs with 0 or 3 repeats were removed from pBS-ΔAA by digestion with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into pHβAPr-1-neo expression vector. All constructions were verified by extensive restriction enzyme analysis, and fragments generated by PCR were verified by sequence analysis. To determine whether the cytoplasmic domain of MUC1 plays an important role in targeting the molecule to the cell surface, truncated forms of the gene were created (Fig. 1A). Stop codons were inserted at specific locations in the cytoplasmic domain coding sequence as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The wild type (WT) construct contained the entire extracellular domain including 30 tandem repeats, the transmembrane region, and all 69 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. The deletion mutants contained all of the extracellular and transmembrane sequences, and 45 (CT45), 33 (CT33), 18 (CT18), or 3 (CT3) amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. The three amino acids were the charged residues Arg-Arg-Lys (RRK) which are believed to represent a stop transfer sequence and would therefore be necessary for transmembrane retention of the molecule during biosynthesis. All constructs were subcloned into the pHβAPr-1-neo vector and transfected into canine MDCK and human Panc-1 cells, both of which express very low levels of the MUC1 gene or homologue. After antibiotic selection, multiple independent clones of positive transfectants were initially selected by staining methanol:acetone-fixed cells with the monoclonal antibody HMFG-2 (26.Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Peterson J.A. Arklie J. Burchell J. Ceriani R.L. Bodmer W.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 17-21Google Scholar) by indirect immunofluorescence. HMFG-2 is reactive with an epitope contained within the extracellular tandem repeat domain(27.Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Rothbard J. Burchell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12820-12823Google Scholar). The surface expression of MUC1 was analyzed on the transfected Panc-1 cell lines (Fig. 1B) and MDCK cell lines (data not shown) by FACS after immunofluorescence staining of live cells with HMFG-2. In both cell lines, high levels of the wild type MUC1 (WT) were expressed on the cell surface. Cells transfected with the cytoplasmic tail deletion constructs CT45, CT33, CT18, and CT3 also expressed MUC1 on the cell surface. MDCK cells that had been transfected with the empty expression vector (V) did not express MUC1, while Panc-1 cells transfected with this vector expressed low levels comparable with those detected in the parental cell line. There were, however, no differences in the levels of expression of the wild type and different mutant forms, other than clonal differences in levels of expression. Panc-1 cells transfected with MUC1 appeared to express higher levels of the glycoprotein than the MDCK cells, although in both cell lines, expression of MUC1 in a clonal population of cells appeared fairly heterogeneous. In cultured epithelial cells which are polarized, MUC1 is generally detected on the apical domain corresponding to the distribution observed in normal epithelial cells in vivo(6.Zotter S. Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 11-12: 55-100Google Scholar, 17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar). The membrane localization of MUC1 in the transfected cells was determined by immunofluorescence analysis of stably transfected clones using the antibody HMFG-2 directed to the tandem repeat domain. The cells were grown on glass coverslips for several days in order to form tight monolayers and then stained for immunofluorescence without prior permeabilization and analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. Analysis of the sequence of the XY planes (horizontal sections) of the cells transfected with wild type MUC1 clearly showed segregation of the label to the apical domain of these cells. Vertical XZ sections showed that, in the MDCK cells, which form tight monolayers, the immunofluorescent signal was excluded from the basolateral domain and was seen only in the apical domain (Fig. 2, A and B). In the Panc-1 cells, staining was seen in the apicolateral domain. Panc-1 cells do not form tight monolayers as seen in the MDCK cells and polarize to form apicolateral and basal domains, where the apicolateral domain encompasses much of the lateral region of the cell. MUC1 is restricted to this domain in these cells and is excluded from the basal domain. Similar analysis of both cell lines expressing the deletion mutants CT45, CT33, CT18 (data not shown), and CT3 (Fig. 2, C and D; shown here for Panc-1 CT3 cells) indicated that the mutant MUC1 was expressed on the apical (or apicolateral) cell surface in the same way as the wild type molecule. These results indicated that in these transfected cells the MUC1 protein was targeted to the apical domain and the cytoplasmic tail was not important for apical expression. The characteristic punctate pattern of MUC1 observed by indirect immunofluorescence staining and the ultrastructural studies of Parry et al.(17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar) suggested that this molecule was associated with microvilli. Moreover, data obtained following treatment of cells with actin-disrupting drugs suggested that MUC1 is associated with the actin cytoskeleton(17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar), which is well represented in microvilli rich in actin. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry was carried out on the transfected cells in order to confirm the confocal microscopy results and to determine whether the products of the transfected MUC1 gene and the MUC1 mutants showed the same ultrastructural localization. Ultrastructural studies by Parry et al.(17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar) have shown that MUC1 in an endogenously expressing cell line was localized to apical microvilli. Cells were grown to confluence on plastic dishes, scraped from the dishes, and fixed as pellets. Panc-1 cells (which are not as well polarized as MDCK cells) were fixed and embedded prior to staining and immunolabeled with HMFG-2 and gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, whereas the MDCK cells were fixed and embedded following immunolabeling. This latter type of procedure generally prevents the entry of any labeled antibody into intracellular compartments, and only antigen available on the membrane is labeled. Also, since the cells form tight monolayers, they retained their cell-cell attachments during processing, and it was possible to orientate them and to determine the apical and basolateral surfaces, both of which were accessible to labeled antibody. In the MDCK cells, the wild-type MUC1 and CT3 mutant were expressed only on the apical surfaces and appeared to be localized to microvilli as illustrated for CT3 in Fig. 3A. No surface expression was seen in MDCK cells transfected with the vector alone (data not shown). Similar results were observed with the Panc-1 cells. In the cells transfected with empty expression vector, MUC1 was expressed at very low levels both in intracellular vesicles and on the cell surface (Fig. 3B). In the MUC1-transfected Panc-1 cells, a high degree of labeling was observed in intracellular vesicles and on the cell surface (Fig. 3C) where labeling appeared to localize to microvilli. No differences could be detected between the localization of ImmunoGold labeling in transfected Panc-1 cells expressing MUC1 WT and the mutants CT45, CT33, CT18 (data not shown), or CT3 (Fig. 3D) MUC1 proteins. These results demonstrated that the transfected MUC1 was localized to apical microvilli as has been shown for endogenously expressed MUC1(17.Parry G. Beck J.C. Moss L. Bartley J. Ojakian G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 302-311Google Scholar), and, similarly, that the CT3 mutant MUC1 was also expressed on microvilli. This suggests that this localization is not dependent on the cytoplasmic tail. It has been suggested that interactions between MUC1 and the actin cytoskeleton are important for the apical localization of MUC1. Results presented above with the tailless CT3 mutant which is unlikely to be able to interact directly with the actin cytoskeleton suggested that this was not the case. In order to determine whether interactions of the cytoplasmic tail with the cytoskeleton were important for anchoring MUC1 on the cell surface, detergent extractions of cells transfected with MUC1 and the MUC1 mutants were carried out. Extraction of MUC1 from a breast epithelial cell line, MCF-7, with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice and subsequent separation by centrifugation of the insoluble and soluble fractions, resulted in approximately 50% of the cellular MUC1 fractionating into the insoluble pellet fraction, as determined by Western blotting. 2L.

Although there were several indicators suggesting a pathogenetic role for this mtDNA polymorphism, its heteroplasmic nature made functional and molecular studies difficult to interpret. We have now fused enucleated fibroblasts from the patient with a mtDNA-less cell line to generate transmitochondrial cybrids harboring different proportions of mutated and wild-type mtDNA. Individual clones harboring essentially 100% wild-type or >99% mutated mtDNAs were characterized and studied for respiratory capacity, respiratory chain enzymes activity, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and RNA steady-state levels and processing. Our results showed that cell lines containing exclusively mutated mtDNAs respire poorly, overproduce lactic acid, and have significantly impaired activity of respiratory complexes I and IV. Molecular studies showed that mutant clones have a decrease in steady-state levels of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR), and a partial impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis and steady-state levels, suggesting that these molecular abnormalities are involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of the mtDNA 3256 mutation."

To delineate the mechanisms governing the liver-specific expression of Factor X, we have previously characterized the complete 2.8 kilobase pairs of the 5′-flanking region of Factor X and demonstrated that the first 209 base pairs is sufficient to confer maximal promoter activity in HepG2 cells, a hepatoma cell line that expresses Factor X. We have also shown that mutations at ACTTTG and CCAAT elements located at −56 to −51 and −120 to −116, respectively, significantly reduce the promoter activity. In this report, we demonstrate that Factor X mRNA is primarily but not exclusively expressed in the liver. Using DNase I footprinting analysis, we determine four protein binding sites within the 209-base pair fragment, designated site 1 (−73 to −44), site 2 (−128 to −94), site 3 (−165 to −132), and site 4 (−195 to −169). Using gel mobility shift assays in combination with competition and supershift experiments, we demonstrate that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 and Sp1 bind at site 1, the site which contains the ACTTTG element. Methylation interference assays reveal that HNF-4 and Sp1 contact adjacent sites with minor overlap. HNF-4 and Sp1 appear to bind site 1 in a mutually exclusive fashion. We also demonstrate that HNF-4 can transactivate the Factor X promoter in HeLa cells; mutation at the adjacent Sp1 site further increases the transactivation. Heteromeric transcription factor NF-Y was identified as the protein that binds the CCAAT box at site 2. We conclude that HNF-4 and NF-Y play crucial roles in modulating the activity of the proximal promoter of Factor X.

F.IX, F.X and prothrombin are the precursors of the major enzymes of the coagulation cascade. In order to have activity in coagulation, these proteins must undergo γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues at the N terminus, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which requires vitamin K as a cofactor(1.Wright D.J.

The vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are synthesized predominantly or exclusively in the liver, but the mechanisms controlling liver-specific expression are not understood in detail. We have chosen F.X as a paradigm for study, because of its central role in coagulation (when activated, it converts prothrombin to thrombin) and because, in contrast to the case of F.IX, a well characterized cell line exists, HepG2 cells, which expresses F.X(2.Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Google Scholar). In previous work(3.Huang M.N. Hung H.L. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15440-15446Google Scholar), we had defined the start sites of transcription of the F.X gene and had also carried out a functional characterization of the F.X promoter, which demonstrated that the proximal 209 bp of the promoter were adequate to confer maximal activity in HepG2 cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis and reporter gene assays, we defined two areas within the F.X promoter that bound proteins from HepG2 nuclear extracts and that were required for promoter activity. In this report, we have used DNase footprinting to define 4 protein-binding sites in the proximal promoter. Using gel shift assays with nuclear extracts or purified proteins, and supershift assays with well characterized antibodies, we have determined the identity of the transcription factors that bind at the two proximal sites. In the case of the most proximal site, site 1, we show that two transcription factors, one ubiquitous (Sp1), and the other found in only a few tissues (HNF-4) bind at the site in a competitive fashion; we present evidence that HNF-4 binds at a similar site in the promoters of F.VII and F.IX. For site 2, which contains a CCAAT box, we have shown that the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y binds at this site; this is distinct from the transcription factor that binds at the CCAAT box in the F.IX promoter, which occupies a similar position with respect to the translation start site.DISCUSSIONA longstanding but poorly documented assumption regarding procoagulant proteins has been that expression of these proteins is confined to the liver. Our data indicate that, although liver is the major site of F.X mRNA synthesis, F.X mRNA is also found in lung, heart, ovary, and small intestine. Similar findings have been reported for other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins: Jamison and Degen (21.Jamison C.S. Degen S.J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 208-216Google Scholar) have reported that prothrombin mRNA is found in uterus, placenta, kidney, spleen, and small intestine in addition to liver; and more recently, Stitt et al.(22.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D. Jones P. Masiakowski P. Ryan T. Tobkes N. Chen D. DiStefano P. Long G. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.G. Lemke G. Glass D. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar) have reported the presence of protein S mRNA in uterus, heart, placenta, lung, smooth muscle, kidney, spleen, and ovary. Like thrombin and protein S, which have recently been demonstrated to activate intracellular signaling cascades through binding to specific cell surface receptors (a G protein-coupled receptor in the case of thrombin(23.Coughlin S.R. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 639-649Google Scholar), the Tyro 3/Axl family of receptor tyrosine kinases in the case of protein S(22.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D. Jones P. Masiakowski P. Ryan T. Tobkes N. Chen D. DiStefano P. Long G. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.G. Lemke G. Glass D. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar)), F.Xa has also been shown to bind to a specific cell surface receptor, EPR-1, found on monocytes and endothelial cells(24.Altieri D. FASEB. 1995; 862: 860-865Google Scholar). Occupation of the EPR-1 receptor by F.Xa triggers a mitogenic response through a signal transduction process that is not yet well understood. Thus, in contrast to F.VII 2H.-L. Hung and K. A. High, unpublished results. and F.IX(25.Salier J.P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Google Scholar), vitamin K-dependent proteins for which expression is clearly confined to the liver, our data suggest that F.X belongs to another group of vitamin K-dependent proteins with a wider tissue distribution and more protean biological effects.In previous work we had determined that the proximal 209 bp of the F.X promoter were adequate to confer maximal promoter activity in a reporter gene assay. In this work, we have used DNase I footprint analysis with nuclear extracts from HepG2 and HeLa cells to identify four protein-binding sites within this promoter element. A previously reported footprint analysis of this region carried out with HepG2 extracts identified only one of these sites, site 1(26.Miao C. Leytus S.P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7395-7401Google Scholar). The failure to detect other sites within the probe used by these investigators may reflect a difference in the quality and concentration of transcription factors in the nuclear extracts used, or it may be a function of the incubation conditions used, since failure to saturate a protein-binding site may render it difficult to detect on a footprint. For the same reasons, of course, we cannot state with certainty that the four sites we have mapped are the only protein-binding sites within this fragment.We chose the two proximal protein-binding sites for further study. In previous studies, we had established the functional significance of both of these sites(3.Huang M.N. Hung H.L. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15440-15446Google Scholar). Additionally, site 1 was of special interest, because it is the only one of the four for which the footprint differs between HepG2 and HeLa cells. We have now identified the cognate binding proteins for each site. Site 1 forms two DNA-protein complexes, designated A and B. Complex B is present only in nuclear extracts from liver, kidney, and HepG2 cells, whereas complex A is present (in varying amounts) with all extracts tested. Competition experiments, gel shift assays using in vitro translated HNF-4, and supershift experiments document that the protein giving rise to complex B is HNF-4. HNF-4 belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors; these are characterized by two highly conserved regions, one in the N terminus which binds DNA, and another in the C terminus that is required for ligand binding, dimerization, and activation. Because of the high degree of conservation in the DNA-binding domain, other members of the superfamily can demonstrate similar binding specificity. For example, COUP-TF and ARP-1 have been demonstrated to compete with HNF-4 for binding sites in the promoters of apolipoprotein CIII(27.Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Google Scholar), ornithine transcarbamylase(28.Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11125-11133Google Scholar), and erythropoietin(29.Galson D. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Google Scholar). In the supershift experiment presented in Fig. 3D, the two residual bands seen with the APF-1 probe (marked by asterisks next to lane 8) likely represent complexes containing these (or other) related proteins. The absence of any distinct residual bands in the supershift experiments with F.VII, F.IX and F.X (lanes 5-7) suggests that these promoters are probably not recognized by other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.Recently published data (30.Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Google Scholar) demonstrate that HNF-4 forms stable homodimers and fails to heterodimerize with a number of nuclear receptors that were tested. In the supershift experiment presented here (Fig. 3C, lane 12), the presence of 2 supershifted complexes raises the question of heterodimerization, but the data presented by Jiang et al.(30.Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Google Scholar) make it more likely that the two complexes arise from the binding of either one (faster moving complex) or two (slower moving complex) antibody molecules to the homodimer in the supershift complex.The promoters of F.VII, F.IX, and F.X all contain the ACTTTG motif and all bind HNF-4 (Fig. 3D). The molar amounts of labeled DNA were identical in these experiments. Thus HNF-4 has greater affinity for the F.X promoter than for the promoters of F.VII and F.IX. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences to a 13-bp consensus HNF-4 binding site proposed by Sladek (31.Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar) showed that the F.X promoter sequence gave the best match (12/13 nucleotides). The F.VII and F.IX promoters did not exhibit as close a match (11/13 and 10/13, respectively).In addition to the binding experiments, we showed that HNF-4 can transactivate all three promoters in HeLa cells. The transactivation effect in our system ranged from 2-fold in the case of F.X to 4.5-fold in the case of F.VII. These results are different from those previously published by Reijnen et al.(32.Reijnen M.L. Sladek F.M. Bertina R.M. Reitsma P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6300-6303Google Scholar), who reported a >300-fold transactivation of the F.IX promoter by HNF-4 in cotransfection experiments using the same HNF-4 expression vector. Technical considerations likely account for the differences in results. To assess transactivation, we compared our results to a base-line control cotransfected with the expression plasmid without the HNF-4 insert. Use of mock-transfected cells as base line, as reported by Reijnen et al.(32.Reijnen M.L. Sladek F.M. Bertina R.M. Reitsma P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6300-6303Google Scholar), results in a much higher fold transactivation effect.Based on competition with an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide and on supershift by an Sp1 antibody, the protein in complex A that binds to site 1 is identified as Sp1. Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor, but as is clearly evident in Fig. 3B, its concentration in different tissues varies considerably. These differences are supported by a study of the developmental expression of Sp1 in the mouse(33.Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annabella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Google Scholar), which documents low levels of Sp1 in the liver, and 70-fold higher levels in the thymus, the highest expressing tissue. One possibility is that relative levels of HNF-4 and Sp1 may influence sites of expression of F.X, with the highest levels of expression being seen in the liver where HNF-4 levels are high and Sp1 levels are low.Methylation interference analysis of the contact points of HNF-4 and Sp1 on site 1 indicates that the two transcription factors bind at adjacent sites with minor overlap. The contact region of HNF-4 includes at least 11 nucleotides centered around the ACTTTG element, whereas the contact region of Sp1 surrounds the GGGGCG element. The overlap of the HNF-4 and Sp1 binding sites suggests that they may bind to site 1 in a mutually exclusive manner. This notion is further supported by the fact that addition of increasing amounts of Sp1 reduces the binding of HNF-4 in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 5). Based on this hypothesis, one would predict that Sp1 could repress expression of Factor X by excluding the binding of HNF-4 at the neighboring site and that loss of the Sp1 site might result in higher level expression. Experimental confirmation of the latter prediction can be seen in Fig. 6, where HNF-4 transactivation of the F.X promoter in HeLa cells improves from 2- to 3.5-fold when the Sp1 binding site is destroyed. In previous work (3.Huang M.N. Hung H.L. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15440-15446Google Scholar), we had shown that mutation of the Sp1 site does not result in an increase in expression in HepG2 cells. This is most likely due to the fact that the concentration of Sp1 in HepG2 cells is low (Fig. 3B), so that loss of the Sp1 binding site has little effect. In contrast, in HeLa cells, where Sp1 is abundant, loss of the Sp1 binding site has a noticeable effect on transactivation. Whether repression by Sp1 plays any physiologic role in cells that express HNF-4 but express only low levels of F.X (e.g. kidney) is not yet clear.Two lines of evidence support our contention that the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y binds at site 2. First, the specific complex formed between site 2 and HepG2 nuclear extracts can be competed away by a strong NF-Y binding site (the Y box from MHC class II Eα gene), and second, the DNA-protein complexes can be supershifted by antibodies against NF-YA and NF-YB. It is of interest that the CCAAT box from the F.IX gene, which resides at a similar location in the F.IX promoter, cannot compete away the complex formed between site 2 and HepG2 nuclear extracts. Crossley and Brownlee (19.Crossley M. Brownlee G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the F.IX CCAAT box binds to NF-1, a transcription factor that is not structurally related to NF-Y(34.Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Google Scholar). Thus in contrast to the situation with HNF-4, which binds to the conserved ACTTTG element in all three promoters (F.VII, F.IX, and F.X), the conserved CCAAT boxes of F.IX and F.X demonstrate binding to distinct and unrelated cognate proteins.Our findings are summarized in Fig. 9. The proximal 209 bp of the F.X promoter, which are sufficient to confer maximal activity in HepG2 cells, contains four protein-protected sites as identified by DNase I footprinting. Only one of these, site 1, shows a unique footprint pattern when results with HepG2 nuclear extracts are compared with extracts from non-hepatic cell lines. We have demonstrated that site 1 binds two distinct transcription factors, HNF-4, a liver-specific factor, and Sp1, a ubiquitous factor. Methylation interference assays and transactivation experiments suggest that these two factors bind at overlapping sites in a competitive manner. In reporter gene assays in HepG2 cells, a mutation that abolishes HNF-4 binding (but does not affect Sp1 binding) reduces promoter activity to 17.2% of wild type, but mutation of the Sp1 site has virtually no effect (90.2%)(3.Huang M.N. Hung H.L. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15440-15446Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y binds at site 2; a mutation at this site also markedly reduces promoter activity to 11.8% of wild type(3.Huang M.N. Hung H.L. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15440-15446Google Scholar). These data confirm that sites 1 and 2 are critical for activity of the F.X promoter. Ongoing experiments are directed at determining the identity of the proteins that bind at sites 3 and 4 and their role in the regulation of F.X transcription.

F.IX, F.X and prothrombin are the precursors of the major enzymes of the coagulation cascade. In order to have activity in coagulation, these proteins must undergo γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues at the N terminus, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which requires vitamin K as a cofactor(1.Wright D.J. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 309-329Google Scholar). The vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are synthesized predominantly or exclusively in the liver, but the mechanisms controlling liver-specific expression are not understood in detail. We have chosen F.X as a paradigm for study, because of its central role in coagulation (when activated, it converts prothrombin to thrombin) and because, in contrast to the case of F.IX, a well characterized cell line exists, HepG2 cells, which expresses F.X(2.Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Google Scholar). In previous work(3.Huang M.N. Hung H.L. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. High K.A. J. Biol.

Using site-directed mutagenesis and reporter gene assays, we defined two areas within the F.X promoter that bound proteins from HepG2 nuclear extracts and that were required for promoter activity. In this report, we have used DNase footprinting to define 4 protein-binding sites in the proximal promoter. Using gel shift assays with nuclear extracts or purified proteins, and supershift assays with well characterized antibodies, we have determined the identity of the transcription factors that bind at the two proximal sites. In the case of the most proximal site, site 1, we show that two transcription factors, one ubiquitous (Sp1), and the other found in only a few tissues (HNF-4) bind at the site in a competitive fashion; we present evidence that HNF-4 binds at a similar site in the promoters of F.VII and F.IX. For site 2, which contains a CCAAT box, we have shown that the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y binds at this site; this is distinct from the transcription factor that binds at the CCAAT box in the F.IX promoter, which occupies a similar position with respect to the translation start site."

Whereas coumarins inhibit gyrase by binding the GyrB subunit and thereby blocking the ATP-binding site, they inhibit vaccinia topoisomerase by binding to the protein and blocking the interaction of enzyme with DNA. Noncovalent DNA binding and single-turnover DNA cleavage by topoisomerase are inhibited with KI values of 10-25 μM for coumermycin and 350 μM for novobiocin. Spectroscopic and fluorescence measurements of drug binding to enzyme indicate a single binding site on vaccinia topoisomerase for coumermycin (KD = 27 ± 5 μM) and two classes of binding sites for novobiocin, one tight site (KD1 = 20 ± 5 μM) and several weak sites (KD2 = 513 ± 125 μM; n = 4.9 ± 0.7). Addition of a stoichiometric amount of DNA to a preformed coumermycin-topoisomerase complex quantitatively displaces the drug, indicating that coumermycin binding and DNA binding to topoisomerase are mutually exclusive. A simple interpretation is that the site of drug binding coincides or overlaps with the DNA-binding site on the topoisomerase. Both novobiocin and coumermycin alter the susceptibility of vaccinia topoisomerase to proteolysis with either chymotrypsin or trypsin; similar effects occur when topoisomerase binds to duplex DNA.

INTRODUCTIONDNA topoisomerases are targeted by a variety of antimicrobial and antineoplastic drugs(1.Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Google Scholar, 2.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Google Scholar, 3.Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Google Scholar). In addition to their therapeutic value, these drugs provide indispensable research tools. Insights into topoisomerase mechanism are provided by inhibitors and poisons affecting specific steps in the catalytic cycle. Studies of drug effects in vivo, supported by genetic analyses of drug resistance, underscore the important role played by topoisomerases in virtually all DNA transactions. Drug-target relationships have been firmly established for bacterial DNA gyrase, which is sensitive to the quinolone and coumarin antibiotics(2.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Google Scholar, 3.Maxwell A. Mol.

The vaccinia enzyme is resistant to camptothecin(13.Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Google Scholar), the hallmark topoisomerase I poison, yet it is sensitive to the coumarin drugs novobiocin and coumermycin(14.Fogelsong P.D. Bauer W.R. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 1-8Google Scholar, 15.Shaffer R. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9309-9315Google Scholar), which are classical inhibitors of DNA gyrase. Coumarin action on gyrase has been studied in detail(3.Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Google Scholar). The coumarins bind to the GyrB subunit and inhibit its ATPase activity, which is required for enzyme-catalyzed DNA supercoiling. A 24-kDa subdomain of GyrB is sufficient to bind the coumarins(16.Gilbert E.J. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 365-373Google Scholar); moreover, specific amino acids implicated in drug binding are defined by drug-resistant gyrase mutants that map within this subdomain(17.Contreras A. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1617-1624Google Scholar). The molecular basis for coumarin action emerges from the crystal structure of the GyrB-novobiocin complex, in which the bound drug impinges on the binding pocket for ATP (18.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar, 19.Lewis R.J. Singh O. Smith C.V. Maxwell A. Skarzynski T. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol.

The ATP-dependent eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are also inhibited by novobiocin and coumermycin, albeit at much higher drug concentrations(20.Miller K.G. Liu L.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

The reported potency of novobiocin against vaccinia topoisomerase was comparable to its efficacy against eukaryotic topoisomerase II(14.Fogelsong P.D. Bauer W.R. J.

The identification of the gene encoding vaccinia topoisomerase (24.Shuman S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7478-7482Google Scholar) made it clear that the viral enzyme is structurally homologous to other eukaryotic type I enzymes, with no discernible similarity to DNA gyrase. Because the vaccinia topoisomerase, like other eukaryotic type I enzymes, does not require ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis for DNA relaxation, it is unclear how the coumarins might inhibit the viral protein. We now show that the coumarins target the vaccinia enzyme by a distinctive mechanism in which drug binding to the topoisomerase prevents the binding of the enzyme to DNA.DISCUSSIONThe results presented above indicate that the coumarin drugs novobiocin and coumermycin inhibit the vaccinia type I topoisomerase via a distinctive mechanism. Whereas coumarins inhibit DNA gyrase by binding the GyrB subunit and thereby blocking the ATP-binding site on GyrB, they inhibit vaccinia topoisomerase by binding to the protein and blocking the interaction of enzyme with DNA. Coumermycin binding and DNA binding to the enzyme are mutually exclusive, as judged by the ability of added DNA to displace coumermycin from a preformed drug-protein complex. The simplest interpretation of the data is that the site of drug binding coincides or overlaps with the DNA-binding site on the topoisomerase. These findings illuminate new properties of the coumarins and provide additional insights into the ligand binding properties of the vaccinia type I enzyme.An intriguing finding is that the binding of the drugs to the topoisomerase results in protection of the interdomain bridge and hinge regions from proteolysis, the same effects observed upon binding of the enzyme to duplex DNA. Models to account for the effects of drug binding on proteolysis follow naturally from the two simple cases discussed previously for DNA binding(34.Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Google Scholar), i.e. (i) that protection by ligand from proteolysis stems from direct binding of ligand to the protected region of the enzyme or (ii) that ligand binding induces a conformational change in the topoisomerase that affects the hinge and bridge. In the second case, no assumptions are made about the location of the ligand-binding site. The bridge and hinge are separated in the linear protein sequence, but their proximity in three dimensions is not known. Although duplex DNA constitutes a relatively large ligand (the “minimal” substrate for covalent complex formation by vaccinia topoisomerase is an 11-bp duplex, whereas stable noncovalent binding requires a 20-bp DNA duplex(36.Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Google Scholar, 37.Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5360-5363Google Scholar)) compared with coumermycin (1110 kDa), it is conceivable that the binding of a single coumermycin molecule at or near the DNA site could elicit the same protective effects if the bridge and hinge are relatively close to each other in the native protein.The structures of novobiocin and coumermycin bear little resemblance to DNA; therefore, it seems unlikely that they would make the same spectrum of contacts with the enzyme that are made by duplex DNA. A more plausible explanation for hindrance of DNA binding by coumarins is that the drugs bind to the enzyme and overlap with the DNA-binding site. This is similar to the gyrase case, where novobiocin does not bind in the ATP site, but binds adjacent to it and sterically hinders ATP binding. The binding data indicate that occupancy by one coumermycin molecule at a high affinity site is sufficient to account for inhibition of vaccinia topoisomerase, whereas novobiocin inhibition entails binding to one or more weak sites. Coumermycin, which resembles a dimer of novobiocin, may therefore extend from its tight binding site into the DNA-binding site. The present data do not address whether coumermycin and novobiocin bind to the same high affinity site on the topoisomerase (with novobiocin also binding to additional weak sites). Invoking a common site is nonetheless in keeping with the similar chemical structures and the similar dissociation constants for a tight binding site.The increased susceptibility of the coumarin-topoisomerase complex to proteolysis at sites outside the bridge and hinge segments is consistent with a ligand-induced conformational change. The increased cleavage by chymotrypsin at Leu-146 in the presence of coumermycin or novobiocin compared with free enzyme is precisely what was observed for the topoisomerase-DNA complex(34.Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Google Scholar). The induction of multiple novel tryptic cleavage sites upon coumarin binding was more dramatic than the (primarily protective) shifts in the tryptic pattern seen with the protein-DNA complex(34.Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Google Scholar). To the extent that competitive inhibition of DNA binding by coumermycin likely involves an overlapping ligand-binding site, we view the exposure of protease-sensitive sites upon drug binding as additional indirect evidence for a conformational change upon binding of topoisomerase to DNA. Again, this does not rule out direct contact between DNA or drugs and the hinge or bridge regions.Our understanding of the interaction of vaccinia topoisomerase with DNA would be enhanced immeasurably by a crystal structure of the enzyme, preferably in the DNA-bound state. The crystal structure of the 9-kDa N-terminal tryptic fragment of the enzyme (33.Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A. Structure. 1994; 2: 767-777Google Scholar) is not informative in this regard because this fragment does not bind DNA by itself. Efforts to crystallize the full sized protein alone or with DNA have not yet been successful. The binary complex of topoisomerase and coumermycin, with drug bound at or near the DNA-binding site, offers an alternative target for crystallization. INTRODUCTIONDNA topoisomerases are targeted by a variety of antimicrobial and antineoplastic drugs(1.Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Google Scholar, 2.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Google Scholar, 3.Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Google Scholar). In addition to their therapeutic value, these drugs provide indispensable research tools. Insights into topoisomerase mechanism are provided by inhibitors and poisons affecting specific steps in the catalytic cycle. Studies of drug effects in vivo, supported by genetic analyses of drug resistance, underscore the important role played by topoisomerases in virtually all DNA transactions. Drug-target relationships have been firmly established for bacterial DNA gyrase, which is sensitive to the quinolone and coumarin antibiotics(2.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Google Scholar, 3.Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Google Scholar); for eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, which are blocked by epipodophyllotoxins, acridines, and quinolones(4.Sullivan D.M. Latham M.D. Rowe T.C. Ross W.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5680-5687Google Scholar, 5.Zwelling L.A. Hinds M. Chan D. Mayes J. Sie K.L. Parker E. Silberman L. Radcliffe A. Beran M. Blick M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Google Scholar); and for eukaryotic topoisomerase I, which is susceptible to camptothecin(8.Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Google Scholar, 9.Tamura H. Kohchi C. Yamada R. Ikeda T. Koiwai O. Patterson E. Keene J.D. Okada K. Kjeldsen E. Nishikawa K. Andoh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 69-75Google Scholar, 10.Tanizawa A. Bertrand R. Kohlhagen G. Tabuchi A. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25463-25468Google Scholar, 11.Rubin E. Pantazis P.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348Google Scholar).Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase, a eukaryotic type I enzyme, displays unusual pharmacological properties. The vaccinia enzyme is resistant to camptothecin(13.Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Google Scholar), the hallmark topoisomerase I poison, yet it is sensitive to the coumarin drugs novobiocin and coumermycin(14.Fogelsong P.D. Bauer W.R. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 1-8Google Scholar, 15.Shaffer R. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9309-9315Google Scholar), which are classical inhibitors of DNA gyrase. Coumarin action on gyrase has been studied in detail(3.Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Google Scholar). The coumarins bind to the GyrB subunit and inhibit its ATPase activity, which is required for enzyme-catalyzed DNA supercoiling. A 24-kDa subdomain of GyrB is sufficient to bind the coumarins(16.Gilbert E.J. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 365-373Google Scholar); moreover, specific amino acids implicated in drug binding are defined by drug-resistant gyrase mutants that map within this subdomain(17.Contreras A. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1617-1624Google Scholar). The molecular basis for coumarin action emerges from the crystal structure of the GyrB-novobiocin complex, in which the bound drug impinges on the binding pocket for ATP (18.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar, 19.Lewis R.J. Singh O. Smith C.V. Maxwell A. Skarzynski T. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 128-130Google Scholar) 1D. Wigley, personal communication. The ATP-dependent eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are also inhibited by novobiocin and coumermycin, albeit at much higher drug concentrations(20.Miller K.G. Liu L.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9334-9339Google Scholar, 21.Goto T. Laipis P. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10422-10429Google Scholar, 22.Melendy T. Ray D.S. J. Biol.

Virol. 1984; 49: 1-8Google Scholar) first documented coumarin inhibition of DNA relaxation by vaccinia topoisomerase using enzyme purified from infectious virions. The reported potency of novobiocin against vaccinia topoisomerase was comparable to its efficacy against eukaryotic topoisomerase II(14.Fogelsong P.D. Bauer W.R. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 1-8Google Scholar, 15.Shaffer R. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9309-9315Google Scholar, 20.Miller K.G. Liu L.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol.
