Therefore, NFκB and the signaling pathways that regulate its activation have become a major focus of drug development programs. Withania somnifera (WS) is a medicinal plant that is widely used in Palestine for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders. In this study we show that the leave extract of WS, as well as its major constituent withaferin A (WA), potently inhibits NFκB activation by preventing the tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of IκB kinase β via a thioalkylation-sensitive redox mechanism, whereas other WS-derived steroidal lactones, such as withanolide A and 12-deoxywithastramonolide, are far less effective. To our knowledge, this is the first communication of IκB kinase β inhibition by a plant-derived inhibitor, coinciding with MEK1/ERK-dependent Ser-181 hyperphosphorylation. This prevents IκB phosphorylation and degradation, which subsequently blocks NFκB translocation, NFκB/DNA binding, and gene transcription. Taken together, our results indicate that pure WA or WA-enriched WS extracts can be considered as a novel class of NFκB inhibitors, which hold promise as novel anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of various inflammatory disorders and/or cancer.

The search for anticancer drugs and anti-inflammatory agents from natural products represents an area of great interest worldwide (1.Aggarwal B.B. Ichikawa H. Garodia P. Weerasinghe P. Sethi G.

In the Palestinian traditional folk medicine, more than 700 plant species are known for their use as medicinal herbs or as botanical pesticides (2.Ali-Shtayeh M.S. Abu Ghdeib S.I. Mycoses. 1999; 42: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3.Ali-Shtayeh M.S. Yaghmour R.M. Faidi Y.R. Salem K. Al-Nuri M.A. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1998; 60: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As revealed by a recent ethnobotanical survey carried out in the West Bank, at least 63 plant species are still in use (4.Azaizeh H. Fulder S. Khalil K. Said O. Fitoterapia. 2003; 74: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Plants like Withania somnifera (WS) 4The abbreviations used are: WS, Withania somnifera; WA, withaferin A; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; IκB, inhibitory subunit of NFκB; IKK, IκB kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DEX, dexamethasone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; P-, phospho-; 12DW, 12-deoxywithastramonolide; WdA, withanolide A; PSI, proteasome inhibitor. are applied in different forms (decoctions, infusions, ointments, powder, syrup, etc.) (5.Archana R. Namasivayam A. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1999; 64: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6.Anonymous Altern. Med. Rev. 2004; 9: 211-214PubMed Google Scholar) to treat burns, wounds, and/or dermatological disorders, to prevent infections, and to treat various diseases including gastrointestinal diseases, infertility, and cutaneous abscesses (7.Essawi T. Srour M. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2000; 70: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). WS belongs to the Solanaceae family and is being used in many indigenous systems of medicine (8.Davis L. Kuttan G. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2001; 75: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is a small, semi-woody shrub with ovate leaves and greenish orange fruit. It grows wild to about 1.5 m in height and can be found growing in Palestine as well as in some other Middle East countries, in Africa, and in India (where it is alternatively called ashwagandha in ayurvedic medicine). As a result of this wide growing range, there are considerable morphological and/or chemotypical variations in terms of local species, which may affect the composition of its metabolites and/or its activities (6.Anonymous Altern. Med. Rev. 2004; 9: 211-214PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Glotter E. Kirson I. Abraham A. Lavie D. Tetrahedron. 1973; 29: 1353-1364Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10.Ascher K.R.S. Schmulterer H.

The biologically active constituents of WS are alkaloids (isopelletierine and anaferine), saponins (sitoindosides), and the C28 steroidal lactones (withanolides) (12.Mishra L.C. Singh B.B. Dagenais S. Altern. Med. Rev. 2000; 5: 334-346PubMed Google Scholar). Although some evidence on immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of WS has been reported before, the molecular mechanisms by which its constituents exert their immunomodulatory effects have not been studied and characterized sufficiently. Because the NFκB transcription factor is a key regulator of cellular processes involved in the immune response, differentiation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis (13.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 14.Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar) and because the constitutive activation of NFκB contributes to multiple pathophysiological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (15.Barnes P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), AIDS (16.Hiscott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), and cancer (17.Amit S. Ben-Neriah Y. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of the WS leaf extract and its major constituent withaferin A (WA) on the NFκB signaling pathway. In mammalian cells, the NFκB/Rel family consists of five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p105/p50 (NFκB1), and p100/p52 (NFκB2). Each family member has a conserved Rel homology domain specifying DNA binding, protein dimerization, and nuclear localization. In most cells, NFκB is composed of a heterodimer of p65 and p50 where the p65 protein is responsible for the transactivation potential. In unstimulated cells, NFκB is sequestered predominantly in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex through interaction with IκB inhibitor proteins. In response to stimulation by a variety of potent activators, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, or lipopolysaccharide (18.Wei H. Saladi R. Lu Y. Wang Y. Palep S.R. Moore J. Phelps R. Shyong E. Lebwohl M.G. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3811S-3819SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated at two conserved NH2-terminal serines (Ser-32 and Ser-36) and degraded through a ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, resulting in the release of NFκB, translocation into the nucleus, and induction of gene transcription. NFκB regulates a wide variety of important target genes encoding cytokines (IL-6, TNF, and IL-1), chemokines (IL-8 and RANTES), adhesion molecules (E-selectin), and even its own inhibitors, IκBα and IκBβ (19.Makris C. Roberts J.L. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20.Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). IκB kinase (IKK) is the protein kinase complex responsible for IκB phosphorylation in response to proinflammatory stimuli, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of the latter. IKK is a multisubunit complex that contains two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ/NEMO (NFκB essential modulator) (20.Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 21.Perkins N.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Knock-out studies have revealed that IKKβ is responsible for the proinflammatory cytokine-induced activation of NFκB (22.Pasparakis M. Luedde T. Schmidt-Supprian M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that activate the IKK complex are not completely understood, but it is known that activation requires phosphorylation of Ser-177 and Ser-181 in the activation loop of IKKβ (23.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The physiological molecular mechanism for postinduction inactivation of IKK remains a mystery; regulated IKK inhibitors such as A20 (24.Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) or other IKK inhibitors such as PP2Cβ, PP2A, CYLD (cylindromatosis), hTid-1, and Hsp70 might be involved (25.Prajapati S.

Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Alternatively, regulation of the conformational state of IKKβ via hyperautophosphorylation of its COOH terminus could lead to IKK inactivation (23.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Importantly, the disruption of the COOH-terminal sites in IKKβ leads to persistently active IKK upon stimulation (23.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), suggesting inhibitory autophosphorylation as the major source of fast IKK down-regulation. Considerable work has been directed at identifying small molecules that inhibit IKKβ as possible targets for the development of anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic drugs (31.Liang M.C. Bardhan S. Pace E.A. Rosman D. Beutler J.A. Porco Jr., J.A. Gilmore T.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 634-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, we highlight the potential of pure WA compound or WA-containing fractions of the WS leaf extract from Palestine as potent and specific inhibitors of the NFκB pathway. We observed that WA inhibits NFκB activation through inhibition of IKKβ activity depending on thioalkylation-sensitive IKKβ regulation concomitant with IKKβ Ser-181 hyperphosphorylation. This results in stabilization of cytoplasmic IκBα and hence the reduction of nuclear translocation, diminished NFκB/DNA binding, and blockage of NFκB-driven gene expression. Plant Collection and Preparation−The leaves of WS were collected during the months of January to April from the surrounding area of Ramallah, Palestine. The shade-dried and ground leaves of WS were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (1:1, v/v) for 24 h at room temperature. After filtration, the residue was covered with 100% methanol for 20 min and then drained into the same flask. The solvent was dried by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure and at a maximal temperature of 45 °C. The resulting crude extracts were stored at –20 °C until assayed. Before running the bioassay the extract was dissolved in Me2SO, diluted in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and added to the cell culture at the dose or concentration range indicated in figure legends. Chromatography−The crude extract was fractionated via solid phase extraction using Bond Elut C18 cartridges (Varian, St.-Kathelijne Waver, Belgium). After activation with methanol and conditioning with water, the extract (dissolved in methanol and diluted with 9 volumes of water) was applied to the cartridge. Fractions were eluted, respectively, with solvent of increasing strengths: water, water/methanol (3:1, v/v), water/methanol (1:1), water/methanol (1:3), and finally methanol. Appropriate volumes were used depending on the scale of the fractionation. All extracts and fractions were analyzed using HPLC. Analyses were carried out using a Waters 2695 Alliance Separations Module equipped with a Waters 996 Photodiode Array detector. The column was a Varian Omnispher (C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and was maintained at 35 °C; the injection volume was 20 μl. Gradient elution over 60 min was applied from 15% solvent B (a methanol/acetonitrile mixture with 0.025% formic acid) in solvent A (water with 0.025% formic acid) to 95% solvent B in solvent A. Another gradient from 45% solvent C (methanol with 0.025% formic acid) in solvent A to 85% solvent C in solvent A was used for the quantitative analysis of WA in the WS extract and in the fractions. Chromatograms at 220 nm were extracted from the three-dimensional data, and peaks were characterized based on their UV spectra and retention times and compared with authentic standards. Peak integrations were carried out using standard parameters. Isolation of WA and withanolide A was carried out using a Gilson 322 pump equipped with a Gilson UV-visible 156 detector and a Gilson 206 fraction collector. Solvents and gradients were similar to those used for analytical purposes. The column was a Varian Omnispher (C18, 350 × 21.4 mm, 10 μm), and fractions were collected either manually or based on peak intensity. The organic solvent remaining in the collected fractions was removed under reduced pressure using a rotavapor, and fractions were taken to dryness via lyophilization. Samples were analyzed with mass spectroscopy using flow injection on a Micromass Quattro Micro. The purified materials were also subjected to 1H NMR and 13C NMR using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. Cell Culture−Murine fibrosarcoma L929sA cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours before induction, cells were seeded in multiwell dishes such that they were confluent at the time of the experiment. IKKα- and IKKβ-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. Emmanuel Dejardin) (32.Derudder E. Dejardin E. Pritchard L.L. Green D.R. Korner M. Baud V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and cervix cancer cells (HeLa) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were cultured in L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cytokines, Inducing Compounds, Antibodies, and Reagents−Recombinant murine TNF, produced in Escherichia coli and purified in our laboratory to at least 99% homogeneity, had a specific biological activity of 8.58 × 107 IU/ml of protein as determined in a standard TNF cytolysis assay. Reference TNF (code 88/532) was obtained from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK). U0126 was supplied by Promega (Madison, WI); SB203580 was purchased from Alexis (Lausanne, Switzerland); SP600125 was purchased from Calbiochem; cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. Work solutions of the reagents were routinely prepared in culture medium. Control experiments verified that the final concentration of organic solvents did not interfere with any of the assays. Withaferin A, withanolide A, and 12-deoxywithastramonolide were purchased from ChromaDex (Santa Ana, CA) and were stored as 1 mg/ml solution in methanol at –20 °C. PSI was purchased from Affiniti Research Products Ltd. and was stored as a 10 mm solution in Me2SO at –20 °C. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem, and lipopolysaccharide was purchased from Sigma. Anti-IκBα (C-21), anti-IKKα, anti-IKKβ, anti-p65, anti-IKKγ, and the phosphospecific anti-IκBα and anti-IKKα(Ser-180)/IKKβ(Ser-181) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The phosphospecific anti-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-p42/p44 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and anti-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) MAPK polyclonal rabbit antibodies only detect the dual phosphorylated form of MAPK; they were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Plasmids−The full-size IL-6 promoter reporter gene construct p1168hu.IL6P-luc+ and the recombinant plasmids pAP1luc and p(IL-6κB)350hu.IL6P-luc+ were described previously (33.Vanden Berghe W.

Mukaida (Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa, Japan). pELAMP-luc+, containing the E-selectin promoter, was a kind gift from D. Goeddel (Tularik, San Francisco, CA). Biological IL-6 Assay−Secreted IL-6 was quantified according to its growth-stimulating effect on 7TD1 cells as described previously (33.Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Transfection Procedure−Stable transfection of L929sA cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure according to standard protocols (33.Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Analysis−Luciferase and galactosidase reporter assays were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) and have been described previously (33.Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Normalization of luciferase activity was performed by measurement of β-galactosidase levels in a chemiluminescent reporter assay Galacto-Light kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Light emission was measured in a luminescence microplate counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Luciferase activity, expressed in arbitrary light units, was corrected for the protein concentration in the sample by normalization to the co-expressed β-galactosidase levels. β-Galactosidase protein levels were quantified with a chemiluminescent reporter assay Galacto-Light kit (Tropix). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)−L929sA, MDA-MB231, HeLa, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. After appropriate induction, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested with a rubber policeman, and precipitated in 1 ml of PBS by centrifugation for 10 min at 2600 rpm (4 °C). Preparation of total, cytoplasmic, or nuclear cell extracts has been described previously (35.De Bosscher K. Vanden Berghe W. Beck I.M. Van Molle W. Hennuyer N. Hapgood J. Libert C. Staels B. Louw A. Haegeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15827-15832Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 36.Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For EMSA, equal amounts of protein were incubated for 25 min with an NFκB-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide and binding mixture as described previously (36.Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Vanden Berghe W. Francesconi E. De Bosscher K. Resche-Rigon M. Haegeman G. Mol Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 797-806PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed with [α-32P]dCTP by using Klenow enzyme (Roche Applied Science). The NFκB oligonucleotide comprises the sequence 5′-AGCTATGTGGGTTTTCCCATGAGC-3′ in which the single IL-6 promoter-derived NFκB motif is bold and underlined. Samples were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer (pH 8). The gel was dried after electrophoresis, and complexes formed were analyzed using PhosphorImager technology. Western Blot Analysis−L929sA cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. Cells were pretreated with the extract/compound for 1 h followed by incubation with TNF for the indicated time periods. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue). To shear DNA and reduce sample viscosity, lysates were sonicated for 1 min in a water bath sonicator and then heated to 95 °C for 5 min after which they were immediately cooled in ice and microcentrifuged for 5 min. The lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed using the appropriate antibodies, and the immunoreactive protein was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Eastman Kodak Co.). Zymosan-induced Inflamed Paw Model−Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Iffa Credo. The experimental setup contained three groups with 10 animals per group. Group 1 received an intraperitoneal injection of 60 μl of Me2SO (sterile) followed 30 min later by a subcutaneous injection of zymosan solution (15 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, sterilized) in the right footpad; the left footpad was left uninjected. Group 2 was treated intraperitoneally with 60 μl of 0.5 mg/mouse withaferin A (dissolved in Me2SO) followed 30 min later with zymosan injection. Group 3 was treated with 60 μl of (150 μg/mouse) dexamethasone (DEX) followed 30 min later with zymosan injection. 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the zymosan treatment, the thickness of both footpads was measured by using a caliper, and the difference between zymosan- and non-injected footpads was compared for all three experimental groups. Determination of Systemic IL-6 Levels in Blood−Blood samples were taken by sinus retro-orbital punction under isoflurane anesthesia from mice 6 h after zymosan injection, which followed pretreatment with Me2SO (60 μl/mouse), withaferin A (0.5 mg/mouse), or DEX (150 μg/mouse) injected intraperitoneally (six mice per group) for 30 min. IL-6 protein levels were tested by the biological 7TD1 assay as described elsewhere (33.Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR−Reverse transcription-PCRs were carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Briefly, an aliquot of 5 μg of total RNA, 2 μl of oligo(dT), and x ml of DEPC-bidi (diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated bidistilled water) (to adjust the final volume to 10 μl) was placed in a microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The sample was briefly centrifuged and placed on ice for 10 min. A 20-μl reaction mixture (containing 6 μl of buffer 5×, 2.5 μl of 100 mm DTT, 2.5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, 0.5 μl of RNasin®, 1 μl if avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 7.5 μl of DEPC-bidi) was added to the annealed RNA sample. The reverse transcription was conducted using the following conditions: 5 min at 70 °C followed by a decrease of 0.1 °C/s to 42 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 90 °C per cycle. The obtained cDNA fragments were then further analyzed with quantitative PCR. cDNA-specific primer sets are available upon request. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. After staining the gel with ethidium bromide, the products were detected under UV light. Northern Blot Analysis−After appropriate inductions, RNA isolations were obtained by using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly 10 × 106 L929sA cells were grown to subconfluency in 14-cm Petri dishes. Cells were pretreated with WS for 1 h before TNF induction for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol; denaturation was achieved with a combination of Me2SO and deionized glyoxal (Sigma). A total of 23 μg of RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). RNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by standard capillary blotting and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Hybridization was done by sequentially probing with murine IL-6, human IκBα, RANTES, and murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragments. The membrane was stripped (with boiling 0.5% SDS, left on the membrane until it is cold) before each new hybridization step. All fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using a Random Primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). In Vitro Kinase Assay−IKK complex from whole-cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKKγ for 2 h followed by treatment with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After 2 h of incubation, the beads were washed with IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.1% Igepal, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and assayed in 40 μl of kinase assay mixture containing kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with an anti-P-IκBα antibody.

Previous studies have shown that these receptors bind the outer trimannose branch Manα1-3[Manα1-6]Manα present in high mannose structures. Although the trimannoside binds to DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR more strongly than mannose, additional affinity enhancements are observed in the presence of one or more Manα1-2Manα moieties on the nonreducing termini of oligomannose structures. The molecular basis of this enhancement has been investigated by determining crystal structures of DC-SIGN bound to a synthetic six-mannose fragment of a high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide, Manα1-2Manα1-3[Manα1-2Manα1-6]Manα1-6Man and to the disaccharide Manα1-2Man. The structures reveal mixtures of two binding modes in each case. Each mode features typical C-type lectin binding at the principal Ca2+-binding site by one mannose residue. In addition, other sugar residues form contacts unique to each binding mode. These results suggest that the affinity enhancement displayed toward oligosaccharides decorated with the Manα1-2Manα structure is due in part to multiple binding modes at the primary Ca2+ site, which provide both additional contacts and a statistical (entropic) enhancement of binding.

The dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN functions in the initial recognition of pathogens and also in adhesive interactions with T cells that scan the surface of dendritic cells for complementary peptide antigen-major histocompatibility complexes (1Cambi A.C.

Although the epitope for T cell interactions has not been defined, interactions with pathogens exploit the ability of DC-SIGN to recognize both branched fucosylated structures bearing terminal galactose residues and high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides (3Appelmelk B.J. van Die I. van Vliet S.J.

A related receptor found on endothelia in the liver, lymph nodes, and placenta, designated DC-SIGNR or L-SIGN, does not recognize fucosylated carbohydrates but shares with DC-SIGN the ability to bind tightly to high mannose N-linked carbohydrates and to serve as a viral receptor (5Guo Y.

DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are members of the C-type lectin family of Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins. The two receptors have similar primary structures, each of which comprises a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane anchor, a tetramerization domain, and a C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) (6Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR CRDs reveal the typical long form C-type lectin fold (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). There are three Ca2+ seen in these structures, of which one, designated the principal Ca2+, is common to all C-type lectins. The hallmark of sugar binding to C-type lectins is the direct coordination of the principal Ca2+ by vicinal hydroxyl groups of a pyranose ring, which also form hydrogen bonds with the amino acid side chains that serve as the other Ca2+ ligands (12Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In the case of mannose-like ligands, vicinal, equatorial 3- and 4-OH groups form these coordination and hydrogen bonds. Specificity for particular oligosaccharides comes from additional contacts made to flanking regions of the C-type CRD. Competition assays in which a test ligand is used to compete radiolabeled mannose-bovine serum albumin from immobilized CRD have been used to examine the relative affinities of mannose-containing structures for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 6Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The trimannose core structure Manα1-3[Manα1-6]Man was found to bind 4-fold better than mannose to DC-SIGN and 2-fold better to DC-SIGNR, and the disaccharide Manα1-2Man shows similar preferences (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A pentasaccharide corresponding to the inner five mannoses of a high mannose oligosaccharide but lacking all terminal α1-2-linked mannoses binds 7- and 4-fold better than mannose to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. The full N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc2, however, shows much more substantial affinity enhancements (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the presence of the Manα1-2Man moieties at the nonreducing termini of high mannose oligosaccharides might provide substantial affinity enhancements, perhaps by interacting with a secondary binding site for this group. The surface glycoproteins of HIV and other enveloped viruses are relatively rich in Man8 and Man9 structures (13Scanlan C.N. Pantophlet R. Wormald M.R. Saphire E.O. Stanfield R. Wilson I.A. Katinger H. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7306-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), so high affinity binding to such glycans contributes to selective interaction of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR with these pathogens. Here, the mechanism by which terminal Manα1-2Man groups enhance affinity toward DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR is investigated using synthetic fragments of the full N-linked high mannose structure in binding and structural studies. The data indicate that multiple modes of binding at the DC-SIGN carbohydrate-binding site provide a statistical enhancement of the affinity but do not account for all of the observed affinity differences. The different binding orientations feature contacts between the terminal mannose and different regions of the proteins, which likely provide the remaining component of the increased affinity for larger glycans. Protein Expression—The DC-SIGN carbohydrate-recognition domain was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (6Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and used for cocrystallization with Manα1-2Man. A similar construct lacking the C-terminal 12 residue extension was used for cocrystallization with Man6. Both proteins were purified as described (6Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Synthesis and Purification of Man6 and Man9 Oligosaccharides—Compounds Man9 and Man6a (Fig. 1) were prepared analogously to those previously described in the literature (14Ratner D.M. Adams E.W.

Chem. 2002; 2002: 826-833Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). O-Me protection at the reducing end was chosen to diminish the possible interference of the linker with the binding site of the protein. Compound Man6b was prepared following the same approach as Man9, using methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (16Ding X. Wang W. Kong F. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 303: 445-448Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Sondheimer S.J. Eby R. Schuerch C. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 60: 187-192Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as the core sugar unit. After removal of all protecting groups, the compounds were dialyzed two times each for 12 h against 2 liters of Millipore water and then lyophilized. The Manα1-2Man disaccharide was purchased from Sigma. Binding Assays—Solid phase competition binding assays were performed using bacterially expressed CRDs of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, with 125I-Man-bovine serum albumin employed as the reporter ligand (6Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The assays were performed at least twice in duplicate, except that the Man9GlcNAc2 glycan was assayed only once in duplicate because only limited quantities were available. Sugar concentrations were determined using the anthrone reaction (18Spiro R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 3-26Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of DC-SIGN CRD complexed with Man2 or Man6b (Fig. 1) were grown at 21 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion (1 μl of protein to 1 μl of reservoir in a drop for Man2 and 0.6:0.6 for Man6b). The protein solution that gave crystals for the DC-SIGN·Man2 complex contained 10 mg ml-1 protein, 5 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Man2. The protein solution that gave crystals for the DC-SIGN·Man6b complex contained 5 mg ml-1 protein, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Man6b. The reservoir solution for both crystals contained 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0. The crystals were transferred to a drop of reservoir solution with added sugar, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and maintained at 100 K during data collection. DC-SIGN·Man6b complex data were measured on an ADSC Q315 CCD detector at beam line 11-1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. DC-SIGN-Man2 diffraction data were measured on an ADSC Q315 CCD detector at beam line 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source. Diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA (19Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The asymmetric unit contains one copy of the protein·ligand complex. Rather than reindexing to allow direct rigid body refinement, the two structures were determined by molecular replacement with the DC-SIGN CRD model from the Man4 complex (Protein Data Bank ID 1SL4). The Man2 complex structure was determined with the program MOLREP (19Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), which gave a correlation coefficient of 70% and the R value of 33% for data to 3 Å. The Man6b complex was solved with the program COMO (20Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 782-784Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which gave a correlation coefficient of 56% and the R of value 31% for data to 3.5 Å. Refinement and map calculations for both structures were performed with CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The maximum-likelihood amplitude target was used, with bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections applied throughout the refinement. As refinement progressed it became clear that the ligand is bound to the site in two alternative, overlapping orientations in both structures. The two conformations were assigned occupancies of 75 and 25% based on the quality of the electron density and refined temperature factors. For each ligand orientation, Fig. 2 shows the Fo - Fc electron density calculated from coordinates omitting the indicated orientation but including the other. Water molecules were added to peaks of >3 σ in Fo - Fc maps that were within hydrogen bond distance to protein, sugar, or other water molecules. The final model of the DC-SIGN CRD·Man2 complex contains residues 253-384 of DC-SIGN, two alternative conformations of the carbohydrate ligand, 3 Ca2+, and 135 water molecules. The final model of the DC-SIGN CRD·Man6 complex contains residues 253-384 of DC-SIGN, two alternative conformations of the ligand, 3 Ca2+, and 59 water molecules. The refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Relative Affinities of Oligomannose Structures for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR—To examine the contribution of the Manα1-2Man groups present on the termini of high mannose oligosaccharide to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR binding, three synthetic oligomannose structures corresponding to fragments of Man9GlcNAc2 were tested in the competition assay. Man9 is the full 9-mannose structure that would be linked to GlcNAc-GlcNAc-Asn in high mannose N-linked carbohydrates (Fig. 1, green box). Man6a lacks the three terminal mannoses of Man9 (Fig. 1, red box). Man6b is the substructure of Man9 that lacks the α1-3 branch arm (Fig. 1, blue box). These compounds were assayed relative to mannose, and the full Man9GlcNAc2 structure purified from soybean agglutinin was also included for direct comparison. The two Man6 structures bind similarly, with a 9-14-fold affinity enhancement relative to mannose, whereas the Man9 compound binds roughly twice as strongly as the Man6 glycans. The full Man9GlcNAc2 glycan consistently shows 2-3-fold stronger binding than Man9 (Table 2).TABLE 2Competition data for ligand binding to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR CRDsLigandDC-SIGNDC-SIGNRK1K1 vs. mannoseK1K1 vs. mannoseμMfold increaseμMfold increaseMan2300 ± 10012500 ± 2001Manα 1-2ManaRelative values of K1 vs. mannose for Manα 1-2Man taken from Ref. 4.

The structure of this complex was determined at 2.4 Å resolution. The protein structure is identical to that previously described for complexes with Man3GlcNAc2 (GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-3[GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-6]Man) (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I.

The ligand is bound in two overlapping orientations, in a mixture estimated at 75%, designated the major orientation (Fig. 3, A and B), and 25%, designated the minor orientation (Fig. 3, C and D). Of the six mannoses in the compound, only three are visible in the major orientation (Manα1-2Manα1-3Man) and two in the minor orientation (Manα1-2Man). The penultimate α1-3-linked mannose that forms one arm of the outer branched trimannose unit (i.e. Manα1-2Manα1-3[Manα1-2Manα1-6]Manα1-6Man) binds to the primary Ca2+ site and was similarly observed to bind to the Ca2+ in both the DC-SIGN/Man4 (5Guo Y.

The α1-6 branch of the oligosaccharide is not visible, however, which is surprising given the shape complementarity and specific hydrogen bonds between the α1-6-linked mannose and Phe313, Ser360, and other residues in DC-SIGN that were observed in the earlier structures (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 5Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is obscure, especially considering the fact that the crystal is essentially isomorphous to the Man4 complex (5Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the Man4 and Man3GlcNAc2 structures, the α1-6-linked mannose has higher temperature factors than the α1-3-linked mannose, suggesting that it may be more weakly bound. The α1-2-linked mannose at the nonreducing terminus directly contacts Val351. In the second, less populated orientation, the same mannose residue is bound to the Ca2+, but its orientation is reversed by a 180° rotation about a line bisecting the pyranose ring through the C-3-C-4 bond. This rotation exchanges the positions of the 3- and 4-OH groups so that they still form the Ca2+ coordination and hydrogen bonds characteristic of C-type lectin-mannose interactions (Fig. 3, B and D). A similar situation was observed in complexes of mannose-binding proteins with various ligands (22Ng K.K.-S. Kolatkar A.R. Park-Snyder S. Feinberg H. Clark D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16088-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this orientation, only two sugars are visible: the mannose at the Ca2+ site and the nonreducing terminal α1-2-linked mannose, which forms hydrogen bonds with Glu358 and Ser360 and which also interacts with the face of the Phe313 ring (Fig. 3C). Thus, it appears that the Phe313 side chain has important roles in the recognition of ligand in either orientation. Because only Manα1-2Man is visible, it is not possible to distinguish whether these residues correspond to the α1-3 or α1-6 arms of Man6b or whether they represent a mixture of both (Fig. 1). An overlay of the major and minor orientations is shown in Fig. 3F. Structure of Manα1-2Man Bound to DC-SIGN—To assess whether DC-SIGN might have additional subsites for the Manα1-2Man residues found at the nonreducing termini of high mannose oligosaccharides, the CRD was cocrystallized with 25 mm Manα1-2Man. The structure of the disaccharide complex reveals binding only in the principal Ca2+ site; no other carbohydrate molecules were observed even at low electron density map contour levels. Manα1-2Man binds at the principal Ca2+ site in two orientations, again related by a 180° rotation about the C-3-C-4 bond bisector. The major orientation is virtually identical to that of the Manα1-2Man moiety in the minor Man6b ligand orientation and forms the same contacts with DC-SIGN, including the contact with Phe313 (Fig. 4, A and B). In the minor orientation, only a single sugar is visible and forms the typical Ca2+ coordination and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4, C and D). This mannose is oriented identically to the Ca2+-bound mannose in the major Man6 orientation. The electron density maps, however, do not make clear whether the sugar bound at the Ca2+ is the reducing or nonreducing end of the disaccharide; it is possible that there is a mixture of the two. In particular, unlike the Man6b structure, the nonreducing α1-2-linked mannose is not visible. The electron density for this sugar is not especially well defined in the Man6b complex, so the lack of density for this residue in the Man2 complex could be due to its low occupancy. It is also possible that the favorable interaction with Val351 seen in the Man6b structure does not compensate for the loss of entropy required to form this contact in the disaccharide. Models of Man9 Binding—To assess whether the two modes of binding observed in the Man6b and Man2 structures are relevant to a full, 9-mannose oligosaccharide, coordinates for Man9GlcNAc2 obtained by NMR analysis of the free glycan (23Woods R.J. Pathiaseril A. Wormald M.R. Edge C.J. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 372-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were superimposed on the two orientations of Man6b. As noted previously (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), superposition of the outer branched trimannose moiety reveals no significant steric clashes between the rest of the oligosaccharide and the protein (Fig. 5, A and B), with only the side chain rotamers of Leu371 needing adjustment to avoid clashes. Superposition of the second orientation, which places the terminal α1-2-linked mannose of the outer α1-3 arm near Phe313, also reveals no clashes with the protein, with the possible exception of interference between Arg345 and the innermost GlcNAc residue (Fig. 5C). Further modeling, in which the terminal Manα1-2Man groups of the other arms were superimposed, shows no steric clashes (Fig. 5, D and E). Similar results were obtained with crystallographic coordinates of Man9GlcNAc2 derived from the complex with a neutralizing anti-HIV antibody (24Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), although in this case some minor adjustments to the carbohydrate were required when the outer branched mannose units were superimposed (data not shown). The structure of the Man6b·DC-SIGN complex reveals two significantly populated binding modes for the ligand. The major binding mode corresponds to that observed in previous crystal structures, featuring a specific site for the outer branched trimannose unit of high mannose N-linked carbohydrates. In this orientation, additional contacts are formed between a nonreducing α1-2-linked terminal mannose and Val351. This region of DC-SIGN is also important in binding to fucosylated sugars and a terminal GlcNAc in the GlcNAc2Man3 complex (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The latter compound binds 17-fold more strongly to DC-SIGN relative to mannose and 4-fold more than the trimannose core, suggesting that the additional interactions contribute significantly to overall specificity. Surprisingly, a second binding orientation was observed in which the mannose at the principal Ca2+ site is reversed, thereby generating new interactions between the nonreducing terminal mannose and the region around Phe313. Modeling indicates that this orientation would be able to bind to the protein as part of a full 9-mannose structure (Fig. 5, C-E). The relevance of the dual binding modes of the Man6b compound was confirmed by the structure of the Manα1-2Man disaccharide, which shows the same interactions. In this case, the preferred binding mode leaves the nonreducing end near the Phe313 site. This probably reflects a different energetic balance of the Man2 and Man6 compounds, but in any case it is clear that this binding mode can be significantly populated. The fact that no other binding sites for this ligand were observed suggests that there are no other secondary subsites that interact with terminal Manα1-2Man disaccharides in larger N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides that might account for enhanced binding to such glycans. The observation of dual binding modes, each resulting in unique contacts with DC-SIGN, permits a semi-quantitative explanation of the affinity enhancements observed when high mannose structures are decorated with α1-2-linked mannose residues at the nonreducing termini. Using [P] and [L] to denote the concentrations of free protein and ligand, respectively, and [PLn] for the concentration of the nth distinct protein·ligand complex with an association constant Ka(n), the measured affinity constant is related to the affinity constants of the individual binding modes by the equation Ka(meas) = ([PL1] + [PL2] +...)/[P][L] = Ka1 + Ka2 +... Using the definition xn = Ka(n)/Ka1 = [PLn]/[PL1], this relationship can be restated as Ka(meas) = Ka1(1 + x2 +...). Because ΔG(meas) = -RTlnKa(meas) = -RTlnKa1 - RTln(1+ x2 +...) = ΔG1 - RTln(1+ x2 +...), ΔG1 = -RTlnKa1, and ΔGn =-RTlnKa(n), it follows that xn = exp (-(ΔGn - ΔG1)/RT). Thus, for two binding modes of equal energy, ΔG2 -ΔG1 = 0, x2 = 1, and ΔG(meas) =ΔG1 - RTln2, so the ability to bind in two equally energetic modes provides an additional RTln2 of free energy, corresponding to 0.41 kcal mol-1 at 25 °C. For n isoenergetic binding modes the observed association constant will be n times the intrinsic association constant, whereas additional weaker binding modes will increase the association by less than a factor of n. The effect of this statistical factor can be illustrated by comparing the binding of Manα1-2Man with the biding of mannose. With free 3- and 4-OH groups, mannose could bind in either of two orientations related by a 180° rotation that interchanges the 3- and 4-OH groups, as described above. In the disaccharide, each residue can in principle bind in either orientation, giving a total of four binding modes. Thus, if all of these modes were strictly equivalent, the relative Ka for the disaccharide would be twice that of mannose. This argument ignores the possible contribution of an alternative binding arrangement involving the 1- and 2-OH groups, which has only been observed in the case of galactose binding to mannose-binding C-type lectins (25Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The predicted ratio is seen for DC-SIGNR, but the ratio is about 4 for DC-SIGN, which probably indicates that there are additional, favorable interactions with DC-SIGN made by the second sugar of the disaccharide. It is also possible that free mannose can bind in only one of two modes, as seen in crystal structures of mannose-binding proteins bound to monosaccharides, which generally show a single orientation rather than a mixture in the binding site (22Ng K.K.-S. Kolatkar A.R. Park-Snyder S. Feinberg H. Clark D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16088-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For more complex ligands, we can consider the trisaccharide binding mode observed in Man3GlcNAc2 and Man4 as a relatively high affinity mode. The 5-mannose core of the full Man9 structure, which lacks all Manα1-2Man groups, binds to DC-SIGN 7-fold better than mannose and 4-fold better in the case of DC-SIGNR. Man5 also possesses the inner branched trimannose unit in the core that in the absence of the β-linked GlcNAc (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) might also bind. The ability to bind to either the inner or outer branched trimannose units likely explains the enhancement of Man5 over Man3 (4Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Man6b binds 14-fold better than mannose to DC-SIGN and 12-fold better than mannose to DC-SIGNR (Table 2). Man6b lacks the inner trimannose, but the outer branched trimannose binding mode and the “reversed” mode in which the nonreducing terminal Man is bound near Phe313 are present. The 2- and 4-fold enhancement of Man6b over Man5 binding to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, can be accounted for in part by the second binding mode. In the major orientation, the α1-2-linked terminal mannose on Man6b forms additional interactions relative to Man5, which might make this orientation inherently stronger. In principle the Manα1-2Man group present on the termini of both the α1-3 and α1-6 branches of Man6b can bind in this second orientation, but they cannot be distinguished in the structure (see “Results”), potentially providing three distinct modes at the principal Ca2+ site (when the outer branched trimannose moiety plus the two termini of the two branches are considered). Given the unequal occupancies of the two orientations observed in the Man6b complex, it is likely that an inherently stronger interaction of the major, trimannose binding mode and the statistical effect of the second mode both contribute to the observed affinity enhancements. If the major orientation is of higher affinity than the nonreducing Manα1-2Man binding mode, the affinity enhancements provided by the latter will be less than a factor of n modes. If we assume that the observed occupancies reflect the relative affinities of the two binding modes, with the estimated 3:1 ratio of occupancy in both the Man6 and Man2 structures, x = ⅓, so ΔΔG = 0.65 kcal mol-1 would be the energy difference between these modes. If we further assume that the observed minor mode has an equal mixture of the two different α1-2 termini, then the ratios are 3:0.5:0.5, and the energy difference is 1.06 kcal mol-1. This result illustrates that small differences in energy caused by differences in contacts combined with entropy losses caused by conformational immobilization can give rise to preferred binding orientations and likely explains why all possible modes are not allowed even though the binding site requires only vicinal, equatorial OH groups for Ca2+ ligation. The affinities of Man6a for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are enhanced to a similar extent as for Man6b. In this case, the outer branched trimannose unit is present, but no Manα1-2Man moieties are appended to these branches. However, two Manα1-2Man groups present on the α1-3 arm of the inner branched trimannose would provide two more binding modes. It is also possible that the inner branched trimannose unit could bind. Thus, this compound would appear to have a similar number and kind of binding modes as Man6b, despite their different covalent structures. In the full Man9 structure, the inner and outer branched trimannose units are present, as well as the Manα1-2Man groups attached to the branches. If we assume that the Manα1-2Manα1-2Man on the α1-3 branch of the inner trimannose structure can provide two more modes, we have a total of six modes, which would explain its further enhancement relative to Man6. Although this analysis makes several assumptions about which modes of binding might or might not occur, it is clear that the ability of high mannose oligosaccharides to interact with DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in multiple orientations can give rise to statistical affinity enhancements that are consistent with the measured values. Energetic differences among the different binding modes also play an important role in determining the affinity of each compound. Nonetheless, the 2-3-fold increase in affinity displayed by the full Man9GlcNAc2 structure versus Man9 is difficult to understand. Perhaps the inner GlcNAc residues restrict the conformation of nearby sugar groups such that there is a smaller entropy penalty for binding, or alternatively, novel contacts are formed between these residues and the surface of the protein. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR serve as receptors for HIV and several other enveloped viruses by binding to the high mannose oligosaccharides present on viral surface glycoproteins. The CRD of DC-SIGN specifically recognizes an internal portion of the carbohydrate, namely the outer branched trimannnose unit unique to these carbohydrates. The presence of Manα1-2Man enhances the affinity of oligomannose toward these receptors, even though by itself this disaccharide binds only slightly more strongly than mannose. The CRD has an intrinsically high affinity for oligomannose structures, and tetramerization likely provides further avidity enhancements for arrays of such structures (6Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 26Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The ability of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR to bind high mannose glycans in multiple orientations may facilitate this multivalent binding of clusters of CRDs to glycans displayed in various arrangements on the surface of the virus, as proposed previously for cell surface recognition by mannose-binding proteins (22Ng K.K.-S.

There are some parallels with the mechanism by which a neutralizing antibody to HIV, 2G12, binds specifically to the terminal Manα1-2Man groups present on high mannose carbohydrates (13Scanlan C.N. Pantophlet R. Wormald M.R. Saphire E.O. Stanfield R. Wilson I.A. Katinger H. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7306-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 27Sanders R.W.

The binding site of 2G12 appears to recognize specifically a single orientation of Manα1-2Man present on the nonreducing termini of Man9, but at least two of the three branch termini bind to this antibody, which would contribute some statistical enhancement of affinity. High avidity is provided in this case by the unusual domain-swapped dimeric antibody structure, which is proposed to display appropriately spaced binding sites that match the spacing of these structures on the viral surface (24Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A.

Despite the fact that the human MMR pathway was recently reconstituted in vitro from purified individual components (5Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol.

The repair reaction requires a mismatch recognition step, which is mediated by the heterodimers of MSH2 (MutS homologue 2) and MSH6 (MutSα) or MSH2 and MSH3 (MutSβ). MutSα preferentially recognizes single base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops (7Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J.

Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Upon mismatch binding, the MutS (α or β) heterodimer associates with the heterodimeric complex of MLH1 (MutL homologue 1) and PMS2 (postmeiotic segregation 2) (MutLα) that was shown to be essential for repair (10Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Until recently, the biochemical function of the MutL protein homologues remained enigmatic. MutLα was believed to couple the mismatch recognition step to downstream processes that include the removal of the mismatch from the nascent DNA strand, resynthesis of the degraded region, and ligation of the remaining nick (1Jiricny J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 11Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). MutLα was shown to possess a weak ATPase activity (12Raschle M. Dufner P. Marra G. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21810-21820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that is essential for MMR, but the contribution of this enzymatic function to DNA metabolism was unclear. Most recently however, MutLα was shown to possess also an endonuclease activity, which introduces additional nicks into the discontinuous strand and thus facilitates the 5′ to 3′ degradation of the mismatch-containing strand by EXO1 (13Jiricny J. Cell. 2006; 126: 239-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This latter function helped explain why both EXO1, a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease, and MutLα, are required for 3′ to 5′ MMR. Moreover, characterization of the endonuclease activity of MutLα requires that the involvement of this heterodimer in biological processes other than MMR must be reexamined.MLH1 can bind two other human MutL homologues, PMS1 and MLH3, to form the heterodimers MutLβ and MutLγ, respectively. In vitro studies failed to identify a role of MutLβ in MMR (15Raschle M. Marra G. Nystrom-Lahti M. Schar P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas MutLγ can participate in the repair of base-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops, although its in vivo role seems to be only marginal (16Cannavo E.

Interestingly, the active site of the MutLα endonuclease resides in the PMS2 subunit and is conserved in MLH3 but not in PMS1 (14Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This explains why MutLα and MutLγ are active in MMR, whereas MutLβ is not.MMR defects in humans are linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, with MLH1 mutations being responsible for ∼60% of the cases. Animal models of the disease confirm this link; disruption of Msh2 and Mlh1 is associated with the most tumor-prone phenotype, whereas the severity of mutations in animals null for Msh6, Pms2, and Mlh3 is reduced, which can be explained by the redundant roles played by the polypeptides encoded by the products of these genes in MMR. Correspondingly, mice lacking both MSH3 and MSH6 have a similar phenotype to animals deficient in MSH2, and those doubly mutant in MLH3 and PMS2 resemble MLH1-deficient mice (17Prolla T.A. Baker S.M.

Shanmugarajah D. Gilgeous A. Thomas J. Cheng J. Touchman J.W. Green E.D. Schwartzberg P. Collins F.S. Cohen P.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) knockout mice are not only cancer-prone but also sterile. Interestingly, in PMS2-/- animals, sterility is a feature of male mice only (23Baker S.M. Bronner C.E. Zhang L. Plug A.W. Robatzek M. Warren G. Elliott E.A. Yu J. Ashley T. Arnheim N. Flavell R.A. Liskay R.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), suggesting that PMS2 may have a more limited spectrum of meiotic functions than MLH1 and MLH3 (1Jiricny J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 24Wei K. Kuchelapati R. Edelmann W. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 346-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The importance of MMR proteins in DNA metabolism is further underscored by the findings that MMR status affects the outcome of other key processes, such as single strand annealing (25Sugawara N. Goldfarb T. Studamire B. Alani E. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9315-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), class switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes (26Neuberger M.S. Di Noia J.M. Beale R.C. Williams G.T. Yang Z. Rada C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as well as triplet repeat expansions (27Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajek M. Badger II, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we currently lack mechanistic insights into these processes. In an attempt to elucidate the involvement of the MMR proteins in the above (and perhaps even in as yet unlinked) biological pathways, we set out to study the interactome of the human MutL homologues by tandem affinity purification (TAP). Several reports provide evidence that this technique, originally established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar, 29Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar), represents a major improvement in the identification of protein-protein interactions. TAP represents a valuable method to identify interacting proteins in vivo, under native conditions and with a high degree of selectivity (30Gingras A.C. Aebersold R. Raught B. J. Physiol. 2005; 563: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We also carried out a large scale immunoprecipitation of PMS1 and analyzed the interacting partners of this third MutL homologue by mass spectrometry (MS). Our efforts led to the identification of a number of proteins complexed with MLH1, PMS1, or PMS2, some of which were described previously but the majority of which represented new interacting partners. It is hoped that further study of these interactions will help us uncover novel roles of the enigmatic MutL homologue family in human cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—The mammalian vector for the expression of N-terminally TAP-tagged MLH1 was created by inserting the cDNA encoding the full-length MLH1 into the EcoRI site of pZome-1-N (Cellzome), and the vector for the expression of C-terminally TAP-tagged PMS2 was created by inserting the cDNA encoding the full-length PMS2 into the BamHI site of pZome-1-C (Cellzome). The vectors for the mammalian expression of Amot (angiomotin)/p80 and Amot/p130 were kindly provided by Dr. L. Holmgren (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). The pCDNA3-HA-Ubi vector, encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin, was kindly provided by Dr. D. Bohmann (School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY).Cell Culture and Transfections—The human 293, 293T, and HeLa cells were obtained from the cell line repository of Cancer Network Zurich, and the HeLa12 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. M. Bignami (ISS, Rome, Italy). All of the cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and maintained in the appropriate media. Transfection was performed using the Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For generation of stable cell lines, 0.2 μg/ml puromycin (Invivogen) was added to the medium 1 day after transfection. After 2 weeks, the surviving colonies were isolated and their extracts were screened by Western blot using antibodies against MLH1 and PMS2. The clones showing the highest expression of the two tagged mismatch repair proteins were further subcloned.Western Blot Analyses and Antibodies—Preparation of whole cell extracts and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (31Cejka P. Stojic L. Mojas N. Russell A.M. Heinimann K. Cannavo E. di Pietro M. Marra G. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using the following antibodies: MLH1 and PMS2 from BD PharMingen (1:4000 and 1:1000, respectively), β-tubulin and BRCA1 (breast cancer-associated protein-1) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (1:2000 and 1:500, respectively), BRIP1 (BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1) from Novus Biologicals (1:4000), MSH6 from Transduction Laboratories (1:1000), and ubiquitin from BAbCO (1:1000). The anti-angiomotin antibody was a kind gift of Dr. L. Holmgren (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). For the immunoprecipitation experiment, the anti-PMS1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (15Raschle M. Marra G. Nystrom-Lahti M. Schar P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was further affinity-purified. Briefly, 10 mg of purified His6-tagged internal peptide of PMS1 (amino acids 335–643) were coupled to 0.4 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 ml of rabbit polyclonal anti-PMS1 serum diluted 10× in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was then bound to the CNBr-bound antigen for 4 h at 4°C. After two washes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and two additional washes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, the antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, at 4 °C. The elution step was repeated twice, and the final eluates were pooled in new tubes containing 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 100 mm. 300 μl of the corresponding preimmune serum were IgG/A-purified by binding to 300 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Elution of the IgG/A bound antibodies was then performed as above.Co-immunoprecipitations—Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (16Cannavo E. Marra G. Sabates-Bellver J. Menigatti M. Lipkin S.M. Fischer F. Cejka P. Jiricny J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10759-10766Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Control experiments were done in the absence of the primary antibody. The detection of PMS1 polyubiquitylation was carried out as described (32El-Shemerly M. Janscak P. Hess D. Jiricny J. Ferrari S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3604-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Testing of MMR Status—In vitro MMR assays, the N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) sensitivity assay, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses were performed as described previously (31Cejka P. Stojic L. Mojas N. Russell A.M. Heinimann K. Cannavo E. di Pietro M. Marra G. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).TAP—293T and HeLa12 cells stably transfected with plasmids expressing the N-terminally TAP-tagged MLH1 and the C-terminally TAP-tagged PMS2 (TAP-MLH1/293T and TAP-PMS2/HeLa12 cell lines, respectively) were plated in 15-cm dishes. Cells were cultured to 80% confluence, washed twice in cold PBS, and lysed for 30 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× complete inhibitory mixture (Roche Applied Sciences), 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 nm okadaic acid. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min, and the soluble material was collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Tandem affinity purification was performed batchwise according to the original protocol (29Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) with minor changes. All of the following purification steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. For each experiment, 60 mg of whole cell extract were incubated for 4 h with gentle agitation with 100 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer. Beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and three times with 1 ml of tobacco etch virus (TEV) buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× complete inhibitory mixture). Bound TAP-tagged proteins were released by overnight incubation in TEV buffer containing 16 units of acTEV protease (Invitrogen) in tubes mounted on a rotating platform. The supernatant from the TEV reaction was collected and transferred to a new tube. One volume of calmodulin binding buffer (10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgOAc, 1 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× complete inhibitory mixture) was added to the collected supernatant and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube, and the procedure described above was repeated two more times. 1/250 volume of 1 m CaCl2 was then added, and the supernatant was batch-purified by binding to 100 μl of calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) equilibrated in calmodulin binding buffer for 4 h on a rotating platform. Beads were washed three times with 1.2 ml of calmodulin binding buffer and twice with 1.2 ml of calmodulin rinsing buffer (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgOAc, 1 mm imidazole, and 2 mm CaCl2) and eluted with 100 μl of calmodulin elution buffer (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and 35 mm EGTA). One-third of the eluate was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. As negative control, the purification was performed with extracts prepared from parental cells not expressing the tagged protein.Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS Analysis—The eluate from two TAP experiments (total volume 200 μl) was concentrated using the Microcon YM-3 concentrator (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. The gel was then cut into 11 slices, and the polypeptides were subjected to in-gel tryptic digest. Briefly, the gel slices were cut into small fragments and subjected to two cycles of rehydration in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and shrinking by dehydration in 80% acetonitrile. The proteins were then reduced with 37 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 50 °C for 30 min. After two rounds of dehydration, the proteins were alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After three further rounds of rehydration and shrinking, the gel pieces were incubated with 200 ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) for 4 h at 37 °C and then at 25 °C overnight. The peptides were extracted by one change of 0.1% formic acid and three changes of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and dried under vacuum. The tryptic peptides were analyzed on an LTQ-FT™ analyzer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were separated on a nano-high pressure liquid chromatograph (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) online prior to MS analysis on a C18 reversed phase column (Magic 5-μm 100-Å C18 AQ; Michrom, Auburn, CA), using an acetonitrile/water system at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Tandem mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner. Typically, four MS/MS were performed after each high accuracy spectral acquisition range survey. The human portion (taxonomy ID: 9606) of the UniProt data base (available on the Internet at ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/SPproteomes/fasta/proteomes/25.H_sapiensfasta.gz) was interrogated using the Mascot search algorithm (33Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6711) Google Scholar). One failed trypsin cleavage was allowed per search. The precursor and fragment ion tolerances were set to 5 ppm and 0.8 Da, respectively.RESULTSGeneration and Characterization of Stable Mammalian Cell Lines Expressing TAP-tagged MLH1 and PMS2—TAP was shown to be a powerful method for identification of interacting partners of known proteins in various host cell lines (29Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 30Gingras A.C. Aebersold R. Raught B. J. Physiol. 2005; 563: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In order to avoid competition, it is preferable to use cell lines lacking the corresponding endogenous protein. For this reason, we stably transfected two human cell lines deficient for MLH1 or PMS2, namely the MLH1-deficient embryonic kidney cell line 293T (34Trojan J. Zeuzem S. Randolph A. Hemmerle C. Brieger A. Raedle J. Plotz G. Jiricny J. Marra G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 211-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the PMS2-deficient ovarian carcinoma cell line HeLa12 (35Ciotta C. Ceccotti S. Aquilina G. Humbert O. Palombo F. Jiricny J. Bignami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with pZome-1-N-MLH1 and pZome-1-C-PMS2, respectively. The resulting clones were analyzed by Western blot for the expression of the TAP-tagged protein MLH1 or PMS2 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Since the stable clones exhibited different expression levels of the transfected proteins (data not shown), we selected two that expressed the TAP-tagged proteins at levels comparable with those present in the MMR-proficient cell line HeLa (Fig. 1A). The TAP-tagged proteins translocated in both cases into the nucleus as ascertained by indirect immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry (data not shown).To rule out the possibility that the TAP tag impairs the function of MLH1 or PMS2, we performed in vitro MMR assays with cytoplasmic extracts from TAP-MLH1/293T and TAP-PMS2/HeLa12 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the MMR activity in both cell lines was comparable with the repair activity of MMR-proficient HeLa cells.Treatment of mammalian cells with low doses of SN1 type alkylating agents, such as MNNG, induces a G2 cell cycle arrest that is absolutely dependent on functional MMR (36Stojic L. Mojas N. Cejka P. Di Pietro M. Ferrari S. Marra G. Jiricny J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1331-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We confirmed this hallmark of MMR proficient cells in our stable cell lines by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Both TAP-MLH1/293T and TAP-PMS2/HeLa 12 cell lines arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle upon treatment with 0.2 μm MNNG for 24 h (Fig. 1C). The arrest of cell growth upon treatment with MNNG was also confirmed by clonogenic assays (data not shown). In summary, the TAP tag impairs the function of neither MLH1 nor PMS2 in MMR.Tandem Affinity Purifications—Since its first description in 1999 (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), TAP tagging has been successfully used in the identification of binding partners of various proteins (29Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 30Gingras A.C. Aebersold R. Raught B. J. Physiol. 2005; 563: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The affinity tag consists of two IgG binding domains of the Staphylococcus aureus protein A and of a calmodulin binding peptide, whereby the two motifs are separated by a TEV protease cleavage site. We placed the TAP tag at the N terminus of MLH1, since the C terminus of this polypeptide is extremely sensitive to modification (37Kondo E. Horii A. Fukushige S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1695-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and at the C terminus of PMS2 (Fig. 2A). The protein complexes were then isolated by chromatography on IgG-Sepharose, followed by elution with TEV protease and loading onto calmodulin-Sepharose. The final elution was carried out with EGTA (Fig. 2B). TAP and liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 2C) were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each experiment was repeated several times, and the results were highly reproducible, as judged by comparing silver-stained gels from independent experiments (data not shown).FIGURE 2Tandem affinity purifications. A, schematic representation of the MLH1-TAP (top) and PMS2-TAP (bottom) constructs. The TAP tag was inserted at the N terminus of MLH1 and at the C terminus of PMS2.

The top shows the MS/MS spectrum of [M + 2H]2+ = 901.4644, which was identified as the peptide ELVENSLDAFATNIDLK from PMS2 found in the TAP of MLH1. The peptide was identified with a Mascot score of 104, whereas the overall protein coverage was 59% with a score of 4117. The bottom shows the MS/MS spectrum of [M + 2H]2+ = 733.9164. The peptide identified was KAIETVYAALPK from MLH1 found in the TAP of PMS2, with a peptide ion score of 97. The overall protein coverage was 85% with a Mascot score of 4158.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Interacting Partners of MLH1 and PMS2—Each TAP experiment was performed with 2 × 60 mg of whole cell extracts. Upon concentration, the final eluate was subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were visualized by silver staining for analytical purposes and by Coomassie Blue staining for MS analysis. The bait protein and its partner(s) were detected as the most prominent bands, migrating at the predicted molecular sizes (Fig. 3A). The identity of these bands was also independently confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The lanes containing the TAP eluates were then cut into 11 slices, and the proteins in each slice were identified by MS analysis of their tryptic peptides. As anticipated, the highest Mascot scores belonged to MLH1, PMS1, and PMS2, but we were able to identify also a large number of other proteins in the TAP-MLH1 or TAP-PMS2 eluates. First, we verified that the detected proteins were isolated from the gel area corresponding to their predicted molecular sizes. Next, we classified the proteins into several groups according to the known function. A selection of MLH1 and PMS2 interactors are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.FIGURE 3Analysis of MLH1- and PMS2-interacting partners by TAP.

The activities of GSK-3 are regulated negatively by serine phosphorylation but positively by tyrosine phosphorylation. GSK-3 inactivation has been proposed as a mechanism to promote neuronal survival. We used GSK-3 isoform-specific small interfering RNAs, dominant-negative mutants, or pharmacological inhibitors to search for functions of the two GSK-3 isoforms in regulating neuronal survival in cultured cortical neurons in response to glutamate insult or during neuronal maturation/aging. Surprisingly, RNA interference-induced depletion of either isoform was sufficient to block glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and the resulting neuroprotection was associated with enhanced N-terminal serine phosphorylation in both GSK-3 isoforms. However, GSK-3β depletion was more effective than GSK-3α depletion in suppressing spontaneous neuronal death in extended culture. This phenomenon is likely due to selective and robust inhibition of GSK-3β activation resulting from GSK-3β Ser9 dephosphorylation during the course of spontaneous neuronal death. GSK-3α silencing resulted in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3β, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is also a critical autoregulatory event. Interestingly, GSK-3 inhibitors caused a rapid and long-lasting increase in GSK-3α Ser21 phosphorylation levels, followed by a delayed increase in GSK-3β Ser9 phosphorylation and a decrease in GSK-3α Tyr279 and GSK-3β Tyr216 phosphorylation, thus implying additional levels of GSK-3 autoregulation. Taken together, our results underscore important similarities and dissimilarities of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in the roles of cell survival as well as their distinct modes of regulation.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). One of the most notable qualities of GSK-3 is the vast number of signaling pathways that converge on this enzyme and subsequently an even greater number of biological targets (reviewed in Refs. 2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 3Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol.

To date, numerous studies have indicated that GSK-3 acts as a downstream regulator that determines the outcome of several prominent pathways following stimuli such as Wnt signaling, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and neurotrophic pathways. Dysregulation of GSK-3-mediated substrate phosphorylation and signaling pathways has been implicated in the pathophysiological conditions of a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer (4Doble B.W.

Such exquisite regulation involves coordinated control of phosphorylation of GSK-3 and its substrates; the formation of substrate-specific GSK-3 binding/scaffolding protein complexes; and GSK-3 subcellular distribution, notably in nuclei and mitochondria (11Jope R.S.

A previous study further suggests that inactivation of GSK-3β is a principal regulatory target of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase survival pathway (18Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). However, little information is available as to the effects on neuronal survival resulting from depletion/inhibition of GSK-3α.The main structural differences between the GSK-3α and GSK-3β isoforms lie in the N- and C-terminal regions, whereas their sequences are highly homologous within the kinase domain. The activities of GSK-3 are positively regulated by phosphorylation of Tyr279 and Tyr216 for the α- and β-isoforms, respectively, and negatively regulated by N-terminal phosphorylation of Ser21 and Ser9 for the α- and β-isoforms, respectively (3Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is unique in that the kinase is constitutively active in cells under resting conditions and is primarily regulated through inhibition of its activity. In addition, compared with other protein kinases, GSK-3 has its preference for primed substrates, i.e. substrates previously phosphorylated by another kinase (4Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of serine residues of both isoforms is dynamic, involving phosphorylation mainly by diverse kinases (4Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) (24Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of both serine and tyrosine residues in GSK-3 has been reported and suggests that GSK-3 regulates its own phosphorylation status (24Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 25Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

Although some evidence supports active regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in the brain (21Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the vast majority of research on GSK-3 has been focused on the aspect of inhibitory serine phosphorylation, and little is known about possible kinases involved in GSK-3 activation through tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, previous studies have led to conflicting conclusions as to whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3 is catalyzed by GSK-3 itself or by a distinct tyrosine kinase (25Wang Q.M.

Dynamic regulation of GSK-3 kinase activity through modulation of serine/tyrosine phosphorylation in neurons at different developmental/maturation stages is thus possibly mediated via diverse spatial/temporal distribution of these two GSK-3 isoforms. Accordingly, a better understanding of the state of GSK-3 serine/tyrosine phosphorylation of each isoform in response to stimulation is necessary to address these critical issues.In this study, we used pharmacological inhibitors, GSK-3 isoform-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), wild-type GSK-3α and GSK-3-β, and their dominant-negative mutants to address their differential functions and regulation in cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons. We first investigated the role of GSK-3 isoforms in the execution of and protection against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. We then assessed their states of serine and tyrosine phosphorylation and neuronal survival following GSK-3 inhibition as well as during various stages of neuronal cultures to explore their functional involvements.MATERIALS AND METHODSRat Primary Cerebral Cortical Culture—Preparation of cerebral cortical neurons from 18-day-old embryonic rats was performed as described previously (40Hashimoto R. Hough C. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Chuang D.-M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) with modifications (41Liang M.-H. Chuang D.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were used for transfection after 9 days in vitro (DIV) unless indicated otherwise.siRNA Preparation—Several rat-specific siRNAs targeting either isoform of GSK-3 were as described previously (41Liang M.-H. Chuang D.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). They are αP747, αP1269, αP1375, βP555, βP514, βP1093, and αβP1357. siRNA αβP1357 is the only siRNA that targets both GSK-3 isoforms. The siRNA mixture specific to either GSK-3 isoform consists of the three species of isoform-specific siRNAs described above. Unless indicated otherwise, GSK-3 siRNA mixtures were used in all silencing experiments. A control siRNA (control non-targeting siRNA-1, Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) was used as an RNA interference control for all siRNA transfection experiments.Plasmid DNA—Wild-type GSK-3α and its dominant-negative mutant (pMT2/hGSK3α and pMT2-KRhGSK3α, respectively) and the construction of wild-type GSK-3β and two GSK-3β dominant-negative mutants (pEGFP-GSK3β-wt, pEGFP-GSK3β-K85R, and pEGFP-GSK3β-R96A, respectively) were as described previously (41Liang M.-H. Chuang D.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Transfection Assays—To determine whether the siRNA was efficiently delivered to the cytoplasm of cortical neurons, we labeled siRNA duplexes with Cy3 using the Silencer™ siRNA labeling kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) prior to transfection. The siRNA transfection condition was optimized using siPORT Amine transfection reagent (Ambion, Inc.) for cortical neurons. Rat primary cortical cultures were evenly plated and cultured for 9 DIV before transfection for 48 h with 80 nm siRNA using 8 μl of siPORT Amine in 1 ml of the transfection mixture. Transfection of GSK-3 expression vectors (wild-type or dominant-negative mutants) into primary cortical neurons were established using a Nucleofector device (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany) in conjunction with a rat neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa GmbH) at the time of cell plating as described (41Liang M.-H. Chuang D.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).GSK-3 Inhibitors—Two structurally unrelated non-ATP-competitive GSK-3β inhibitors, inhibitor I (TDZD-8, thiadiazolidinone analog) and inhibitor VII (α-4-dibromoacetophenone), were purchased from Calbiochem. Two structurally similar ATP-competitive GSK-3 inhibitors, SB 216763 and SB 415286, were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Lithium salt (LiCl) was obtained from Sigma.Cell Viability Analysis—Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described (40Hashimoto R. Hough C. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Chuang D.-M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Annexin V (AN)-propidium iodide (PI) double staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis were also performed to detect pre-apoptotic and dead cells, respectively. Briefly, cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA solution, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and double-stained with 5 μl of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated AN (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to detect externalized phosphatidylserine during apoptosis and 1.5 μm PI (Sigma) in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4)) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Additionally, cell viability was determined by lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity detection assay and calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM)/ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) live/dead cell detection assay. Briefly, 96-well cultures (2000 cells/well) were transfected with GSK-3 isoform-specific siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA by electroporation using a Nucleofector device in conjunction with a rat neuron Nucleofector kit formulated for primary rat cortical neurons at the time of cell plating. Cells were harvested at the indicated DIV, and cell viability was performed using a lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Similarly, at the indicated DIV, cells were incubated with 3 μm calcein-AM and 1 μm EthD-1 (live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit, Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 45 min to simultaneously detect live and dead cells, respectively. This procedure produced two-color fluorescence to determine live and dead cells, which were quantified with a fluorescence microplate reader using the appropriate filters (Wallac 1420 multilabel counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland) and WorkOut Applications data management software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Additionally, at the indicated DIV, cultured cortical cells plated on poly-d-lysinecoated chambered coverglasses (Lab-Tek II No. 1.5 borosilicate coverglass, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were incubated with 6 μm calcein-AM and 2 μm EthD-1 (live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit) in Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 45 min. Following incubation, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS, and images of green fluorescence (calcein-AM)-labeled live cells and red fluorescence (EthD-1)-labeled dead cells were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 413, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Z-sectioning images were captured with a Zeiss digital camera and analyzed using Zeiss LSM 5 software (Version 3.2).FACS Analysis—Cy3-labeled siRNA targeting GSK-3α or GSK-3β was transfected into rat cortical neurons at 9 DIV. Forty-eight h after transfection, ∼3 × 106 cortical cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and fixed overnight in 5 ml of 70% ethanol at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The transfection efficiency was determined by FACS analysis (EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Data curves were fitted using the ModFit LT software package (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). In a separate viability assay experiment, AN-PI double staining and FACS analysis were performed to detect pre-apoptotic cells. Flow cytometry was performed to detect PI (red) and AN (fluorescein isothiocyanate; green) staining of dead and pre-apoptotic cells, respectively. The cellular DNA content and AN labeling were determined by FACS analysis. Data curves were fitted using the WinList software program (Verity Software House).Immunoblot Analysis—Cortical neurons were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS and harvested by scraping into cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Basel, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Typically, an aliquot of 20 μg of protein was loaded onto each well of a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was further incubated with the indicated antibodies using standard protocols. Antibodies against GSK-3α, GSK-3β, β-actin, β-catenin, and CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase-5) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Antibodies against phospho-GSK-3α Ser21, phospho-GSK-3β Ser9, phospho-GSK-3αβ Tyr279/216, phospho-cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) Ser133, phospho-ERK (p44/42), phospho-AKT Ser476, CREB, ERK, and AKT were products of Cell Signaling Technology. An ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) was used to obtain Western blot signals, and autoradiographs were scanned. The intensity of immunoblot signals was analyzed using Scion Image for Windows (Scion Corp.).Immunocytochemistry—Poly-d-lysine-coated chambered coverglasses (Lab-Tek II No. 1.5 or 1.0 borosilicate coverglass) were used for cortical neuronal cultures. Cortical neurons at 9 DIV were transfected with siRNAs for GSK-3α and GSK-3β as described above. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (FD NeuroTechnologies, Baltimore, MD) for 15 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes) in PBS for 10 min. For the detection of Cy3-labeled siRNAs and DAPI-stained nuclei, cortical cells were visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510) with the appropriate filters, and Z-sectioning images were captured using a digital camera and software as described above. To assess co-localization of Cy3 siRNAs and DAPI-stained nuclei, we used a Zeiss ApoTome device for Z-sectioning. For the detection of phospho-GSK-3β Ser9, anti-phospho-GSK-3β Ser9 antibody (1:500 dilution) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used. The coverglasses were mounted using VECTA-SHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (H-1200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described above. For the detection of pre-apoptotic cells, the AN conjugate was used with a slight modification of the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cortical neurons at 12 DIV were washed with cold PBS, followed by incubation in annexin binding buffer. Cells were then double-stained with 25 μl of AN conjugate and 0.8 μm PI in 100 μl of reaction mixture for 25 min at room temperature, followed by washing three times with annexin binding buffer. The coverglasses were then viewed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510), and images were captured as described above.Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. The results were analyzed for statistical significance by GraphPad InStat (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA) by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. In analysis of variance, a quantile-quantile plot was adopted for normal distribution tests, and Turkey's post hoc test was adopted if the variances between groups were similar.RESULTSSelective Silencing and Neuroprotective Effects Induced by siRNA for GSK-3α or GSK-3β in Rat Cortical Neurons—We first established high efficiency transfection of siRNA into rat cerebral cortical neurons using the siPORT Amine transfection reagent. Rat cortical neurons at 9 DIV were transfected with various concentrations (20–80 nm) of siRNA targeted specifically against GSK-3β. Confocal imaging results using 60 nm Cy3-labeled siRNA showed uptake of GSK-3β-targeted siRNAs into cortical neurons 48 h after transfection (Fig. 1A). The arrows in the merged image indicate examples of cultured cortical neurons with co-localized Cy3-labeled siRNAs and DAPI-stained nuclei. FACS dot plots of Cy3-positive cells showed the dose-dependent, highly effective transfection of GSK-3β siRNA, with ∼80% of cells being transfected at 80 nm (Fig. 1, B–G). Similar transfection efficiency was achieved when siRNA for GSK-3α was employed (data not shown). These results were confirmed by a comparable experiment using manual counting of cells on slides, which produced results similar to those obtained by flow cytometry (data not shown).Western blotting was performed to assess the silencing effects of siRNA for GSK-3α or GSK-3β. Transfection of cortical neurons with 80 nm siRNA mixtures for either GSK-3α or GSK-3β alone or a combination of siRNAs targeting both GSK-3α and GSK-3β resulted in 70–80% knockdown of their respective proteins 48 h after transfection, whereas the protein levels of the non-targeted GSK-3 isoforms were unaffected (Fig. 2, A and B). A commercially available antibody that recognizes both GSK-3 isoforms was used to examine the abundance of both GSK-3 isoforms in cortical neurons. GSK-3β was found to be predominant, and GSK-3α accounted for only 35% of the total GSK-3 protein in cortical neurons treated with non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2siRNA-mediated silencing of GSK-3α and/or GSK-3β and GSK-3 inhibition protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in cortical neurons.

Among them, Hsfs A4 and A5 form a group distinguished from other Hsfs by structural features of their oligomerization domains and by a number of conserved signature sequences. We show that A4 Hsfs are potent activators of heat stress gene expression, whereas A5 Hsfs act as specific repressors of HsfA4 activity. The oligomerization domain of HsfA5 alone is necessary and sufficient to exert this effect. Due to the high specificity of the oligomerization domains, other class A Hsfs are not affected.

In contrast to other organisms, plant genomes encode extraordinarily complex Hsf families both in terms of the total number of genes (usually more than 20) as well as in terms of the structural and functional diversification of the Hsfs. There is good evidence that the Hsf mixture in cells strongly changes in a tissue-specific manner and in response to stress treatments (Refs. 9Scharf K.-D. Rose S. Zott W. Schöffl F. Nover L.

Hsfs have a modular structure (see Fig. 1A) with an N-terminal DNA binding domain, an adjacent domain with heptad hydrophobic repeats (HR-A/B) involved in oligomerization, a cluster of basic amino acid residues essential for nuclear import (nuclear localization signal), and a C-terminal activation domain, which is frequently characterized by a nuclear export signal and short peptide motifs (AHA motifs) essential for the activator function (10Scharf K.-D.

Plant J. 2004; 39: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Three classes of plant Hsfs (classes A, B, and C) are defined by peculiarities of their HR-A/B regions (6Nover L. Bharti K.

Unfortunately, our understanding of the complexity of the plant Hsf family is very limited. Detailed investigations on the structural and functional diversification so far are restricted to Hsfs A1, A2, A3, A9, and B1 (10Scharf K.-D. Heider H. Hohfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol.

An interesting new aspect of functional diversification of Hsfs was reported when a mutant of rice (spl7) with spontaneous necrotic lesions in mature leaves was identified as a point mutation with a Trp > Cys substitution in the N-terminal part of the DNA binding domain of HsfA4d. Although the molecular consequences of this mutation need to be elaborated, the defect of HsfA4d evidently made leaves hypersensitive to small doses of stress that resulted in uncontrolled apoptosis (25Yamanouchi U. Yano M. Lin H. Ashikari M. Yamada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7530-7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Examples for such daily stress effects on leaves are certainly connected with high light intensities and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In support of this interpretation, Davletova et al. (26Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaev V. Schaluch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) showed that transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a dominant negative form of HsfA4a were inhibited in early signal transduction events connected with high light and oxidative stress. Based on details of so-called signature sequences, Hsfs A4 are closely related to Hsfs A5. Both together form a group that is clearly separated from other members of the Hsf family (8Baniwal S.K. Bharti K. Chan K.Y. Fauth M. Ganguli A. Kotak S. Mishra S.K. Nover L. Port M. Scharf K.-D. Tripp J. Weber C. Zielinski D. von Koskull-Doring P. J. Biosci. (Bangalore). 2004; 29: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The crucial similarities include details of the DNA binding and the oligomerization domains as well as conserved sequence motifs in the C-terminal domains (see Figs. 1A and 6A, block diagrams, and the compiled data in supplemental materials Fig. S1 and Table S1). In this report, we present data on the functional interaction of Hsfs A4 and A5, which is based on an unprecedented specificity of their oligomerization domains. Based on results from reporter assays in mesophyll protoplasts, we show that HsfA4 represents an activator of hs gene expression, whereas HsfA5 specifically inhibits HsfA4 activity. Evidently, HsfA5 forms heterooligomers with HsfA4 and thus interferes with its DNA binding capacity. The biological implications of the cooperation between Hsfs A4 and A5 will be discussed. General Reagents and Procedures—Standard protocols were used for cloning and nucleic acid analysis (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1993Google Scholar, 28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from plant tissues by using the RNeasy® plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For cDNA synthesis, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR fragments for subcloning were generated by using the High Fidelity PCR enzyme mix (Fermentas). Protein extraction, SDS-PAGE, and protein blotting analysis were performed as described (19Mishra S.K. Tripp J. Winkelhaus S. Tschiersch B. Theres K. Nover L. Scharf K.-D.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The generation and use of specific antisera against individual tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) Hsfs (HsfA1, A2, A3) and Hsp17-CI were described before (12Lyck R. Harmening U. Höhfeld I. Scharf K.-D. Nover L. Planta. 1997; 202: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Bharti K. Schmidt E. Lyck R. Bublak D. Scharf K.-D.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies for immunodetection of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-, Myc-, HA-, and Strep-tagged proteins were obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany), HISS Diagnostics (Freiburg, Germany), and IBA (Göttingen, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). For transient gene expression studies, tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) leaf mesophyll protoplasts were used. Polyethylene glycol-mediated co-transformation of reporter and Hsf expression plasmids was carried out as described previously (10Scharf K.-D. Heider H. Hohfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2240-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Treuter E. Nover L. Ohme K. Scharf K.-D. Mol. Gen.

Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were used for overexpression of recombinant Hsfs and GST fusion proteins. Plasmid Constructs for Transient Expression Studies in Protoplasts—The Hsf-dependent reporter plasmids pGmhsp17.3B-CI::GUS and pHSE9::GUS and the repressor reporter construct p35S::HSE9-GUS were described before (15Treuter E. Nover L. Ohme K. Scharf K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs for Hsf expression in plant cells are based on the pRT series of vectors (30Töpfer R. Schell J. Steinbiss H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Constructs for Hsfs A1, A2, and A3 were described before (10Scharf K.-D. Heider H. Hohfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2240-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Bharti K. Schmidt E. Lyck R. Bublak D. Scharf K.-D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR fragments containing the full-length open reading frame regions of Hsfs tested in this study were generated by using cDNA preparations from sepals of opening flower buds (HsfA4b) or young leaves (HsfA5) as template. Gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were designed on the basis of corresponding expressed sequence tag sequence data (supplemental Table S2) and adapted for introducing appropriate restriction sites for in-frame subcloning of amplified DNA fragments into pRT vectors providing the corresponding sequences for affinity tags (31Kirschner M. Winkelhaus S. Thierfelder J.M. Nover L. Plant J. 2000; 24: 397-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Siddique M. Port M. Tripp J. Weber C. Zielinski D. Calligaris R. Winkelhaus S. Scharf K.-D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further deletions or modifications were done on the basis of these parental expression vectors. An overview of all constructs and primer sequences is compiled in Table S2. For subcellular localization studies, PCR fragments of the corresponding Hsfs were subcloned into p35dS::GFP to generate in-frame GFP-Hsf fusions. The binary bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) plant transformation vectors pSPYNE and pSPYCE (33Walter M. Chaban C. Schutze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Nake C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. Harter K. Kudla J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Klaus Harter (Center for Plant Molecular Biology, University of Tübingen, Germany) and were used as template DNA for PCR amplification of Myc-YN and HA-YC encoding sequences for cloning into pRT vectors to achieve compatible cloning sites to create Hsf-Myc-YN and Hsf-HA-YC fusion constructs (supplemental Table S2). Expression Constructs for Yeast and E. coli—For expression of tomato HsfA4b-Strep in yeast cells, the corresponding DNA fragment was subcloned from a plant expression construct into pAD5Δ (16Boscheinen O. Lyck R. Queitsch C. Treuter E. Zimarino V. Scharf K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Expression constructs for GST pull-down bait proteins were based on plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) and generated by in-frame fusions of DNA fragments encoding C-terminal parts of tomato Hsfs A4b (amino acids residues 112–393) and A5 (amino acids residues 110–478), respectively. Full-length HsfA1 and 3HA-HsfA5 encoding sequences were cloned in pJC vectors (22Bharti K. von Koskull-Döring P. Bharti S.K.P. Tintschl-Körbitzer A. Treuter E. Nover L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1521-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Interaction Assay—Bait proteins were purified with the GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pull-down assay was conducted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor, Roche Diagnostics) by incubation of GST-Hsfs bound to glutathione-Sepharose with lysates prepared either from yeast cells expressing HsfA4b-Strep or from E. coli cells expressing HsfA1 or 3HA-HsfA5, respectively. The bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with the appropriate antibodies by protein blot analysis. Two-hybrid Interaction Assay—For two-hybrid interaction studies, the pGal4-BD bait and pGal4-AD prey vector system (Stratagene) was used as described previously (10Scharf K.-D. Heider H. Hohfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2240-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Bharti K. Schmidt E. Lyck R. Bublak D. Scharf K.-D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All Arabidopsis Hsf fusion constructs used in this study were described earlier (14Kotak S. Port M. Ganguli A. Bicker F. von Koskull-Döring P. Plant J. 2004; 39: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Pascal von Koskull-Döring (Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany). The strength of interaction was confirmed by colony growth in the presence of the histidine biosynthesis inhibitor 3-aminotriazole. Intracellular Localization and Interaction Studies—Tobacco protoplasts transformed with appropriate combinations of plasmids encoding chimeras of Hsfs with GFP or with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) domains were analyzed after 16 h of expression. For nuclear retention of Hsf proteins, protoplasts were incubated in the presence of 20 ng ml–1 leptomycin B (kindly provided by Minoru Yoshida, Tokyo, Japan) added 3 h before harvesting (13Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy analysis of protoplasts transformed with GFP-Hsf fusion constructs was performed immediately after harvesting without any further treatments. Fluorescence light emission of recombined YFP in heterooligomeric Hsf-YN/Hsf-YC complexes was determined after fixation of protoplasts and staining with 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride to visualize the nuclei (13Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For fluorescence microscopic analysis, a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used combined with a Color View XS photo system (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany). For overlay, captured images were resized and combined by using PhotoShop 8.0 software (Adobe Systems, La Jolla, CA). Transactivation Potentials of HsfA4 and HsfA5—As a starting point, we studied the transactivation potential of tomato Hsfs A4b and A5 (Fig. 1A) using transient expression assays with tobacco mesophyll protoplasts and two types of reporter genes: (i) plasmid-borne GUS reporter gene harboring a 1-kb upstream region of the soybean Hsp17.3B gene (34Czarnecka E. Gurley W.B. Nagao R.T. Mosquera L.A. Key J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1985; 82: 3726-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and (ii) endogenous chromatin-embedded Hsp17 genes, which comprise a set of Hsf-dependent genes encoding the members of Hsp17-CI and Hsp17-CII protein classes (29Port M. Tripp J. Zielinski D. Weber C. Heerklotz D. Winkelhaus S. Bublak D. Scharf K.-D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Scharf K.-D. Siddique M. Vierling E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 225-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the excellent antiserum available for proteins of the class CI members, we present here only the data obtained for this group of proteins. With few exceptions, results obtained for the two types of reporters were very similar. In Fig. 1B, the GUS activity observed in a sample transformed with the reporter plasmid only represents the basal level expression due to the endogenous Hsf mixture present in tobacco protoplasts (marked with a dotted line). GUS activities above this level correspond to the transactivation potential of the transiently expressed Hsfs. Expression of HsfA4b alone (sample 1) showed nearly 40-fold stimulation of reporter gene expression as compared with the basal level, whereas expression of HsfA5 showed no activity (sample 8). In agreement with the GUS activities, expression of endogenous Hsp17 genes was high in sample 1 but not detectable in sample 8 (Fig. 1C). The contrasting behavior of the two Hsfs in reporter assays was surprising as both share very similar basic structural features, particularly of their DNA binding domains and of their C-terminal domains containing the activator motifs (Fig. 1A and Table S1, block diagram). To examine any functional interaction between them, we co-transformed tobacco protoplasts with a constant amount of HsfA4b and increasing amounts of HsfA5 expression plasmids (Fig. 1B, samples 2–7). Two effects were observed. (i) The level of HsfA4b increased as a result of co-expression with HsfA5. (ii) In contrast to the increased HsfA4b accumulation, the GUS reporter activity decreased in direct correlation with increasing HsfA5 expression (Fig. 1B, Hsf expression control and GUS activity in samples 2–7, respectively). Similar effects of HsfA5 on HsfA4b activity were observed on the endogenous Hsp17 level as reporter (Fig. 1C, samples 1–7). Interestingly, the repressor effect of HsfA5 was more pronounced on the chromatin-embedded Hsp17 than on the plasmid-borne GUS reporter gene (compare results with samples 1 and 5 in Figs. 1B versus C). Protein blot analysis (Fig. 1B, Hsf expression control) showed that both HA-tagged Hsfs accumulated to detectable levels. Usually, the level of HsfA5 was higher than that of HsfA4b, ruling out the simple explanation that low expression of HsfA5 was the cause for its lack of activity. We conclude that HsfA4b is a strong activator, whereas HsfA5 has no activator potential on either plasmid-borne or chromatin-embedded reporters. Next, we examined whether the repressor effect of HsfA5 is specific for HsfA4b or HsfA5 functions as a general repressor of Hsf activity, e.g. by competing for DNA binding sites. To this aim, we co-expressed HsfA5 together with other well characterized members of the tomato Hsf family, i.e. Hsfs A1, A2, and A3 (Fig. 1D). All three Hsfs are potent transcriptional activators (samples 9, 11, and 13). However, the activity of none of them was repressed in the presence of HsfA5 but was rather increased (Fig. 1D, samples 10, 12, and 14). We conclude that the HsfA5 function as repressor is highly specific for HsfA4b and does not simply result from competition for Hsf binding sites. As an additional proof for the selectivity of HsfA5 repressor function, we expressed HsfA5 and examined the hs response of the tobacco protoplasts following temperature treatment as indicated in Fig. 2A. The accumulation of Hsp17 in the mock-transformed protoplasts (Fig. 2B) reflects the hs-induced activity of the tobacco Hsf system. It was completely blocked by the expression of a dominant negative form of tomato HsfA1, i.e. HsfA1ΔC394, which competes for DNA binding but has no activator function. In contrast to this, expression of HsfA5 had no detectable effect. Evidently, the hs induction in these mesophyll protoplasts completely depends on the activity of A1-type but not A4-type Hsfs. Furthermore, HsfA5 does not act as a general repressor. These results nicely confirm the fundamental differences between Hsfs A1, A2, and A3 on one hand and Hsfs A4/A5 on the other. HsfA5 Effectively Binds to Heat Stress Elements—The inactivity of HsfA5 prompts the question about the functionality of its DNA binding domain. Thus, we studied DNA binding by using a repressor reporter assay (15Treuter E. Nover L. Ohme K. Scharf K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that allows in vivo assessment of DNA binding activity independent of the activator function of Hsfs. The repressor reporter contains multiple Hsf binding sites immediately downstream of the TATA box of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (Fig. 3A). Binding of an Hsf blocks the function of the 35 S promoter and thus diminishes transcription of the GUS gene. Depending on the expression levels and DNA binding capacities, Hsfs A1, A4b, and A5 strongly reduced the detectable GUS activity (Fig. 3B, samples 2–8). Reference points are sample 1 showing GUS activity in the absence of transiently expressed Hsfs and sample 9 expressing a DNA binding mutant form of HsfA5. We further confirmed the functionality of the HsfA5 DNA binding domain by testing in fusion proteins with the C-terminal activation domains of HsfA2 or HsfA4b, respectively. As expected, both hybrid Hsfs behaved as strong transcriptional activators (data not shown). Repression of HsfA4b Activity Is Mediated through the Oligomerization Domain of HsfA5—To define the structural elements of HsfA5 required for the repression of HsfA4b activity, we prepared a series of deletion forms (Fig. 4A, constructs b–e) and a DNA binding mutant form (construct f) and tested them with respect to their repressor activity in transient reporter assays (Fig. 4, B and E). As expected from the previous results (Fig. 1B), none of the HsfA5 mutant forms showed any activity on their own (data not shown), but as long as they contained the oligomerization domain (OD), they effectively repressed HsfA4b activity (Fig. 4B, samples 4, 7, and 8). Note that the smallest HsfA5 fragment with full repressor activity contained only the OD (construct e). Evidently, the oligomerization domain of HsfA5 is necessary and sufficient to exert the repressor effect on HsfA4b. In support of this, HsfA5 fragments lacking the OD (Fig. 4A, constructs c and d) did not repress HsfA4b activity (Fig. 4B, samples 5 and 6). DNA binding and transcriptional activation by Hsfs are strongly dependent on their oligomerization state. Hsf deletion mutants lacking their OD are poor in DNA binding and activator function (16Boscheinen O. Lyck R. Queitsch C. Treuter E. Zimarino V. Scharf K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The repressor reporter assay described above allowed us to test whether the DNA binding activity of HsfA4b could be affected by co-expression with HsfA5 or its mutant forms (Fig. 4C). The effects observed can be summarized as follows. (i) As shown before (Fig. 3B), HsfA4b blocked the GUS expression (Fig. 4C, sample 2), and co-expression of HsfA5 enhanced this effect (sample 3). This enhancement is mainly due to the marked increase of the HsfA4b level in the presence of HsfA5 (Fig. 4D, sample 3). (ii) In combinations of HsfA4b with HsfA5 mutant forms containing the OD (samples 4, 7, and 8), GUS expression was much less diminished than in sample 3. Evidently, interaction with the truncated forms of HsfA5 affected the DNA binding affinity of HsfA4b. (iii) As expected, mutant forms of HsfA5 lacking the OD had no influence on the HsfA4b-mediated block of GUS expression (Fig. 4C, samples 5 and 6). Taken together, these results imply that interaction of HsfA5 with HsfA4b may disturb the oligomerization state of the latter and thereby drastically decreases its DNA binding capacity and function as transcriptional activator. The structural prerequisites of HsfA4b, i.e. functional DNA binding and oligomerization domains as well as the C-terminal activator domain with AHA motifs, are basically similar with those defined for HsfA1 and HsfA2 (18Döring P.

Here, we studied gene amplification of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel alpha subunit (KCNMA1), which is located at the chromosomal region 10q22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed KCNMA1 amplification in 16% of 119 late-stage human prostate cancers and in the hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell line PC-3. In contrast, KCNMA1 amplification was absent in 33 benign controls, 32 precursor lesions and in 105 clinically organ-confined prostate cancers. Amplification was associated with mRNA and protein overexpression as well as increased density of BK channel protein and β-estradiol-insensitive BK currents in PC-3 cells as compared to non-amplified control cell lines. Specific blockade of BK channels by iberiotoxin or RNAi significantly inhibited K+ currents and growth of PC-3 cells. The data demonstrate that 10q22 amplification drives KCNMA1 expression and cell proliferation. Thus, KCNMA1 qualifies as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target in patients with prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2006985572,"Large conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels modulate the excitability and contractile state of arterial smooth muscle. Recently, we demonstrated that during hypertension, expression of the accessory β1 subunit was decreased relative to the pore-forming α subunit of the BK channel. Reduced β1 subunit expression resulted in BK channels with impaired function due to lowered sensitivity to Ca2+. Here, we tested the hypothesis that activation of the calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway down-regulates β1 expression during angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that in vivo administration of angiotensin II-activated calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling in arterial smooth muscle. During angiotensin II infusion, arterial smooth muscle BK channel function was decreased in wild type (WT) but not in NFATc3 null (NFATc3-/-) mice. Accordingly, β1 expression was decreased in WT but not in NFATc3-/- arteries. Angiotensin II-induced down-regulation of the β1 subunit required Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels. However, in the absence of angiotensin II, moderate elevation of [Ca2+]i alone was not sufficient to activate NFAT transcriptional activity and, thus, decrease β1 subunit expression. Importantly, angiotensin II infusion increased systemic blood pressure to a lower extent in NFATc3-/- than in WT mice, indicating that this transcription factor is required for the development of severe hypertension during chronic angiotensin II signaling activation.

In these cells BK channels are composed of pore-forming α and accessory β1 subunits (1Knaus H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

The β1 subunit modulates BK channel function by stabilizing the open conformation and increasing the intrinsic Ca2+ sensitivity of the α subunit (4Cox D.H. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 5Meera P. Wallner M. Jiang Z. Toro L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This enhances the activity of BK channels and strengthens the coupling between these channels and their physiological activators, “Ca2+ sparks” (6Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F.

The functional relevance of the β1 subunit of the BK channel was underscored in a recent series of studies, which demonstrated that in β1 null mice, arterial smooth muscle BK channels had lower Ca2+ sensitivities than their wild type counterparts. Consequently, these BK channels were decoupled from Ca2+ sparks, which resulted in depolarized arterial smooth muscle, increased vasoconstriction, and ultimately hypertension (3Brenner R. Perez G.J.

We recently examined whether decreased β1 expression contributed to arterial dysfunction during hypertension (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Amberg G.C. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We found that there was pronounced down-regulation of the β1, but not the α subunit, of BK channels in arterial smooth muscle during hypertension (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Amberg G.C. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Accordingly, BK channels from hypertensive arterial myocytes were decoupled from Ca2+ sparks. The ensuing loss of the hyperpolarizing influence of BK channels contributed to increased membrane depolarization, [Ca2+]i, and arterial tone, three hallmarks of arterial dysfunction during hypertension (10Harder D.R. Smeda J. Lombard J. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Wellman G.C. Cartin L. Eckman D.M. Stevenson A.S. Saundry C.M. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: 2559-2567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at present the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes in BK channel composition in arterial smooth muscle are unclear. Our group demonstrated that chronic angiotensin II signaling decreases the expression of voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv2.1) in arterial myocytes through the activation of the transcription factor NFATc3 by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (12Amberg G.C. Rossow C.F. Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47326-47334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the hypothesis that angiotensin II selectively down-regulates the BK channel β1 subunit in arterial smooth muscle through the calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway. We found that in vivo administration of angiotensin II increased calcineurin/NFATc3-mediated transcriptional activity in arterial myocytes. This resulted in decreased expression of the β1, but not the α, subunit of the BK channel. The effect of angiotensin II on β1 expression was independent of changes in blood pressure. We also show that calcineurin/NFATc3 activity was not only necessary for β1 subunit down-regulation by angiotensin II but was sufficient in doing so. Importantly, our data indicate that NFATc3 is required for the development of severe hypertension during angiotensin II infusion. Collectively, our data suggest that activation of calcineurin and NFATc3 during sustained angiotensin II signaling down-regulates the expression of the β1 subunit of the BK channel, which contributes to arterial dysfunction and the development of hypertension. In Vivo Angiotensin II Infusion and Blood Pressure Monitoring—Wild type and NFATc3-/- mice (kindly provided by Dr. Laurie Glimcher) were handled in strict compliance with the guidelines of the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were made hypertensive by subcutaneous administration of angiotensin II (800 ng/kg/min) by means of a mini-osmotic pump (Alzet, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA). Blood pressure was monitored in conscious adult mice before and after angiotensin II treatment using a telemetry system (Data Science International). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. A ventral midline incision from the lower mandible to the sternum was made to isolate the left common carotid. Two lengths of 7-0 silk suture were thread beneath the vessel for retraction and ligation. The artery was permanently ligated at the level of the bifurcation between the interior and exterior carotid. The second suture was used to occlude blood flow temporally and allow insertion of the catheter. A 25-gauge syringe needle was used to make an incision in the artery through which the tip of the catheter was inserted. The catheter was advanced to the thoracic aorta and tied in place with the suture. A subcutaneous pocket was then made to place the transmitter body. After placement of the transmitter body the incision was closed with 5-0 suture. In experiments in which animals had signs of an incomplete Circle of Willis (e.g. NFATc3-/-), blood pressure was measured from the femoral artery. Blood pressure was recorded continuously and stored in the hard drive of a PC running Dataquest software (Data Science International). Control blood pressure measurements began 7 days after surgery to allow animals to recover. After this recovery period, blood pressures were recorded for 3 days before the saline or angiotensin II pump was implanted. Blood pressure recordings continued for up to 7 days after pump implantation. Isolation of Arterial Myocytes—Mice were euthanized with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg; intraperitoneal). Myocytes were isolated from cerebral and mesenteric arteries as described elsewhere (9Amberg G.C. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, arteries were cleaned from connective tissue and placed in digestion buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 3 mm pyruvate, 25 mm HEPES, and 22 mm glucose (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Arteries were incubated (8 min at 37 °C) in digestion buffer containing papain (0.5 mg/ml; Worthington Biochemical) and dithiothreitol (1.0 mg/ml) followed by a second incubation (15 min at 37 °C) in digestion buffer supplemented with collagenase type H (1 mg/ml; Sigma). After enzymatic treatment, tissues were washed three times with enzyme-free digestion buffer. Single cells were obtained by gentle mechanical trituration using a set of fire-polished pipettes with progressively smaller tip diameters. Cells were kept in ice-cold digestion buffer and used on the day of isolation. Organ Culture—Mesenteric and cerebral arterial segments were cultured as described previously (12Amberg G.C. Rossow C.F. Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47326-47334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology and [Ca2+]i Imaging—BK single channel activity was recorded from inside-out patches under symmetrical K+ (140 mm) conditions. The bath and pipette solutions contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, or 1 mm HEDTA, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.3. The MAXC software (C. Patton, Stanford University Pacific Grove, CA) was used to determine the amount of CaCl2 needed to achieve the desire free Ca2+ concentration in the bath solution. Single channel currents were digitized at 5 kHz using pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc.) The data were filtered at 1 kHz using a Bessel filter (8 pole). Clampfit (Axon Instruments Inc.) and Analysis of Single Channel Data (G. Droogmans, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) software were use for single channel data analysis. BK channel number, conductance, and open probability (Po) were determined from all point amplitude histograms. To estimate the number of BK channels per patch, the patches were held at +80 mV in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+, which maximizes the Po of this channels (5Meera P. Wallner M. Jiang Z. Toro L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For [Ca2+]i imaging experiments, cells were loaded with the acetoxymethyl form of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-5 (5 μm) as described previously (12Amberg G.C. Rossow C.F. Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47326-47334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Confocal images were acquired using Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system coupled to an inverted Nikon TE300 microscope equipped with a Nikon PlanApo (60 ×, NA = 1.4) oil-immersion lens. Images were acquired and analyzed with Lasersharp 4.0 (Bio-Rad) and ImageJ software, respectively. In these experiments background-subtracted fluorescence signals were calibrated using the Fmax equation (13Maravall M. Mainen Z.F. Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2655-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) using Kd and Fmax/Fmin (i.e. ratio of the fluo-5 fluorescence under saturating and Ca2+-free conditions) values of 400 nm and 180, respectively. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mice cerebral and mesenteric arteries using the RNAeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer. To identify the presence of BK channel α and β1 subunit transcripts in mice arteries, we designed primers specific for the BK channel α subunit (GenBank™ accession number NM_010610; sense nt 1204-1227 and antisense nt 1457-1478, amplicon = 275 bp) and β1 subunit (GenBank™ accession NM_031169.2; sense 604-627 and antisense 780-803, amplicon = 200 bp). We used β-actin (GenBank™ accession V01217; sense nt 2384-2404 and antisense nt 3071-3091, amplicon = 496 bp) transcript levels as an internal control. The β-actin primers amplify a region between exons 4 and 6 such that genomic contamination within the RNA preparation is identified by the presence of a 708-bp band in addition to the 496-bp band. Reverse transcription (with random primers) and amplification was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit from Qiagen following the manufacturer's instructions. Amplicons were visualized using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Calcineurin and NFAT Activity—To assess NFAT activity, we took advantage of genetically engineered mice (NFAT-luc) in which luciferase expression is transcriptionally regulated by NFAT (14Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Kaiser R.A. Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Glascock B.J. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Kimball T.R. Aronow B.J. Doevendans P.A. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Arteries from saline- and angiotensin II-treated NFAT-luc mice were collected as described above. Luciferase transcript expression was evaluated by conventional RT-PCR (Photinus pyralis; firefly luciferase, GenBank™ accession M15077; sense nt 520; antisense nt 1009). Calcineurin activity in arterial smooth muscle from control and Ang II-treated mice (NFAT-luc) was assessed using a colorimetric calcineurin cellular activity assay kit (Calbiochem) following the manufacturer's instructions. Chemicals and Statistics—All chemicals were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Two-group comparisons were made using Student's t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. A Wilcoxon ranked test was performed for data sets that did not have a normal distribution. The asterisk (*) symbol used in the figures illustrates a statistically significant difference between groups. In Vivo Administration of Angiotensin II Activates the Calcineurin/NFATc3 Signaling Pathway in Arterial Smooth Muscle—We measured calcineurin and NFAT activity in mice infused with saline (control) and angiotensin II via subcutaneous osmotic mini-pump. For these experiments, we used a transgenic NFAT reporter mouse (NFAT-luc) in which luciferase expression is controlled by multiple NFAT binding sites (15Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Thus, in these mice, luciferase transcript levels can be used as an indicator of NFAT activity. To verify the successful infusion of angiotensin II, blood pressures were monitored telemetrically (Fig. 1A). As expected, 2 days after pump implantation, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher in angiotensin II (systolic = 164 ± 7.2 mm Hg, diastolic = 124.6 ± 5.1 mm Hg, n = 3) than in control, saline-infused mice (systolic = 123.2 ± 5.0 mm Hg, diastolic = 91.6 ± 4.0 mm Hg, n = 3; p < 0.05). Tissues (mesenteric and cerebral arteries) were then harvested from control and angiotensin II mice 5 days after the implantation of pumps. As shown in Fig. 1B, calcineurin activity was nearly 5-fold higher in angiotensin II-infused than in saline-infused control arteries (p < 0.05, n = 5). Next, we investigated if the observed increase in calcineurin activity induced by angiotensin II translated into increased NFAT-mediated transcriptional activity. We used RT-PCR to detect luciferase transcript expression in arteries from saline- and angiotensin II-infused NFAT-luc mice (Fig. 1C). As a control, β-actin expression was also measured in these tissues. We found that luciferase, but not β-actin, transcript expression was higher in angiotensin II than in control arteries (n = 5; p < 0.05; Fig. 1). Indeed, it is important to note that luciferase transcript levels could not be detected in any of the control tissues examined, indicating that basal NFAT transcriptional activity in arterial smooth muscle is low. These results corroborate our calcineurin activity data, suggesting that calcineurin function and NFAT transcriptional activity increase in arterial smooth muscle in response to sustained in vivo administration of angiotensin II. Activation of Calcineurin Is Necessary for Decreased β1 Subunit Expression after Angiotensin II Infusion—We investigated if the increase in calcineurin/NFAT activity described above is linked to decreased expression of the β1 subunit of BK channels during angiotensin II infusion (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To begin, we analyzed the promoter region of the mouse BK channel α and β1 subunits genes to determine whether they contain putative NFAT binding sites (GGAAA). Our analysis revealed the presence of multiple putative NFAT binding sites in the promoter region of the mouse β1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_031169; -84 to -1202) but not α subunit genes (GenBank™ accession number NM_010610; -84 to -1202). On the basis of these findings, we examined if activation of the calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway during sustained angiotensin II administration was involved in selective down-regulation of the BK channel β1 subunit in arterial smooth muscle cells. First, we tested the hypothesis that calcineurin activity is necessary for down-regulation of BK channel function in arterial smooth muscle. In these experiments, mice were infused with angiotensin II and/or the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (3 mg/kg twice a day) for 5 days. In control experiments calcineurin activity was measured in arteries isolated from mice infused with saline, angiotensin II, FK506, and angiotensin II + FK506 (Fig. 2A). We found that calcineurin activity was similar in arteries from control and FK506 mice (n = 5, p > 0.05). As noted above, calcineurin activity was higher in angiotensin II than in control arteries (n = 5, p < 0.05). Note, however, that angiotensin II failed to increase calcineurin activity in the presence of FK506 (n = 5, p > 0.05). These data suggest that basal calcineurin activity is minimal in arterial smooth muscle and that infusion of FK506 prevents the activation of this phosphatase during in vivo angiotensin II administration. If calcineurin activation is necessary for decreasing β1 subunit expression during sustained angiotensin II infusion, then FK506 should prevent such down-regulation from occurring. Because the β1 subunit enhances the Ca2+ sensitivity of BK channels, we examined the open probability (Po) of BK channels from control, angiotensin II, FK506, and angiotensin II + FK506 myocytes at 1 and 10 μm Ca2+. Single BK channel currents were recorded using the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique at -40 mV in the presence of 1 and 10 μm Ca2+ in the cytosolic aspect of the channel. Fig. 2B shows representative traces of BK channels from control, angiotensin II, FK506, and angiotensin II + FK506 myocytes. As expected, the Po of BK channels in control cells increased as Ca2+ was elevated from 1 to 10 μm (Fig. 2, B-C). Consistent with our previous study (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we found that the Po of BK channels in angiotensin II myocytes was lower than in control cells at each Ca2+ concentration examined (n = 9 patches, p < 0.05). In contrast, the Po values of BK channels from FK506 and control cells were similar, indicating that basal calcineurin activity does not influence β1 function in arterial myocytes (p > 0.05). Note, however, that the Po of BK channels from angiotensin II + FK506 myocytes at 1 and 10 μm Ca2+ was similar to that of control channels (p > 0.05; Fig. 2C). These data indicate that coinfusion of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 prevents the decrease in BK channel Ca2+ sensitivity associated with chronic angiotensin II administration. In addition to increasing the intrinsic Ca2+ sensitivity of the BK channel α subunit, the β1 subunit also increases the open time of these channels. Thus, we examined the open times of BK channels in control, angiotensin II, FK506, and FK506 + angiotensin II myocytes by constructing open time histograms at a membrane potential of +40 mV with a free [Ca2+] of 1 μm. Fig. 2D shows representative single-channel recordings and open time histograms for all the experimental conditions examined. As reported previously (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the open dwell times of BK channels in myocytes from angiotensin II-infused mice are decreased relative to those of BK channels from control cells (4.3 ± 0.5 versus 12.0 ± 1.8 ms, p < 0.05, n = 9 patches each), which is consistent with decreased β1 subunit function in angiotensin II-exposed cells. Note, however, that control, FK506, and FK506 + angiotensin II BK channels had similar open times. From these results we conclude that FK506-sensitive activation of calcineurin is required for decreased BK channel open times after angiotensin II infusion. One potential mechanism by which FK506 prevented the decrease in BK channel function (i.e. shorter open times and lowered Ca2+-sensitivity) after angiotensin II infusion is by preventing down-regulation of the β1 subunit. To investigate this possibility, we measured α and β1 transcript levels in control, angiotensin II, FK506, and angiotensin II + FK506 arteries using RT-PCR (Fig. 3). We found that expression of α transcript was similar in control, angiotensin II, FK506, and angiotensin II + FK506 arteries. As reported previously (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), β1 transcript expression was about 60 ± 5% lower in angiotensin II than in control arteries (n = 6 mice; p < 0.05). Note, that the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 prevented angiotensin II infusion-mediated down-regulation of the BK channel β1 subunit. In light of our electrophysiological data, these findings suggest that calcineurin activity is necessary for down-regulation of β1 subunit expression and, hence, decreased BK channel function during angiotensin II-induced hypertension. NFATc3 Is Necessary for Decreased β1 Subunit Expression after Angiotensin II Infusion—Calcineurin dephosphorylates and, thus, activates the transcription factor NFATc3 in arterial myocytes (12Amberg G.C. Rossow C.F. Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47326-47334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Stevenson A.S. Gomez M.F. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15018-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because we have shown that calcineurin activity is necessary for β1 subunit down-regulation by angiotensin II, we hypothesized that NFATc3 may also be necessary. A testable prediction of this hypothesis is that angiotensin II infusion will not decrease β1 subunit function in arteries from NFATc3 null mice (NFATc3-/-). Accordingly, we implemented an experimental strategy similar to the one described above to assess the role of NFATc3 on β1 subunit function. We examined the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity and open dwell times of BK channels in excised patches from myocytes isolated from wild type (WT) and NFATc3-/- mice infused with saline or angiotensin II (see Fig. 4). We found that the Ca2+ sensitivity and open dwell times of BK channels in control (i.e. saline-infused WT and NFATc3-/- mice) were not different (panels A and B in Fig. 4; p > 0.05). This indicates that that basal NFATc3 activity is not necessary for normal BK channel function in arterial myocytes. As expected from the data presented above and our previous study (8Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we found that angiotensin II infusion decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity and open dwell times of WT BK channels. However, note that the Ca2+ sensitivity and open dwell times of BK channels of cells from NFATc3-/- mice infused with angiotensin II were similar to those from control WT and NFATc3-/- cells (Fig. 4; p > 0.05). These data indicate that the calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway is necessary for angiotensin II-mediated decreases in BK channel Ca2+ sensitivity and open times. Next, we investigated if NFATc3 activity is involved with decreased BK channel β1 expression after angiotensin II infusion. RT-PCR was used to assess α and β1 transcript expression in WT, NFATc3-/-, WT + angiotensin II, and NFATc3-/- + angiotensin II arteries (Fig. 5). Our data indicate that α subunit transcript expression was similar under all experimental conditions. As expected, angiotensin II infusion decreased β1 transcripts in WT arteries but failed to do so in NFATc3-/- arteries (Fig. 5). β1 subunit transcript expression was similar in control (i.e. no angiotensin II), WT, and NFATc3-/- arteries (n = 6 animals; p > 0.05). Taken together, our findings indicate that sustained angiotensin II infusion activates the calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway, which results in down-regulation of β1 subunit and, thus, decreases BK channel function. Angiotensin II-induced Down-regulation of the BK Channel β1 Subunit Is Independent of Changes in Blood Pressure—In the next series of experiments, we investigated if the effects of systemic angiotensin II administration on arterial smooth muscle BK channels were dependent on changes in arterial pressure. To examine this issue, we placed WT cerebral arterial segments in organ culture (12Amberg G.C. Rossow C.F. Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47326-47334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Kleppisch T. Winter B. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: 2462-2468PubMed Google Scholar) for 48 h under control conditions (i.e. medium only) and in the presence of angiotensin II (100 nm). At the end of this incubation period, we dissociated cells from these arteries and examined the activity (Po) of BK channels in inside-out patches at 1 and 10 μm Ca2+ at -40 mV as described above. Note that all experiments were performed in the absence of angiotensin. As observed during in vivo administration of angiotensin II (see above), the Po of BK channels from control WT myocytes was higher than those from angiotensin II-treated WT cells at 1 and 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 6"

Here patch clamping reconstituted inner membranes allowed for first time insights into the structure and function of the preprotein translocase. Our findings indicate that the TIM23 channel has “twin pores” (two equal sized pores that cooperatively gate) thereby strikingly resembling TOM, the translocase of the outer membrane. Tim17p and Tim23p are homologues, but their functions differ. Tim23p acts as receptor for preproteins and may largely constitute the preprotein-conducting passageway. Conversely depletion of Tim17p induces a collapse of the twin pores into a single pore, whereas N terminus deletion or C terminus truncation results in variable sized pores that cooperatively gate. Further analysis of Tim17p mutants indicates that the N terminus is vital for both voltage sensing and protein sorting. These results suggest that although Tim23p is the main structural unit of the pore Tim17p is required for twin pore structure and provides the voltage gate for the TIM23 channel.

Because more than 95% of the ∼700 yeast mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, newly synthesized proteins need to be translocated to their final destinations in the outer and inner membranes, the matrix, or the intermembrane space (1Reichert A.S. Neupert W. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Three multisubunit complexes or translocases mediate this routing of preproteins. All precursor proteins cross the outer membrane through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM). 3The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PAM, presequence translocase-associated motor; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; pS, picosiemens; PEG, polyethylene glycol. The TIM22 and TIM23 complexes are two translocases in the inner membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 2Chacinska A. Lind M. Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E.

Multipass membrane proteins carrying internal targeting signals, e.g. phosphate carrier, are inserted into the inner membrane by the TIM22 complex. Those preproteins with cleavable N-terminal presequences that are destined for the matrix or the inner membrane are transported by the TIM23 translocase. The TIM23 complex is formed by at least three integral membrane proteins including Tim23p, Tim17p, and Tim50p. Preproteins are recognized in the intermembrane space by the large C-terminal domain of Tim50p. This domain interacts with Tim23p and guides the precursor protein to the pore of the complex (8Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Pfanner N.

Tim23p also contains a hydrophilic domain of about 100 amino acids exposed to the intermembrane space that has receptor-like properties for the recognition of preproteins (11Emtage J.L. Jensen R.E.

For complete translocation, preproteins need the driving force of the presequence translocase-associated motor or PAM complex, which contains mtHsp70 (matrix heat shock protein), Mge1, Pam16p/Tim16p, Pam18p/Tim14p, and Tim44p (15D'Silva P.D.

The high degree of homology of Tim17p with Tim23p led to speculation that these two proteins form the protein-translocating channel (21Kubrich M. Keil P. Rassow J. Dekker P.J. Blom J. Meijer M. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.C. Neupert W. Brunner M.

It has also been hypothesized that Tim17p might form a Tim23p-independent channel that mediates incorporation of proteins into the inner membrane by a stop-transfer mechanism (24Pfanner N. Chacinska A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently Tim17p was shown to be essential for both sorting of proteins into the inner membrane and translocation of precursor proteins into the matrix where Tim17p may provide a link between the TIM23 and PAM complexes (2Chacinska A. Lind M. Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Cell. 2005; 120: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Moreover Tim17p specifically interacts with the purified N-terminal domain of Pam18/Tim14p, which is exposed to the intermembrane space (2Chacinska A. Lind M. Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Cell. 2005; 120: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). At the core of each of the translocases is a channel, or pore, that provides the aqueous pathway for the transit of unfolded proteins. The TOM and TIM22 complexes were found to have twin pore structures by single particle analysis (25Kunkele K.-P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S.

Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); this approach has not yet been successfully applied to the TIM23 complex. In previous electrophysiological studies, the channel activities associated with the TOM and TIM23 complexes were found to be remarkably similar (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that the TIM23 channel has a twin pore structure, like the TOM and TIM22 channels, and that Tim17p is vital to maintaining this structure. Analysis of several mutants revealed that the N terminus of Tim17p acts as the voltage sensor for the TIM23 complex. Isolation of Mitochondria and Preparation of Proteoliposomes—A mutant strain of Saccaromyces cerevisiae, Tim17(Gal10), in which the expression of TIM17 gene is controlled by a Gal10 promoter was used (28Milisav I. Moro F. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25856-25861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated at 30 °C on standard defined lactate medium with 2% glucose in the presence or absence of 1% galactose for 24 h as described by Milisav et al. (28Milisav I. Moro F. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25856-25861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Three additional Tim17 mutants were analyzed and include versions lacking the C-terminal 24 (Tim17ΔC) or N-terminal 11 (Tim17ΔN) amino acids, double point mutant D4R/D8K (Tim17DD→ RK), and a four-point mutant with an additional replacement at amino acids 80 and 83 (Tim17DD→ RK/KR→ DD). Cells were grown at 30 °C on semisynthetic lactate medium as described by Meier et al. (29Meier S. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7777-7785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from logarithmically growing cells as described previously (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Homogenization buffer was 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P 8215). Mitoplasts were prepared from isolated mitochondria by the French press method (30Decker G.L. Greenawalt J.W. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1977; 59: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the inner membranes were further purified according to Mannella (31Mannella C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) as described previously (32Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H.-Y. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Membrane purity was routinely assessed, and cross-contamination was typically less than 5%. Inner membranes were reconstituted into giant proteoliposomes by dehydration-rehydration as described previously (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Lohret T.A. Kinnally K.W. Biophys.

Patch Clamping Techniques—Patch clamp experiments were carried out on reconstituted TIM23 channels of proteoliposomes containing purified mitochondrial inner membranes (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H.-Y. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly membrane patches were excised from giant proteoliposomes after formation of a gigaseal using microelectrodes with ∼0.4-μm-diameter tips and resistances of 10–30 megaohms. Unless otherwise indicated, the solution in the microelectrode and bath was 150 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at ∼23 °C. Voltage clamp was established with the inside-out excised configuration (35Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) using a Dagan 3900 patch clamp amplifier in the inside-out mode. Voltages across excised patches were reported as bath potentials. The open probability, Po, was calculated as the fraction of the total time the channel spent in the open state from total amplitude histograms generated with WinEDR Software (courtesy of J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK) from 20–40 s of current traces. V0 is the voltage at which the channel spends half of the time open (Po is 0.5). Mean open time was measured by analyzing >1000 transition events per patch. Filtration was 2 kHz with 5-kHz sampling for all analysis and currents traces shown unless otherwise stated. Simulations were generated by WinEDR Software as described previously (27Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by providing single channel parameters including transition amplitude, mean open and closed times, and designating five openings/burst for each data set. The distribution of time spent in each of the three states (O, two open (PO1O2 = Po2); S, one open and one closed (PO1C2 or C1O2 = 2Po(1 – Po)); and C, two closed (PC1C2 = (1 – Po)2)) was fit to the open state of two independent channels. Permeability ratios were calculated from the reversal potential in the presence of a 150:30 mm KCl gradient as described previously (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Peptides were introduced by perfusion of the 0.5-ml bath with 3–5 ml of medium. Flicker rates were determined from 20–40 s of current traces as the number of transition events/s from the open to lower conductance states with a 50% threshold of the predominant event (∼250 pS). The pore size was estimated using the polymer exclusion method (36Bezrukov S.M. Kasianowicz J.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 26: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Krasilnikov O.V. Sabirov R.Z. Ternovsky V.I. Merzliak P.G. Muratkhodjaev J.N. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 5: 93-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transition size and peak conductance in the presence of a series of polyethylene glycols (PEGs; molecular mass, 200–8000 Da) was determined. PEG solutions were 15% (w/v) in 150 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and were added to the bath by perfusion. The radius of the pore of the TIM23 channel was also estimated from the peak conductance assuming a pore length of 7 nm (38Szabo I. Bernardi P. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2940-2946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, Rpore = (l + (π a)/2) (ρ/π a2) where R and ρ are the resistivity of the pore and solution, l is pore length, and a is pore radius (39Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 4th Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 351-352Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred (32Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H.-Y. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Indirect immunodetection used chemiluminescence (ECL by Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Membrane proteins (0.5–12 μg/line) were decorated with antibodies against Tim23p, Tim17p, and Tim44p (gift of M. Brunner and I. Milisav). Scion imaging and densitometry were used to semiquantify the amount of Tim17p and Tim23p from the signal intensities of bands on Western blots that were normalized relative to 1 μg of total protein of cells grown in the presence of galactose. Peptides—Peptides were prepared by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center Peptide Synthesis Core Facility (Albany, NY) using an Applied Biosystems 431A automated peptide synthesizer as described previously (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The presequence peptides used were based on amino acids 1–13 and 1–22 from the N terminus of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV of S. cerevisiae (yCoxIV-(1–13) and yCoxIV-(1–22)) and a synthetic mitochondrial presequence, SynB2 (46Allison D.S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Peptides were subjected to mass spectroscopy to determine impurities and proper composition and were typically >90% pure. Considerable evidence links TIM23 channel activity to protein import and the TIM23 complex. Antibodies against Tim23p specifically block TIM23 channel activity in patch clamp experiments and protein import in mitoplasts (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A tim23.1 strain that is import-deficient displays altered TIM23 channel activity (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TIM23 channel activity is reversibly regulated by synthetic presequence peptides (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J.

The frequency of detecting TIM23 channels is directly coupled to the amount of Tim17p (supplemental Fig. S1) or Tim23p (47Martinez-Caballero S. Peixoto P.M.V. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Anal. Biochem. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) present in the membrane. Moreover the single channel properties of TIM23 are surprisingly similar to those of TOM channel, the import channel of the outer membrane (27Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether TIM23 channels have a twin pore structure like that of TOM channels, the architecture of the TIM23 channel was investigated by characterizing normal and Tim17 mutant strains of yeast with patch clamp techniques. Mitochondrial inner membranes were purified and fused with small liposomes to form giant proteoliposomes. Membrane patches were excised from proteoliposomes with a micropipette, and the conductance (which is proportional to the resistance to the current flow of ions and the pore size) was measured at various voltages in the presence and absence of molecules that can size the channel pore. Single channel properties were routinely measured to verify TIM23 channel identity. Like TOM, normal TIM23 channels have an open state conductance of 1000 pS and a half-open substate of 500 pS; most transitions in the current traces are 500 pS (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1) (13Lohret T.A.

Open table in a new tab The Putative Twin Pore Structure of the TIM23 Channel—The single channel behavior can shed light on the pore structure of the TIM23 channel. TIM23 behavior could be described by any of the three models in Fig. 1, C–E. Changes in the radius of the “iris-like” pore of Fig. 1C could account for the open (1000 pS), half-open (500 pS), and closed (0 pS) states. This type of behavior is typified by voltage-dependent anion-selective channel where large conformational changes reduce the radius of the open pore to one that is half-open or closed (43Colombini M. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 169-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Alternatively the TIM23 channel may have two pores of equal size (Fig. 1, D and E). In both cases, the two pores are open when the conductance is ∼1000 pS, one pore is open and one is closed when the conductance is 500 pS, and both are closed when the conductance is 0 pS. The transition size corresponding to opening or closing of one pore in current traces is typically 500 pS (Fig. 1, A and B). The difference between the models of Fig. 1, D and E, is that gating of the twin-sized pores of Fig. 1D is independent and that of Fig. 1E is cooperative. The model with a single pore that changes diameter (iris-like) can be distinguished experimentally from the twin pore models by differences in the pore size of the open state. The iris-like model predicts a significant change in pore radius as the channel transits between the open and half-open states. Both twin pore models predict that the open and half-open states have the same pore size. The conductance of TIM23 channels was used to estimate the size of large pores by the method of Hille (39Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 4th Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 351-352Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures” for formula) from two different control strains. (The single channel behavior of TIM23 channels from both strains was identical (Fig. 1 and Table 1) (13Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2940-2946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this approach indicates that the iris-like single pore would have an open state radius of 1.43 ± 0.08 nm and half-open radius of 0.93 ± 0.03 nm (Table 2). Both twin pores are predicted to have a radius of 0.93 ± 0.03 nm. The polymer exclusion method was then used to measure the pore size to determine whether the radius actually changed during transitions between the open and half-open states.TABLE 2Sizing the radius of the TIM23 channelMethodWild typeTim17(Gal10)+GalTim17(Gal10)-GalPolymer exclusionaCalculated using the method of Bezrukov and Kasianowicz (36).Transition size (nm)0.81-0.91 (n = 5)0.88-0.94 (n = 5)NAPeak conductance (nm)ND0.90-0.94 (n = 5)0.95-1.14 (n = 7)Pore resistancebCalculated from pore resistance using the method of Hille (39) from the transition size or peak conductance assuming a pore length of 7 nm (38).Transition size (nm)0.93 ± 0.03 (n = 10)0.94 ± 0.04 (n = 10)NAPeak conductance (nm)1.43 ± 0.08 (n = 10)1.33 ± 0.05 (n = 8)1.10 ± 0.09 (n = 15)a Calculated using the method of Bezrukov and Kasianowicz (36Bezrukov S.M.

Open table in a new tab The polymer exclusion method is a common means of measuring pore sizes and is based on an observed decrease in conductance when non-electrolytes, e.g. PEG of various molecular weights and known radii, enter the pore of the channel (3Grigoriev S.M.

The presence of non-electrolytes in the pore reduces the “room” available for the current-carrying electrolytes K+ and Cl–, reducing the conductance. Impermeable non-electrolytes have no effect on the conductance once corrected for differences in the conductivity of media. Both the transition size and the peak conductance of TIM23 channels decreased in the presence of 200–600-Da PEGs (0.5–0.8 nm) indicating that these PEG were permeable (Fig. 1, F–H). Neither were affected by the 1000–8000 molecular weight PEG (0.94–3.05 nm) indicating that these PEGs were not permeable in either the half-open or open state. A pore radius of 0.81–0.94 nm was calculated from the transition size (Fig. 1, I and J), and 0.90–0.94 nm was calculated from the peak conductance data (Fig. 1K and Table 2). Both values are similar to the 0.93 ± 0.03-nm radius estimated from the transition size by the method of Hille (39Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 4th Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 351-352Google Scholar). However, these values are significantly different from 1.43 ± 0.08 nm predicted from the peak conductance (Table 2). Hence the TIM23 channel is not an iris-like single pore (Fig. 1C) because the fully open and half-open states have the same permeability for various sized PEGs, i.e. their radii are the same. Further investigations were needed to distinguish between the two twin pore models. Do the twin pores open and close independently (Fig. 1D) or cooperatively (Fig. 1E)? If multiple, independent channels are in a membrane patch, the total amplitude histograms should fit a binomial distribut"

In the human RNase family, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (RNase2) and eosinophil cationic protein (RNase3) have neurotoxic (2.Durack D.T. Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Parasite Immunol. 1981; 3: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Angiogenin (RNase5), which induces blood vessel formation, is also an RNase (4.Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Lobb R.R. Alderman E.M. Bethune J.L. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5480-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In the frog RNase family, most of the members have antitumor activity (5.Liao Y.D. Huang H.C. Leu Y.J. Wei C.W. Tang P.C. Wang S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the above-mentioned functions, the catalytic activities of RNases are essential. Some members of RNase superfamily, such as human RNases 3, 5, and 7 (hRNase3, hRNase5, and hRNase7), mouse angiogenins 1 and 4 (mAng1 and mAng4), as well as chicken RNaseA2, also have antimicrobial activities (6.Zhang J.

The mechanisms for these antibacterial activities remain unclear, although some distinct properties exist in these bactericidal RNases. First of all, the calculated isoelectric points of bactericidal RNases are higher than those of non-bactericidal RNases. Second, the net positive charges of the bactericidal RNases are higher than those of non-bactericidal RNases (Table 1). There is no evidence, however, that the high positive charge or high pI value is critical for the antimicrobial activity. In this study, we have presented evidence that one flexible Lys cluster K1,K3,K111,K112, rather than the catalytic residues His15, Lys38, His123 or other Lys clusters such as K32,K35, and K96,R97,K100,is critical for the bactericidal activity of hRNase7. The functional role of these Lys residues (K1,K3,K111,K112) on the bactericidal activity of hRNase7 will be discussed.TABLE 1Properties of selected RNases in bovine RNase A superfamilyRNaseFunctionCatalytic activityAmino acid no.LysArgAspGluNet chargespIdAccession codes are as follows: hRNase 2 (X16546), hRNase 3 (X16545), hRNase 7 (NM_032572), hRNase 5 (NM_001145), mAng (NM_007447), mAng-4 (AY219870), bRNase A (X07283), RC-RNase (AF039104), and RC-RNase 6 (AF242556)hRNase 2Antiviral, neurotoxic0.65aZhang, et al.

Combined information from two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments yielded assignments for side chain amide resonances of the Asn and Gln residues. Aromatic resonances were assigned using two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC, NOESY, and TOCSY data. Linear prediction was used in the 13C and 15N dimensions to improve the digital resolution.

The best 15 structures, together with the complete list of restraints, have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession number 2HKY. Antimicrobial Activity of RNase Superfamily Proteins−The hRNase7 was more effective (0.1 μm for 102-fold reduction) in cfu compared with that of buffer only against bacteria (105 cfu P. aeruginosa) than bullfrog RC-RNase6 (5 μm), whereas the active RNA-degrading RNases (bovine RNaseA and bull-frog RC-RNase) and all other bullfrog oocytic RNases were not bactericidal at 80 μm. The 12-mer Arg-rich positively charged oligopeptide (R3S1)3, however, possessed similar bactericidal activity (0.2 μm) as that of hRNase7 (0.1 μm) (Fig. 1, A and B). The antimicrobial spectrum of hRNase7 was also examined, and the yeast P. pastoris X-33 (0.03 μm for 102-fold reduction in cfu compared with that of buffer only) was the most sensitive among all of the microbes tested and thereafter in order the Gram-negative bacterium P. aeruginosa (0.1 μm), whereas the Gram-positive S. aureus (1 μm) and Gram-negative E. coli bacteria (10 μm) and yeast C. albicans (> 20 μm) were not sensitive (Fig. 1, B and C). Binding and Permeability to Bacterial Membrane−The cfu of susceptible bacteria was reduced 102-fold in only a few minutes after RNase addition (data not shown). The bactericidal RNases (hRNase7 and RC-RNase6) were bound to the susceptible bacterium P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 11). In contrast, the non-bactericidal bovine RNaseA and bullfrog RC-RNase did not bind to the bacteria (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 8). The membrane of P. aeruginosa became permeable to the DNA-binding dye SYTOX® Green in only a few minutes after the addition of 2.5 μm hRNase7 or bullfrog RC-RNase6 to the bacteria (107 cfu in 100 μl). However, the non-bactericidal bovine RNaseA and bullfrog RC-RNase had no effect under the same conditions, which was in good agreement with the antimicrobial assay (Figs. 1A and 3). The bactericidal activity of hRNase7 was only slightly reduced at 4 °C (0.3 μm for 102-fold reduction in cfu compared with that of 0.1 μm at 37 °C), whereas that of indolicidin, a 13-mer bactericidal oligopeptide from bovine neutroplils, was almost abolished (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the bactericidal activity of hRNase7 is not energy-dependent, whereas that of indolicidin is energy-dependent.FIGURE 4The effect of temperature on the bactericidal activity of hRNase7 and indolicidin. The antimicrobial activities of hRNase7 and indolicidin against P. aeruginosa at both 37 °C (A) and 4 °C (B) were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conformational and Structural Stability of hRNase7−To elucidate the mechanism for the antimicrobial activity of hRNase7, the structure of the recombinant protein was analyzed by CD spectra and NMR studies. The important features are summarized and discussed below. First, the conformation of hRNase7 was pH-independent over the range of 3.5–9.5. The Tm value of hRNase7 was 66.4 °C. The chemical stability was determined with a Cm value at 3.27 m guanidine-HCl. These Tm and Cm values indicate that hRNase7 is a stable protein in structure, similar to other RNaseA superfamily members. Structure of hRNase7−The 800-MHz two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the hRNase7 was obtained in which cross-peaks clearly dispersed (Fig. 5). For the determination of tertiary structures, a set of 1661 restraints were collected for simulated annealing calculations. Among these restraints, 1447 were interproton distances, 94 were hydrogen bonds, 116 were torsional angles, and 4 were disulfide bond restraints (Table 2). The 15 structures of the lowest total energy were chosen to represent the ensemble of NMR structures (Fig. 6A). These structures were consistent with both experimental data and standard covalent geometry and displayed no violations >0.3 Å for distance restraints and no violations >3 ° for torsional angles. Superposition of each structure with the mean structure yielded an average root mean square deviation of 0.34 ± 0.09 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.06 ± 0.08 Å for the heavy atoms in residues 7–128. Analysis of the ensemble using PROCHECK-NMR revealed that 64.4% of the residues lay in the most favored regions and 33.9% of the residues lay in allowed regions in the Ramachandran ϕ, Ψ dihedral-angle plot (Table 2).TABLE 2Structural statistics on the final set of 15 simulated annealing structures for human RNase 7Constraints usedNOE distance restraintsIntraresidue (|i–j| = 0)211Sequential (|i–j| = 1)363Medium range (1<|i–j| < 5)335Long range (|i–j| ≥ 5)538Total NOE distance restraints1447Hydrogen bonds47 × 2Disulfide bonds4Dihedral angles116Statistics for the final X-PLOR structuresNumber of structures in the final set15X-PLOR energy (kcal · mol–1)ENOE131.3 ± 4.0Ecdih3.3 ± 0.4Ebond + Eangle + Eimproper231.1 ± 6.0EVDW322.0 ± 6.4Mean global root mean square deviation (Å)Backbone atoms (N, Cα, C′) (residues 7–128)0.34 ± 0.09Backbone atoms (N, Cα, C′) (secondary structure)0.24 ± 0.06Heavy atoms (residues 7–128)1.06 ± 0.08Heavy atoms (secondary structure)0.95 ± 0.10Ramachandran plot (%)Residues in most favored regions64.4Residues in allowed regions26.9Residues in generously allowed regions7.0Residues in disallowed regions1.7 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6Structure of hRNase7.

The structure was stabilized by four disulfide bridges (C23–C81, C55–C106, C37–C91 and C62–C69). Most of the hydrogen bonds were located in the α-helix and β-sheet regions. Most positively charged residues were distributed into three clusters (Fig. 6B). The first was composed of Lys1, Lys3, Lys111, and Lys112; the second, Lys28, Lys32, Lys35, Arg36, and Lys38, and the third, Lys82, Lys94, Lys96, Arg97, and Lys100. On the other hand, the negatively charged residues were randomly distributed over hRNase7 (Fig. 6C). Residues Responsible for Bactericidal Activity of hRNase7−Because cationic residues were abundant in bactericidal RNases as demonstrated in Table 1, we thus proceeded to determine the role of the RNA catalytic activity or cationic residue in the bactericidal activity. First of all, we found that the catalytic activity-deficient mutants of hRNase7 (H15A, K38A, and H123A) still conferred the same level of antimicrobial activity as the wild-type hRNase7 (Fig. 7, A and B; and Fig. 8A). The result shows that RNA catalytic activity is not essential for the antibacterial activity of RNases.FIGURE 8Antimicrobial activities of recombinant hRNase7 and mutants. A, catalytic RNA-deficient mutants. B and C, deletion or substitution mutants of positively charged residues. Δ1KPKG4 represents the deletion of N-terminal Met and 1KPKG4 residues from the recombinant hRNase7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deletion of the N-terminal Met and four residues (Δ1KPKG4) from recombinant hRNase7 markedly reduced the bactericidal activity but did not alter the RNA catalytic activities (Fig. 7, C and D; and Fig. 8B). Further analysis showed that the K3A mutant exerted less bactericidal activity than the K1A mutant (Fig. 7, C and D; and Fig. 8C). However, the substitution of the K111Q/K112Q residues in the same cationic cluster reduced the bactericidal activity to a lesser extent than N-terminal deletion. In contrast, mutations in other positively charged clusters (K32N/K35Q and K96A/R97A/K100T) altered neither the catalytic nor the bactericidal activity (Fig. 7, C and D; and Fig. 8B). These results show that the flexible Lys1,Lys3, as well as Lys111,Lys112 residues in the first cationic cluster are critical for the bactericidal activity. Structural Comparison of Wild-type and K3A Mutated hRNase7− The structure of K3A-hRNase7 was nearly identical to that of wild-type hRNase7, as there was no difference in the cross-peaks of two-dimensional N15-H1-HSQC and three-dimensional N15-NOESY and HSQC NMR spectra between them, except residues Gly4, Leu124, and Ala3, although K3A-hRNase7 had less antimicrobial activity than wild-type hRNase7 (Fig. 8C). The structures of bactericidal RNases hRNase3 and hRNase7 are similar to those of RNaseA superfamily proteins with three α-helices and two triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheets. Among these RNases, only the bactericidal RNases contained abundant positively charged residues on the enzyme surface, but the non-bactericidal RNases did not (Table 1). The abundance of the cationic residues Lys and Arg is also found in most antimicrobial peptides. These peptides possess amphipathic structures that are composed of clustered cationic and hydrophobic residues on each side of the structure, although they have diverse primary sequences and different secondary structures (23.Epand R.M. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 24.Hancock R.E. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The cationic residues may facilitate their interaction with the negatively charged components on the microbial surface, and the hydrophobic residues may permit their incorporation into microbial membrane (25.Powers J.P. Hancock R.E. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that three clusters of cationic residues are located on the surface of hRNase7. The first cluster consists of Lys1,Lys3, Lys111,Lys112 residues, the second and third clusters contain Lys32,Lys35 and Lys96,Arg97,Lys100, respectively. Only cationic residues in the first cluster, K1,K3,K111,K112, are critical for the bactericidal activity, whereas the other two clusters, K32,K35, and K96,R97,K100, are not (Figs. 6A and 8B). The result of Fig. 6C shows that the side chains of the Lys1, Lys3, Lys111, and Lys112 residues in the first cluster are more flexible than those of cationic residues in other clusters. In addition, we also found that no anionic residue resides in the first cluster of hRNase7 near the K1,K3,K111,K112 residues by NMR studies (Fig. 6) and no anionic residue resides at each N-terminal region of bactericidal RNases by the comparison of amino acid sequences among the RNaseA superfamily members (Fig. 9). Thus, it is concluded that clustering of cationic residues without an adjacent anionic residue is critical for the bactericidal activity of hRNase. Several members in the RNase superfamily have antimicrobial activities, but the key residues/domains responsible for antimicrobial activity were different in human RNase3 and RNase7 (6.Zhang J.

The content of cationic residues of hRNase3 (Lys1 and Arg19) differs from that of hRNase7 (Lys18 and Arg4). Furthermore, the cationic residues Arg101 and Arg104 and aromatic residues Trp10 and Trp35 of hRNase3, which are suggested to be responsible for membrane binding and disruption, reside on the dispersed secondary structure (α1, β4) (26.Carreras E. Boix E. Rosenberg H.F. Cuchillo C.M. Nogues M.V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6636-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas the cationic residues K1,K3,K111,K112, of hRNase7 reside on the flexible coil and loop at the N-terminal cluster. With regard to chicken RNaseA2, the Arg residues in domains II (residues 71–76) and III (residues 89–104) are critical for the bactericidal activity, but the structures of the RNaseA2 remains unknown (10.Nitto T. Dyer K.D. Czapiga M. Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25622-25634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to the flexibility of the side chains of cationic residues, we were also interested in the influence of similar tertiary structure folds for RNases on the antimicrobial activity. Our results indicate that the bactericidal activity of RNase was not correlated with its backbone tertiary structure; for example, the root mean square deviation values between hRNase7 and bactericidal hRNase3 and hRNase5 are 2.57 and 3.37 Å, respectively, whereas those between bactericidal hRNase7 and non-bactericidal hRNase2, hRNase4, and bovine RNaseA are 2.34, 3.09, and 2.33 Å, respectively. This indicates that the tertiary structure fold of the whole RNase backbone is not critical for the antimicrobial activity. The hRNase7 was effective in bactericidal activity at 4 °C, whereas the indolicidin, a Trp-rich oligopeptide (ILPWKWWPWWPWRR-NH2) from bovine neutrophils, was not (27.Hsu C.H. Chen C. Jou M.L. Lee A.Y. Lin Y.C. Yu Y.P. Huang W.T. Wu S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The bactericidal RNases hRNase7 and RC-RNase6 from bullfrog oocytes were bound to susceptible bacteria, whereas the non-bactericidal RNases were not. These results suggest that some component(s) on the bacteria is/are responsible for the binding of hRNase7 and the action mechanism of hRNase7 is energy-independent (28.Falla T.J. Karunaratne D.N. Hancock R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19298-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 29.Robinson Jr., W.E. McDougall B. Tran D. Selsted M.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The bacterial membrane became permeable to the DNA binding dye SYTOX® Green just a few minutes after the addition of hRNase7 (Fig. 3). This indicates that the marked increase of membrane permeability is an important step for the bactericidal activity of hRNase7. Thus, we suggest that the hRNase7 may bind to the negatively charged components of the bacterial membrane through the flexible and cationic residues. The hRNase7 may change its own conformation, incorporates itself into the bacterial membrane through the hydrophobic scaffold, and triggers the disruption of membrane. Alternatively, we also propose that several pores, which are composed of hRNase7-binding proteins, may reside on the bacterial surface for the regulation of the transportation of ions and metabolites. The opening of pores may be triggered by hRNase7 binding through the flexible/clustered cationic residues and hydrophobic scaffold. The efflux of ions and fatal depolarization of bacterial membrane may thus cause immediate cell death, even at low temperatures. The antibacterial mechanisms of these positively charged peptides/proteins by physical disruption of bacterial membrane is different from those for conventional antibiotics, which are inhibition of cell wall synthesis, DNA replication, RNA transcription, or protein synthesis. Due to the unique bactericidal activity of hRNase7, it has the potential to be a new therapeutic agent for bacterial infection, because it may not face the rapid emergence of drug resistance. The induction of endogenous hRNase7 gene expression or the administration of a synthetic oligopeptide designed from the hRNase7 structure would be possible in the clinical therapy for microbial infection. We thank Dr. Chen-Pei David Tu for critical reading of the manuscript, Dr. Yuan-Chao Lou for editing the manuscript, and Chiu-Feng Wang for the construction of various hRNase7 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2005970620,"A growing body of evidence indicates that G-protein-coupled receptors undergo complex conformational changes upon agonist activation. It is likely that the extracellular region, including the N terminus, undergoes activation-dependent conformational changes. We examined this by generating antibodies to regions within the N terminus of μ-opioid receptors. We find that antibodies to the midportion of the N-terminal tail exhibit enhanced recognition of activated receptors, whereas those to the distal regions do not. The enhanced recognition is abolished upon treatment with agents that block G-protein coupling or deglycosylate the receptor. This suggests that the N-terminal region of μ receptors undergoes conformational changes following receptor activation that can be selectively detected by these region-specific antibodies. We used these antibodies to characterize μ receptor type-specific ligands and find that the antibodies accurately differentiate ligands with varying efficacies. Next, we examined if these antibodies can be used to investigate the extent and duration of activation of endogenous receptors. We find that peripheral morphine administration leads to a time-dependent increase in antibody binding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex with a peak at about 30 min, indicating that these antibodies can be used to probe the spatio-temporal dynamics of native μ receptors. Finally, we show that this strategy of targeting the N-terminal region to generate receptor conformation-specific antisera can be applied to other Gαi-coupled (δ-opioid, CB1 cannabinoid, α2A-adrenergic) as well as Gαs-(β2-adrenergic) and Gαq-coupled (AT1 angiotensin) receptors. Taken together, these studies describe antisera as tools that allow, for the first time, studies probing differential conformation states of G-protein-coupled receptors, which could be used to identify molecules of therapeutic interest.

A tremendous effort has been put toward understanding the mechanism of activation of family A GPCRs at a molecular level. Spin label studies with rhodopsin have shown that exposure to light leads to a movement of helices relative to one another that is important for activation of transducin (1Altenbach C. Yang K.

Studies using a variety of techniques suggest that small agonists bind to a pocket formed by the surrounding transmembrane helices, and in addition peptide ligands contact additional determinants in extracellular loops and possibly the N-terminal tail (5Fadhil I.

Binding of agonists, but not antagonists, leads to the stabilization of the helical bundle into a conformation, which, in turn, leads to the uncovering of molecular determinants at the bottom of the core required for G-protein binding and activation (11Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Although a comprehensive mechanism for receptor activation, including the N- and C-terminal regions, is not yet available, accumulating evidence suggests that these regions undergo strong structural perturbations upon receptor activation. Studies with receptors with a large N-terminal tail, such as glycoprotein hormone receptors (12Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), as well as those with a smaller N-terminal tail, such as opioid and other family A receptors, have provided support for the participation of the N-terminal region in receptor activation (13Lecat S.

Opioid receptors belong to family A GPCRs, and their activation induces systemic responses, such as analgesia, euphoria, and decreased intestinal motility (16Dhawan B.N. Cesselin F. Raghubir R.

The alkaloid, morphine, is widely used as an analgesic in the treatment of chronic pain; however, its long term use leads to the development of tolerance and addiction. Therefore, a major research focus has been toward the understanding of the spatio-temporal events that are critical to the development of these side effects. Understanding the mechanisms of receptor activation would allow the design of new drugs that are as effective as morphine in the treatment of chronic pain but with fewer side effects. Antibodies have been useful in exploring the mechanisms of activation by delineating the domains involved in activity-mediated conformational changes in the case of a variety of signaling proteins and ligand-receptor interactions (19Schmidt A. MacColl R. Lindau-Shepard B. Buckler D.R. Dias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23373-23381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Vignal E. Blangy A. Martin M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8022-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of GPCRs, although antibodies have been generated to different regions of the receptor, the involvement of the N-terminal region in activity-dependent conformational changes has not been well explored. In a few instances, antibodies to the N terminus appear to discriminate between naive and activated receptors (21Cha K. Reeves P.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3016-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Takao M. Iwasa T. Yamamoto H. Takeuchi T. Tokunaga F. Zoolog. Sci. 2002; 19: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These results suggested that we should be able to target a region of the N terminus for the generation of antibodies that could detect conformational changes in this region following receptor activation. We tested this possibility by generating antibodies against a region in the N terminus of μ-opioid receptors. We find that these antibodies differentially recognize inactive and agonist-activated receptors. Next, we examined if a similar strategy could be used to generate antibodies that detect conformational changes in the N-terminal region a variety of family A GPCRs (differing in the nature of endogenous ligand and G-protein coupling). We find that these antisera can distinguish between inactive and agonist-activated receptors. Next, we focused on the characterization of μ antibodies because of their high clinical relevance. We show that these antibodies can be used to characterize and screen ligands by whole cell ELISA or flow cytometry. Finally, we show that these antibodies recognize native receptors and that we can quantitate the spatio-temporal dynamics of receptor activation in the brain following peripheral drug administration. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged mouse μ receptors were grown in F-12 medium (23Gomes I. Gupta A. Filipovska J. Szeto H.H. Pintar J.E. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). COS and SKNSH cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. COS cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged wild type μ, δ, α2A, CB1, β2, or AT1 receptors using Lipofectamine as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Generation of Antibodies—The following peptides (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1) were used to generate antisera: μ, 14SDPLAPASCSPA25 for SA25 and 5G8 and 52GSHSLCPQTGSPS64 for NT1 and 3D6; δ, 3LVPSARAELQSSPLV17 for LV17; α2A, 15GTEAPGGGTRATPYS29 for GS29; CB1, 27DIQYEDIKGDMASKL41 for DL41; β2, 17SRAPDHDVTQE27 for SE27; AT1, 3SSTEDGIKRI12 for LK12 antibodies. These regions were chosen with the help of ExPASy software so as to exclude regions containing predicted N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The peptides were subjected to a Blast search of the mouse NCBI data base to ensure that they represent unique sequences (<10% overlap). These peptides were synthesized, on a polylysine backbone, as multiple antigenic peptides (MAPs) by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Antisera to μ (SA25 and NT1), δ (LV17), α2A (GS29), or CB1 (DL41) MAPs were generated in rats and to β2 (SE27) or AT1 (LK12) MAPs in rabbits using a standard protocol (24Fujisawa Y. Furukawa Y. Ohta S. Ellis T.A. Dembrow N.C. Li L. Floyd P.D. Sweedler J.V. Minakata H. Nakamaru K. Morishita F. Matsushima O. Weiss K.R. Vilim F.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9618-9634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal Abs to μ (5G8 and 3D6) MAPs were generated in mice as described previously (25Gomes I. Gupta A. Singh S.P. Sharma S.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These antibodies are highly receptor-specific, since they exhibit low cross-reactivity against other closely related receptors, as examined using a whole cell ELISA (described below) with COS cells expressing the various receptors indicated above. Specificity of the antisera was also examined using an antigen depletion assay, where a 1 mm concentration of the specific MAP or an unrelated MAP (CB1 receptor MAP was used as a nonspecific peptide for SA25, LV17, GS29, SE27, and LK12 antibodies, whereas α2A receptor MAP was used as a non-specific peptide for DL41 antibody) was incubated with 10 μgof Abs for 24 h (4 °C) prior to incubation with cells. Western Blot Analysis—Membranes were prepared from CHO cells or from those stably expressing μ-or δ-opioid receptors (26Gomes I. Filipovska J. Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Methods. 2003; 27: 358-365Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Membranes (15 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis using a 1:1000 dilution of SA25 antiserum or SA25 antiserum preabsorbed (10 mg/ml) with the specific peptide used to generate this antiserum and a 1:15,000 dilution of IR Dye 800CW anti-rat IgG. Blots were visualized using the Odyssey Imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Effect of Ligand Treatment on Receptor Recognition by Abs—CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged μ receptors, COS cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged μ-or δ-opioid, α2A- or β2-adrenergic, CB1 cannabinoid, or AT1 angiotensin receptors, or SKNSH cells (endogenously expressing these receptors) were plated on poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). The next day, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated without or with 8–10 doses of ligands in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, or in isotonic HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES containing 300 mm sucrose and 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C (in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). There is no significant receptor internalization under these conditions 3A. Gupta, I. Gomes, and L. A. Devi, unpublished observations. due to a lack of K+ and Ca+2 ions, which are required for receptor internalization. Cells were quickly rinsed three times (within 5 min) with cold PBS (washing with 20 μm antagonist in PBS produced similar results) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at –20 °C. This treatment was included to help reduce cell loss during multiple washings as determined by protein estimation or recognition by FLAG Ab. We do not observe any significant differences in receptor recognition by SA25 antiserum or FLAG monoclonal Ab in CHO-μ cells that were subjected or not to methanol fixation (0.29 ± 0.01 without and 0.35 ± 0.04 with methanol fixation for SA25 Ab and 0.22 ± 0.01 without and 0.23 ± 0.01 with methanol fixation for FLAG Ab). ELISA was carried out by incubating cells with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of primary antisera in 1% BSA in PBS. The wells were then washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS (5 min each wash) followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with 1:500 dilution (in 1% BSA in PBS) of secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The wells were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS (5 min each wash), and color was developed by the addition of the substrate, o-phenylenediamine (5 mg/10 ml in 0.15 m citrate buffer, pH 5, containing 15 μlofH2O2). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a Bio-Rad ELISA reader. We do not see a difference in the levels of protein at the end of the assay (197 ± 8 and 197 ± 7 μg/well, respectively, for SA25 and FLAG Ab). For screening compounds (Table 2), CHO-μ cells (1 × 105) were plated on 96-well Nunc-Immuno™ plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY), air-dried at room temperature. The wells were washed with PBS, incubated without or with ligands for 30 min at 37 °C. The extent of receptor recognition by the SA25 Ab was assayed by ELISA as described above.TABLE 2Screening of μ ligands using anti-μ (SA25) antibodyμ ligandsAb bindingGTPγS binding12EC50EmaxEC50Emaxm% controlm% controlEndo-12.35 × 10-8230 ± 11ap < 0.0001 (n = 3-5).NDNDEndo-28.00 × 10-10196 ± 25ap < 0.0001 (n = 3-5).NDNDDAMGO1.49 × 10-9161 ± 8.2ap < 0.0001 (n = 3-5).13 × 10-9176 ± 2.1ap < 0.0001 (n = 3-5).Methadone2.00 × 10-9167 ± 1ap < 0.0001 (n = 3-5).42 × 10-9169 ± 2.2bp < 0.001 (n = 3-5).Biphalin6.85 × 10-8165 ± 5bp < 0.001 (n = 3-5).NDNDFentanyl1.64 × 10-8158 ± 5bp < 0.001 (n = 3-5).19 × 10-9160 ± 6.8bp < 0.001 (n = 3-5).Super DALDA3.06 × 10-9153 ± 1cp < 0.01 (n = 3-5).NDNDMet-enk1.72 × 10-9151 ± 1cp < 0.01 (n = 3-5).NDNDMeperidine9.50 × 10-9149 ± 3cp < 0.01 (n = 3-5).NDNDβ-Endorphin7.93 × 10-9145 ± 1cp < 0.01 (n = 3-5).NDNDMorphine3.45 × 10-8141 ± 3cp < 0.01 (n = 3-5).52 × 10-9149 ± 4.6cp < 0.01 (n = 3-5).Naltrexone>10-6120 ± 1NDNDCTOP>10-6111 ± 6NDNDCTAP>10-6108 ± 4NDNDNaloxone>10-6107 ± 9NDNDa p < 0.0001 (n = 3-5).b p < 0.001 (n = 3-5).c p < 0.01 (n = 3-5). Open table in a new tab Flow Cytometry—Cells (3 × 105/well) were plated onto a 24-well plate. After 48 h, the wells were treated with or without 1 μm [d-Ala2,NMe-Phe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, or 1 μm morphine in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The extent of cell surface receptor recognition was determined using receptor-specific antiserum and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse/anti-rat IgG (1:400 in 50% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C) as described previously (27Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Bansinath M. Devi L.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells remaining in the tubes following fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis were routinely examined under the microscope to check for cell lysis. Effect of Peptide:N-glycanase on Antibody Recognition—CHO cells stably expressing μ-opioid receptors (2 × 105) plated on 24-well plates were incubated with or without 1 μm DAMGO in the absence or presence of peptide:N-glycanase F (40 units) for 3 h at 37°C in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5. Cells were quickly washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at –20 °C. The extent of antibody recognition was monitored by ELISA using either SA25, 5G8, NT1, or 3D6 antibodies as described earlier. Studies with Endogenous Receptors—Membranes (1 μg/well) from C57BL/6 mice brain cortex were coated overnight on a high binding 96-well ELISA plate (Fisher). The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated without or with 8–10 doses of ligands in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Membranes were quickly rinsed three times (within 5 min) with cold PBS; washing with 20 μm antagonist in PBS produced similar results. Wells were treated with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at –20 °C, and the extent of receptor recognition by Abs was assayed by ELISA as described above. Specificity of the antisera in endogenous tissue was determined using the antigen-depleted antisera; these gave a signal that was 10–20% that of sera undepleted or treated with unrelated peptide (supplemental Table 4). To examine the effect of modulators of G-protein activity, cortical membranes (10 μg) were pretreated with a 100 μm concentration of either GTPγS, GPP(NH)p, AlF3, or NaF for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). This was followed by a 30-min treatment with 1 μm DAMGO, and the extent of Ab recognition was assayed by ELISA as described above. The pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml) pretreatment was carried out overnight at 37 °C; the protease inhibitor mixture was used to protect membrane proteins, including receptors, from degradation. The effect of membrane incubation at 37 °C on receptor integrity was measured by ligand binding in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture using [3H]diprenorphine as described (23Gomes I. Gupta A. Filipovska J. Szeto H.H. Pintar J.E. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The receptor binding following overnight incubation was 97.2 ± 4.8% of that observed following 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, indicating that under these conditions, no significant loss of receptor binding was observed. In Vivo Receptor Activation Studies on Brain Sections—Four-month-old male C57BL/6 mice (3–5/group) or μ –/– animals and age-matched sex-matched littermate controls (3–5/group) were injected intraperitoneally with either 10 mg/kg morphine, 10 mg/kg morphine plus 10 mg/kg naloxone, or saline and sacrificed 30 min later or at the indicated times. Brains were dissected and frozen at –80 °C until use. The brains were embedded in M-1 embedding matrix (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA), and 10-μm serial sections were cut using a MICROM HM 560 CryoStar (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Areas representing the prefrontal cortex (3.0-2.58 mm; Bregma), striatum (1.5-1 mm; Bregma), or cerebellum (–5.6 to –6.5 mm; Bregma) were collected; at least 10 sections from each animal were probed. Two sections from each region were placed on Fisher Superfrost Plus slides and circled immediately with an ImmEdge PAP pen (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to form a waterproof barrier; the resulting wells held ∼200 μl. ELISA was performed in these wells using a 1:500 dilution of primary antiserum and 1:500 dilution of secondary antibodies. The reaction product was transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a Bio-Rad ELISA reader. Detection of Agonist-induced Conformational Changes in the N Terminus of μ-Opioid Receptors—Studies with rhodopsin indicate that the N-terminal region undergoes conformational changes following receptor activation. This suggests that antisera directed against this region of family A GPCRs should be able to distinguish between inactive and activated receptors. In order to see if a similar strategy could be applied to μ-opioid receptors, we targeted the N-terminal domain and generated antibodies to a region proximal (SA25 antibodies) and a region distal to the N terminus (NT1 antibodies) (Fig. 1). These antibodies were characterized in cell lines stably (CHO-μ) or transiently (COS-μ) expressing recombinant μ receptors or expressing native receptors (SKNSH). In all cell lines, these antibodies specifically recognize μ receptors. There was no significant recognition in cells expressing either δ-opioid, CB1 cannabinoid, α2A-or β2-adrenergic, or AT1 angiotensin receptors (Table 1). The specificity of SA25 antisera was confirmed by Western blotting; a specific signal was observed with membranes from CHO cells expressing μ receptors and not from CHO cells alone or from CHO cells expressing δ receptors. Furthermore, when Western blotting was carried out with SA25 antiserum preabsorbed with the specific peptide used to generate the antiserum there was no signal (Fig. 1B), supporting the specificity of the antiserum. This was further supported by studies with membranes from animals lacking μ receptors (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). We examined if these antibodies were able to differentially recognize activated receptors by treating cells with the μ receptor-specific agonist, DAMGO. We find that this leads to a dose-dependent increase in receptor recognition by SA25 but not NT1 antibodies (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained upon treatment with morphine (not shown). The increase in recognition by SA25 antibodies does not occur upon treatment with the antagonist, naloxone, or unrelated peptide (Fig. 2). This increase in recognition following receptor activation was further explored by flow cytometry. We find that treatment with either DAMGO or morphine leads to a significant increase in the extent of staining by SA25 but not by NT1 antibodies (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the region recognized by the SA25 antibodies undergoes conformational changes following receptor activation, whereas the region recognized by the NT1 antibodies does not. To further explore this, we generated monoclonal Abs to peptides directed against these two regions and examined receptor recognition. We find that 5G8, a monoclonal Ab directed against the SA25 epitope, exhibits increased receptor recognition following treatment with agonists, whereas 3D6, a monoclonal Ab directed against the NT1 epitope, does not (Fig. 2). This was seen both in cells expressing recombinant and native receptors (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the increase in recognition by the antibodies is due to a conformational change leading to increased exposure of the region corresponding to the SA25 epitope but not of the region corresponding to the NT1 epitope (proximal to the first transmembrane domain). Taken together, these results suggest that the midregion of the N-terminal tail of μ-opioid receptors undergoes conformational changes following receptor activation.TABLE 1Specificity of μ-opioid receptor antibodiesCells expressing receptorsPercentage of Ab bindingμ-Opioidδ-OpioidCB1 cannabinoidα2A-Adrenergicβ2-AdrenergicAT1 angiotensin%%%%%%SA25100 ± 1.05.1 ± 4.17.1 ± 1.04.1 ± 1.05.1 ± 4.23.1 ± 2.0NT1100 ± 2.02.0 ± 2.00.0 ± 2.04.0 ± 2.06.0 ± 2.06.0 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab Role of G-protein Activity in Ab Recognition—We examined the role of G-protein activity in recognition by SA25 polyclonal or 5G8 monoclonal antibodies by pretreating cortical membranes with agents that uncouple G-proteins (GTPγS, GPP(NH)p, AlF3, NaF, or pertussis toxin) from the receptor. We find that this leads to an impairment of agonist-induced changes in receptor recognition by these antibodies (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the formation of a ternary agonist-receptor G-protein complex by itself is not able to trigger the change in conformation recognized by the antibody. These results suggest that conformational changes induced by postreceptor activation events could be important factors influencing conformational changes at the N-terminal region of μ receptors. Next, we characterized the increased antibody binding by examining the effect of deglycosylation on antibody recognition. We found that treatment with peptide:N-glycanase F abolished the increased recognition following receptor activation by both the SA25 polyclonal and 5G8 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3B). This, taken with the fact that peptide:N-glycanase treatment does not affect receptor recognition in the basal state, suggests that receptor glycosylation plays a role in the conformational switch that occurs at the N terminus upon receptor activation. Taken together, these results support the idea that these antibodies recognize changes in conformation at the N terminus following receptor activation. Screening of Ligands Using Conformation-sensitive Antibodies—Next, we examined if these antibodies can be used as a tool to screen and characterize specific ligands. For this, we set up a simple and rapid screening assay in a 96-well format and probed a series of μ ligands differing in their chemical and pharmacological properties; these included clinically relevant drugs, endogenous peptides, synthetic peptidic and nonpeptidic agonists, and antagonists (Table 2). We found a correlation between the extent of Ab receptor recognition and the reported efficacies of these ligands; morphine, a partial agonist with lower efficacy, exhibits a lower Emax compared with DAMGO, a highly potent full agonist that exhibits a higher Emax (Table 2). In order to further explore this, we carried out dose-response curves and compared the Ab binding properties with the signaling properties. We find a positive correlation between the Emax for Ab binding and that for GTPγS binding (Table 2). These results suggest that our conformation-sensitive Abs can be used to develop rapid and highly sensitive screening assays for the identification of novel small molecule ligands of therapeutic interest. Detection of Native μ Receptors in the Brain—Next, we examined the extent of recognition of the native receptors using membranes from different brain regions and probing them with SA25 antibodies.

Our findings with PvdI-Ga and PvdI-Cr uptake indicate that iron reduction is required for the dissociation of PvdI-Fe, that a ligand exchange for iron occurs, and that this dissociation occurs in the periplasm. We also observed a delay between PvdI-Fe dissociation and the rebinding of PvdI to FpvAI, underlining the kinetic independence of metal release and siderophore recycling. Meanwhile, PvdI is not modified but recycled to the medium, still competent for iron chelation and transport.

Iron is an essential element for the growth of the vast majority of microorganisms. Under aerobic conditions, the abundance of free iron is limited by the very low solubility of ferric hydroxide. Thus, to maintain the required intracellular levels of iron, bacteria and fungi have developed efficient ferric ion-chelating agents, called siderophores (1Boukhalfa H. Crumbliss A.L. Biometals. 2002; 15: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), to scavenge iron from the extracellular environment and import it.

Of these known Pvd transporters, only the structure of FpvAI has been solved, and its interactions with its siderophore PvdI have been studied using the fluorescent properties of this siderophore.

Previous studies using this technique have shown that in iron-starved P. aeruginosa cells, FpvAI is initially loaded with PvdI and that, in the first round of iron uptake, this bound PvdI dissociates from FpvAI, and PvdI-Fe from the extracellular medium takes its place on the transporter (21Schalk I.J.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 23Clément E. Mesini P.J. Pattus F. Abdallah M.A. Schalk I.J.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the ferric siderophore complexes are then transported into the cytoplasm by an ABC transporter (7Koster W. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Little is known about this step of iron acquisition in Pseudomonads. No ABC transporter has been identified for the PvdI/FpvAI pathway, and the cellular localization of the PvdI-Fe dissociation is unknown. However, we have previously utilized the efficient FRET between FpvAI and PvdI to show that after iron is released from the siderophore, the iron-free siderophore is recycled via an unknown mechanism to the cell surface, where it again binds to FpvAI (22Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Three mechanisms have been proposed that could explain how bacteria overcome the thermodynamic barrier of iron removal from siderophore ligands: ligand exchange, reduction of the iron, and hydrolysis of the siderophore. A reduction mechanism can be differentiated from ligand exchange by investigating the dissociation while substituting iron with a metal that has a similar ionic radius, the same charge, and the same coordination geometry (25Emery T. Hoffer P.B. J. Nucl. Med. 1980; 21: 935-939PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ecker D.J. Emery T. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 616-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cr(III) forms complexes with siderophores that are structurally similar to ferric siderophores but are kinetically inert to ligand substitution, whereas Ga(III) forms complexes with siderophores that are kinetically labile, and exchange with other ligands occurs readily (25Emery T. Hoffer P.B. J. Nucl. Med. 1980; 21: 935-939PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ecker D.J. Emery T. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 616-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, gallium has no stable (II) oxidation state, so the metal cannot be removed from the ligand by reduction. To investigate the fate of PvdI-Fe in P. aeruginosa after transport across the outer membrane by FpvAI, we combined the FRET technique, fluorescence microscopy, and the use of PvdI-Ga and PvdI-Cr complexes. We found that neither PvdI-Cr nor Pvd-Ga could be dissociated by iron-starved P. aeruginosa, despite the fact the Pvd-Ga is efficiently transported across that outer membrane, where it accumulates in the periplasm. No recycling of PvdI to the extracellular medium was detected for either Pvd-Cr or Pvd-Ga. This suggests that reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and a ligand exchange are necessary for the complete release of the metal from PvdI. We have also shown that iron release does not involve a permanent chemical modification of PvdI; the siderophore is recycled to the extracellular medium unmodified and fully functional. Finally, fluorescence microscopy showed that there is no accumulation of PvdI-Ga in the cytoplasm, further evidence that the PvdI-metal complex dissociates in the periplasm immediately after its uptake. Chemicals—Carbenicillin disodium salt was a generous gift from SmithKline Beecham (Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK). Carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and sodium N-lauroylsarcosine were purchased from Sigma, and oPOE (n-octylpolyoxyethylene) was from Bachem. PvdIs were prepared as described previously for PvdI and PvdI-Fe (2Albrecht-Gary A.M. Blanc S. Rochel N. Ocacktan A.Z. Abdallah M.A. Inorg.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Baterial Strains and Growth Media—Three mutants were used: CDC5(pPVR2), which overproduces FpvAI and is PvdI-deficient (29Ankenbauer R. Hanne L.F. Cox C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 7-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), K691(pPVR2), which overproduces FpvAI and produces PvdI (30Poole K. Neshat S. Krebes K. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4597-4604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the PvdI- and Pch-deficient strain PAD07 (31Takase H. Nitanai H. Hoshino K. Otani T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The strains were grown overnight in a succinate medium (27Demange P. Wendenbaum S. Linget C. Mertz C. Cung M.T. Dell A. Abdallah M.A. Biol. Metals. 1990; 3: 155-170Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in the presence of 150 μg/ml carbenicillin for CDC5(pPVR2) and K691(pPVR2) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml tetracycline for PAD07. Image Acquisition—CDC5(pPVR2) cells growing in succinate medium were incubated with or without siderophore, washed once with siderophore-free buffer, and then mounted onto S750-agarose-coated slides, as described previously (32Mascarenhas J. Soppa J. Strunnikov A.V. Graumann P.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3108-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on an Olympus AX70 microscope with a MicroMax CCD camera using 100-ms exposures. Images were captured using MetaMorph 6.0 (Universal Imaging). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence experiments were performed on K691(pPVR2) or CDC5(pPVR2) cells with a PTI (Photon Technology International TimeMaster; Bioritech) spectrofluorometer. For all experiments, the sample was stirred at 29 °C in a 1-ml cuvette, the excitation wavelength (λex) was set at 290 nm (for the FRET experiments) or 400 nm (for direct excitation), and the emission of fluorescence (λem) was measured at 447 nm. The cells were washed with 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspended in the same buffer to a final A600 of 2. PvdI-Fe, PvdI-Ga, PvdI-Cr, or PvdI was added, and the fluorescence at 447 nm was measured every 300 ms for the duration of the experiment. As a control, the same experiments were repeated in the absence of the siderophore, and an analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed the same amount of FpvAI in K691(pPVR2) cells as in CDC5(pPVR2) cells (21Schalk I.J. Hennard C. Dugave C. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Preparation of Periplasmic, Cytoplasmic, Inner Membrane, and Outer Membrane Fractions—CDC5(pPVR2) cells were grown in 50 ml of succinate medium to an A600 of 1, at which time 600 nm PvdI-Ga or PvdI-Fe was added. After 30 min, the transport was complete based on aliquots that were removed for fluorescence measurements, The cells were pelleted at 6000 × g, and the pellet was gently rinsed with water and then resuspended in 3 ml of 20% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0. After 2 min at ambient temperature, with the integrity of the bacterial outer membrane compromised, osmotic shock was achieved by the rapid addition of 4.5 ml of ice-cold water followed by gentle mixing by inversion. After 2 min on ice, the periplasmic fraction was separated from the cells by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. The pellet, which was firm and showing no signs of lysis, was gently rinsed with water and then resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the cytoplasmic fraction was separated from the insoluble material at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The inner membrane was extracted from the pellet with 20 ml of 1% sodium N-lauroylsarcosine in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by a second 100,000 × g spin. The outer membrane was extracted from the resulting pellet with 2% n-octylpolyoxyethylene in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by a final high speed centrifugation. The fluorescence intensity (λex = 400 nm, λem = 450 nm) was measured for each fraction, and the appropriate dilution factors were applied to the measurements so that all reported intensities represent the total fluorescence from the same volume of the initial cultures. Characterization of the Recycled PvdI—CDC5(pPVR2) cells at an A600 of 2 were incubated in the presence of 300 nm PvdI-Fe at 30 °C in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer. Iron uptake was followed in parallel in 1 ml of the mixture by excitation at 290 nm and monitoring the emission of fluorescence at 447 nm as described above. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were pelleted, and the supernatant containing the recycled PvdI was used for the following experiments. The pH of 1 ml of the supernatant (containing the recycled PvdI) was adjusted to 4 with AcOH. 10 μl of 3 μm FeCl3 was added, the sample was incubated for 5 min, and then the fluorescence emission was monitored (λex = 400 nm). The additions of 10 μl of 3 μm FeCl3 were repeated until there was no more fluorescence at 447 nm. For the transport assay, a 1-ml aliquot of this supernatant was incubated with 30 nm 55FeCl3 for 10 min. The mixture was then added to PAD07 cells prepared at an A600 of 1 in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer. After 1, 15, and 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 100-μl aliquots were removed and filtered. The filters were washed and counted. This experiment was repeated with the incubations at 0 °C. Dissociation of Iron from PvdI and PvdI Recycling on FpvAI Are Kinetically Independent Steps—The typical fluorescence signal for iron uptake via PvdI in P. aeruginosa, when excited at 290 nm and monitored at 447 nm, displays two steps: a decrease of fluorescence corresponding to the formation of FpvAI-PvdI-Fe upon the addition of PvdI-Fe and a subsequent increase corresponding to the recycling of PvdI on FpvAI (formation of FpvAI-PvdIrecy) (Fig. 1). During the second step, the fluorescence always returned to exactly the same level as that before the addition of PvdI-Fe, indicating that all of the FpvAI receptors were loaded again with iron-free recycled PvdI. This could be the result of efficient recycling of PvdI to the media and rebinding to FpvAI or a mechanism in which the release of the metal from the siderophore occurs on FpvAI. The second possibility implies that the PvdI would never detach from the FpvAI receptor to enter the cells. If this were case, the increase of fluorescence in Fig. 1 (recycling on FpvA) would correspond to the dissociation of iron from the siderophore while still bound to FpvAI. We tested the possibility of a PvdI-Fe dissociation on FpvAI. PvdI-deficient CDC5(pPVR2) cells were incubated with PvdI-Fe, and the fluorescence was recorded at 447 nm with excitation wavelengths of 290 nm (FRET) and 400 nm (direct excitation) (Fig. 2A). When PvdI-deficient CDC5(pPVR2) cells are excited at 290 or 400 nm, no FRET occurs, and no fluorescence is observed at 447 nm because no PvdI is produced (22Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, after the addition of PvdI-Fe, the binding of PvdI-Fe to empty FpvAI does not produce any FRET signal. Therefore, with CDC5(pPVR2), only the dissociation of PvdI-Fe (formation of fluorescent PvdI) will produce a fluorescence signal, whereas the recycling of PvdI on FpvAI will be the only source of FRET. In this manner, the dissociation of iron from PvdI was followed with the λex = 400 nm, whereas the recycling of PvdI on FpvA was simultaneously followed with λex = 290 nm. If PvdI releases the iron while bound to FpvAI, then the fluorescence signal corresponding to PvdI-Fe dissociation should superimpose with that of the PvdI recycling on FpvAI. There was a lag of about 3 min between the signals, suggesting that PvdI-Fe dissociates inside the cells, before recycling of PvdI on FpvAI (formation of FpvAI-PvdIrecy). CDC5(pPVR2) cells were also incubated in the presence of metal-free PvdI, and in this case the formation of FpvAI-PvdI started immediately after the addition of the siderophore, with no lag (Fig. 2A) (23Clément E. Mesini P.J. Pattus F. Abdallah M.A. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CDC5(pPVR2) cells were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of PvdI-Fe and the formation of free PvdI (Fig. 2B, λex = 400 nm) and of FpvAI-PvdIrecy complex (Fig. 2C, λex = 290 nm) was followed. The kinetics of PvdI-Fe dissociation and of FpvAI-PvdIrecy formation were independent of the initial PvdI-Fe concentration. However, as expected, there was a direct relationship between the PvdI-Fe concentration and the yield of PvdI and of FpvAI-PvdIrecy. Also of interest was that the delay before formation of FpvAI-PvdIrecy was proportional to the initial concentration of PvdI-Fe; the higher the concentration of PvdI-Fe, the longer the delay before the onset of formation of FpvAI-PvdIrecy (Fig. 2C, inset). PvdI-Cr Is an Antagonist of the FpvAI/PvdI System—Chromium forms complexes with siderophores that are structurally similar to siderophore-Fe but are inert to ligand exchange (33Leong J. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 823-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if the PvdI-Fe dissociation mechanism involves ligand exchange with another molecule or protein, PvdI-Cr will not be able to act as metal donor in a ligand exchange mechanism, and the transport will be inhibited. We have previously shown that the PvdI-Cr complex binds to FpvAI with a 10-fold lower affinity than that of PvdI-Fe, and since PvdI-Cr is a nonfluorescent complex, no FRET occurs upon binding of PvdI-Cr to FpvAI (22Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When K691(pPVR2) (FpvAI+, PvdI+) cells were incubated with various concentrations of PvdI-Cr, a TonB-dependent decrease of fluorescence was observed corresponding to displacement of PvdI during the formation of FpvAI-PvdI-Cr; however, there was no subsequent recycling of PvdI on FpvAI (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, no PvdI-Cr dissociation (formation of metal-free PvdI) was detected with λex = 400 nm (Fig. 3C). Thus, PvdI-Cr acts as an antagonist of the PvdI iron uptake pathway in P. aeruginosa, implicating ligand exchange for the iron ion in the PvdI-Fe dissociation mechanism. PvdI-Ga Is Efficiently Transported and Accumulates in the Periplasm—A ligand exchange mechanism for PvdI-Fe dissociation does not exclude a requirement for ferric iron reduction to its lower affinity ferrous species. PvdI-Ga was used to investigate this possibility, since Ga(III) has no stable (II) oxidation state and therefore cannot be removed from the siderophore by reduction. Siderophore-Ga complexes are kinetically labile, exchange with other ligands occurs readily (25Emery T. Hoffer P.B. J. Nucl. Med. 1980; 21: 935-939PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ecker D.J. Emery T. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 616-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Ga(III) is the closest ion to the ferric ion in size and ligand coordination. Therefore, PvdI-Ga should act as an antagonist of the iron uptake via PvdI only if reduction is involved in the PvdI-metal dissociation process. We have shown previously that PvdI-Ga has a Ki of 16 nm for FpvAI and is transported into P. aeruginosa (28Folschweiller N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14591-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since PvdI-Ga is also fluorescent but with about a 2-fold higher quantum yield than PvdI, the removal of gallium from PvdI-Ga would result in a reduction in fluorescence intensity (28Folschweiller N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14591-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, there is a large FRET signal when Pvd-Ga binds to FpvAI. We incubated PvdI-deficient CDC5(pPVR2) cells in the presence of 75 nm PvdI-Ga or PvdI-Fe, and dissociation of the metal from the siderophore was monitored by the emission of fluorescence at 447 nm (λex = 400 nm) (Fig. 4). The addition of the fluorescent PvdI-Ga complex causes an immediate jump in the fluorescence, followed by a decrease of fluorescence that could correspond to PvdI-Ga dissociation (28Folschweiller N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14591-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in P. aeruginosa cells. When compared with the kinetic of PvdI-Fe dissociation (Fig. 4), the plateau for PvdI-Ga fluorescence was reached after 4 min (10 min for PvdI-Fe) and was of a higher fluorescence. This means that either differing amounts of metal-free PvdI were liberated in both experiments or that something else, such as an incomplete dissociation of PvdI-Ga, modulated the Pvd-Ga fluorescence. To further investigate whether PvdI-Ga can dissociate in P. aeruginosa cells, we monitored the recycling of PvdI into the extracellular medium during PvdI-Ga uptake. PvdI-deficient CDC5(pPVR2) cells were incubated in the presence of 600 nm Pvd-Fe, PvdI-Ga, or PvdI-Cr (Fig. 5A). Aliquots were removed at various times, the cells were pelleted, and the quantity of PvdI or PvdI-Ga was measured in the extracellular medium (λex = 400 nm and λem = 447 nm). Efficient recycling of the siderophore to the extracellular medium was observed for PvdIFe, as described previously (22Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and as expected, no recycling of PvdI-Cr was detected. However, PvdI-Ga was nearly depleted from the media at about the same rate as the recycling of PvdI from PvdI-Fe (Fig. 5A). If PvdI-Fe and PvdI-Ga were transported by P. aeruginosa with the same kinetics and mechanism, then the same amount of fluorescent PvdI would be recycled from both complexes, and a plateau of equivalent fluorescence would be reached. However, PvdI from PvdI-Ga was not recycled as it is from PvdI-Fe, so it must therefore remain associated with the bacteria (Fig. 5A). After the uptake of the PvdI-Fe and PvdI-Ga complexes, we measured the amount of fluorescent PvdI or PvdI-Ga in the periplasm, cytoplasm, and inner and outer membranes to determine where the PvdI-Ga was localized (Fig. 5B). The majority of PvdI-Ga remained in the periplasm, apparently trapped and unable to be recycled to the extracellular medium. After PvdI-Fe uptake, there was less PvdI in the periplasm than in the case of PvdI-Ga due to the efficient recycling of PvdI. The remaining fluorescence in the extracellular medium and outer membrane (Fig. 5B) may reflect an equilibrium at these unnaturally high levels of Pvd-metal complexes or similarly an overloading of the PvdI transport pathway as would be consistent with the previously observed saturation of FpvAI at 450 nm PvdI-Fe (22Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the observed partitioning of Pvd-Ga into the periplasmic fraction was not due to an inefficient fractionation procedure, samples from all four cell fractions were analyzed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE and visualized by both silver and Coomassie staining (Fig. 5C). The Tricine buffer system allowed the clear visualization of peptides down to 10 kDa, revealing a unique staining pattern for each fraction with no visible contamination of small peptides from the cytoplasm in the periplasm. Furthermore, the large difference in Pvd-Ga concentration observed in each fraction is not likely to originate from a minor contamination during the cell fractionation. P. aeruginosa imported PvdI-Ga with a similar kinetic to PvdI-Fe (Fig. 5A); however, the PvdI-Ga accumulated in the periplasm (Fig. 5B) instead of being recycled to the media. Our findings are consistent with an incomplete dissociation of PvdI-Ga (kinetic in Fig. 4), such that the siderophore is unable to be recycled in the extracellular medium. A reduction of Fe(III), thereby lowering PvdI affinity for iron, appears to be required for a complete and efficient release of the metal from PvdI in vivo. Recycled PvdI Is Able to Chelate Iron and to Start a New Iron Uptake Cycle—Siderophore-iron dissociation in Gram-negative bacteria could also involve hydrolysis of the siderophore to overcome the high affinity for iron. Recycled PvdI has the same spectral properties as PvdI extracted from P. aeruginosa cultures (22Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that the chromophore is not modified by the bacteria. To test whether the peptide moiety is modified, particularly the two formylhydroxy-ornithines involved in the metal coordination, the ability of PvdIrecy to chelate iron was investigated. PvdIrecy was incubated with stoichiometric amounts of FeCl3, and formation of PvdIrecy-Fe was observed by the decrease in fluorescence (λex = 400 nm, λem = 447 nm). After confirming that PvdIrecy was able to chelate iron efficiently (Fig. 6), we then loaded PvdIrecy with 55Fe and demonstrated that it was able to transport iron i"

These studies suggest that curcumin can modulate tumor formation in vivo, as well as, the proliferation of epidermisderived established cell lines. However, few studies have examined the impact of curcumin treatment on the function of normal human keratinocytes (18Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24007-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Efimova T. Balasubramanian S. Mol. Nutr.

In the present report, we examine the effect of curcumin on human keratinocyte differentiation using involucrin as a marker of differentiation. Involucrin is expressed in the suprabasal layers in epidermis (20Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 21Eckert R.L.

Dermatol. 2004; 123: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because of its differentiation-dependent pattern of expression and because the mechanisms that regulate involucrin expression are well understood (21Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Efimova T. Dashti S.R.

Dermatol. 2004; 123: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the involucrin gene provides an ideal model for understanding the mechanisms whereby chemopreventive agents regulate skin differentiation. We also examine the impact of curcumin treatment on keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Our results suggest that curcumin treatment inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and TPA-dependent activation of involucrin gene expression and enhances keratinocyte apoptosis. The curcumin-dependent suppression of differentiation is associated with reduced AP1 factor expression and DNA binding. A unique observation of these studies is the finding that curcumin suppresses expression of all AP1 factors, suggesting it produces profound changes in AP1-mediated end responses. Moreover, these findings are particularly interesting, because they contrast the mechanism of action of curcumin from that of other chemopreventive agents (18Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, including donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934) and sheep anti-mouse IgG (NA931), were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Tissue Culture, Cell Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Primary keratinocytes from human foreskin were cultured as described (24Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Sixty percent confluent cultures of normal human keratinocytes, maintained in 35-mm dishes, were used for transfection. Fugene-6 reagent (4 μl) was added to 96 μl of KSFM, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The mixture was then mixed with 2 μg of involucrin promoter reporter plasmid or, for co-transfection experiments, with 1 μg of involucrin reporter plasmid, and 1 μg of kinase expression plasmid. The mixture was then incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and added directly to the cells in 2 ml of KSFM. In general, the final plasmid concentration in all groups was adjusted to 2 μg of DNA per 4 μl of Fugene-6 reagent per 35-mm dish by addition of empty expression vector. Keratinocytes were treated with KSFM in the presence or absence of TPA or the indicated concentration of curcumin beginning 24 h after transfection. After an additional 24 h, the cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using Promega luciferase assay. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Luciferase activity was normalized per microgram of protein. Transfection efficiency was determined using a green fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid (Clontech). Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Seventy percent confluent human keratinocytes were treated with 50 ng/ml TPA in the absence or presence of 20 μm curcumin. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (#9803, Cell Signaling), and equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed on acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk solution, incubated with the primary antibody, washed, and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence detection reagents were used to detect the specific secondary antibody binding. Gel Mobility Shift and Supershift Analysis—The gel mobility shift and gel mobility supershift assays utilizing the doublestranded, 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide, 5′-TGTGGTGAGTCAGGAAGGGGTT, and were performed as previously described (24Welter J.F.

This sequence matches the hINV gene sequence, and the API-1 site is underlined. Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Analysis—Keratinocytes, maintained in 35-mm dishes in KSFM, were treated for 4 days with KSFM containing TPA in the absence or presence of curcumin. Fresh medium and treatment agent were added after 2 days. The cells were then harvested with Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 0.025% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, and the cell number was determined using a Coulter counter. For cell cycle analysis, 60% confluent cultures were treated with KSFM or KSFM supplemented with 50 ng of TPA/ml or 20 μm curcumin. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in methanol, and stained with propidium iodide prior to flow cytometric analysis (25Balasubramanian S. Chandraratna R.A. Eckert R.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4257-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fra-1 and JunB Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Subconfluent keratinocytes cultures were treated without or with 20 μm curcumin. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein lysate (100 μg of protein) was incubated with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal Fra-1 or JunB antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose (25 μl) was then added to the samples followed by overnight mixing at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis using a mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-8017). Proteasome Activity Assay—Subconfluent keratinocyte cultures, maintained in 35-mm dishes, were treated with 20 μm curcumin prior to preparation of total cell extracts according the manufacturer’s instructions (Proteasome Activity kit APT280, Chemicon International). Briefly, 50 μg of cell lysate was incubated in assay buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.001% SDS, and 25 μg of the proteasome substrate, LLVY-AMC, for 90 min at 37 °C. Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring release of the fluorescent LLVY-AMC cleavage product, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Curcumin Is a Potent Inhibitor of TPA-induced hINV Gene Expression—We first examined the impact of curcumin treatment on the TPA-dependent increase in hINV gene promoter activity using pINV-2473, a plasmid that encodes the full length of hINV upstream regulatory region and TATA box linked to the luciferase reporter gene (24Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were transfected with pINV-2473 and then treated for 24 h with TPA and/or curcumin. As shown in Fig. 1A, an 8-fold increase in pINV-2473 activity was observed in the TPA-treated cells. Incubation of TPA-treated cells with increasing concentrations of curcumin resulted in a curcumin concentration-dependent reduction in promoter activity. Basal and TPA-responsive promoter activity was increased at intermediate curcumin concentrations, but activity was inhibited at curcumin concentrations ≥15 μm. We next monitored the impact of curcumin treatment on endogenous hINV levels. Fig. 1B shows that TPA treatment increased hINV levels by 2.5-fold; however, addition of 20 μm curcumin completely suppressed this response. These findings suggest that curcumin influences endogenous hINV levels by regulating hINV promoter activity. Curcumin Action Is Mediated via an AP1 Factor Binding Site—To identify the DNA binding site responsible for curcumin action we examined a series of hINV promoter truncation mutants. The proximal regulatory region (nucleotides -241/-7) of the hINV gene promoter is known to encode key regulatory elements (24Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, curcumin treatment suppressed the TPA-dependent increase in pINV-241 and pINV-128 activity. However, neither TPA nor curcumin regulated the activity of constructs pINV-110 and pINV-41, indicating that the key regulatory region is located in the -128/-110 segment, which encodes the AP1-1 site (Fig. 2A). To identify the actual regulatory site, we monitored the impact of curcumin treatment on activity of constructs encoding point mutations at the AP1 and EBS-2 sites. As shown in Fig. 2B, TPA treatment increased pINV-241 and pINV-241(EBS-2m) activity, and this response was suppressed by curcumin treatment. We have previously shown that the EBS-2 site functions as a general repressor of transcription (26Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); therefore, it is not surprising that mutation of this site increased overall promoter activity but did not alter the curcumin-associated response. In contrast, mutation of the AP1-1 site resulted in a loss of response, suggesting that the AP1-1 site is required for this regulation. Curcumin Inhibits Novel PKC-dependent hINV Promoter Activity—TPA activates hINV gene expression via a signaling cascade that includes novel PKC, Ras, MEKK1, and MEK3, which regulates activity of the p38δ-ERK1/2 complex (26Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31753-31760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of curcumin action, we tested the ability of curcumin to inhibit pINV-241 promoter activation induced by overexpression of the novel PKC isoforms (PKCδ,-ε, and -η,), constitutively active Ras, and wild-type MEKK1. As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of the novel PKC isoforms caused an increase in promoter activity that was inhibited by curcumin treatment. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3B, promoter activation, following treatment with constitutively active Ras (RasG12V) or wild-type MEKK1, was also inhibited by treatment with curcumin. Curcumin Inhibits TPA-dependent AP1 Factor Function—The above experiments, using the hINV promoter mutants, suggest that the AP1-1 site, which is located in the proximal regulatory region of hINV upstream regulatory region, is required for curcumin-dependent regulation. To assess the impact of curcumin treatment on AP1 factor function, we determined whether curcumin influences AP1 factor level and/or AP1 factor binding to the AP1-1 site. Nuclear extracts, prepared from untreated and TPA- or curcumin-treated kerat-inocytes, were incubated with trace amounts of 32P-labeled AP1-1 site-encoding oligonucleotide ([32P]AP1-1). It is important to note that the composition of AP1 factors bound at this site does not change in control versus TPA-treated cells (24Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, in the absence of nuclear extract, the free probe migrated at the gel front (FP). Addition of nuclear extract resulted in reduced migration, indicative of [32P]AP1-1 interaction with nuclear proteins. Extracts prepared from untreated and curcumin-treated cultures displayed a similar level of binding to [32P]AP1-1. However, there was a substantial increase in protein-associated [32P]AP1-1 in extracts prepared from TPA-treated cells. It is of considerable interest that this level was decreased to basal levels in TPA/curcumin-treated cells. Fig. 4B shows that the protein interaction was specific, because binding was competed by non-radioactive AP1-1, but not by the DNA sequence encoding an Sp1 transcription factor binding site (Sp1c). Previous studies indicate that JunB and Fra-1 interact at the AP1-1 site (24Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of curcumin treatment on this interaction, we performed gel mobility supershift analysis. Fig. 4C confirms that JunB and Fra-1 interacted at the AP1-1 site in TPA-treated cells and that treatment with curcumin plus TPA resulted in a substantial reduction in this interaction. The reduction in Fra-1/JunB-[32P]AP1-1 interaction, in the presence of curcumin, could be caused by a reduction in AP1 factor expression. To assess this possibility, we prepared total nuclear extracts and monitored the level of each of the AP1 family members by immunoblot. This analysis revealed a marked increase in c-Jun, junB, junD, Fra-1, Fra-2, and fosB levels in the TPA-treated cells and a suppression of this increase in the presence of curcumin (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Curcumin suppresses the TPA-dependent increase in AP1 factor levels. A, keratinocytes were treated with the indicated agents for 24 h prior to preparation of nuclear extracts. The nuclear extracts were electrophoresed on a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel and then incubated with specific AP1 factor-specific antibodies and secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescent detection reagents were used to detect secondary antibody binding. B, inhibition of proteasome function reduces the curcumin-dependent suppression of Fra-1 and Jun B levels. Near-confluent human epi-dermal keratinocytes were treated for 24 h with KSFM (control) or KSFM supplemented with 20 μm curcumin in the presence or absence of 40 μm MG132. Nuclear extracts were then prepared for detection of Fra-1 and JunB levels by immunoblot. Similar results were observed in each of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Role of Proteasome Activity—We previously reported that curcumin-dependent suppression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ levels in human keratinocytes requires proteasome function (18Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24007-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess whether the curcumin-associated reduction in AP1 factor level requires proteasome function, cells were treated with curcumin or TPA in the presence or absence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Our results clearly demonstrate that the curcumin-dependent reduction in Fra-1 and JunB level is reversed by treatment with MG132, indicating that the curcumin-dependent response requires proteasome activity (Fig. 5B). To determine whether Fra-1 and JunB are targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation following curcumin treatment, total cell extracts from curcumin-treated keratinocytes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fra-1 or anti-JunB. The precipitated complex was then electrophoresed for immunoblot detection of ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 6A, curcumin treatment caused a substantial increase in the level of ubiquitinated Fra-1 and JunB. This increase is particularly evident at 16 and 24 h following curcumin treatment. To compare this increase to the overall change in ubiquitination, the level of ubiquitinated protein was monitored in total cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 6B, an increase in ubiquitination was observed as early as 2 h after initiation of curcumin treatment. However, the increase was modest compared with the increase in JunB and Fra-1 ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 6C, the increase in Fra-1 and JunB ubiquitination occurred in parallel with a reduction in Fra-1 and JunB protein levels. We also monitored proteasome activity using a synthetic proteasome substrate, LLVY-AMC. We observed a 15 ± 3% (n = 3) increase in proteasome after 2 h of treatment with 20 μm curcumin. This increase in activity was maintained between 2 and 24 h. Thus, these data correlate nicely with the ubiquitination data shown in Fig. 6B. Curcumin Treatment Impacts Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins—We next monitored the impact of curcumin treatment on keratinocyte cell number. As shown in Fig. 7A, curcumin produces a concentration-dependent reduction in cell number. During a growth period of 4 days, cell number increased 3-fold in untreated cells; however, curcumin treatment resulted in a reduction in this increase that is optimal at curcumin concentrations of >15 μm. We should note that treatment with 50 ng/ml TPA results in maintenance of cell number at the seeding density and that co-treatment with 50 ng/ml TPA and increasing levels of curcumin produces a concentration-dependent reduction in cell number at curcumin concentrations >10 μm. The curcumin-dependent reduction was associated with morphological changes that include a retraction of the cells away from each other, the formation of spindle-like processes, and less adherence to the substratum (Fig. 7B). The mechanism of reduction in cell number could involve altered expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, or activation of cell death processes. To assess this, we examined the impact of curcumin treatment on cell cycle regulatory protein level. Consistent with the idea that curcumin may inhibit cell cycle progression, curcumin treatment reduced the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E (Fig. 7C). Among the cyclin-dependent kinases, cdk1 level was markedly reduced, but the levels of cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 were only slightly altered. We expected that curcumin might increase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor levels. However, p27 level was not altered, and we paradoxically observed that curcumin treatment reduced the levels of p16 and p21. It is important to note that the overall composition of AP1 factors interacting at the AP1-1 site did not change in control versus TPA-treated cultures (24Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (not shown). Curcumin Activates Apoptosis—We next assessed the impact of curcumin treatment on apoptosis. In keratinocytes, apoptosis is associated with alteration of the Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, caspase activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (29Jost M. Huggett T.M. Kari C. Boise L.H. Rodeck U. J.

In contrast, TPA did not influence Bcl-xL or Bax levels. Co-treatment of keratinocytes with curcumin and TPA resulted in suppression of Bcl-xL level, indicating that the curcumin response is dom"
https://openalex.org/W1988022838,"Lung epithelial cells are primary targets of oncostatin M (OSM) and, to a lower degree, of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-31, all members of the IL-6 cytokine family. The OSM receptor (OSMR) signals through activation of STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways to induce genes encoding differentiated cell functions, reduce cell-cell interaction, and suppress cell proliferation. IL-31 functions through the heteromeric IL-31 receptor, which shares with OSMR the OSMRβ subunit, but does not engage gp130, the common subunit of all other IL-6 cytokine receptors. Because the response of epithelial cells to IL-31 is unknown, the action of IL-31 was characterized in the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 in which the expression of the ligand-binding IL-31Rα subunit was increased. IL-31 initiated signaling that differed from other IL-6 cytokines by the particularly strong recruitment of the STAT3, ERK, JNK, and Akt pathways. IL-31 was highly effective in suppressing proliferation by altering expression of cell cycle proteins, including up-regulation of p27Kip1 and down-regulation of cyclin B1, CDC2, CDK6, MCM4, and retinoblastoma. A single STAT3 recruitment site (Tyr-721) in the cytoplasmic domain of IL-31Rα exerts a dominant function in the entire receptor complex and is critical for gene induction, morphological changes, and growth inhibition.

Moreover, all cell types express gp130, the common signal-transducing subunit of this receptor family. A major unresolved issue is whether the receptors for the individual IL-6 cytokines exert redundant functions because of the involvement of shared subunits, or whether they exert specific actions because of the formation of heteromeric subunit combinations. Gross analyses of cell responses to IL-6 cytokines indicated similar signaling reactions, supporting the notion of redundancy (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 3Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). However, the individual receptor forms determine not only the ability of the cells to respond to specific IL-6 cytokines by mediating ligand binding but also the quantitative signaling by the relative expression levels of receptor subunits (4Viswanathan S. Benatar T. Rose-John S. Lauffenburger D.A. Zandstra P.W. Stem Cells. 2002; 20: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The model of IL-6 cytokine receptors directing specific action takes into consideration that receptor complexes engage cytoplasmic domains of two signal-transducing subunits with distinct structures and capabilities to communicate to signaling pathways (3Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Blanchard F. Richards C.

The ligand-dependent association of receptor subunits into signaling-competent complexes leads invariably to the activation of JAKs and to a specific pattern of auto- and trans-tyrosine phosphorylation of kinases, receptor subunits, and interacting proteins, including STATs, Src homology 2-containing phosphatase 2, Src homology 2-containing protein C (SHC) and other adaptor proteins. The receptor proximal events at the plasma membrane and the level of sustained signaling defines the duration and magnitude of cell responses, including transcriptional induction of genes, altered cell morphology, and changes in cell proliferation. Proliferation control by cytokine-activated STAT proteins has gained particular attention in part to explain the role of IL-6 cytokines in tissue damage repair (6Kaido T. Oe H. Imamura M. Hepatogastroenterology. 2004; 51: 1667-1670PubMed Google Scholar, 7Klein C. Wustefeld T. Assmus U. Roskams T. Rose-John S. Muller M. Manns M.P. Ernst M. Trautwein C. J. Clin.

Unexplained thus far is the basis for the divergent outcome of IL-6 cytokine action that, in certain epithelial cell types, yields a suppression of proliferation (11Grant S.L. Douglas A.M. Goss G.A. Begley C.G. Growth Factors. 2001; 19: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas in other cell types it yields a growth promotion (12Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev.

Because the subunits for IL-6 cytokine receptors are encoded by single-copy genes, comparable structures and biochemical actions are expected for the receptor proteins expressed in the various cell types, regardless of the ultimate outcome of cytokine treatment. An independent assessment of receptor signaling specificity among IL-6 cytokine receptors became possible with the identification of IL-31Rα (gp130-like protein; see Ref. 14Diveu C. Lelievre E.

Because antigenic challenge increased levels of IL-31 in a mouse model of airway hyper-responsiveness, this cytokine has also been proposed to play a role in airway hypersensitivity (15Dillon S.R.

The fact that keratinocytes and lung epithelial cells abundantly express OSMRβ and gp130 and respond to OSM by profound changes in gene transcription and proliferation (20Finelt N. Gazel A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the question arises whether IL-31 and OSM cooperate in cell regulation. At issue is whether the signaling by IL-31 through the dimeric complex of IL-31Rα·OSMRβ is equivalent to signaling by OSM through OSMRβ·gp130 and whether signaling by these two receptor combinations equals signaling by the homodimer of the gp130·gp130 complex as part of stimulation by IL-6 or hyper-IL-6, a fusion protein of IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R, which stimulates a gp130 dimer independently of the membrane-bound IL-6R (24Fischer M.

Transient transfection experiments with native and chimeric IL-31Rα constructs indicated the recruitment of those signaling pathways known to be common to IL-6 cytokine receptors, including STAT1, -3, and -5, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and ERK (16Diveu C.

The studies demonstrated the requirement of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-31Rα, as present in the full-length receptor subunit, to enable signaling and determined tyrosine residues 652 and 721 (Tyr-652 and Tyr-721) to direct activation of STAT1/STAT5 and STAT1/STAT3, respectively. Considering the limitations of transient expression systems, the precise function of the IL-31R complex beyond the immediate signaling reactions and quantitative comparison to the action by the other IL-6 cytokine receptors remains to be determined. Despite the prediction of IL-31-responsive epidermal keratinocytes and other epithelial cells (15Dillon S.R. Sprecher C. Hammond A. Bilsborough J. Rosenfeld-Franklin M. Presnell S.R. Haugen H.S.

Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the study of the receptor signaling in these cells proved to be challenging because the level of IL-31Rα is low relative to that of OSMRβ. We hypothesize that sequence elements, which include the kinase-modified tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of the IL-6 family of receptors, define not only the recruitment of signal-transducing pathways (16Diveu C.

This hypothesis was tested for IL-31Rα in lung epithelial cells. We identified that normal human lung epithelial cells and the transformed line A549 express low levels of functional IL-31Rα. To better visualize IL-31 action, expression of IL-31Rα was enhanced in A549 cells by stable integration of a retroviral expression vector. These cells permitted the functional analysis of the receptor combinations IL-31Rα·OSMRβ, OSMRβ·gp130, and gp130·gp130 and indicated a striking specificity of the signaling by IL-31 as compared with OSM and hyper-IL-6. Cells—Clonal lines of the human glioma CCF-3, -4, -124, U118, ROS-9, oligodendrocytoma HS683, neuroblastoma IMR5 (provided by Drs. J. Cowell and R. Fenstermaker, Roswell Park Cancer Institute), and alveolar carcinoma A549 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Primary cultures of normal human bronchial and alveolar type II epithelial cells were generated from residual bronchoscopic brushing and tumor-free lung tissue, respectively, as described (22Loewen G.M. Tracy E. Blanchard F. Tan D. Yu J. Raza S. Matsui S. Baumann H. BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For identification of cytokine signaling, cells from the first passage were used. Normal human skin keratinocytes (passage 2, provided by Dr. S. Sinha, State University of New York, Buffalo) and immortalized human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKα; ATCC) were cultured in serum-free hormonally defined keratinocyte medium (Invitrogen). COS-1 cells were used to express recombinant human cytokines and Hep3B cells (26Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P.

Chen Z. Foster D. Parrish-Novak J. Gross J.A. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 752-760Crossref Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The IL-31 cDNA (encoding amino acid residues 24–164, NCBI accession number NP001014358.1) was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from mitogen-activated human peripheral T-cells. Because the first exon could not be unambiguously identified in the human genomic data base, the cDNA encoding the signal peptide of human IL-6 (amino acid residues 1–29) was added to the 5′ end of the cloned IL-31 cDNA under inclusion of an extra triplet encoding glycine. The resulting construct was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The IL-31Rα cDNA was amplified from RNA extracted from human glioma cell line U87 and cloned into pCMV-Tag 4A (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector between the HindIII and XhoI sites upstream and in-frame with the DYKDDDDK (FLAG) sequence. The IL-31Rα-FLAG sequence was transferred into pLHCX retroviral delivery and expression vector (Clontech). The three tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, Tyr-652, Tyr-683, and Tyr-721, were mutated to phenylalanine (YF), singly and in combinations, by QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). IL-31Rα forms with the mutations of both Tyr-652 and Tyr-683, or Tyr-652 and Tyr-721 are labeled Y652F, Y683F and Y652F, Y721F, respectively. IL-31Rα with all three tyrosine mutations is labeled 3YF. Retroviruses were generated by a 2-day transient transfection procedure in PT67 packaging cells. The chimeric receptor GM-CSFRβ-IL-31Rα was constructed by inserting the EcoRI-NotI fragment encoding the IL-31Rα (amino acid residues 515–745) into the EcoRI-NotI restriction-digested pLNCX2-GM-CSFRβ, encoding the extracellular domain of GM-CSFRβ (amino acid residues 1–437). The chimeric receptor GM-CSFRα-OSMRβ was constructed by inserting the PCR-generated EcoRI-NotI fragment encoding the OSMRβ (amino acid residues 723–979) into the EcoRI-NotI restriction-digested pSVSPORT-GM-CSFRα, encoding the extracellular domain of GM-CSFRα (amino acid residues 1–315) (27Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The chimeric receptor cDNA was excised using HindIII and PmeI restriction enzymes, a NotI site added 3′ to the PmeI site, and re-cloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of the retroviral pLPCX vector. The tyrosine residues 917 and 945 in the cytoplasmic domain of OSMRβ were mutated to phenylalanine and verified by sequencing.

Transfection and Transduction of Cells—The production of IL-6, IL-31, OSM, hyper-IL-6, IL-22, and IL-24 for cell treatments was carried out as follows. COS-1 cells in 10-cm diameter dishes (3 × 106 cells) were transfected with 4 μg of cytokine expression vector and 0.2 μg of pEGFP using Mirus TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI). After 24 h, the cultures with >50% transfected (GFP+) cells were changed to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 4.5 mg/ml glucose. The presence of 10% fetal calf serum was important to preserve the bioactivity of the synthesized cytokines. After 72 h of incubation, during which the cultures reached 100% confluence, the conditioned medium was collected and filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. The cytokine concentrations were determined by Luminex multiplex assay (30duPont N.C. Wang K. Wadhwa P.D. Culhane J.F. Nelson E.L. J. Reprod.

The bioactivity of every cytokine preparation was independently determined by an in-house bioassay in H-35 cells (32Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Marinkovic S. Won K.A. Jahreis G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 557: 280-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which were stably transduced with human OSMRβ (5Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Blanchard F. Richards C. Miyajima A. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25273-25285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and human IL-31Rα. These cells have no measurable production of endogenous IL-6 cytokines and permit the measurement of the bioactivity of all human IL-6 cytokines by the dose-dependent induction of type II acute phase proteins, such as fibrinogen and thiostatin (5Wang Y.

Woloski B.M. McGary C.T. Adams M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Half-maximal expression of the plasma proteins defines one hepatocyte-stimulating factor unit and is obtained with ∼1 ng/ml of IL-6 cytokines. The accuracy of the bioassay was confirmed by using purified recombinant IL-6 cytokines (R&D Systems). Generally, the cytokine concentrations in the COS-1 media ranged from 10 to 50 μg/ml. From these stocks, an initial dilution to 100 ng/ml cytokines was prepared that has been demonstrated to produce in all cell types optimal signaling reactions and cell responses. These preparations, along with further 10-fold serial dilutions, were applied to the experimental cell cultures (see “Results”). Conditioned medium from COS-1 cells transfected with control vector served as background reference (contained <0.1 ng/ml IL-6 equivalent bioactivity). This medium was diluted like the cytokine stocks and was included in the experimental applications as a no-cytokine control. Receptor expression vectors along with the reporter gene constructs pCRP(219)CAT and pEGFP (Invitrogen) were transfected into Hep3B cells, and cytokine-regulated CAT activity was determined and normalized as described (5Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Blanchard F. Richards C. Miyajima A. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25273-25285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A549 cells were transduced with receptor-encoding retroviruses, cloned by limited dilution within 4 days following transduction, and selected in hygromycin (1 mg/ml). Positive clones were identified by the expression of a FLAG epitope. All selected clones (at least three independently derived clones per receptor construct) were subjected to a second round of subcloning. Homogeneity of the selected clonal lines was verified by immunostaining for the FLAG epitope. Cell Treatments—The cell culture conditions and duration of cytokine treatments depended on the type of analysis. Generally, cells were plated into 6-well or 24-well culture plates. When the cultures reached a density of 50–100% (100% = 2 × 105 cells/cm2 culture area), the cells were incubated first in serum-free medium for 2 h and then changed to medium containing cytokines (0–100 ng/ml). For determining receptor-mediated signaling, treatments were limited to 15 min; for measuring induction of genes, altered cell morphology, or change in cell cycle markers, the treatments ranged from 24 to 48 h. To determine cell proliferation, the cells were seeded at 1% density into 24-well culture plates. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by fresh, serum-containing medium that also included 10-fold serially diluted cytokines or dexamethasone (34Greenberg A.K. Hu J. Basu S. Hay J. Reibman J. Yie T.A. Tchou-Wong K.M. Rom W.N. Lee T.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the culture medium was replaced, and another 3 days later, the number of viable cells in each well was counted in a hematocytometer. Values from quadruplicate cultures were expressed as mean ± S.D. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined as described previously (22Loewen G.M. Tracy E. Blanchard F. Tan D. Yu J. Raza S. Matsui S. Baumann H. BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Morphology of the cell cultures was recorded by inverted phase microscopy at ×10 magnification (TE2000; Nikon, Melville, NY). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed within the culture plate (10 μl/1 × 105 cells) with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg of leupeptin, 1 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). Replicate aliquots of lysates containing 1–50 μg of proteins were separated on 6–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) with series of 15 samples per gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and equal loading and transfer were confirmed in all cases by staining with Ponceau S red. Subsections of the membrane containing the proteins of interest were reacted with antibodies. The following phospho-specific antibodies were used: phospho-STAT1-Tyr-701 (9171), phospho-STAT3-Tyr-705 (9131), phospho-STAT5-Tyr-694 (9351), phospho-p44/42 MAPK-Thr-202/Tyr-204 (phospho-ERK1/2; 9106), phospho-SAPK/JNK-Thr-183/Tyr-185 (9251), phospho-Akt-Ser-473 (9271), or phospho-Hsp27-Ser-82 (2401) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA). The antibodies against total proteins included the following: STAT3 (C-20), ERK (K-23), JUNB (C-11), p27Kip1 (C-19), p53 (DO-1), cyclin B1 (H-433), cyclin D1 (M-20), cyclin E (HE-12), CDK2 (M-2), CDK4 (sc-260), CDK6 (C21), CDC2 (sc-54), MCM2 (H-126), MCM4 (H-300), MCL-1 (S-19), and SOCS3 (M-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against FLAG (026K4848) was obtained from Sigma; antibody against Rb (554136) was from Pharmingen; antibody against human IL-31Rα was from R&D Systems; and antibody against human α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-antitrypsin, and fibrinogen were from Dako Immunoglobins, Glostrup, Denmark. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (ICN Biomedical, Aurora, OH), and the antibody binding was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Pierce). In each experimental series, immunoblots were exposed to x-ray films for various lengths of time (1 s to 2 h) to obtain images that are in the linear range of signal detection (22Loewen G.M. Tracy E. Blanchard F. Tan D. Yu J. Raza S. Matsui S. Baumann H. BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For pictorial presentation of immunoblot data, the signals for either total STAT3 or ERK1/2 served as loading controls. Immunoblots were digitalized and quantified with ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). The net pixel value for each protein band that lies within the linear range of detection was compared with co-analyzed control cultures. Immunostaining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and reacted with anti-FLAG and fluoresceinated secondary antibody and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The subcellular distribution of the labels was recorded on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA).

https://openalex.org/W2024395172,"Hormonal therapy of prostate cancer, by inhibiting androgen production and/or androgen function, is the treatment of choice for advanced prostate cancer. Although most patients respond initially, the effect is only temporary, and the tumor cells will resume proliferation in an androgen-deprived environment. The mechanism for androgen-independent proliferation of cancer cells is unclear. Hormonal therapy induces neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells, which is hypothesized to contribute to tumor recurrence by a paracrine mechanism. We studied signal transduction pathways of neuroendocrine differentiation in LNCaP cells after androgen withdrawal, and we showed that both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and ERK are activated, but only the former is required for neuroendocrine differentiation. A constitutively active AKT promotes neuroendocrine differentiation and a dominant negative AKT inhibits it. Activation of AKT by IGF-1 leads to neuroendocrine differentiation, and neuroendocrine differentiation induced by epinephrine requires AKT activation. We also show that the AKT pathway is likely responsible for neuroendocrine differentiation in DU145, an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line. Therefore, our study demonstrated a novel function of the AKT pathway in prostate cancer progression and identified potential targets that may be explored for the treatment of androgen-independent cancer.

Babb P. BJU Int. 2002; 90: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). There are multiple treatment options for PC in early stages. For advanced and metastatic PC, hormonal therapy, consisting of androgen ablation and/or inhibition of androgen action by anti-androgen, is the treatment of choice (2Sharifi N. Gulley J.L. Dahut W.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2005; 294: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Although an initial response is seen in most patients receiving hormonal therapy, the effect is temporary, and the tumor eventually recurs and enters the androgen-independent (AI) stage in which the tumor cells proliferate in an androgen-deprived environment. There are no effective therapies for AI PC (3Balk S.P. Urology. 2002; 60: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).The mechanism of AI proliferation of PC is poorly understood, and many hypotheses have been proposed, such as androgen receptor (AR) amplification (4Visakorpi T.

Churukian C.J. Agarwal M.M. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1985; 109: 607-612PubMed Google Scholar). NE cells are also present in PC as scattered individual cells or small nests among the more abundant secretory type cancer cells. The number of NE cells increases in high grade and high stage tumors and particularly in hormonally treated and AI tumors (9Huang J. Di Sant'Agnese P.A. Lamberts S. Dogliotti L. Advances in Oncology: The Expanding Role of Octreotide I. BioScientifica Ltd., Bristol, UK2002: 243-262Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that hormonal therapy induces NED and the NE cells contribute to AI growth of PC in the androgen-deprived environment by secreting their products to act on the adjacent non-NE tumor cells in a paracrine fashion (8Vashchenko N.

Urol. 1999; 162: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), mimicking in vivo observation in PC patients treated hormonally. This finding supports the trans-differentiation model and suggests that NE cells may be derived from the non-NE secretory-type cancer cells (13Burchardt T. Burchardt M. Chen M.W.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathway involved in the differentiation process is unclear. Here we report our study demonstrating that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is critically involved in NED.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LNCaP and DU145 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); FBS, RPMI medium 1640, sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen; charcoal/dextran-treated FBS was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT); GeneJuice® transfection reagent was from Novagen; RNeasy® mini kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); transcriptor reverse transcriptase and homogeneous protein A were from Roche Applied Science; random hexamers was from Promega (Madison, WI); iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix and Bio-Rad Protein assay kit were from Bio-Rad; monoclonal anti-NSE antibody was from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA); polyclonal anti-IGF-1 receptorβ antibody and monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); polyclonal anti-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-S6K, anti-phospho-S6K antibodies, and monoclonal anti-Tyr(P)-100 antibody were from Cell Signaling (Dancers, MA); RIPA lysis buffer was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY); protease inhibitor mixture and epinephrine (used at 5 μm) were from Sigma; IGF-1 (used at 100 ng/ml) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). U0126 (used at 10 μm) and AKT inhibitor IV (used at 20 μm) were from Calbiochem. LY294002 (used at 20 μm) was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and rapamycin (used at 10 nm) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).Cell Culture, Plasmid DNA, and Transfection—LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For androgen deprivation, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS. When chemical inhibitors or stimulating agents (IGF-1, epinephrine) were used, the culture media were changed daily with fresh inhibitors.pCDNA3-cAkt (a constitutively active Akt with a deletion at amino acids 4–129 replaced with a consensus myristoylation domain) (15Kohn A.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and pcDNA-dnAKT (kinase-deficient mutant, K179A) were kindly provided by Dr. Freeman of the University of Rochester. The liposome-mediated plasmid transfection was performed using GeneJuice® transfection reagent (Novagen). The cells were plated and maintained to 70–80% density in 50-mm plates and then transfected with the plasmid DNAs according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. For transient transfection, the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For stable transfection, the transfected cells were diluted at 1:5–1:10 and selected with 300 μg/ml G418.Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy® kit. RNA was reverse-transcribed by transcriptor reverse transcriptase with random hexamers. The following specific forward and reverse primers were used for NSE, 5′-AGCTGCCCCTGCCTTAC-3′ and 5′-GAGACAAACAGCGTTACTTAG-3′, and for chromogranin A, 5′-GCGGTGGAAGAGCCATCAT-3′ and 5′-TCTGTGGCTTCACCACTTTTCTC-3′.Real time PCR was performed with iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix in an iCycler iQ System (Bio-Rad) using the SYBR Green Detection protocol. Total reaction volume was 20 μl, and a cycle consists of 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, for a total of 45 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min.Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. The cells were sheared twice through a 20-gauge needle and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane with Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with TBS containing 5% w/v nonfat dry milk, hybridized with primary antibody in 2% w/v nonfat dry milk, followed by incubation with secondary antibody and detected with an ECL kit (Bio-Rad).Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by t test. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. from three separate (replicate) experiments.RESULTSAndrogen Deprivation of LNCaP Cells Induces NED and the Activation of ERK and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR Signaling Pathways—As has been shown previously, androgen withdrawal in the culture media of LNCaP cells induced NED, characterized by changes in cell morphology (elongated cellular processes; Fig. 1A) and increased expression of NE cell markers chromogranin A (Fig. 1B) and NSE (13Burchardt T. Burchardt M. Chen M.W. Cao Y. de la Taille A. Shabsigh A. Hayek O. Dorai T. Buttyan R. J. Urol. 1999; 162: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Androgen withdrawal also induced phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 1D) and the serine/threonine kinase AKT (Fig. 1E). Because AKT is a key player in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and its activity is increased by phosphorylation, our observation suggests that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway may be activated during NED of LNCaP cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, androgen deprivation of LNCaP cells significantly increased the levels of phosphorylation of S6 kinase (S6K) (Fig. 1F), an important downstream effector of mTOR whose level of phosphorylation directly correlates with the activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in PC (16Thomas G.V. Horvath S. Smith B.L. Crosby K. Lebel L.A. Schrage M. Said J. De Kernion J. Reiter R.E. Sawyers C.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8351-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway, Not ERK Pathway, Is Required for NED of PC Induced by Androgen Withdrawal—Because androgen withdrawal activates both ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways in LNCaP cells, we studied whether one or both of them may be required for NED induced by androgen withdrawal. Addition of U0126, an inhibitor of MEK that inhibits the activation of ERK, had no effect on the increased NSE level in androgen-deprived LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A). The relative specificity of this compound was demonstrated by showing that U0126 blocked the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 2B) but not that of AKT (Fig. 2C), suggesting that activation of ERK is not required for NED of PC.FIGURE 2NED induced by androgen withdrawal is not suppressed by inhibition of ERK. A, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS or C-FBS for 6 days in the absence or presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126. Equal amounts of cellular proteins were immunoblotted with anti-NSE and anti-GAPDH antibodies to show that U0126 did not inhibit NED. B and C, Western blots show that U0126 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK but increased the phosphorylation of AKT. Results are plotted as mean ± S.D. from three replicates for each treatment group. Significant changes (compared with control) are indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To study whether PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is required for NED of LNCaP cells, inhibitors that target key molecules of this pathway were added to LNCaP cells cultured in androgen-deprived media. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, significantly inhibited the expression of NSE (Fig. 3A and Fig. 4A). The specificity of LY294002 was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. 3B) but not ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Similarly, we demonstrated that rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K, a downstream molecule of mTOR (Fig. 4B), but not ERK (Fig. 4C). Additionally, we studied whether inhibition of AKT by a chemical inhibitor (AKT inhibitor IV) may inhibit NED. Because treatment of LNCaP cells with this compound for longer than 12 h causes significant cell apoptosis, we performed our study for 12 h (complete NED occurs in 6 days). LNCaP cells cultured in charcoal-treated FBS for 12 h showed increased NSE mRNA but not its protein (data not shown). We showed that AKT inhibitor IV abolished the increased expression of NSE mRNA after androgen withdrawal (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results suggest that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, but not the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway, is required for androgen withdrawal-induced NED of PC.FIGURE 3NED induced by androgen withdrawal is suppressed by inhibition of PI3K activity. A–C, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS or C-FBS for 6 days in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Equal amounts of cellular proteins were immunoblotted with anti-NSE, anti-GAPDH, anti-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT, anti-ERK, and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies.

We next studied whether activation of AKT by other means also promoted NED. We transiently transfected LNCaP cells with pcDNA3-cAkt, which expresses a constitutively active AKT with a deletion of amino acids 4–129 replaced with a consensus myristoylation domain, or pcDNA3-dnAKT, which expresses a dominant negative (kinase-deficient mutant) AKT (K179A). A real time PCR assay 48 h after transfection showed that expression of c-AKT, not dnAKT, induced the expression of NSE mRNA in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that activated AKT induces NED, and the kinase activity of AKT is required for this function.FIGURE 5A constitutively active AKT promotes NED while a dominant negative AKT inhibits androgen withdrawal-induced NED. A, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-cAKT (expressing a constitutively active AKT) or pcDNA3-dnAKT (expressing a dominant negative AKT) or cultured in c-FBS (positive control of NED). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and a real time PCR assay was performed to study the expression of NSE mRNA and showed that cAKT, not dnAKT, induced NED.

The LNCaP cells were transfected with pcDNA3-cAKT and pcDNA3dnAKT, respectively and selected with G-418. Cells that survived the selection were pooled and designated as LNCaP-cAKT and LNCaP-dnAKT cells, respectively. Western blot showed significant overexpression of AKT in these cells in comparison to the parental LNCaP cells (Fig. 5B).LNCaP-cAKT cells had a significantly increased level of NSE in comparison with that in the parental LNCaP cells when cultured in normal FBS (Fig. 5C), suggesting that activation of the AKT pathway promotes NED of LNCaP cells. mTOR mediates the function of AKT in inducing NED because a downstream effector of mTOR, S6K, was constitutively activated in the LNCaP-cAKT cells cultured in normal FBS (Fig. 5D). Additionally, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, inhibited NED of the LNCaP-cAKT cells (Fig. 5E). Expression of the dominant negative AKT significantly inhibited androgen withdrawal-induced NED (Fig. 5C) as well as phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 5D), confirming that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is required for NED of PC.IGF-1 Activates AKT and Induces NED of LNCaP Cells—We next studied whether activation of endogenous AKT by a stimulus other than androgen withdrawal may induce NED. We chose to study the effects of IGF-1, which activates AKT and has been implicated in the progression of PC in many studies (17Chan J.M. Stampfer M.J. Ma J. Gann P. Gaziano J.M. Pollak M. Giovannucci E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). IGF-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor β and the phosphorylation of AKT as expected (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, addition of IGF-1 to LNCaP cells cultured in normal media induced NE morphologic changes similar to what is observed in cells cultured in androgen-deprived media (Fig. 6C) and also significantly increased the expression of chromogranin A and NSE (Fig. 6, D and E), suggesting that it induces NED. Importantly, NED induced by IGF-1 was inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 6F), suggesting that IGF-1-induced NED is also mediated by the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.FIGURE 6IGF-1, an activator of AKT, induces NED of LNCaP cells. A, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS in the absence or presence of IGF-1 for 6 days. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-IGF-1-Rβ antibody and immunoblotted (IB) with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. B, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS in the absence or presence of IGF-1 or in C-FBS (positive control of NED) for 6 days. Equal amounts of protein were immunoblotted with anti-AKT and anti-phospho-AKT antibodies. C, LNCaP cells were cultured in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of IGF-1 for 6 days to show that IGF-1 induced NE-like morphology. D, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS, C-FBS, or in FBS with IGF-1 for 6 days. A real time PCR assay was performed to study the expression of chromogranin A mRNA. E, equal amounts of proteins were immunoblotted with anti-NSE and anti-GAPDH antibodies to show that IGF-1 induces NED. F, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS, C-FBS, or FBS plus IGF-1 in the absence or presence of rapamycin for 6 days. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoblotted with anti-NSE and anti-GAPDH antibodies to show that rapamycin inhibited IGF-1-induced NED. Results are plotted as mean ± S.D. from three replicates for each treatment group. Significant changes (compared with control) are indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Epinephrine Activates AKT and Induces NED—Results from the previous experiments support the hypothesis that AKT is essential for the induction of NED of PC by androgen withdrawal. However, other agents, such as β-adrenergic receptor agonist epinephrine, can also stimulate NED of LNCaP cells (14Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Bissonette E.A. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13812-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but it was unclear whether AKT is involved under such conditions. Thus, we tested if NED of LNCaP cells induced by epinephrine also requires activation of AKT. Addition of epinephrine to LNCaP cells induced morphologic changes of NED and significant increases in the expression of chromogranin A and NSE as reported previously (Fig. 7, A–C) (14Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it also induced phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. 7D). Epinephrine-induced NED was significantly inhibited by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 7E), suggesting that AKT also plays an essential role in this process.FIGURE 7NED induced by epinephrine (Epi) requires AKT signaling. A, LNCaP cells were cultured in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of epinephrine for 6 days to show that epinephrine induced NE-like morphology. B, LNCaP cells were cultured in FBS, C-FBS, or FBS with epinephrine for 6 days. A real time PCR assay was performed to study the expression of chromogranin A mRNA. C and D, Western blots show that epinephrine induced NED and also induced phosphorylation of AKT. E, LNCaP cells were treated with epinephrine for 6 days in the absence or presence of rapamycin. Untreated LNCaP cells cultured in FBS or C-FBS were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoblotted with an anti-NSE and an anti-GAPDH antibody to show that rapamycin inhibits NED induced by epinephrine. Results are plotted as mean ± S.D. from three replicates for each treatment group.

https://openalex.org/W1976229755,"Clusterin mRNA levels were shown to increase dramatically in rat ventral prostate following castration, and clusterin was therefore originally thought to be repressed by androgens. It was later discovered that the increased clusterin levels are most likely due to castration-induced apoptosis of the prostatic epithelium rather than direct action of the androgen receptor (AR). In the studies presented here, LNCaP cells in culture and rat prostate organ culture were treated with androgens. Clusterin mRNA and protein are shown to increase with androgen treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This induction of clusterin requires AR and can be inhibited by casodex, an AR antagonist. We have found that the first intron of the clusterin gene contains putative androgen response elements. The intronic region is shown to be bound by AR in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and is transactivated by AR in reporter assays. Two isoforms of clusterin result from alternate transcriptional start sites. Both isoforms are cytoprotective; however, Isoform 1 has the capacity to produce a splice variant that is apoptotic. Real time PCR was used to determine the response of the two isoforms to androgens. Intriguingly, these results illustrated that Isoform 2 was up-regulated, whereas Isoform 1 was down-regulated by androgens. Isoform 2 was also increased as the LNCaP xenograft tumor progressed to androgen-independence, whereas Isoform 1 was unaltered. This androgen regulation of clusterin may underline the cytoprotective role of androgens in normal prostate physiology as well as play an antiapoptotic role in prostate cancer progression."

Here we use x-ray diffraction to investigate the structural basis for the pH dependence of activity and nitrite affinity by examining the type 2 copper site and its immediate surroundings in nitrite reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3. At active pH the geometry of the substrate-free oxidized type 2 copper site shows a near perfect tetrahedral geometry as defined by the positions of its ligands. At higher pH values the most favorable copper site geometry is altered toward a more distorted tetrahedral geometry whereby the solvent ligand adopts a position opposite to that of the His-131 ligand. This pH-dependent variation in type 2 copper site geometry is discussed in light of recent computational results. When co-crystallized with substrate, nitrite is seen to bind in a bidentate fashion with its two oxygen atoms ligating the type 2 copper, overlapping with the positions occupied by the solvent ligand in the high and low pH structures. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy is used to assign the pH dependence of the binding of nitrite to the active site, and EPR spectroscopy is used to characterize the pH dependence of the reduction potential of the type 2 copper site.

Taken together, these spectroscopic and structural observations help to explain the pH dependence of nitrite reductase, highlighting the subtle relationship between copper site geometry, nitrite affinity, and enzyme activity. The nitrogen cycle has received much attention in recent years due to the fact that several substrates and products of the pathway are known to be environmental pollutants (1Suzuki S. Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Inoue T. Kai Y. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1999; 192: 245-265Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In dissimilatory denitrification (2Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar), nitrate is used as an alternative electron acceptor during respiration when oxygen is scarce, being reduced stepwise and finally returned to the biosphere as inorganic nitrogen. One of the intermediate compounds is NO(g), which is toxic to the host at high levels. It is, therefore, of great importance for the bacteria to regulate the concentration of NO. This regulation is achieved by the controlled expression of two enzymes, nitrite reductase (NiR) 4The abbreviations used are: NiR, nitrite reductase; Cu-NiR, copper-containing nitrite reductase; RsNiR, nitrite reductase from R. sphaeroides 2.4.3; FTIR, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy; MES, 4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol. and NO reductase. NiR reduces nitrite to produce NO(g), and NO reductase reduces NO to N2O, where NO is the first gaseous compound in the pathway. There are two main categories of NiRs; those that are heme-containing (cd1-NiRs) (3Fulop V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The overall enzymatic reaction performed by NiRs is NO2− + 2H+ + e- → NO(g) + H2O. Cu-NiRs are blue or green in color, showing visible absorption at 460 and 600 nm (1Suzuki S. Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Inoue T. Kai Y. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1999; 192: 245-265Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The relative magnitude of these absorption peaks determines the enzyme color (i.e. blue or green). RsNiR is a copper-containing green NiR with two peaks of equal maximum absorption at 457 and 590 nm (9Olesen K. Veselov A. Zhao Y.W. Wang Y.S. Danner B. Scholes C.P. Shapleigh J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6086-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As with all other Cu-NiRs, the protein is a homotrimer with two copper atoms per monomer, ∼12 Ä apart. The type 1 copper site has four ligands (His-126, His-177, Cys-167, and Met-182) and is located a few angstroms beneath a hydrophobic surface (8Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which is the docking site for an electron donor protein (10Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M.

Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1648-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The type 2 copper site is situated at the monomer-monomer interfaces and has ligands from both monomers (His A131, His A166, His B338), forming a propeller-shaped structure with the copper at its center. When the type 2 copper is oxidized, there is also a fourth ligand, a solvent molecule, but this ligand disorders upon reduction of the type 2 copper ion (12Jacobson F. Guo H.W. Olesen K. Okvist M.

After an electron is passed to the type 1 copper site from the electron donor protein, the electron is transferred on to nitrite via the type 2 copper ion (15Suzuki S. Kohzuma T.

Although schematics of the enzymatic reaction typically only mention the species NO2−, it has been argued that it is actually the protonated HNO2 species that binds to the active site (16Boulanger M.J.

Recent studies have shown that before the NO(g) product leaves the type 2 copper site, it is bound to the copper ion as a side-on copper-nitrosyl intermediate (17Antonyuk S.V. Strange R.W. Sawers G.

Near the type 2 site there are also the catalytic residues Asp-129 and His-287, which have been found to be crucial to enzyme activity and nitrite binding (9Olesen K. Veselov A. Zhao Y.W. Wang Y.S.

Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These residues are bridged by a solvent molecule referred to as the “bridging water,” and Asp-129 forms an H-bond to one of the oxygen atoms when nitrite is bound or to the water ligand in the absence of nitrite (6Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). All details concerning the catalytic role of His-287 are not entirely clear, but this residue is believed to be involved in supplying the proton needed for the enzymatic reaction to occur (6Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and has in Rhodobacter sphaeroides been seen to disorder at high pH, most likely due to loss of H-bond interactions (12Jacobson F. Guo H.W. Olesen K. Okvist M. Neutze R. Sjolin L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nitrite reductase is highly pH-dependent and has an activity maximum between pH 5 and 6 (23Zhao Y.W. Lukoyanov D.A. Toropov Y.V. Wu K. Shapleigh J.P. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7464-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Deligeer Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One property influencing the activity of NiR is the active-site affinity of the substrate, which in turn varies with pH (25Abraham Z.H.L. Smith B.E. Howes B.D. Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that nirK, the gene encoding Cu-NiRs (2Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar), is regulated by both nitrite concentrations and pH in such a way that high nitrite concentrations increases the expression of nirK, whereas increased pH down-regulates the expression of this gene, as indicated by recent findings for nirK from Nitrosomonas europaea (26Beaumont H.J.E. Lens S.I. Reijnders W.N.M. Westerhoff H.V. van Spanning R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This correlation between the pH dependence of the expression levels and activity emphasizes the fact that nitrite production is strictly controlled within the cell. In this work we use x-ray crystallography to identify those structural features of NiR that are pH-dependent, and we correlate these findings with data from EPR and FTIR spectroscopy to characterize the structural causes and implications of the pH-dependent activity of RsNiR. Our results highlight the elegant way in which nature has exploited subtle pH-dependent differences in the ligating properties of metal centers to regulate the activity of copper-dependent enzymes. Nitrite reductase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (12Jacobson F. Guo H.W. Olesen K. Okvist M. Neutze R. Sjolin L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. Crystallization was performed with and without nitrite at both pH 6.0 and 8.4. The protein concentration ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 mm. Nitrite was added to the well solution in the case of pH 8.4, but when crystallized at pH 6.0 nitrite was only added to the protein solution before setting up the drops. For cryoprotection, solutions containing 10% PEG 400 were prepared from the specific crystallization conditions. The crystallization conditions can be found in Table 1.TABLE 1Crystallization conditions for the structures of RsNiR at pH 6.0 and 8.4 with and without nitritepH 8.4aFrom Jacobson et al.

Indexing and integration of the data were performed with Mosfilm (27Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography 26. European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France1992: 27-33Google Scholar), and scaling and merging were performed with Scala (28Evans P.R. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography.33. European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France1997: 22-24Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suite (29Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The structures were solved with molecular replacement using AMoRe (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4196) Google Scholar) using another RsNiR structure as a model (Protein Data Bank code 1ZV2). For all datasets refinement was carried out in CCP4 (Refmac 5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar)) and CNS, and subsequent model rebuilding was performed in O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). After molecular replacement, a rigid body refinement was performed with Refmac 5 followed by a round of restrained refinement. The copper atoms were then added to the model, and two rounds of simulated annealing were carried out in CNS. Solvent molecules were added after simulated annealing with ARP/Warp (34Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) during refinement in Refmac 5, and the rest of the refinement and model building was done in Refmac 5 and in O, respectively. In the dataset obtained from RsNiR co-crystallized with substrate at pH 6.0, nitrite was modeled (at the end of refinement) into two Fo - Fc difference electron density peaks, corresponding to the oxygen atoms of bound nitrite at the type 2 copper site. There are also structures of NiR mutants crystallized close to active pH with more than a 20-fold excess of nitrite in which no substrate has been modeled at the type 2 copper site, possibly due to electron density peaks being assigned as water. Hence, care was taken to avoid mis-assignment of these peaks since, in principle, they could represent two solvent molecules with partial occupancy (∼50% each) rather than nitrite. For example, the activity of the enzyme was assessed before crystallization setups by measuring the reoxidation of dithionite-reduced enzyme with nitrite (data not shown). As a further precaution, nitrite was added in 100-fold excess to the protein solution before mixing with precipitant solution to avoid problems with precipitants preventing nitrite binding, which has previously been reported (35Barrett M.L. Harris R.L. Antonyuk S. Hough M.A. Ellis M.J. Sawers G. Eady R.R. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16311-16319Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, in the structure at pH 6.0, full occupancy was recovered for the oxygen atoms, and the hypothesis that they may represent two solvent molecules could, hence, be rejected because steric effects would prevent both solvent molecules to be present at the same time. When nitrite was modeled at this site the electron density became continuous, and the weaker density for the nitrogen in the Fo - Fc electron density map was presumably due to the nitrogen atom being less ordered than the ligating oxygen atoms. In this context it is noted that although the position of the oxygen atoms is well conserved in all structures of NiR with bound substrate, the exact position of the nitrogen atom varies significantly (21Ellis M.J.

The concentration of type 1 copper was determined at 590 nm using an absorption coefficient of 2300 m-1 cm-1 (9Olesen K. Veselov A. Zhao Y.W. Wang Y.S. Danner B. Scholes C.P. Shapleigh J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6086-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protein samples at pH 6.0 and 8.4 were prepared using 0.1 m MES and Tris, respectively. The type 1 copper concentration was estimated to be 0.3 mm at both pH 6.0 and 8.4. Ascorbic acid and potassium ferricyanide were used as reductant and oxidant, respectively, throughout the titration. N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol were used as mediators at micromolar concentrations. Samples were prepared in a glove box (Belle Technology) at an oxygen level less then 5 ppm. Titrations were performed by gradually adding ascorbic acid to a larger batch of protein that had been fully oxidized with ferricyanide. The sample was allowed to equilibrate with the platinum redox electrode for more than 15 min after each addition. Small aliquots were then transferred to calibrated EPR tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded at 133 K with a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer operating at 9.3 GHz. The modulation amplitude was 3.0 millitesla, and the microwave power was 21 milliwatts. The concentration of RsNiR type 2 copper was determined by integrating the first EPR hyperfine peak with the Bruker Xepr software. FTIR spectra were obtained with a Bruker IFS-66 FTIR spectrometer (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled, narrow band MCT detector and interfaced to a microcomputer. Acquisition parameters were: resolution, 4 cm-1; number of co-added interferograms, 1024; moving mirror velocity, 4.11 cm/s; acquisition time, 75 s. Peak to peak noise levels between 2200 and 2000 cm-1 were found to be less than 5 × 10-5 A units in all cases. Where necessary, second derivative spectra smoothed over 13 data points were calculated to resolve overlapping bands. Spectra of aqueous solution of RsNiR (2.4 mm) were obtained using a horizontal ATR (attenuated total reflectance) with a germanium internal reflection element (model A737, Bruker) and equipped with a dialysis membrane to enable changing the pH of the sample in situ. The pH-dependent binding of nitrite to the enzyme (2.4 mm) at 293 K was monitored in a downward and an upward pH gradient between pH 8.6 and 5.5, employing either a phosphate buffer or a HEPES (pH 8.6-7.0) plus MES buffer (pH 6.6-5.5) at a concentration of 50 mm containing 2.5 mm sodium nitrite. 50 ml of this buffer solution was superfused over the enzyme solution so as to ensure an excess substrate over enzyme. The buffer composition was chosen such that the results could be compared with the kinetic data on the overall reaction, obtained by Olesen et al. (9Olesen K. Veselov A. Zhao Y.W. Wang Y.S. Danner B. Scholes C.P. Shapleigh J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6086-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Zhao et al. (9Olesen K. Veselov A. Zhao Y.W. Wang Y.S. Danner B. Scholes C.P.

An aqueous solution of 100 mm NaNO2 shows a broad absorption around 1237 cm-1 (bandwidth 78 cm-1) corresponding to an anti-symmetric stretching vibration within the V-shaped nitrite anion. Taking 15N stable isotope-labeled nitrite, this band shows a downshift toward 1209 cm-1 (bandwidth 64 cm-1). To diminish the effect of overlapping bands, absorbance changes induced by a downward pH gradient scan were quantified using second derivative spectra (Fig. 1B). Such spectra show a decreasing, negative signal at 1237 cm-1 flanked by two exchanging bands at 1247 and 1224 cm-1 (isosbestic point at 1232 cm-1), resulting from the sulfonate moiety in the HEPES or MES buffer. To positively identify nitrite specific signals, the experiment was repeated using 15N-labeled nitrite as a ligand. In this case, the intensity at 1237 cm-1 remained nearly constant, but a new signal decreasing with pH was observed at 1209 cm-1 (Fig. 1D). Upon increasing the pH in an upward gradient, release of nitrite was not observed (data not shown). In addition, we looked for signals representing the nitrite bound to the type 2 copper site. If nitrite binds to NiR through formation of a copper-oxygen bond, the nature of the two NO bonds changed to 1, with an N=O bond characteristic and 1 with an N—O characteristic. In the infrared spectrum, these bands were expected to occur between 1500 and 1400 cm-1 and between 1100 and 1000 cm-1, respectively. Other characteristics should be the pH dependence of the peak intensity and the shift to a lower wavenumber upon labeling the ligand with the 15N stable isotope. Fig. 1, A and C, show the second derivatives of the pH-dependent infrared spectra in the range in which the N=O stretching vibrational band is expected to occur. When using natural abundance nitrite as a ligand, the bands at 1366, 1419, 1439, 1455, and 1472 cm-1 do show pH-dependent intensity changes (Fig. 1A). However, these bands cannot be assigned to an N=O vibration since the same changes were observed when using 15N-labeled nitrite (Fig. 1C). In the latter case a new band at 1386 cm-1 was observed that gains intensity upon decreasing the pH. Moreover, the band originally at 1396 cm-1 shows a decreased bandwidth. These results can be explained by assigning the band at 1386 cm-1 to the N=O stretching vibration in 15N-labeled nitrite, bound to the type 2 copper center. Using the harmonic oscillator approximation, the maximum frequency for the natural abundance, 14N nitrite is calculated to be 1411 cm-1. This value corresponds well with the unresolved shoulder at 1407 cm-1 found in the spectra of natural abundance nitrite bound to NiR. Further support for this assignment comes from the observation that these signals disappear upon reduction of the formed complexes by the addition of either ascorbate or sodium dithionite solutions (data not shown). Four structures of RsNiR have been solved to high resolution; at two pH values (8.4 and 6.0) and with or without nitrite. All structures crystallize in the same space group with one monomer in the asymmetric unit and were solved in a range from 1.74 to 2.26 Ä resolution. When comparing all four structures, almost all significant differences are located in the immediate vicinity of the active site. These active-site structural variations observed at high resolution are detailed below and provide new insight into the pH dependence of the enzyme activity and nitrite affinity. The most noteworthy structural difference away from the active site is that, in the pH 8.4 structure without nitrite, a Mg2+ ion binds to residues 220 and 224 and thereby stabilizes a protruding loop (12Jacobson F. Guo H.W. Olesen K. Okvist M. Neutze R. Sjolin L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At pH 6.0, however, even though the MgCl2 concentration is almost doubled in the crystallization conditions, no Mg2+ ion is visible in the structure. Fig. 2 shows the 2Fo - Fc electron density map of the active site when NiR was co-crystallized with nitrite at pH 8.4 and 6.0. At pH 8.4 the substrate can only be modeled in the active site with a partial occupancy of 0.5 (Fig. 2b), whereas nitrite can be seen to ligate the copper ion at full occupancy at pH 6.0 (Fig. 2a). It should also be noted that the occupancy of nitrite may actually be lower than 0.5 in the high pH structure, since the presence of solvent ligands in the absence of nitrite may somewhat enhance the apparent occupancy of nitrite recovered through structural refinement. These observations indicate that the substrate affinity for the copper active site decreases significantly with pH, which is consistent with the results of the FTIR analyses (see below). In either structure with (Fig. 2) or without (Fig. 3) nitrite the catalytic histidine residue, His-287, is disordered at pH 8.4 but not at pH 6.0. This disorder is most likely due to alterations in H-bonding properties because of deprotonation of the imidazole ring at high pH but possibly also due to changes in the preferred copper coordination geometry. At pH 6.0 this disordering is not seen, strengthening the hypothesis that His-287 is kept away from the copper ion by forming a H-bond to the bridging water (12Jacobson F. Guo H.W. Olesen K. Okvist M. Neutze R. Sjolin L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b). From an earlier electron density map we suggested that the disorder of His-287 in RsNiR could be modeled as a dual conformation of the imidazole ring, with one conformation close to and one distant from the copper ion (12Jacobson F. Guo H.W. Olesen K. Okvist M. Neutze R. Sjolin L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)."

To investigate the discrimination mechanism between self and non-self by ficolins, we determined the crystal structure of the human M-ficolin fibrinogen-like domain (FD1), which is the ligand-binding domain, at 1.9Å resolution. Although the FD1 monomer shares a common fold with the fibrinogen γ fragment and tachylectin-5A, the Asp-282–Cys-283 peptide bond, which is the predicted ligand-binding site on the C-terminal P domain, is a normal trans bond, unlike the cases of the other two proteins. The trimeric formation of FD1 results in the separation of the three P domains, and the spatial arrangement of the three predicted ligand-binding sites on the trimer is very similar to that of the trimeric collectin, indicating that such an arrangement is generally required for pathogen-recognition. The ligand binding study of FD1 in solution indicated that the recombinant protein binds to N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and the peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro and suggested that the ligand-binding region exhibits a conformational equilibrium involving cis-trans isomerization of the Asp-282–Cys-283 peptide bond.

Surveillance systems of innate immunity are present in all multicellular organisms and play a crucial role in the first line of defense against pathogens.

In angiopoietin-2, it was found that the P domain of the fibrinogen-like domain relates to receptor binding (35Barton W.A. Tzvetkova D. Nikolov D.B.

Interestingly, although both host cells and pathogens have the same sugars recognized by ficolins and collectins on their surface, these proteins can discriminate between pathogens and the host cell. Here, we present the first crystal structure of the human M-ficolin FBG domain (FD1; 26.8 kDa/monomer). The crystal structure reveals how the three FBG domains form a trimer and provides a structural basis for understanding how these proteins discriminate between self and non-self. Purification and Crystallization of FD1—FD1, comprising residues 115–326 of M-ficolin, with the C-terminal peptide containing a c-myc epitope and a His6 tag, was overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized as described previously (36Tanio M.

The reaction mixture was incubated with 67 μl of GlcNAc-agarose beads (Sigma; 1 μl of maximally binds to about 0.7 μg of FD1 in the Tris buffer at 4 °C) in a MicroSpin column (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 or 4 °C for 2 h. After washing with the Tris buffer, the bound FD1 was eluted from the column with 200 μl of the Tris buffer containing 0.5 m GlcNAc. The eluted samples were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For the investigation of the pH-dependent GlcNAc binding activity, a 300-μl aliquot of 0.05 mg ml-1 FD1 in MES buffer (50 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2) at several pHs (between 5.2 and 7.0) was applied to a GlcNAc column (34 μl of resin) at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound protein was eluted with 300 μl of the Tris buffer containing 0.5 m GlcNAc at pH 8.0. The concentrations of the applied and eluted FD1 were estimated from the absorption at 280 nm (molar absorption coefficient: 48,700 cm-1 m-1), and the relative fractions of the eluted FD1 at each pH were evaluated using the KaleidaGraph non-linear fitting program (Synergy Software). Overall Structure of FD1—The crystal structure of FD1 was solved with molecular replacement and was refined to 1.9 Å resolution (Table 1). The structure contains one trimeric form of FD1 per asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). The quality of electron density allowed the assignment of 209 residues (Glu and Phe derived from the EcoRI site, residues 115–295 and 301–326 of M-ficolin) to monomer A, 200 residues (Phe from the EcoRI site, residues 115–293, 301–307, and 314–326) to monomer B and 212 residues (residues 115–326) to monomer C. Although GlcNAc was added to the protein solution for crystallization, no obvious electron density for the ligand was observed. Therefore, we concluded that the FD1 structure determined here corresponds to the ligand-free form. Two disulfide bonds, between Cys-118 and Cys-146 and between Cys-270 and Cys-283, were observed in each FD1 monomer. The root-mean-square deviations among the three monomers in the trimer are ∼0.6 Å for 199–205 equivalent Cα positions. The overall structure of the FD1 monomer is similar to those of TL5A (34Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The primary sequence of FD1 is 49 and 45% identical to those of the FBG domain of TL5A and the fibrinogen γ fragment, respectively. The root-mean-square deviation for the α-carbon atoms in FD1 is ∼1.1 Å as compared with TL5A (∼184 Cα positions in residues 45–262) and ∼1.3 Å as compared with the fibrinogen γ fragment (∼180 Cα positions in residues 150–389). In these three proteins, not only the Ca2+-binding site located on the P domain (Fig. 2A) but also the positions of the two disulfide bridges are essentially conserved, indicating that the innate immunity and blood coagulation systems have evolved from a common ancestor, as described by Kairies et al. (34Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding site is located near the conserved disulfide bond in the P domain (Figs. 2B and 3A). Although the overall structure of FD1 is similar to those of TL5A and the fibrinogen γ fragment, a significant difference was observed in the P domain (Fig. 2). The peptide bond between Asp-282 and Cys-283 is a normal trans bond in FD1 (Figs. 2B and 3B), whereas in the corresponding regions of TL5A (Arg-218–Cys-219) (34Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P.

This coordination geometry is identical to those of TL5A (34Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These aspartic acid residues (Asp-262 and Asp-264) are also conserved in the other two human ficolins. The electron density at the Ca2+ in monomer B was weaker than those of the other monomers, and no coordinating water molecules were found around the loop. Therefore, we assigned this position to a water molecule, instead of a Ca2+. In monomer C, one of the two water molecules coordinating the Ca2+ was replaced by the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly-250 of monomer B from a neighboring trimer in the crystal. The electron density of the Ca2+ was relatively weak in monomer C, and thus, its occupancy was assumed to be 0.5 at the refinement stage. Crystal packing may cause these differences of Ca2+ bindings between the three monomers because the Ca2+-binding sites in monomer A and C, but not that in monomer B, face the neighboring trimers in the crystal. Trimeric Formation of FD1—The trimerization of ficolins is thought to be mediated by the N-terminal collagen-like region (13Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Sugimoto R. Yae Y. Akaiwa M. Kitajima S. Shibata Y. Sato H. Hirata J. Okochi K. Izuhara K. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20721-20727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, we found that the recombinant FD1, which lacks the collagen-like region, forms a trimer in solution as judged by a dynamic light scattering experiment in 0.1–1 mg ml-1 FD1 solution (apparent molecular mass 86.3–88.9 kDa, data not shown). This finding indicates that the trimerization of M-ficolin is accomplished not only by the N-terminal collagen-like region but also by the FBG domain. Our crystal structure of FD1 clarified the details of FBG domain trimerization (Fig. 4). The A and B domains, but not the P domain, contribute to the trimerization. The buried surface areas at the monomer-monomer interfaces are about 500 Å2. Fig. 4B shows the interface of the interactions between monomers A and C. The main chains of Phe-127 and Ser-129 of one monomer form hydrogen bonds with those of Gly-180 and Gln-182 of another monomer. The hydrophobic side chains of Phe-127 and Leu-128 of one monomer are buried in a hydrophobic pocket, mainly composed of Trp-131, Leu-142, Gly-178, Gly-180, Phe-186, and Leu-188 of another monomer. The phenyl ring of Phe-127 is also in contact with the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Gln-177 and Leu-188 and the polar side chain of Asn-192 of the neighboring monomer. The carboxyl oxygen atom of Gln-177 is close to the center of the phenyl ring of Phe-127 and probably prevents its release from the hydrophobic pocket. The C=O... π interaction (44Yang X. Wu D. Randford J.D. Vittal J.J. Cryst. Growth Des. 2004; 5: 41-43Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) between these groups might contribute to preventing this release. A salt bridge between Asp-149 of one monomer and Arg-170 of another monomer further stabilizes the trimerization. Sugar Binding and Novel Peptide Binding Activities—A Glc-NAc-agarose affinity assay revealed that the GlcNAc binding activity of FD1 was enhanced at lower temperature (4 °C) and inhibited in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 5A). The binding ability of the EDTA-treated FD1 was restored by the addition of CaCl2 (data not shown), clearly indicating that M-ficolin requires Ca2+ for GlcNAc-binding. Since the Ca2+-binding site is located on the P domain (Fig. 1B), this domain is involved in ligand binding. Dithio-threitol treatment of FD1 reduced the binding activity (Fig. 5A). Since FD1 contains only two disulfide bonds (Cys-118–Cys-146 on the A domain and Cys-270–Cys-283 on the P domain), the GlcNAc-binding site would be located near the Cys-270–Cys-283 disulfide bond. Interestingly, the peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP), which mimics the N-terminal sequence of the fibrin α-chain and inhibits the polymerization of fibrin, prevents the binding of FD1 to Glc-NAc agarose (Fig. 5A). The elution of the FD1 bound to GlcNAc agarose by 50 mm GPRP peptide (data not shown) indicates that GlcNAc and GPRP share the same binding site on FD1. Although the biological significance of GPRP binding of FD1 is unknown, it suggests that M-ficolin might be involved not only in pathogen-recognition but also in blood coagulation and/or fibrinolysis"

As the origin of a “life-and-death” signal that reflects the progression toward brain stem death, the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a suitable neural substrate for mechanistic delineation of this phenomenon. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a neuroprotective role in the RVLM during brain stem death and delineated the underlying mechanisms, using a clinically relevant animal model that employed the organophosphate pesticide mevinphos (Mev) as the experimental insult. In Sprague-Dawley rats, proteomic, Western blot, and real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that Mev induced de novo synthesis of HSP60 or HSP70 in the RVLM without affecting HSP90 level. Loss-of-function manipulations of HSP60 or HSP70 in the RVLM using anti-serum or antisense oligonucleotide potentiated Mev-elicited cardiovascular depression alongside reduced nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) I/protein kinase G signaling, enhanced NOS II/peroxynitrite cascade, intensified nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, elevated cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments or activated caspase-3, and augmented the cytochrome c/caspase-3 cascade of apoptotic signaling in the RVLM. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further revealed a progressive increase in the complex formed between HSP60 and mitochondrial or cytosolic Bax or mitochondrial Bcl-2 during Mev intoxication, alongside a dissociation of the cytosolic HSP60-Bcl-2 complex. We conclude that HSP60 and HSP70 confer neuroprotection against Mev intoxication by ameliorating cardiovascular depression via an anti-apoptotic action in the RVLM. The possible underlying intracellular processes include enhancing NOS I/protein kinase G signaling and inhibiting the NOS II/peroxynitrite cascade. In addition, HSP60 exerts its effects against apoptosis by blunting Mev-induced activation of the Bax/cytochrome c/caspase-3 cascade.

Whereas brain stem death is currently the clinical definition of death in many countries (1.Report of the Medical Consultants on the Diagnosis of Death to the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research.J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1981; 246: 2184-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Hung T.P. Chen S.T. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1995; 58: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the cellular and molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon of paramount medical importance are wanting. The invariable prognosis, that asystole takes place within hours or days after the diagnosis of brain stem death (3.Pallis C. ABC of Brain Stem Death. British Medical Journal Press, London1983Google Scholar), strongly suggests that permanent impairment of the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery should precede death. It is therefore intriguing that our laboratory demonstrated previously that a common denominator exists among patients who succumbed to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (4.Yien H.W. Hseu S.S.

We found that a dramatic reduction or loss of the power density of the low frequency (LF) 3The abbreviations used are: LF, low frequency; aCSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HR, heart rate; HSF1, heat shock transcription factor 1; HSPs, heat shock proteins; HSP60, 60-kDa heat shock protein; HSP70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; HSP90, 90-kDa heat shock protein; IκB, inhibitory κB; Mev, mevinphos (3-(dimethoxyphosphinyloxyl)-2-butenoic acid methyl ester); MSAP, mean systemic arterial pressure; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PKG, protein kinase G; RVLM, rostral ventrolateral medulla; SAP, systemic arterial pressure; nt, nucleotide(s); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. component (0.04–0.15 Hz in human) in the systemic arterial pressure (SAP) spectrum, which reflects failure of brain stem cardiovascular regulatory functions, invariably precedes death. We further established that this “life-and-death” signal takes origin from the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (7.Kuo T.B.J. Yang C.C.H. Chan S.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H485-H492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the brain stem site responsible for tonic sympathetic vasomotor outflow to the blood vessels and maintenance of SAP (8.Ross C.A.

It follows that evaluation of biochemical changes in the RVLM, whose neuronal activity is reflected in the waxing and waning of the life-and-death signal, should shed light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of brain stem death. One suitable experimental animal model for mechanistic evaluation of brain stem death uses the organophosphate poison, mevinphos (3-(dimethoxyphosphinyloxyl)-2-butenoic acid methyl ester (Mev)) as the experimental insult (9.Chan J.Y.H. Chang A.Y.W. Chan S.H.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 77: 396-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The RVLM is a brain stem site via which Mev, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Category I pesticide, acts to elicit cardiovascular toxicity (10.Yen D.H.T. Yen J.C. Len W.B. Wang L.M.

Shock. 2004; 21: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More importantly, the distinct phases of augmentation followed by reduction of the LF component in the SAP spectrum exhibited during Mev intoxication can be designated as “pro-life” and “pro-death” phases in this model of brain stem death (9.Chan J.Y.H. Chang A.Y.W. Chan S.H.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 77: 396-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our laboratory demonstrated previously (11.Chan J.Y.H. Chan S.H.H. Chang A.Y.W.

Neuropharmacology. 2005; 48: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that nitric oxide generated by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) I in the RVLM, followed by activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) cascade, is responsible for the pro-life phase of Mev intoxication. On the other hand, peroxynitrite formed by a reaction between NOS II-derived NO and superoxide anion in the RVLM underlies the pro-death phase. Because death represents the end of existence for an individual, we proposed recently (9.Chan J.Y.H. Chang A.Y.W. Chan S.H.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 77: 396-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14.Li F.C.H. Chan J.Y.H. Chan S.H.H. Chang A.Y.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that multiple pro-life and pro-death programs must be activated in the RVLM during the progression toward brain stem death. In this regard, the heat shock proteins (HSPs) present themselves as another reasonable candidate for the pro-life program. The HSPs represent a group of intracellular proteins that protect cells from otherwise lethal consequences of exposure to heat, toxins, infection, seizure, trauma, ischemia, or other cellular stresses (15.Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar, 16.Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 17.Morimoto R. Santoro M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Based on the molecular size, HSPs are grouped into families that include at least HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90. The cellular protective mechanisms of HSPs are related to their chaperone functions (18.Ellis R.J. van der Vries S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which lead to the prevention of protein denaturation and promotion of refolding of damaged proteins after stress (17.Morimoto R.

Circulation. 2004; 110: 3560-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) also suggest that HSPs may interact with NOS at the level of gene regulation or NO-associated signaling cascades. For example, HSP60 (21.Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Karahashi H. Michelsen K.S. Equils O. Morrison S.G. Morrison R.P. Arditi M. J.

Med. 1999; 31: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 29.Todryk S.M. Melcher A.A. Dalgleish A.G. Vile R.G.

On the other hand, HSP60 is reportedly pro-apoptotic (31.Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) or anti-apoptotic (32.Kirchhoff S.R. Gupta S. Knowlton A.A.

Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1135-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Based on an animal model that uses Mev as the experimental insult (9.Chan J.Y.H. Chang A.Y.W. Chan S.H.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 77: 396-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that HSP60, HSP70, or HSP90 in the RVLM plays a neuroprotective role during brain stem death and delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. This hypothesis was partially validated. We demonstrated that, whereas an augmented expression of HSP60 or HSP70 in the RVLM, which resulted from de novo synthesis, plays a neuroprotective role during Mev intoxication, HSP90 is essentially not involved. Results from our mechanistic evaluations further showed that by enhancing the NOS I/PKG signaling pathway and inhibiting the NOS II/peroxynitrite cascade in the RVLM, both HSP60 and HSP70 confer neuroprotection by preventing cardiovascular depression via an anti-apoptotic action in the RVLM. In addition, HSP60 exerts its effects against apoptosis by blunting the Mev-induced activation of the Bax/cytochrome c/caspase-3 cascade. Animals−Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (278–362 g, n = 523) purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China, were used. All experimental procedures were carried out in compliance with the guidelines of our institutional animal care committee. General Preparation−Preparatory surgery for our physiological experiments was performed under an induction dose of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). This included intubation of the trachea and cannulation of the left femoral artery and both femoral veins. During the recording session, which routinely commenced 60 min after the administration of pentobarbital sodium, anesthesia was maintained by an intravenous infusion of propofol (Zeneca, Macclesfield, UK) at 20–25 mg/kg/h. This scheme (34.Yang C.H. Shyr M.H. Kuo T.B.J. Tan P.P.C. Chan S.H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1568-1574PubMed Google Scholar) provided satisfactory anesthetic maintenance while preserving the capacity of central cardiovascular regulation. The head of the animal was thereafter fixed to a stereotaxic head holder (Kopf, Tujunga, CA), and body temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a heating pad. During the experiment, animals were allowed to breathe spontaneously with room air. Recording and Power Spectral Analysis of SAP Signals−SAP signals recorded from the femoral artery were subject simultaneously to on-line power spectral analysis (7.Kuo T.B.J. Yang C.C.H. Chan S.H.H.

We were particularly interested in the LF (0.25–0.8 Hz in rat) component of SAP signals, which takes origin from the RVLM (7.Kuo T.B.J. Yang C.C.H. Chan S.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H485-H492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mirrors the prevalence of sympathetic neurogenic vasomotor discharges that emanate from this brain stem site (11.Chan J.Y.H.

Chang A.Y.W. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 1184-1194Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12.Chan J.Y.H. Chan S.H.H. Li F.C.H. Cheng H.L. Chang A.Y.W.

Chang A.Y.W. Chan S.H.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 77: 396-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Heart rate (HR) was derived instantaneously from SAP signals. The SAP spectra and power density of LF component were displayed during the experiment, alongside pulsatile SAP, mean SAP (MSAP), and HR, in an on-line and real-time manner. Microinjection of Test Agents−Microinjection bilaterally of test agent into the RVLM, each at a volume of 50 nL, was carried out stereotaxically and sequentially with a 27-gauge needle that was connected to a 0.5-μl Hamilton microsyringe (Reno, NV). The coordinates were: 4.5–5 mm posterior to lambda, 1.8–2.1 mm lateral to midline, and 8.1–8.4 mm below the dorsal surface of cerebellum (10.Yen D.H.T. Yen J.C. Len W.B. Wang L.M. Lee H.C.

Injecting the same amount of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) controlled for possible volume effect of microinjection. Test agents used included Mev (kindly provided by Huikwang Corp., Tainan Hsien, Taiwan) and a transcription inhibitor (13.Yen D.H.T. Chan J.Y.H. Tseng H.P. Huang C.L. Lee C.H. Chan S.H.H.

A goat polyclonal antiserum against HSP60 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or mouse monoclonal antiserum (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) against HSP70 or HSP90 was used to effect immunoneutralization. 0.02% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to facilitate transport of the antiserum across the cell membrane of RVLM neurons (supplemental Fig. S1B). Microinjection of normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) or normal mouse serum (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 0.02% Triton X-100 served as our vehicle control. To avoid verbose presentation, however, the phrase “0.02% Triton X-100” is omitted from subsequent narration. Gene knockdown was introduced using an antisense oligonucleotide (Quality Synthesis, Taipei, Taiwan) against the coding region nt 109–123 of hsp60 (32.Kirchhoff S.R. Gupta S. Knowlton A.A.

The corresponding sense oligonucleotide: 5′-GATGCTCGAGCCTTA-3′ (hsp60), 5′-TTCCAGCACGGCAAGGTG-3′ (hsp70) or 5′-ATGGAGAGGAAGAGGTGGAG-3′ (hsp90); or scrambled oligonucleotide 5′-GCTCGTGGTCAATAC-3′ (hsp60), 5′-TGGATCCGACATGTCAGT-3′ (hsp70) or 5′-TCTCACCCCTTCCCTCATTC-3′ (hsp90) was used as the control. The oligonucleotides were phosphorothioated in all positions and were diluted in aCSF at pH 7.4. To avoid the confounding effects of drug interactions, each animal received only one treatment regimen. Protein Extraction−Because the power density of LF component in the SAP spectrum reflects the prevalence of the life-and-death signal detected from patients intoxicated with organophosphate poisons (6.Yen D.H.T. Yien H.W. Wang L.M. Lee C.H. Chan S.H.H. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 2805-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we routinely collected tissue samples (11.Chan J.Y.H. Chan S.H.H. Chang A.Y.W. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 1184-1194Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12.Chan J.Y.H. Chan S.H.H. Li F.C.H. Cheng H.L. Chang A.Y.W.

Medullary tissues collected from anesthetized animals but without treatment served as the sham-controls. In brief, rats were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and perfused intracardially with 150 ml of warm (37 °C) saline containing heparin (100 units/ml). The brain was rapidly removed and placed on dry ice. Tissues from both sides of the ventrolateral medulla, at the level of the RVLM (0.5–1.5 mm rostral to the obex), were collected by micropunches made with a 1-mm (inner diameter) stainless steel bore. The tissues thus obtained covered the anatomical boundaries of the RVLM and were co-extensive with the penetration of, for example, the microinjected IgG (supplemental Fig. S1A). Tissues were homogenized on ice in a protein extract buffer and centrifuged. The supernatant was processed either for proteomic or Western blot analysis. In some experiments, proteins from the mitochondrial or cytosol fraction were extracted using a mitochondrial extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). We verified the purity of the mitochondrial fraction by the selective expression of the mitochondrial inner membrane-specific protein, prohibitin, or manganese superoxide dismutase, or copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in the cytosolic fraction (14.Li F.C.H.

Med. 2005; 39: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total protein or that in the mitochondrial or cytosolic extracts was estimated by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Proteomic Analysis−The proteomic map for the RVLM was generated according to procedures detailed previously (14.Li F.C.H. Chan J.Y.H. Chan S.H.H. Chang A.Y.W. Mol.

Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each silver-stained two-dimensional electrophoresis gel was scanned by a Molecular Dynamics densitometer, and protein spots were quantified and numbered using the ImageMaster 2D Elite software (Amersham Biosciences). Protein spots of interest excised from corresponding Coomassie Blue-stained gels were subject to in-gel digestion and analyzed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer system (Voyager ED-PRO, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The measured mono-isotopic masses of peptide were analyzed using MS-Fit (Protein Prospector, UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility, San Francisco, CA) and MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search programs.

The primary antisera used for the HSPs were the same as those used for immunoneutralization. The other primary antisera used included rabbit polyclonal anti-serum against NOS I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NOS II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PKG (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), Bax (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or activated caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); or mouse monoclonal antiserum against nitrotyrosine (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), prohibitin (Labvision/NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), or β-actin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The secondary antisera used included horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for HSP60; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) for HSP70, HSP90, nitrotyrosine, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, prohibitin, or β-actin; or horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for NOS I, NOS II, PKG, Bax, or activated caspase-3. Specific antibody-antigen complex was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amount of protein was quantified by the ImageMaster software (Amersham Biosciences) and was expressed as the ratio of relative to β-actin protein (for analysis of total protein or proteins in cytosolic fraction) or prohibitin (for analysis of proteins in mitochondrial fraction). Densitometric values that were not statistically different from the background were designated below detection limits. Isolation of RNA and Real-time PCR−Total RNA fr"

PtNHase was found to exhibit a bell-shaped curve for plots of relative activity versus pH at pH 3.2–11 and was found to display maximal activity between pH 7.2 and 7.8. Fits of these data provided pKES1 and pKES2 values of 5.9 ± 0.1 and 9.2 ± 0.1 (kcat′ = 130 ± 1 s-1), respectively, and pKE1 and pKE2 values of 5.8 ± 0.1 and 9.1 ± 0.1 (kcat′/Km′ = (6.5 ± 0.1) × 103 s-1 mm-1), respectively. Proton inventory studies indicated that two protons are transferred in the rate-limiting step of the reaction at pH 7.6. Because PtNHase is stable at 60 °C, an Arrhenius plot was constructed by plotting ln(kcat) versus 1/T, providing Ea = 23.0 ± 1.2 kJ/mol. The thermal stability of PtNHase also allowed ΔH0 ionization values to be determined, thus helping to identify the ionizing groups exhibiting the pKES1 and pKES2 values. Based on ΔH0ion data, pKES1 is assigned to βTyr68, whereas pKES2 is assigned to βArg52, βArg157, or αSer112 (NHases are α2β2-heterotetramers).

However, one of the most attractive features of nitrile-metabolizing enzymes is their ability to selectively hydrolyze one cyano group of a dinitrile to its corresponding amine, something that is virtually impossible using conventional chemical methods (12Wu Z.L. Li Z.Y. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; 3: 386-387Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Dadd M.R. Claridge T.D. Walton R. Pettman A.J. Knowles C.J. Enzyme Microb.

NHases are metalloenzymes that contain either a non-heme Fe(III) ion (iron-type) or a non-corrin Co(III) ion (cobalt-type) in their active site and are typically α2β2-heterotetramers (5Kovacs J.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 825-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Banerjee A. Sharma R. Banerjee U.C. Appl. Microbiol.

In all known NHases, each α-subunit has a highly homologous amino acid sequence (CXYCSCX) that forms the metal-binding site. Cobalt-type NHases contain threonine and tyrosine in the -C(T/S)YCSC(Y/T)- sequence of the active center, whereas iron-type NHases contain serine and threonine (6Banerjee A. Sharma R. Banerjee U.C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recently, both iron- and cobalt-type NHases have been crystallographically characterized (17Hourai S. Miki M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9887-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In all structures published to date, the trivalent metal ion is six-coordinate, with the remaining ligands made up of three cysteines and two amide nitrogens (Fig. 1). Interestingly, two of the active-site cysteine residues are post-translationally modified to cysteinesulfinic acid (–SO2H) and cysteinesulfenic acid (–SOH), yielding an unusual metal coordination geometry termed a “claw setting,” and it has been shown that, unless this Cys oxidation process occurs, NHase is inactive (23Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nakayama H. Dohmae N. Koshino H. Asami T. Hoshino M. Takio K. Yoshida S. Maeda M. Endo I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 11532-11538Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Dey A. Chow M.

In iron-type NHases, nitric oxide (NO) binds in place of a metal-coordinated water/hydroxide molecule, which can be photoactivated, whereas cobalt-type NHases do not bind NO (5Kovacs J.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 825-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based on theoretical calculations, the carbon–nitrogen bond in the coordinated amide of both iron- and cobalt-type NHases has significant double bond character, suggesting that it is best represented as an imidometal bond (25Boone A.J. Cory M.G. Scott M.J. Zerner M.C. Richards N.G. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 1837-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The structural characterization of both iron- and cobalt-type NHases has provided some insight into how the molecular structure controls the enzyme function. Based on these data and several elegant studies on active-site NHase model complexes (for reviews, see Refs. 5Kovacs J.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 825-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar and 16Harrop T.C. Mascharak P.K. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), four simple reaction mechanisms have been proposed (5Kovacs J.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 825-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Desai L.V. Zimmer M. Dalton Trans. 2004; 6: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In each reaction, imidate is produced as a reaction intermediate, which then isomerizes to the corresponding amide. Even though a significant amount of structural and synthetic modeling data have been reported for NHases, details of the enzymatic reaction, including which proposed mechanism is operative as well as the nature of the transition state, the identities of groups involved in proton transfers, and the role of the metal ion, remain uncertain. To gain insight into the catalytically important active-site residues and the number of protons that are transferred in the transition state, we have examined the pH and temperature dependence of the kinetic parameters and solvent isotope effect of the cobalt-type NHase from Pseudonocardia thermophila JCM 3095 (PtNHase). Based on these data, a novel catalytic mechanism is proposed. Protein Expression, Purification, and Kinetic Assay—All chemicals used in this study were purchased from commercial sources and were of the highest quality available. The plasmid encoding the α- and β-subunits of PtNHase was obtained from the International Patent Organism Depositary (unit.aist.go.jp/ipod/index_e.html) in Japan. The enzyme was purified by a significantly simplified and shortened procedure based on a previously published purification method (19Miyanaga A. Fushinobu S. Ito K. Wakagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Miyanaga A. Fushinobu S. Ito K. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21 Star™(DE3) cells containing the pUC18-NHase plasmid (20Miyanaga A. Fushinobu S. Ito K. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which includes the genes for the α- and β-subunits of NHase and an NHase activator protein, were grown at 37 °C in 5 liters of Luria-Bertani broth containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter). When the absorbance reached ∼0.8 at 600 nm, the cells were induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.25 mm Co(II) chloride. The cells were then cultured for an additional 16 h, followed by harvesting by centrifugation. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4 °C. The cell paste was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation. The cell-free extract was fractionated with 40–70% ammonium sulfate and equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1 m (NH4)2SO4 prior to hydrophobic interaction gradient chromatographic purification using phenyl-Sepharose (1 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0% isopropyl alcohol → 0 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0% isopropyl alcohol → 0 m (NH4)2SO4 and 40% isopropyl alcohol). Active fractions (∼15% isopropyl alcohol) were concentrated by ultrafiltration and further purified to >95% (SDS-PAGE) by size exclusion chromatography using Sephacryl S-300. PtNHase was assayed for catalytic activity using benzonitrile as the substrate (20Miyanaga A. Fushinobu S. Ito K. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this assay, the hydration of benzonitrile was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of benzamide at 242 nm (ε = 5.5 mm-1 cm-1). All assays were performed on a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer equipped with a constant-temperature cell holder and an ISOTEMP 2013D water bath (Fisher). Enzyme concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All assays were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). pH Profiles—The enzymatic activities of PtNHase at pH 3.2–11.0 were measured using benzonitrile as the substrate. The concentration of each buffer used was 50 mm, and the following buffers were used: borate (pH 8.50–10.50), Tris-HCl (pH 7.00–8.50), phosphate (pH 7.00–7.75), MOPS (pH 6.50–7.00), MES (pH 5.50–6.50), and acetate (pH 3.23–5.50). The kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were determined using 8–12 different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 10.0 times the observed Km value at each pH studied. Kinetic parameters and fits to the kinetic curves were obtained using IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Solvent Isotope Effect—All buffers were prepared from a freshly opened bottle of 99.9% 2H2O (Aldrich). The buffers used in the preparation of all deuterated buffers were in the anhydrous form. The pH of each buffer used was adjusted by the addition of NaOD or DCl (both 99%+ deuterium content; Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and corrected for deuteration by adding 0.4 to the reading of the pH electrode (27Salomaa P. Schaleger L.L. Long F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1-7Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). pH Dependence of the Kinetic Parameters—To examine the reaction mechanism of PtNHase, the kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were recorded as a function of pH. PtNHase catalyzed the hydration of benzonitrile at pH 7.6 and 25 °C with kcat = 123 ± 1 s-1 and Km = 20.0 ± 0.1 μm in the absence of n-butyric acid. These values are indistinguishable from those reported previously (kcat = 120 s-1 and Km = 19 μm) (20Miyanaga A. Fushinobu S. Ito K. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PtNHase was found to exhibit a bell-shaped curve for plots of relative activity versus pH at pH 3.2–11 and was found to display maximal activity between pH 7.2 and 7.8. Plots of log(kcat) and log(kcat/Km) versus pH were prepared for PtNHase and fit to Equations 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 2) (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar, 29Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics.2nd Ed.

SCHEME 2 Inspection of a plot of log(Km) versus pH (Fig. 2) indicated that the Km does not vary with pH. Therefore, plots of log(kcat) versus pH and plots of log(kcat/Km) versus pH provided similar pKa values (Table 1).TABLE 1Ionization constants for benzonitrile hydration by PtNHasekcat vs. pH pKES15.9 ± 0.1 pKES29.2 ± 0.1 kcat′ (s–1)130 ± 1kcat/Km vs. pH pKE15.8 ± 0.1 pKE29.1 ± 0.1 kcat′/Km′ (s–1 mm–1)(6.5 ± 0.1) × 103 Open table in a new tab Examination of a plot of log(kcat) versus pH revealed a bell-shaped curve that could be fit to Equation 1 (Fig. 2). The slopes of the asymptotes, calculated as described previously (30Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1997; 45: 273-387Google Scholar), for the acidic and basic limbs of log(kcat) versus pH for PtNHase are 1, indicating that one group is ionized on each limb. A good fit to Equation 1 was obtained, which yielded a pKES1 value of 5.9 ± 0.1 and a pKES2 value of 9.2 ± 0.1 (kcat′= 130 ± 1 s-1). Similar to plots of log(kcat) versus pH, fits of log(kcat/Km) versus pH to Equation 2 provided a pKE1 value of 5.8 ± 0.1 and a pKE2 value of 9.1 ± 0.1 (kcat′/Km′= (6.5 ± 0.1) × 103 s-1 mm-1) (Fig. 2). Solvent Isotope Effect—Solvent isotope effect experiments were carried out on PtNHase using benzonitrile as the substrate at pH 7.6 (p2H = p1H meter reading + 0.4) (27Salomaa P. Schaleger L.L. Long F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1-7Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar) by substituting hydrogen (1H) with deuterium (2H). kcat values for benzonitrile were measured at several different ratios of D2O and H2O, and the results were plotted as the atom fraction of deuterium versus Vn/V0, where Vn is the observed velocity at n fraction of deuterium, and V0 is the observed velocity in water (Fig. 3). Proton inventories were obtained by fitting the experimental data to equations derived from the Gross-Butler equation (Equation 3), Vn/V0=iΠvT(1−n+nϕiT)jΠvR(1−n+nϕiR)(Eq. 3) where n is the atom fraction of deuterium, vT is the number of protons transferred in the transition state, vR is the number of protons transferred in the reactant state, and ϕ is the fractionation factor defined as in Equation 4, ϕ=(XiD/XiH)/(n/(1−n))(Eq. 4) where XDi and XHi are the mole fractions of deuterons and protons in the ith transition or reactant state (31Albery W.J. Proton Transfer Reactions. Chapman & Hall, London1975Google Scholar, 32Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). At pH 7.6, the data deviate from linearity, and the best fit was obtained for a polynomial, suggesting that at least two protons are transferred in the transition state at this pH (Fig. 3). Because the largest deviation for theoretical proton inventory curves occurs at an atom fraction of 0.5 (33Elrod J.P. Hogg J.L. Quinn D.M. Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3917-3922Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Izatt R.M. Christensen J.J. Heats of Proton Ionization, pK, and Related Thermodynamic Quantities.3rd Ed. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1976Google Scholar), calculation of a midpoint partial solvent isotope effect often helps in determining the number of protons involved in the catalytic reaction. Equations 5, 6, 7, derived by Elrod et al. (33Elrod J.P. Hogg J.L. Quinn D.M. Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3917-3922Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), allowed the calculation of midpoint partial solvent isotope effects when the experimental data were obtained at different atom fractions, Oneproton:Vm/V1=(1−nm)(V0/V1)+nm(Eq. 5) Twoprotons:(Vm/V1)=((1−nm)(V0/V1)1/2+nm)2(Eq. 6) Generalsolvation:(Vm/V1)=(V0/V1)1−nm(Eq. 7) where nm = 0.49 (the H2O/D2O ratio at the midpoint), Vm/V1 equals the midpoint partial solvent isotope effect, and V0/V1 represents the total isotope effect ((velocity in 100% H2O)/(velocity in 100% D2O)). The experimental and calculated mid-point partial isotope effects are presented in Table 2. The presence of D2O lowered the catalytic activity of PtNHase, resulting in a solvent isotope effect of 2.07 (Fig. 3). The plot of the atom fraction of deuterium versus Vn/V1 ((velocity at n fraction of deuterium)/(velocity in 100% D2O)) obtained for the reaction of benzonitrile and PtNHase was best fit to Equation 6, suggesting that two protons are transferred during the rate-limiting step at pH 7.6. However, midpoint partial isotope effect calculations do not strongly distinguish between two protons transferred and generalized solvent effects (Table 2). Because the Km was found to be independent of pH over the entire pH range studied, the D(kcat/Km) for PtNHase is 1.7.TABLE 2Comparison of experimental and calculated midpoint solvent isotope effects The experiment was carried out using benzonitrile as the substrate at pH 7.6. Experimental and theoretical midpoint isotope effects were calculated for 0.49 atom fraction of deuterium.V0/V1Midpoint solvent isotope effect (Vm/V1)Calculated midpoint solvent isotope effectOne protonTwo protonsGeneralized solvation changesPtNHase2.071.451.531.451.43 Open table in a new tab Temperature Dependence of Km and kcat for PtNHase—It was reported previously that PtNHase is stable at 60 °C and pH 7.6 (35Yamaki T. Oikawa T. Ito K. Nakamura T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1997; 83: 474-477Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data are very unusual because most enzymes undergo some denaturation at temperatures above 50 °C, resulting in a decrease in Vmax (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). This observed thermal stability provides the unique opportunity to probe the thermodynamic properties of the PtNHase-catalyzed hydration of benzonitrile. Initially, the hydration rate of benzonitrile was measured in triplicate between 20 and 60 °C for PtNHase at eight substrate concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 μm. From these data, both Km and kcat values were derived by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation at each temperature studied. Both the kcat and Km values increased with increasing temperature. In a simple rapid equilibrium, Vmax/[E] = kcat, the first-order rate constant. Keeping a constant enzyme concentration, an Arrhenius plot was constructed by plotting ln(kcat) versus 1/T. A linear plot was obtained, indicating that the rate-limiting step does not change as the temperature is increased (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). From the slope of the line, the activation energy (Ea) for temperatures between 293 and 333 K was calculated to be 23.0 ± 1.2 kJ/mol (36Chen G. Edwards T. D'Souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the slope of an Arrhenius plot is equal to -Ea1/R (where R = 8.3145 J·K-1·mol-1), other thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the following relations: ΔG‡ =-RT ln(kcath/kBT), ΔH‡ = Ea - RT, and ΔS‡ = (ΔH‡ -ΔG‡)/T, where kB, h, and R are the Boltzmann, Planck, and gas constants, respectively (Table 3). Assuming that the Kd is equal to the Km, a linear plot was obtained for ln(1/Km) versus 1/T, which provides ΔH0 by multiplying the negative slope by R. The following thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the relations: ΔG0 =-RT ln(1/Km) and ΔS0 = (ΔH0 -ΔG0)/T (Table 3).TABLE 3Thermodynamic parameters for benzonitrile hydration by PtNHase at 25°CE + S → ES ΔG0 (kJ/mol)–7.3 ± 0.4 ΔH0 (kJ/mol)–10.2 ± 0.5 ΔS0 (J/mol)–9.7 ± 0.7ES → (ES··EP)‡ ΔG‡ (kJ/mol)61.1 ± 1.0 ΔH‡ (kJ/mol)18.0 ± 0.9 ΔS‡ (J/mol)–146.0 ± 0.7 Ea (kJ/mol)23.0 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab Given the thermal stability of PtNHase, the pH dependence of kcat at saturating substrate concentrations (100 μm) at several pH values between 3.2 and 10.5 were also examined at three different temperatures to determine the identity of the ionizing groups exhibiting the pKES1 and pKES2 values of 5.9 and 9.2, respectively. These data were fit to Equation 1, providing three ionization constants, one for each temperature. A plot of ionization constants versus inverse absolute temperature yields the slope (Equation 8), Slope=ΔHion/2.303·R(Eq. 8) where R is the gas constant (Fig. 4, A and B) (37Bienvenue D.L. Mathew R.S. Ringe D. Holz R.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The enthalpies of ionization calculated from these data are 7.6 ± 0.3 and 12.0 ± 0.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The enthalpy of ionization for pKES1 is in the range for tyrosine or histidine residues (6.0–7.5 kcal/mol), suggesting that the pKES1 is due to βTyr68 because no active-site histidine residues exist (34Izatt R.M. Christensen J.J. Heats of Proton Ionization, pK, and Related Thermodynamic Quantities.3rd Ed. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1976Google Scholar, 38Segel I.H. Wiley Classics Library Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The enthalpy of ionization for pKES2 is in the range for serine or arginine residues (12–13 kcal/mol), so it can be assigned to one of the following residues: αArg52, αArg157, or αSer112 (34Izatt R.M. Christensen J.J. Heats of Proton Ionization, pK, and Related Thermodynamic Quantities.3rd Ed. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1976Google Scholar, 38Segel I.H.

Simple catalytic mechanisms for NHases have been proposed based on x-ray crystal structures, theoretical modeling studies, synthetic models, and limited kinetic and spectroscopic studies (5Kovacs J.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 825-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Harrop T.C. Mascharak P.K. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Desai L.V.

Soc. 1987; 109: 5848-5850Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the most widely accepted mechanism of NHases, the nitrile moiety of the substrate binds directly to the metal center, displacing the active-site water/hydroxide group and allowing the metal ion to act as a Lewis acid, activating the coordinated nitrile toward nucleophilic attack (26Desai L.V. Zimmer M. Dalton Trans. 2004; 6: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the nucleophilic water/hydroxide is likely provided/activated by an active-site base. This mechanism was proposed based on observed changes in electronic absorption and EPR spectra upon the addition of nitriles (39Sugiura Y. Kuwahara J. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5848-5850Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, synthetic model studies have revealed that nitriles can readily exchange with low spin Fe(III) and Co(III) centers (40Shearer J. Jackson H.L. Schweitzer D. Rittenberg D.K. Leavy T.M. Kaminsky W. Scarrow R.C. Kovacs J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11417-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 41Shearer J. Kung I.Y. Lovell S. Kaminsky W. Kovacs J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the NO-bound iron-type NHase from Rhodococcus erythropolis revealed that NO binds in place of the metal-coordinated water molecule in the wild-type enzyme (42Nagashima S. Nakasako M. Dohmae N. Tsujimura M. Takio K. Odaka M. Yohda M. Kamiya N. Endo I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, the x-ray crystal structure of the cobalt-type NHase from P. thermophila bound by the weak competitive inhibitor n-butyric acid revealed that a carboxylate oxygen atom binds to the metal ion, displacing the metal-coordinated water molecule (20Miyanaga A. Fushinobu S. Ito K. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both of these structural studies are consistent with the direct interaction of the nitrile with the active-site metal ion. Moreover, theoretical modeling studies have suggested that nitriles can be accommodated in the active site of the NHase from R. erythropolis and that the nitrile can bind to the active-site metal (26Desai L.V. Zimmer M. Dalton Trans. 2004; 6: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 43Greene S.N. Richards N.G.J. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 45: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, to date, no detailed catalytic mechanism has been proposed for any NHase, in part because of a lack of detailed kinetic studies. To examine the reaction mechanism of PtNHase, we initially examined the kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km for the hydration of benzonitrile as a function of pH. PtNHase was found to exhibit a bell-shaped curve"
https://openalex.org/W2131411742,"The green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum synthesizes three types of (bacterio)chlorophyll ((B)Chl): BChl aP, Chl aPD, and BChl cF. During the synthesis of all three molecules, a C-8 vinyl substituent is reduced to an ethyl group, and in the case of BChl cF, the C-82 carbon of this ethyl group is subsequently methylated once or twice by the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme BchQ. The C. tepidum genome contains homologs of two genes, bchJ (CT2014) and CT1063, that are highly homologous to genes, bchJ and AT5G18660, and that have been reported to encode C-8 vinyl reductases in Rhodobacter capsulatus and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. To determine which gene product actually encodes a C-8 vinyl reductase activity, the bchJ and CT1063 genes were insertionally inactivated in C. tepidum. All three Chls synthesized by the CT1063 mutant of C. tepidum have a C-8 vinyl group. Using NADPH but not NADH as reductant, recombinant BciA reduces the C-8 vinyl group of 3,8-divinyl-protochlorophyllide in vitro. These data demonstrate that CT1063, renamed bciA, encodes a C-8 divinyl reductase in C. tepidum. The bchJ mutant produces detectable amounts of Chl aPD, BChl aP, and BChl cF, all of which have reduced C-8 substituents, but the mutant cells secrete large amounts of 3,8-divinyl-protochlorophyllide a into the growth medium and have a greatly reduced BChl cF content. The results suggest that BchJ may play an important role in substrate channeling and/or regulation of Chl biosynthesis but show that it is not a vinyl reductase. Because only some Chl-synthesizing organisms possess homologs of bciA, at least two types of C-8 vinyl reductases must occur. The green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum synthesizes three types of (bacterio)chlorophyll ((B)Chl): BChl aP, Chl aPD, and BChl cF. During the synthesis of all three molecules, a C-8 vinyl substituent is reduced to an ethyl group, and in the case of BChl cF, the C-82 carbon of this ethyl group is subsequently methylated once or twice by the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme BchQ. The C. tepidum genome contains homologs of two genes, bchJ (CT2014) and CT1063, that are highly homologous to genes, bchJ and AT5G18660, and that have been reported to encode C-8 vinyl reductases in Rhodobacter capsulatus and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. To determine which gene product actually encodes a C-8 vinyl reductase activity, the bchJ and CT1063 genes were insertionally inactivated in C. tepidum. All three Chls synthesized by the CT1063 mutant of C. tepidum have a C-8 vinyl group. Using NADPH but not NADH as reductant, recombinant BciA reduces the C-8 vinyl group of 3,8-divinyl-protochlorophyllide in vitro. These data demonstrate that CT1063, renamed bciA, encodes a C-8 divinyl reductase in C. tepidum. The bchJ mutant produces detectable amounts of Chl aPD, BChl aP, and BChl cF, all of which have reduced C-8 substituents, but the mutant cells secrete large amounts of 3,8-divinyl-protochlorophyllide a into the growth medium and have a greatly reduced BChl cF content. The results suggest that BchJ may play an important role in substrate channeling and/or regulation of Chl biosynthesis but show that it is not a vinyl reductase. Because only some Chl-synthesizing organisms possess homologs of bciA, at least two types of C-8 vinyl reductases must occur. Plants and bacteria convert light energy into chemical potential energy through the process known as photosynthesis. Antenna complexes harvest the light energy, and protein-pigment complexes known as reaction centers perform photochemical reactions that lead to stable charge separation. Reaction centers contain special pairs of (bacterio)-chlorophyll ((B)Chl) 2The abbreviations used are: BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; BChl aP, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with phytol; BChl cF, bacteriochlorphyll c esterified with farnesol; Chl(s), chlorophyll(s); Chl aPD, chlorophyll a esterified with Δ2,6-phytadienol; DPOR, light-independent (dark) protochlorophyllide reductase; DV, 3,8-divinyl; LPOR, light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase; MV, 3-monovinyl; PChlide, protochlorophyllide; Protopheo, protopheophorbide; DVR, DV reductase; GSB, green sulfur bacteria; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. molecules that initiate these photochemical reactions (1Golbeck J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Allen J.P. Williams J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition to this essential function, all known photosynthetic antenna systems rely on cyclic tetrapyrroles (Chls) or linear tetrapyrroles (bilins) for light harvesting. A variety of antenna Chls are found in nature, and these molecules carry different modifications of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. These chemical differences help an organism to fine-tune the absorption and energy-transfer features of its light-harvesting complexes, and these differences also influence the pigment-protein and pigment-pigment interactions within the antenna system (3Green B.R. Parson W.W. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration, Light-Harvesting Antennas in Photosynthesis.Vol. 13. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004Google Scholar). Most Chls and BChls in plants and bacteria carry an ethyl substituent, or less frequently a vinyl group, at the C-8 position of the (bacterio)-chlorin macrocycle. For example, Chls a and b occur as the 3-monovinyl (MV) derivatives in green plants, but Chl precursors sometimes accumulate as 3,8-divinyl (DV) intermediates, and the ratio between the two forms can vary depending on the species, tissue and growth conditions (4Kim J.S. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 29: 327-334Google Scholar). It has been proposed that plants have parallel routes for the biosynthesis of the DV and MV precursors of Chl, and that several enzymes could thus be responsible for reducing the C-8 vinyl groups of the different precursors (5Kolossov V.L. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Kolossov V.L. Bohnert H.J. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 348: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that a single enzyme acts as the DV reductase (DVR) activity in maize (7Bazzaz M.B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1981; 2: 199-207Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined whether one or multiple enzymes are responsible for the reduction of the DV-Chl intermediates in plants. With the exception of some Prochlorococcus spp., which produce 3,8-divinyl-Chl a and b (8Partensky F. Hess W.R. Vaulot D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 106-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BChls and Chls in bacteria mostly occur with an ethyl group at the C-8 position. Green sulfur bacteria (GSB) also synthesize BChls that carry reduced ethyl substituents at the C-8 position, and these organisms further methylate the C-82 carbon of the ethyl group in their antenna BChls to yield a mixture of BChls alkylated to different extents at the C-8 position (9Bobe F.W. Pfennig N. Swanson K.L. Smith K.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4340-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Through genetic and biochemical studies of BChl a biosynthesis in purple bacteria, it was determined that the first step after the insertion of the Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX and the formation of the isocyclic ring is the reduction of the vinyl group at the C-8 position of the 3,8-divinyl-protochlorophyllide (DV-PChlide) to an ethyl group (10Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A mutant of Rhodobacter capsulatus with an inactive copy of bchJ, a gene found in the photosynthetic gene cluster of purple bacteria, was shown to accumulate and secrete large amounts of DV-PChlide; thus, it was proposed that bchJ encoded the enzyme responsible for the reduction of the C-8 vinyl group (11Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3732-3740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An ortholog of the bchJ gene is present in the Chlorobium tepidum genome (12Eisen J.A. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Heidelberg J.F. Wu M. Dodson R.J. Deboy R. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K.

U.S. A. 2002; 99: 9509-9514Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the product of this gene was presumed to perform the DVR function (12Eisen J.A. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Heidelberg J.F. Wu M. Dodson R.J. Deboy R. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Durkin A.S. Kolonay J.L. Yang F. Holt I. Umayam L.A. Mason T. Brenner M. Shea T.P. Parksey D. Nierman W.C.

U.S. A. 2002; 99: 9509-9514Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, higher plants and cyanobacteria, which produce MV-Chl a, do not have any detectable homolog of bchJ. In fact, as recently as 2004 this was the only step of Chl biosynthesis in plants for which a gene remained to be identified (13Eckhardt U. Grimm B. Hortensteiner S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 56: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In early 2005 two groups independently reported that a protein unrelated to BchJ and encoded by AT5G18660 was responsible for the reduction of the C-8 vinyl group in the biosynthesis of Chl a in Arabidopsis thaliana (14Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Nakanishi H. Nozue H. Suzuki K. Kaneko Y. Taguchi G. Hayashida N. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an open reading frame encoding a conserved hypothetical protein (CT1063), which encodes a protein with a very high degree of sequence identity to the AT5G18660 product, is found in the genome of C. tepidum. To determine the function of this gene and to determine whether bchJ encodes a DV-PChlide reductase, the CT1063 and bchJ (CT2014) genes were insertionally inactivated, and the resulting mutants were characterized biochemically. HPLC and HPLC-MS analyses of the pigments from each mutant revealed that CT1063, whose product is orthologous to the A. thaliana protein AT5G18660, encodes an enzyme that is responsible for the reduction of the C-8 vinyl moieties of Chl aPD, BChl aP, and BChl cF in C. tepidum. Furthermore, the bciA gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and recombinant BciA was shown to utilize NADPH as the coenzyme for reduction of the C-8 vinyl group of DV-PChlide in vitro. In contrast, the bchJ mutant produced Chls in which the C-8 vinyl group was reduced. However, consistent with a role for BchJ in the synthesis or regulation of (B)Chl biosynthesis, the bchJ mutant cells have a greatly reduced BChl cF content and excrete large amounts of DV-PChlide a into the growth medium. The possible roles and distributions of these two proteins among Chl-synthesizing organisms are discussed. Construction of Mutants—The plating strain WT2321 of C. tepidum (16Wahlund T.M. Madigan M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2583-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) derived from strain ATCC 49652 (17Wahlund T.M. Woese C.R. Castenholz R.W. Madigan M.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 81-90Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar) was used in all experiments. All cultures were grown anaerobically in liquid CL medium or solid CP medium as described (18Frigaard N.U. Bryant D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Culture transfers and growth on solid medium were performed in a Coy Anaerobic Chamber (Grass Lake, MI) with an atmosphere composed of 10% CO2 and 10% H2 balanced with N2. The constructs for inactivating CT1063 and CT2014 were made by PCR by amplifying a region of the gene using the primers 5′-TACTGGCTGAATTCTGTAACGGCTCTC-3′ and 5′-ACTCCCGGTTGTTGCTGCAGTTGAGTTCCAC-3′ for CT1063 and 5′-GGCATCACAGGAATTCCAGCACAGCA-3′ and 5′-ACATCCGGATCGAGATCTAGTCGCTC-3′ for CT2014 from genomic DNA. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pUC19 using EcoRI and PstI sites (underlined) engineered into the primers for CT1063 and EcoRI and BglII sites for CT2014. To insertionally inactivate these genes, the aadA gene, which confers spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance, was inserted into the ClaI site of CT1063 and the BclI site of CT2014, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). The resulting plasmids were linearized by digestion with AhdI and used to transform wild-type C. tepidum cells as described (19Frigaard N.U. Voigt G.D. Bryant D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Segregation of the mutants was confirmed by PCR as described (19Frigaard N.U. Voigt G.D. Bryant D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2, C and D). Pigment Analysis—Cell cultures (25 ml) were grown at 42 °C in an anaerobic chamber for 24–36 h. The culture was diluted 1:3 (v/v) in aqueous buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and the whole cell absorption spectrum from 350 to 900 nm was recorded using a Genesys Spectrophotometer (Thermo-Spectronic, Rochester, NY). The absorption spectrum of the extracted pigments was also recorded in methanol (1:9, v/v) in the same manner. For the HPLC and HPLC-MS analyses, cells from 1 ml of a dense culture were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pigments were extracted by sonication in acetone: methanol (7:2, v/v). The pigment extract was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC as described (20Frigaard N.U. Takaichi S. Hirota M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 343-349Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to resolve the different BChl c species as well as BChl a and Chl a. ChemStation Rev. A.10.03 software by Agilent Technologies was used to analyze the chromatograms and the absorption spectra from the different samples and the eluants. Samples for HPLC-MS were prepared in the manner described above and were analyzed in a Micromass Quattro II mass spectrometer equipped with a Shimadzu LC10ADvp pump (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). The resulting data were analyzed with MassLynx software (version 3.5; Micromass, Ltd., Manchester, UK). Spent growth medium was collected by centrifuging 1 ml of a dense culture, then transferring the supernatant to a clean tube and centrifuging again to remove all suspended cells from the medium. The absorption spectrum of the medium was recorded as described for the cell cultures. The absorption in methanol was obtained by diluting the spent medium with methanol in a 1:3 (v/v) ratio. To perform HPLC analyses of the spent growth media, the clarified medium (1 ml) was dried under vacuum and extracted with 400 μl of acetone:methanol (7:2, v/v). The extract was filtered over 0.4-μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and dried under vacuum. The pigments were extracted again with acetone: methanol (7:2, v/v) immediately before injection in the HPLC. The method used to separate these compounds was a modified version of the method described (20Frigaard N.U. Takaichi S. Hirota M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 343-349Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Solvent A (62.5% water, 21% methanol, 16.5% acetonitrile, 10 mm ammonium acetate) was used as the stationary phase and solvent B (50% methanol, 20% acetonitrile, 30% ethyl acetate) was used as the mobile phase using the following gradient. At the time of injection, the mobile phase was 20% B at a flow rate of 0.75 ml min–1; the % B increased linearly to 70% B over 10 min, at which point the flow rate was increased to 1.0 ml min–1. This was followed by a linear gradient to 100% B over 30 min and kept isocratic at 100% B for another 10 min. Finally, the percentage of B was reduced to 20% with a linear gradient over 10 min and the flow rate reduced to 0.75 ml min–1. Samples for mass analysis were prepared in the same way and analyzed as described above. To calculate the protein:pigment ratios, cells from a dense culture (1 ml of a culture with A600 nm between 1.6 and 1.8 that had been grown at a light intensity of 90 μmol photons m–2 s–1) were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was extracted with 1 ml of acetone:methanol (7:2, v/v) and centrifuged again to pellet the denatured protein. The pigment content was determined by absorbance assuming, for the bciA mutant extracts, that the molar extinction coefficient at 667 nm (ϵ667 nm) of the 8-vinyl-BChl c was 69,717 liters mol–1 cm–1 (21Stanier R.Y. Smith J.H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 41: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and that the distribution of homologs was 5% 8-vinyl-12-methyl-BChl c and 95% 8-vinyl-12-ethyl-BChl c, and that the molar extinction coefficient at 770 nm (ϵ770 nm) of 8-vinyl-BChl a was 54,630 liter mol–1 cm–1 (22Permentier H.P. Schmidt K.A. Kobayashi M. Akiyama M. Hager-Braun C. Neerken S. Miller M. Amesz J. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the extracts from the bchJ mutant, the same extinction coefficients but a distribution of BChl c homologs of 67% 12-ethyl-BChl c and 33% [Pr,E]-BChl c were used. The protein content was determined using the Sigma Protein Assay Kit P5656 as described by the manufacturer. Samples were analyzed in triplicate for each strain and the results are the average of two independent determinations. Sequence Analysis and Phylogeny—The A. thaliana protein sequence was obtained from the Entrez Protein data base (NP_197367). The amino acid sequence obtained was then used as a query for tblastn analysis using the freely available software from NCBI (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). The sequences for all the bacterial orthologs, except that of R. capsulatus SB1003, were obtained from the Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomics data base. The R. capsulatus SB1003 amino acid sequences were obtained from the Integrated Genomics (Chicago, IL) website. The alignments and neighbor-joining trees were constructed using MacVector (version 7.1.1, Accelrys Inc., Burlington, MA). In Vitro Protein Assay—An expression construct for bciA was made by amplifying the gene from C. tepidum genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CTGGCTATTGCATATGTCATCTTCGTC-3′ and 5′-TGTTGGCTTTGAGATCTACGAGGAAG-3′. The resulting PCR product was subcloned using the Invitrogen TOPO-TA cloning kit (Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. The region containing the insert was then excised from the TOPO-TA vector using the NdeI and BamHI sites engineered into the primers (underlined) and cloned into pET-28a (Novagen catalog number 69864, Madison, WI), which has a kanamycin resistance cassette and which added an N-terminal polyhistidine tag to the BciA protein. A cell extract containing the active protein was obtained by expressing the protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells containing the expression plasmid were grown at 18 °C until they reached an A600 nm of 0.6. The expression of bciA was then induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were collected after 8 h of induction. The pellet was stored overnight at –20 °C. The pellet was thawed and resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and the cells were disrupted by three passes through a chilled French pressure cell at 138 megapascal. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4,300 × g for 15 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The DV-PChlide substrate was purified from the spent medium collected from 2-liter cultures of the bchJ mutant. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation in a Sorvall SLC-4000 rotor at 5,000 × g for 20 min. The spent media was then extracted with 1/10 volume of ethyl ether. The ether phase was collected, placed in 5-ml glass vials, and dried under nitrogen gas. The dried pigments were stored at –20 °C until required. For use in the assay the substrate was solubilized in 80% (v/v) acetone. To assay the activity of BciA, assay buffer (500 μl of 80 mm potassium citrate, 0.5 mm NADPH, pH 6.3) was added to an equal volume of the clarified cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The DV-PChlide solution (80 μl) was added to the mixture to initiate the reaction. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min, was stopped by the addition of acetone (500 μl), and was centrifuged to pellet the precipitated protein. The pigments were extracted from the pellet with acetone and analyzed by HPLC and HPLC-MS as described above. Identification of the Divinyl Reductase—A tblastn analysis of the nucleotide databases revealed that one of the closest homologs of the A. thaliana protein AT5G18660 in the available sequences is the C. tepidum hypothetical protein CT1063. The translated amino acid sequence (see supplemental Fig. S1) shares 60% identity and 75% similarity with the DVR recently identified in A. thaliana (14Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To verify the function of CT1063 in C. tepidum, open reading frame CT1063 was insertionally inactivated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm that the bchJ gene (CT2014) was not responsible for the reduction of the DV-PChlide in C. tepidum, the bchJ gene (CT2014) was also insertionally inactivated. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, homozygous mutants were obtained for both genes; these data indicate that the products of CT1063 and CT2014 are not required for viability of C. tepidum cells. HPLC and HPLC-MS of Chls in the CT1063::aadA and bchJ::aadA Mutant Cells—An HPLC chromatogram of a pigment extract from C. tepidum wild-type cells recorded at 667 nm, the absorbance maximum of BChl c, shows four main peaks that elute between 18 and 24 min and that correspond to the differently methylated homologs of BChl cF (Fig. 3B; see Ref. 9Bobe F.W. Pfennig N. Swanson K.L. Smith K.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4340-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The HPLC chromatogram recorded at 667 nm of the pigment extract from the CT1063::aadA mutant revealed only two Bchl cF-related peaks, indicating that methylation was only occurring at the C-121 position. The retention times for these peaks were ∼30 s longer than those for the corresponding peaks in the extract from wild-type cells (compare Fig. 3, A and B). The absorbance spectra of the two BChl cF-related compounds from the CT1063::aadA mutant showed features similar to those of BChl cF, with a Qy maximum at 667 nm, but the Soret absorption peak was red-shifted by 10 nm from 435 to 445 nm (Fig. 3C). The red-shifted Soret absorbance maximum is consistent with the presence of a vinyl group attached to the chlorin macrocycle, and from the absence of C-82 methylation, it can be inferred that the vinyl group must occur at the C-8 position. HPLC-MS analyses confirmed that the two BChl cF derivatives in the CT1063::aadA mutant were 2 mass units lighter (i.e. 790 and 804 Da) than their counterparts in wild-type cells (792 and 806 Da). These data confirm the presence of a vinyl group on these two molecules (Fig. 3, A and B). Insertional inactivation of open reading frame CT1063 also altered the properties of Chl aPD and BChl aP. The absorption spectrum of Chl aPD from the CT1063::aadA mutant also had a Soret peak whose maximal absorbance was red-shifted by ∼10 nm from 432 to 443 nm (Fig. 4B), and the mass of this Chl aPD derivative was 2 Da less (888 Da) than that of Chl aPD from wild-type cells (890 Da) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, BChl aP from the CT1063::aadA mutant had a mass of 908.5 Da, which is 2 Da less than the mass of BChl aP from the wild-type cells (910.5 Da) (Fig. 4C). However, the Soret absorption maxima for BChl aP from the two strains were identical (Fig. 4D). These results further support the assignment of the vinyl group to the C-8 position. BChl a, a bacteriochlorin, has a single bond joining the C-7 and C-8 carbons, in contrast to BChl c and Chl aPD, which are both chlorins, which have a double bond joining the C-7 and C-8 carbons. From these data, it can be concluded that open reading frame CT1063, which has been renamed bciA in accordance with established bacterial gene nomenclature rules (24Demerec M. Adelberg E.A. Clark A.J. Hartman P.E. Genetics. 1966; 54: 61-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bachman B.J. Low K.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 1-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), encodes the only C-8 vinyl reductase in C. tepidum and that the BciA enzyme is responsible for the reduction of the C-8 vinyl groups of Chl a, BChl a, and BChl c to the corresponding ethyl groups. HPLC analyses of the bchJ::aadA mutant revealed that the BChl cF homologs had identical elution times and masses (Fig. 5A) and absorption properties (Fig. 5B) as the BChl homologs of the wild-type strain. Similarly, BChl aP and Chl aPD from the bchJ::aadA mutant had retention times and masses (data not shown) and absorbance spectra (Fig. 5, C and D) that were identical to those of these compounds from the wild-type strain. However, the total BChl c content in the bchJ mutant was severely reduced (Fig. 5A and Table 1). These results, together with the presence of DV-BChls in the bciA mutant establish that bchJ does not encode the C-8 vinyl reductase in C. tepidum.TABLE 1Pigment content on the basis of total cell protein, calculated as micrograms of pigment (mg protein)–1, for the bciA::aadA mutant, bchJ::aadA mutant, and wild-type cellsMutantBChl aBChl cCarotenoidsWT8.4 ± 0.789.5 ± 2.99.3 ± 0.2bciA7.9 ± 1.1110.8 ± 4.210.3 ± 0.5bchJ3.5 ± 0.78.4 ± 0.613.5 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Pigment Content of Whole Cells—The cells of the bciA::aadA mutant were dark green in color and similar in appearance to wild-type cells. However, it should be noted that the absorption maximum of the BChl c aggregates in the bciA::aadA mutant was blue-shifted to 724 nm (Fig. 6A). This blue-shifted absorption maximum is similar to that observed in a bchQ mutant, which like the bciA mutant synthesizes BChl c that is not methylated at the C-82 position. 3A. Gomez Maqueo Chew and D. A. Bryant, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, the bchJ::aadA cells were orange in color, which suggested that these cells had a severely reduced BChl c content (see Refs. 19Frigaard N.U. Voigt G.D. Bryant D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The whole cell absorption spectrum of the mutant and wild-type cells confirmed this observation (Fig. 6A). To determine the amounts of BChl c, BChl a, and carotenoids in the bciA and bchJ mutant cells with respect to those of the wild-type cells, the pigment to protein ratios were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These analyses confirmed that the bchJ::aadA mutant contained only 9% of the BChl c found in the wild-type cells. In contrast, bciA::aadA mutant cells, which contain 8-vinyl-BChl c, accumulated 23% more BChl c than the wild type when grown under the same growth conditions. The BChl a content of the bchJ::aadA mutant cells was also reduced to only 41% of that of the wild type; however, the BChl a content of the bciA::aadA mutant cells was only 6% lower than that of the wild type (Table 1). Carotenoids were more abundant in both mutants than in the wild type. A large difference was visible even in the in vivo absorbance of the bchJ::aadA culture (Fig. 6B). The bchJ::aadA mutant had 46% more carotenoids than the wild type, whereas the bciA::aadA mutant had 11% more carotenoids under identical growth conditions (Table 1). Analysis of the Spent Growth Media—The spent growth medium of cultures of the bchJ::aadA mutant was a golden-orange color when the cells were thoroughly removed by centrifugation. The absorbance spectrum of the spent medium in methanol revealed peaks at 422, 440, 583, and 635 nm (Fig. 7). These values are similar but not identical to those for MV-PChlide a and its demetallated analog, MV-protopheophorbide a (MV-Protopheo a; also known as pheoporphyrin a5). HPLC analyses showed that there were indeed two compounds in the spent medium (Fig. 8, top) with peaks resembling MV-protochlorophyllide (MV-PChlide) (Fig. 8B) and MV-Protopheo a (Fig. 8A). The HPLC-MS analysis of the spent medium showed that the two compounds had masses of 610 and 588 Da, which are 2 mass units lighter than the masses of MV-PChlide (612 Da) and MV-Protopheo a (590 Da). These data establish that the substance excreted into the media by the bchJ::aadA mutant cells is DV-PChlide.FIGURE 8HPLC elution profile of pigments in spent growth medium.

A γ2(R43Q) substitution is linked to childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizure, and a γ2(K289M) mutation is associated with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. To understand the effect of these mutations, surface targeting of GABAA receptors was analyzed by subunit-specific immunofluorescent labeling of living cells. We first transfected hippocampal neurons in culture with recombinant γ2 constructs and showed that the γ 2(R43Q) mutation prevented surface expression of the subunit, unlike γ2(K289M) substitution. Several γ2-subunit constructs, bearing point mutations within the Arg-43 domain, were expressed in COS-7 cells with α3- and β3-subunits. R43Q and R43A substitutions dramatically reduced surface expression of the γ2-subunit, whereas R43K, P44A, and D39A substitutions had a lesser, but still significant, impact and K289M substitution had no effect. Whereas the mutant γ2(R43Q) was retained within intracellular compartments, αβ complexes were still targeted at the cell membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that γ2(R43Q) was able to associate with α3- or β3-subunits, although the stoichiometry of the complex with α3 was altered. Our data show that γ2(R43Q) is not a dominant negative and that the mutation leads to a modification of GABAA receptor subunit composition on the cell surface that impairs the synaptic targeting in neurons. This study reveals an involvement of the γ2-Arg-43 domain in the control of receptor assembly that may be relevant to the effect of the heterozygous γ2(R43Q) mutation leading to childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizure.

A modification in the GABAergic systems has been postulated in many neurological and psychiatric diseases (1Korpi E.R. Sinkkonen S.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 12-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For instance, alteration or modulation of GABA neurotransmission plays an important role in epilepsy mechanisms and treatment (2Noebels J.L. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, several mutations of GABAA receptor genes have recently been associated with epileptic syndromes (5Baulac S. Huberfeld G. Gourfinkel-An I. Mitropoulou G. Beranger A. Prud'homme J.F.

These mutations offer an opportunity to obtain new insights into the structure and function of GABAA receptors (9Hales T.G. Tang H. Bollan K.A. Johnson S.J. King D.P. McDonald N.A. Cheng A.

The ionotropic GABA receptors, mediating fast inhibitory transmission, are heteromeric structures composed of a combination of five out of at least 18 different subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, ϵ, θ, δ, and ρ1–3), grouped into several classes (12Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Brown N. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7241-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that the subunit composition determines their affinity for GABA and the specific effect of allosteric modulators, as well as receptor trafficking. The major GABAA receptor in the brain is believed to consist of two α1-, two β2-, and one γ2-subunits (14Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46020-46025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that the γ2-subunit plays an essential role in the response to benzodiazepine modulators and receptor targeting (15Fritschy J.M. Brunig I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 299-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). An R43Q mutation in the γ2-subunit N-terminal domain has been found to cause childhood absence epilepsy with febrile seizure (6Wallace R.H. Marini C. Petrou S. Harkin L.A. Bowser D.N. Panchal R.G. Williams D.A. Sutherland G.R. Mulley J.C. Scheffer I.E. Berkovic S.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 49-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the consequences of this mutation on GABAA receptors expressed in different heterologous cell types has produced conflicting data, raising the question of the subunit composition of receptors on the cell surface. It has been shown that the mutated subunit does not modify benzodiazepine sensitivity of GABAA receptors whereas most of the complexes are retained intracellularly (10Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kang J.Q. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8672-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), in contradiction with other findings showing that γ2(R43Q) specifically modifies pharmacological and functional properties (6Wallace R.H. Marini C. Petrou S. Harkin L.A. Bowser D.N. Panchal R.G. Williams D.A. Sutherland G.R. Mulley J.C. Scheffer I.E. Berkovic S.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 49-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hales T.G.

Moreover, none of these experiments were performed on neurons. To elucidate whether γ2(R43Q) mutation altered subunit assembly or trafficking, we decided to study the surface expression of recombinant GABAA receptors by subunit-specific labeling. Labeling of transfected neurons showed that the γ2(R43Q) mutation prevented surface targeting. Co-expression experiments in heterologous cells showed that the γ2(R43Q)-subunit was retained intracellularly, as it was in neurons, whereas GABAA receptor complexes reached the cell surface membrane. Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a modification in subunit assembly induced by the γ2(R43Q) mutation. Altogether, our findings indicate a relationship between the expression of GABAA receptors on the cell surface and epilepsy. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Eurobio). Cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium onto 12-mm glass coverslips in 24- or 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Embryonic hippocampal neurons were obtained from E18 rat embryos as described earlier (19Boue-Grabot E. Emerit M.B. Toulme E. Seguela P. Garret M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6967-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected hippocampi were incubated in trypsin and mechanically dissociated using a Pasteur pipette. The cells were counted and plated onto poly-d-lysin-coated 12-mm glass coverslips in complete Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 0.01% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with conditioned medium obtained by incubating complete Neurobasal medium on glial cultures for 24–48 h. DNA Constructs—Rat α1, α3, β3, and γ2 GABAA subunits were subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). We used constructs that were available from previous studies (20Boue-Grabot E. Toulme E. Emerit M.B. Garret M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52517-52525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 6-Myc epitope (MEQKLISEEDLNE, repeated 6 times) was inserted between amino acids 4 and 5 of the γ2S- or γ2L-subunits. As previously described, an insertion within this domain does not modify the functional properties of GABA- or glutamate-gated channels (19Boue-Grabot E. Emerit M.B. Toulme E. Seguela P. Garret M. J.

Receptor mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction with the wild-type plasmid as a DNA template, using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to minimize artifactual mutations. Point mutations were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by automatic dideoxy DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Meylan, France). Cell Transfection—COS-7 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer specifications. Equal amounts of α3- and β3-subunit cDNAs (0.3 μg/well in 24-well plates for immunochemistry, 0.6 μg/well in 6-well plates for biochemistry) were mixed with different amounts (equal or 8-fold) of wild-type or mutated γ2 cDNAs and then added to FuGENE 6. Cells were incubated for 24 h with cDNAs before analysis. Hippocampal neurons were transfected at 7–11 days in vitro using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer specifications. Briefly, 0.5 μg of cDNAs, coding for wild-type or mutated γ2-subunits, were mixed with 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Neurobasal medium. The cDNAs were then incubated with neurons in serum-free medium for 40–50 min before replacing the latter with conditioned complete Neurobasal medium (see above). Neurons appeared morphologically normal and expressed the neuronal marker NeuN (not shown). The cells were analyzed 24–60 h after transfection. Immunocytochemistry—For living cell surface labeling, COS-7 cells and hippocampal neurons were incubated with antibodies at room temperature for 20 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Neurobasal medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, respectively. Antibodies were raised in rabbit against the α1 or α3 GABAA subunit N termini (Alomone Labs, Israel) or the Myc tag (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). Sera were diluted 1:1000 (anti-α3), 1:500 (anti-α1), or 1:100 (anti-Myc) in medium. After incubation, cells were washed quickly by dipping coverslips in medium and fixed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% sucrose and 4% paraformaldehyde preheated to 37 °C, washed in PBS, and blocked in 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 50 mm glycine (in PBS) for 15 min. Cells were washed in PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. After cell permeabilization using 0.3% Triton X-100, intracellular tagged γ2-subunits were detected by incubating the cells with a mouse anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (1:100; Roche Applied Science) for 2 h. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were detected using an Alexa Fluor 568-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes) and an FITC-coupled anti-mouse antibody (1:200; Chemicon), respectively. Quantitative Analysis of Fluorescence Signals—Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope, with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. Quantification of fluorescence signals and background substraction were performed using Metamorph Software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downington, PA). For each image acquired, background levels were determined using the surface and intracellular signals measured in neighboring non-transfected cells and subtracted from the values obtained in transfected cells. Numerical data are presented as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance, assessed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (Dunn's method) test (unless otherwise stated), was taken as p < 0.05 (Sigmastat; SPSS Inc.). Coimmunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 mm EDTA, and 10 mm KCl, pH 8, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The buffer was then adjusted to 12% sucrose, and after four more strokes the cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min to remove genomic DNA. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was recovered, and cell membranes were solubilized with 15 strokes in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% deoxycholate, pH 8, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors and then incubated for 45 min. The sample was centrifuged for 45 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of Protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min. The clarified supernatant was then incubated with 5 μg of mouse anti-Myc 9E10 antibody for 2 h and then overnight with 30 μl of anti-mouse Protein-A-Sepharose (Sigma). The resin was washed with the solubilization buffer and with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Four independent experiments were performed. The beads were resuspended in 80 μl of gel loading buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies as previously described (19Boue-Grabot E. Emerit M.B. Toulme E. Seguela P. Garret M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6967-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were anti-α3 (1:2000; Alomone Labs), anti-β3 (1:1000; Chemicon), and polyclonal anti-Myc (1:500; Upstate). The three antigens were detected consecutively on each Western blot membrane after stripping to selectively remove both primary and secondary antibodies (24Kain S.R. Mai K. Sinai P. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 982-987PubMed Google Scholar). Each immunoprecipitate was analyzed twice. Pictures of the blots were taken with the ChemiGenius 2XE apparatus under the control of GeneSnap program. Quantitative analysis was performed using GeneTools Software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Structural Building of GABAA Receptor Mutants—The coordinate file (GABA-A_expanded.pdb) of the GABAA receptor homology model (31O'Mara M. Cromer B. Parker M. Chung S.H. Biophys.

To study this mutation in a neuronal environment, hippocampal neurons at 7 to 11 days in vitro were transfected with wild-type and mutant γ26myc. Subunits expressed on the cell surface were detected on living cells to avoid any intracellular labeling that could occur with fixed cells (27Taylor A.B. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Labeling the extracellular epitope with a polyclonal antibody directed against the Myc tag revealed that expression of the wild-type γ2-subunit on the surface membrane was uniformly distributed throughout the neurons (Fig. 1, top lane). After permeabilization, labeling of the Myc tag with a monoclonal antibody revealed perinuclear and reticular structures that probably correspond to the endoplasmic reticulum, where a large majority of subunits are retained during the protein folding and assembling processes (16Kang J.Q. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8672-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When the arginine in position 43 of γ26myc was replaced with a glutamine residue, neurons transfected with γ26myc(R43Q) were not labeled at the surface (Fig. 1, middle lane). This effect was specific to γ26myc(R43Q), as γ26myc(K289M), known to be responsible for generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (5Baulac S. Huberfeld G. Gourfinkel-An I. Mitropoulou G. Beranger A. Prud'homme J.F. Baulac M. Brice A. Bruzzone R. LeGuern E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), was targeted to the neuron cell surface (bottom lane). We obtained similar data with wild-type or R43Q mutant when γ2S6myc (Fig. 1) or γ2L6myc (not shown) constructs were expressed in transfected neurons for 24 (Fig. 1), 36, or 60 h (not shown). These experiments showed that the γ2(R43Q)-subunit was not addressed to the surface when expressed in neurons. To study the mechanisms behind this deficient GABAA receptor surface targeting, we co-expressed wild-type and mutated γ26myc constructs with α- and β-subunits in COS-7 cells. In α3-, β3-, and γ26myc-transfected cells, anti-Myc polyclonal surface labeling of living cells revealed clusters all over the cell plasma membrane (Fig. 2, top lane). When COS-7 cells were transfected with the γ26myc(R43Q) mutant, surface staining was close to background (middle lane) whereas the γ26myc(K289M) was clearly targeted on the cell surface (bottom lane). Our result for γ2(K289M) was in agreement with previous data showing that this mutant expressed in heterologous cells gave rise to GABA-induced current with unaltered amplitude (10Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as previously observed in neurons, there was no difference when experiments on COS-7 cells were conducted using the γ2S (Fig. 2) or γ2L splice form (not shown) or when COS-7 cells were transfected with α1-instead of the α3-subunit (not shown). γ2(R43) Domain Is a Major Determinant to Drive Cell Surface Targeting of the γ2-Subunit—Crystal structure analysis of a soluble acetylcholine-binding protein was used to design a model of the GABAA receptor ligand-binding domain (30Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31O'Mara M. Cromer B. Parker M. Chung S.H. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3286-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A homology model of the whole GABAA receptor (Fig. 3A) was also generated by combining the extracellular domain model with a model of the membrane domain constructed from the coordinates of the acetylcholine receptor pore (31O'Mara M. Cromer B. Parker M. Chung S.H. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3286-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N.

These homology models indicated that a bifurcated salt bridge may connect the γ2(E178), γ2(R43), and β2(R117) residues (Fig. 3B). Using the coordinate file of the whole receptor homology model, we constructed models of several Arg-43 mutants. In the R43Q mutant (Fig. 3C), γ2(E178) only interacted ionically with β2(R117), whereas the γ2(R43K) mutant model suggested that there could be a salt bridge network similar to the one found in the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3D and supplemental movie). We also used the GABAA wild-type homology model to highlight the Asp-39 position, conserved among GABA-gated receptor channels, and Pro-44, conserved among the Cys loop ligand-gated receptor channel family (Fig. 3E). We created mutants of the residues mentioned above to study their importance in receptor assembly or trafficking. Interestingly, we noted that γ2(S171), whose influence in GABAA receptor subunit assembly has recently been reported (33Jin P. Walther D. Zhang J. Rowe-Teeter C. Fu G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14179-14183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), is located at the beginning of the loop close to β2(R117) that ends with γ2(E178) (Fig. 3, E and F). The γ2K289 and γ2R43 residues are located far apart (48 Å, Fig. 3A); thus, K289M substitution was not expected to affect GABAA receptor properties in the same way as mutations within the Arg-43 domain. As the γ2(R43Q) mutant behaved in a similar way when it was expressed in COS-7 cells or neurons and surface labeling is an efficient way to study GABAA receptor expression (34Alldred M.J. Mulder-Rosi J. Lingenfelter S.E. Chen G. Luscher B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we used this approach, with several γ26myc mutants, to study the role of the domain surrounding the Arg-43 position. Cells were transfected with α3- and β3-subunits in combination with γ2S6myc bearing different point mutations. Immunolabeling showed that, as described above for γ2(R43Q), γ2(R43A) mutant was not detected on the cell surface, whereas γ2(R43K), γ2(D39A), and γ2(P44A) were consistently expressed at the surface (Fig. 4A). Quantitative analysis of intracellular γ26myc revealed that there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in expression levels of the wild-type subunit and any of the mutants in the Arg-43 domain (Fig. 4B), showing that the effect of mutations was not due to a subunit expression or stability defect. Surface targeting was analyzed by measuring the ratio of the amount of γ2-subunit labeled on the cell surface versus γ2 labeled within intracellular compartments (Fig. 4C). The surface versus intracellular signal ratio showed that both the R43Q and R43A mutations prevented cell surface targeting compared with wild type (0.033 ± 0.002, 0.052 ± 0.003, 1.163 ± 0.078, respectively). Cell surface labeling was detected on cells transfected with the γ2S6myc(R43K) construct (Fig. 4A), showing that this conservative substitution restored γ2 surface targeting (0.235 ± 0.033) to some extent. When the conserved Asp-39 or Pro-44 residues were replaced with alanine, labeling was detected on the membrane surface (Fig. 4A), although the γ2-subunit ratio on the cell surface was reduced (0.396 ± 0.083 and 0.135 ± 0.011, respectively). The significantly higher level of intracellular signals for the γ2(K289M) mutant (p < 0.05; Fig. 4B) may be due to a different expression level or stability. This increase did not interfere with surface targeting efficacy, because the K289M substitution had no significant effect on the surface versus intracellular signal ratio (0.84 ± 0.093) compared with the wild type, in agreement with previous studies (10Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments clearly showed the major impact of the Arg-43 residue on γ2-subunit cell surface localization and led us to evaluate the influence of this position, either on the subunit itself or on GABAA receptor complexes associated with this subunit. It has been shown that the γ2S-subunit, expressed alone in heterologous cells without other subunit subtypes, is able to reach the cell surface, probably as a monomer (35Connolly C.N. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In agreement with that data, cells transfected solely with the γ2S6myc construct were labeled in their intracellular compartments and at the surface (Fig. 5A). Note that when γ26myc was expressed alone, the surface-versus intracellular-labeling ratio was six times lower than when the subunit was expressed with α and β (0.218 ± 0.019 and 1.163 ± 0.078, respectively). Our experiments showed that any mutation within the domain encompassing Arg-43 significantly reduced the surface/intracellularlabeling ratio of monomeric γ26myc (WT, 0.218 ± 0.019; R43Q, 0.026 ± 0.003; R43A, 0.015 ± 0.001; R43K, 0.036 ± 0.006; D39A, 0.034 ± 0.003; P44A, 0.023 ± 0.002). We then examined α3-subunit cell surface targeting that forms either α3β3 or α3β3γ2 complexes to give rise to functional receptors (14Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46020-46025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with α3, β3, and γ26myc constructs (1:1:1 ratio). Surface expression of the α3 extracellular epitope on living cells and total γ2S6myc subunit expression on fixed and permeabilized cells were revealed by double labeling. As stated above (Fig. 4B), mutations did not modify intracellular γ2-subunit expression levels. Then, quantitative analysis (Fig. 5B) showed that, irrespective of the amino acid substitution in the γ2-subunit, there was no major modification of α3-subunit cell surface targeting (mean ± S.E. surface labeling in arbitrary units was WT, 12.7 ± 0.5; R43Q, 16.4 ± 0.8; R43A, 13.2 ± 0.8; R43K, 11.7 ± 0.7; D39A,"

We describe here a third activity of CyaA that yields elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in target cells.

Compared with intact CyaA, a CyaA-AC– toxoid unable to generate cAMP promoted a faster, albeit transient, elevation of [Ca2+]i. This was not because of cell permeabilization by the CyaA hemolysin pores, because a mutant exhibiting a strongly enhanced pore-forming activity (CyaA-E509K/E516K), but unable to deliver the AC domain into cells, was also unable to elicit a [Ca2+]i increase. Further mutations interfering with AC translocation into cells, such as proline substitutions of glutamate residues 509 or 570 or deletion of the AC domain as such, reduced or ablated the [Ca2+]i-elevating capacity of CyaA. Moreover, structural alterations within the AC domain, because of insertion of various oligopeptides, differently modulated the kinetics and extent of Ca2+ influx elicited by the respective AC– toxoids.

Adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (AC-Hly or CyaA) is a key virulence factor involved in the early stages of the respiratory tract colonization by Bordetella pertussis, a Gram-negative pathogen causing whooping cough (1Goodwin M.S. Weiss A.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3445-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically, the most relevant cellular targets of the toxin appear to be the myeloid phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils (2Harvill E.T. Cotter P.A. Yuk M.H. Miller J.F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1493-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These express the αMβ2 integrin receptor CD11b/CD18 (known also as CR3 or Mac-1) to which CyaA binds with high affinity (3Guermonprez P.

The toxin can form small, transient, and cation-selective membrane pores that permeabilize cells and account for the hemolytic activity of CyaA on erythrocytes (4Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D.

The major activity of the toxin on host cells, however, consists in delivery of an adenylate cyclase (AC) 2The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylate cyclase; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate; 2DG, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; AC-domain, N-terminal enzymatic adenylate cyclase domain; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; CyaA, adenylate cyclase toxin; CyaC, acyltransferase; CyaA-AC–, enzymatically inactive adenylate cyclase toxin; [Ca2+]i, free cytosolic calcium concentration; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoro)methoxyphenylhydrazone; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SK&F 96365, 1-(β-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; OVA, ovalbumin. enzyme domain into cells, where this is activated by binding of cytoplasmic calmodulin and catalyzes unregulated conversion of ATP to cAMP (7Confer D.L.

Dissipation of cellular ATP and signaling of cAMP then causes impairment of microbicidal functions of host phagocytes, such as inhibition of chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and phagocytosis and eventually results in cell apoptosis (7Confer D.L.

Recent results suggest a role for CyaA in promoting incomplete maturation of dendritic cells, possibly yielding immune tolerance of the pathogen on respiratory epithelia (18Bagley K.C.

Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, CyaA can increase cAMP levels detectably also in a variety of other cell types lacking the CD11b/CD18 receptor, including erythrocytes (4Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CyaA action can elicit release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 from tracheal epithelial cells (23Bassinet L. Fitting C. Housset B. Cavaillon J.M. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5530-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The bi-functional toxin molecule consists of an N-terminal ∼400-residue-long AC enzyme domain that is linked to a characteristic RTX hemolysin moiety (Hly) of ∼1300 residues (24Glaser P. Ladant D. Sezer O. Pichot F. Ullmann A. Danchin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The Hly itself consists of several functional domains (25Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It contains a hydrophobic channel-forming domain, including residues 500–800 (6Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an acylation subdomain of Hly located between residues 800 and 1000 carries the post-translational fatty acyl modifications of CyaA, which are essential for toxin activity (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Sebo P. J. Biol.

Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Finally, a typical calcium-binding RTX domain occupies the C-terminal half of Hly between residues 1008 and 1706, where glycine- and aspartate-rich nonapeptide repeats are located that form the numerous (∼40) calcium-binding sites of CyaA (28Rhodes C.R.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both toxin activities, penetration across target cell membranes, and formation of cation-selective pores strictly depend on covalent post-translational palmitoylation of the ϵ-amino groups of internal lysine residues 860 and 983 (30Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and on binding of calcium ions into sites within the glycine- and aspartate-rich repeats (29Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A unique feature of CyaA is its capacity to translocate the enzymatic AC domain directly across the cytoplasmic membrane of target cells, without the need for receptor-mediated endocytosis (31Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schlecht G. Loucka J. Najar H. Sebo P. Leclerc C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6089-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Translocation across, but not insertion of, CyaA into the cytoplasmic membrane of cells as such appears to be driven by negative (inside) membrane potential (33Otero A.S. Yi X. Gray M.C. Szabo G. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9695-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The path and mechanism of direct passage of the ∼40-kDa AC domain across the lipid bilayer of target membranes remain, however, poorly understood. The AC domain does not appear to enter cells through the CyaA hemolysin pore, which exhibits a diameter of only 0.6–0.8 nm (6Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of pores and translocation of the AC domain indeed appear to be two parallel and independent activities of the membrane-inserted forms of CyaA and can be dissociated and manipulated independently by mutations, fatty-acylation status, and assay conditions, such as temperature and calcium loading (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Sebo P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that the pore forming activity contributes to cytotoxic action of CyaA by synergizing with enzymatic conversion of ATP to cAMP in promoting cell death (38Hewlett E.L. Donato G.M. Gray M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Basler M. Masin J. Osicka R. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Aside from perturbing ion homeostasis and promoting colloidosmotic lysis of permeabilized cells, the cytotoxic contribution of the pore forming activity of CyaA might also be expected to consist of elevating the cytoplasmic levels of calcium ions ([Ca2+]i), as has been observed with many other bacterial poreforming toxins (40Nhieu G.T. Clair C. Grompone G. Sansonetti P. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, modulation of [Ca2+]i belongs to the most prominent mechanisms of cellular signaling, and [Ca2+]i regulates many cellular pathways, including those leading to cell death through apoptosis or necrosis (41Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar, 42Duke R.C. Witter R.Z. Nash P.B. Young J.D. Ojcius D.M.

Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Therefore, [Ca2+]i is tightly controlled and maintained at a low level (∼100 nm), as prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i is lethal to most cell types. Toxin action of CyaA leading to an increase of cellular cAMP level was indeed shown to promote massive calcium influx and increase of [Ca2+]i in cardiac myocytes and βTC3 cells through opening of cAMP-regulated L-type calcium channels (33Otero A.S.

Matschinsky F.M. Wolf B.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it has not been examined whether CyaA can elevate [Ca2+]i also in its natural targets that lack the L-type Ca2+ channels, such as the CD11b-expressing myeloid phagocytes. Here we report that CyaA causes elevation of [Ca2+]i in CD11b+ J774A.1 monocytic cells by a novel mechanism that is independent of its enzymatic or pore forming activities and that requires structural integrity and membrane translocation of the AC domain polypeptide as such.

Fura-2/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes and thapsigargin from ICN. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Purified monoclonal anti-CD11b antibody (M1/70, rat IgG2b, κ) was purchased from Pharmingen. Mutagenesis of cyaA—The site-directed substitutions were introduced into the cyaA gene by PCR mutagenesis as described previously (36Osickova A. Osicka R. Maier E. Benz R. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37644-37650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CyaA-AC– forms of the proteins, unable to convert ATP to cAMP, were generated by placing a Cys-Thr dipeptide between amino acid residues Asp188 and Ile189 of the ATP-binding site in the catalytic domain of CyaA, as described previously (46Osicka R. Osickova A. Basar T. Guermonprez P. Rojas M. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 247-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Recombinant CyaA synthesis was induced in exponential 500-ml cultures by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were disrupted by ultrasound; the insoluble cell debris was extracted with 8 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.2 mm CaCl2, and the proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose followed by hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, as described previously (50Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 51Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The integrity of all proteins was systematically controlled by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1). CyaA and derived proteins were added to J774A.1 cells by direct dilution from the concentrated stock solutions containing 8 m urea. Unless indicated otherwise, the final working concentration of the toxin was 3 μg/ml, and the final concentration of urea was 80 mm in all samples. Appropriate controls showed that at this concentration the urea had no effect on cell physiology whatsoever. The lipopolysaccharide content of CyaA preparations was between 10 and 15 EU/μg CyaA, as determined by the chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker). Assay of Hemolytic Activity on Sheep Erythrocytes—Hemolytic activity of the CyaA and mutant toxin variants was measured by photometric (A541) determination of the amount of hemoglobin released upon prolonged incubation (5 h) of erythrocytes (5 × 108/ml) with 5 μg/ml toxin (4Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assay of Adenylate Cyclase Activity—Adenylate cyclase activities were measured as described previously (52Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2612-2618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of AC activity corresponds to 1 μmol of cAMP formed per min in the presence of 1 μm calmodulin at 30 °C, pH 8.0. Determination of cAMP—To determine the intracellular levels of cAMP in cells exposed to toxin, the J774A.1 cells (105 per well) were incubated with different concentrations of the CyaA-derived protein for 30 min in DMEM containing 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) as inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 mm HCl solution containing 0.2% Tween 20, and the samples were boiled for 15 min at 100 °C to denature cellular proteins (cAMP is heat- and acid-resistant). The samples were neutralized by addition of 150 mm unbuffered imidazole, and cAMP concentration was determined by an antibody competition immunoassay as described elsewhere (53Masin J. Basler M. Knapp O. El-Azami-El-Idrissi M. Maier E. Konopasek I. Benz R. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12759-12766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cellular ATP Level and Cell Lysis—ATP level in J774A.1 cells (105 per well) was determined using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysis was determined as lactate dehydrogenase release from J774A.1 cells (105 per well) using the CytoTox 96 kit assay (Promega). Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the results represent the average of values obtained in at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Cell Culture and Handling—J774.A1 murine macrophages (ATCC, number TIB-67) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (250 ng/ml). For fluorescence measurements, cells were mechanically harvested, seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well plates, and grown to 30% confluence. In some experiments, J774A.1 cells were pretreated at room temperature for 20–40 min with the calcium channel blockers 2-APB (100 μm), LaCl3 (100 μm), nifedipine (10 μm), flunarizine (30 μm), thapsigargin (1 μm), or SK&F 96365 (10 μm), respectively. Fluorescence Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+—Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed in modified HBSS (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-Na, 50 mm glucose (pH 7.4)). After washing, cells were loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark, rinsed, and allowed to rest in HBSS for 30 min prior to fluorescence measurements of [Ca2+]i at 25 °C. Ratiometric rapid screening and multiply repeated measurements were performed using FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with DataMax software (Jobin Yvon Horriba, France). The observed area of coverslip mounted in the 1-cm cuvette was about 10 mm2, corresponding to approximately 104 cells. Fluorescence intensity of Fura-2 (excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm, emission wavelength 510 nm) was recorded every 15 s, and integration time for each wavelength was 3 s. The measured fluorescence intensity was not corrected for background intensity (<10%). Intracellular calcium fluctuations were further verified and corroborated by following calcium entry into individual cells using an Olympus microscope IX 50-based microspectrofluorometer (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany), equipped with a cooled digital CCD camera (MicroMAX RTE/CCD-512EFT, Princeton Instruments, Monmouth Junction, NJ). Fluorescence of Fura-2 was excited at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm switched by a Polychrome II (Till Photonics, Planegg, Germany) illumination device. Emitted light at λ > 420 nm (filter U-MWU) was recorded every 10 s, and integration time for each wavelength was 300 ms. MetaFluor 2.76 software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) was used to control synchronization of excitation and data acquisition and for the visualization of the relative calcium concentration based on the ratiometric measurement. The curves in the shown graphs correspond to average kinetics of a random sample of at least 30 individual cells, and the curves are representative of typical average kinetics from more than three independent measurements. The background fluorescence of the coverslip area without cells (about 50% of total area) was monitored and subtracted for each measurement. In vivo calibrations for determination of the calcium concentration were performed as described elsewhere (54Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using 10–5 m ionomycin and a Kd = 224 nm value for Fura-2. The minimal cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ was determined by measurements in calcium-free HBSS, pH 7.4, containing 4 mm EGTA instead of 2 mm CaCl2. The maximum of [Ca2+]i was determined in HBSS supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2. CyaA Promotes Elevation of Cytosolic Calcium Level in J774A.1 Monocytes by a Mechanism That Does Not Involve cAMP Signaling—Elevation of cellular cAMP levels upon exposure to CyaA was shown previously to cause massive influx of calcium ions into excitatory types of cells possessing the cAMP-regulated L-type Ca2+ channels (33Otero A.S. Yi X. Gray M.C. Szabo G. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9695-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 45Gao Z. Young R.A. Trucco M.M. Greene S.R. Hewlett E.L. Matschinsky F.M. Wolf B.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These channels, however, appear to be absent in natural targets of the toxin, such as the CD11b-expressing myeloid phagocytes, and the impact of CyaA action on [Ca2+]i in myeloid cells has not been addressed previously. Because CyaA possesses the capacity to form small cation-selective membrane pores that account for hemolytic activity of CyaA and thus might potentially permeabilize cells for entry of Ca2+, we first examined whether exposure to CyaA causes alterations of [Ca2+]i in CD11b+ J774A.1 monocytic cells. As documented in Fig. 1 by a typical result of a ratiometric measurement employing Fura-2/AM as a Ca2+-sensitive probe accumulating in cell cytosol, exposure of cells to CyaA resulted in [Ca2+]i increase with the kinetics and final [Ca2+]i level being a function of toxin concentration. At 3 μg/ml of CyaA, the [Ca2+]i increased shortly upon exposure of J774A.1 cells to toxin, and it continued to rise for about 8–12 min, until a maximal [Ca2+]i level was reached. Based on calibration experiments employing the calcium ionophore ionomycin (supplemental Fig. 2), it could be estimated that exposure of cells to 3 μg/ml CyaA resulted in a [Ca2+]i increase from a basal level of ∼80 nm to a persistent final level of about 2 μm. As further shown in Fig. 1, no elevation of [Ca2+]i was observed upon exposure of cells to 3 μg/ml of the comparably pure but nonacylated pro-CyaA, which binds CD11/CD18 in a nonproductive manner and exhibits only a residual biological activity (53Masin J. Basler M. Knapp O. El-Azami-El-Idrissi M. Maier E. Konopasek I. Benz R. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12759-12766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and neither did an appropriate lipopolysaccharide control (45 EU/ml) that caused no elevation of [Ca2+]i (supplemental Fig. 3). Therefore, it can be concluded that the [Ca2+]i increase was specifically due to action of the toxin itself and was not provoked by any potential traces of contaminating bacterial components that might still have been present in the purified toxin preparation. Moreover, although the presence of a control isotype antibody had no effect on [Ca2+]i increase (supplemental Fig. 3), the capacity of the toxin to elevate [Ca2+]i in J774A.1 cells was completely abrogated in the presence of an excess of the CD11b-specific antibody M1/70 that competes with CyaA for binding to the CD11b/CD18 receptor (Fig. 1). This showed that elevation of [Ca2+]i by CyaA required binding of the toxin to its integrin receptor CD11b/CD18. However, as further documented in Fig. 2, the capacity of CyaA to cause a [Ca2+]i increase in J774A.1 cells was not primarily because of its capacity to elevate cellular cAMP concentration. Exposure of the CD11b+ monocytes to the cell-permeable cAMP analog Bt2cAMP (1 mm) had no effect on [Ca2+]i, and more importantly, the enzymatically inactive CyaA-AC– construct, unable to catalyze any cAMP synthesis because of disruption of the ATP-binding site, was still able to promote the [Ca2+]i increase in cells (Fig. 2). It should be noted, however, that the time course of the [Ca2+]i increase promoted by CyaA-AC– differed markedly from that induced by the enzymatically active CyaA. The latter caused a progressive [Ca2+]i increase that continued over 10 min, and the CyaA-AC– toxoid (3 μg/ml) promoted a strikingly faster [Ca2+]i increase with an earlier onset and a maximum of [Ca2+]i reached within 3 min followed by a progressive decrease of [Ca2+]i to an intermediate level in about 5 min from toxoid addition. Moreover, the time course of [Ca2+]i increase produced by CyaA-AC– was not affected in the presence of 1 mm Bt2cAMP (Fig. 2), suggesting that it was the capacity of CyaA to dissipate ATP into cAMP, rather than the cAMP itself, which accounted for the observed difference in time courses of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by CyaA and CyaA-AC– proteins, respectively. Depletion of Cellular ATP Enables CyaA to Cause Permanent Elevation of Cytosolic Calcium Levels in J774A.1 Monocytes— To analyze in more detail the mechanistic basis of the difference in [Ca2+]i increasing activities of CyaA and CyaA-AC–,"
https://openalex.org/W2029561421,"The receptors for the peptide hormones relaxin and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) are the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors LGR7 and LGR8 recently renamed as the relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP2, respectively. These receptors differ from other LGRs by the addition of an N-terminal low density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLa) module and are the only human G-protein-coupled receptors to contain such a domain. Recently it was shown that the LDLa module of the RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptors is essential for ligand-stimulated cAMP signaling. The mechanism by which the LDLa module modulates receptor signaling is unknown; however, it represents a unique paradigm in understanding G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Here we present the structure of the RXFP1 receptor LDLa module determined by solution NMR spectroscopy. The structure is similar to other LDLa modules but shows small differences in side chain orientations and inter-residue packing. Interchange of the module with the second ligand binding domain of the LDL receptor, LB2, results in a receptor that binds relaxin with full affinity but is unable to signal. Furthermore, we demonstrate via structural studies on mutated LDLa modules and functional studies on mutated full-length receptors that a hydrophobic surface within the N-terminal region of the module is essential for activation of RXFP1 receptor signal in response to relaxin stimulation. This study has highlighted the necessity to understand the structural effects of single amino acid mutations on the LDLa module to fully interpret the effects of these mutations on receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2049357251,"Werner syndrome is a human premature aging disorder characterized by chromosomal instability. The disease is caused by the functional loss of WRN, a member of the RecQ-helicase family that plays an important role in DNA metabolic pathways. WRN contains four structurally folded domains comprising an exonuclease, a helicase, a winged-helix, and a helicase-and-ribonuclease D/C-terminal (HRDC) domain. In contrast to the accumulated knowledge pertaining to the biochemical functions of the three N-terminal domains, the function of C-terminal HRDC remains unknown. In this study, the crystal structure of the human WRN HRDC domain has been determined. The domain forms a bundle of α-helices similar to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 and Escherichia coli RecQ. Surprisingly, the extra ten residues at each of the N and C termini of the domain were found to participate in the domain architecture by forming an extended portion of the first helix α1, and a novel looping motif that traverses straight along the domain surface, respectively. The motifs combine to increase the domain surface of WRN HRDC, which is larger than that of Sgs1 and E. coli.In WRN HRDC, neither of the proposed DNA-binding surfaces in Sgs1 or E. coli is conserved, and the domain was shown to lack DNA-binding ability in vitro. Moreover, the domain was shown to be thermostable and resistant to protease digestion, implying independent domain evolution in WRN. Coupled with the unique long linker region in WRN, the WRN HRDC may be adapted to play a distinct function in WRN that involves protein-protein interactions.

Werner syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease that results in premature aging. Werner syndrome gives rise to multiple progeroid pathologies, including osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, type II diabetes, cataracts, and a marked increase in the incidence of cancer (1Salk D.

Cells isolated from patients also display features of accelerated aging. In particular, genomic instability is characteristic of Werner syndrome cells, which show extensive chromosomal deletions, elevated rates of homologous recombination, prolonged S-phase DNA synthesis, and defective telomere maintenance (3Lebel M.

Whereas genomes of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes typically encode a single recQ gene, the human genome contains five recQ genes, RecQ1, Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), WRN, RecQ4, and RecQ5. Mutations in BLM and RecQ4 cause Bloom syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively, and share a predisposition to cancer with Werner syndrome (9Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Recently, the epigenetic inactivation of WRN in human cancer was demonstrated, illuminating the tumor-suppressor functions of WRN (10Agrelo R. Cheng W.H. Setien F. Ropero S. Espada J. Fraga M.F.

Although little is known about the in vivo molecular pathways in which WRN is involved, its multiple interactions with key proteins in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance suggest a coordinated function of WRN with these processes in human cells (4Opresko P.L.

WRN contains four structurally folded domains (see Fig. 1) comprising an exonuclease (12Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat.

Most mutations found in Werner patients occur in the C-terminal region of the protein, resulting in C-terminal truncated proteins with loss of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (14Matsumoto T. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The helicase and winged-helix domains combine to form the catalytic core of the protein.

As its name implies, this region shares sequence homology with a domain in the RNase D family of nucleases (18Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The HRDC domains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 (yeast homologue of RecQ proteins) (19Liu Z. Macias M.J.

Keck J.L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have been suggested to function as auxiliary DNA binding domains. HRDC is the most variable of the RecQ family domains (WRN HRDC region shares only ∼20% homology with Sgs1 and E. coli RecQ) with examples of human proteins that lack the HRDC domain altogether, including RecQ1, RecQ4, and all isoforms of RecQ5. The function of the HRDC domains in WRN and BLM might be more diverse than as represented in the proteins of unicellular organisms. In addition, WRN is distinct from E. coli RecQ in having a considerably long linker region (>70 residues) that connects HRDC to the N-terminal winged-helix domain. An interesting point concerns how the isolation of the HRDC domain contributes to the specific functions of WRN. In an effort to delineate the biochemical function of HRDC in WRN, we have determined the crystal structure of the human WRN HRDC domain. This represents the first structure of a mammalian RecQ family HRDC domain. The structure demonstrated that a bundle of α-helices forms the domain core similar to those of Sgs1 (19Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and E. coli RecQ (20Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the additional ten residues at each of the N and C termini, which are disordered or truncated in Sgs1 and E. coli, were found to form a novel motif on top of the WRN HRDC domain. The domain was further shown to be stable in solution and lack DNA binding ability. Expression and Purification of WRN HRDC Domain—DNA encoding residues 1142–1242 of WRN was cloned from human WRN and inserted into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The fidelity of the HRDC coding region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene), which was grown in LB media supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 310 K to an A660 of 0.5. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 0.5 mm. Following incubation for another 5 h, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. For purification, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5% Triton X-100 and disrupted by sonication in an ice bath. The cell suspension was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 37,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant, which contains GST-WRN HRDC, was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose-4B affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A until protein was undetectable in the eluent and subsequently re-equilibrated with digestion buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The protein bound to the resin was digested on the column with 10 unit/ml Factor Xa (Novagen) for 12 h at 293 K. The column effluent containing GST-free HRDC was pooled and then loaded onto a Hi-Trap Q anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove nucleic acids. The flow-through fraction was pooled and concentrated by centrifugation using an Amicon Ultra 5000 MWCO. The protein was finally loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The peak fractions, which gave one major band corresponding to ∼10 kDa in SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and concentrated to ∼50 mg/ml in buffer A. Ten milligrams of purified HRDC was obtained from 1 liter of culture. The sample was analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (Bruker), which verified that the protein had been successfully purified without degradation. Two vector-derived residues (Gly-Ile) were present at the N terminus. The sample was stored at 193 K until use for crystallization. Crystallization—Crystallization screening was carried out by the vapor-diffusion method at 20 °C using commercial screening kits (Hampton Research and Nextal Biotechnologies). The protein was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution. The crystallization conditions were subsequently optimized by the sparse matrix method. The prismatic crystal (space group I4122) was obtained under conditions that included 1.6–2.2 m ammonium sulfate, 5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, and 0.1 m CAPSO-NaOH (pH 9.5). The same I4122 crystal also grew using 30–40% (v/v) PEG400 or 20–28% (w/v) PEG4K as a precipitant. Irrespective of the precipitants, the crystal appeared within a wide range of pH (from 5 to 10). In contrast, the hexagonal crystal (space group P6222) was obtained within a limited pH (∼5.5), under conditions that included 30–40% (v/v) PEG400, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 m citrate-NaOH (pH 5.5). These conditions partially overlap with those for the I4122 crystal, and in fact the two forms of crystals often grew concomitantly from the same crystallization drop. X-ray Data Collection—For x-ray data collection, the I4122 crystal obtained with use of ammonium sulfate was transferred into a cryoprotective solution containing 15% (v/v) glycerol in the reservoir solution. The crystal was mounted on a rayon loop and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The x-ray data were collected at SPring-8 on beamline BL38B1. The crystal was maintained at 100 K in a nitrogen stream during exposure to the x-ray beam with a wavelength of 1.00 Å. Diffraction from a total oscillation range of 180° was recorded by the charge-coupled device detector (Rigaku MSC Jupiter 210). The data set was indexed and merged using the HKL2000 program suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar) to a resolution limit of 2.3 Å. The other two I4122 crystals obtained from use of PEG400 and PEG4K also possessed similar diffraction qualities (resolution limits of 2.6 and 2.4 Å, respectively). The P6222 crystal was directly frozen in liquid nitrogen without cryoprotection, and the x-ray data were collected to a resolution limit of 2.0 Å. Structure Determination—Given the crystallization difficulties encountered for the P6222 crystal, x-ray data were initially only obtained from the I4122 crystal. The phase-determination trials by the molecular replacement (MR) method were performed against the I4122 data, using the HRDC structures of S. cerevisiae Sgs1 (19Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and E. coli RecQ (20Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as an MR model. The MR search using either of the models was unsuccessful, probably due to the lack of homology with human WRN. Following this, a calculated MR model was constructed using the homology-modeling server SWISSMODEL (22Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4482) Google Scholar), to which the amino acid sequence of WRN and both of the two template structures (Sgs1 and E. coli HRDCs) were submitted. The model obtained was further converted to an alanine model. Using this calculated structure as a new MR model, PHASER (23McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) successfully gave a solution corresponding to one HRDC molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The electron-density map obtained was of good quality and allowed for further model building of the WRN HRDC domain. The extreme N- and C-terminal residues, 1142–1151 and 1227–1235, respectively, that are missing in the search model were modeled de novo using program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined using CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Subsequently, using this refined I4122 structure as a search model, the phases for the P6222 data were determined by MR, followed by refinement using the same programs. The figures were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Ultracentrifuge Sedimentation Equilibrium—Purified WRN HRDC was dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm DTT followed by adjustment of the absorbance at 280 nm to ∼0.5 (corresponding to a protein concentration of ∼300 μm). The sample solution and reference buffer were injected into each side of a double-sector centerpiece. Ultracentrifugation was performed at 4 and 20 °C at 25,000 rpm using a CP100α unit provided by Hitachi High-Technologies, Japan. Following equilibration (50–60 h later), the radial absorbance at 280 nm was scanned, which subsequently fitted to the calculated curve from the ideal single-species model. The partial specific volume of the protein at 20 °C was calculated to be 0.745 ml/g based on the amino acid composition, whereas the solvent density was calculated to be 1.0049 g/ml (4 °C) and 1.0031 (20 °C). Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering of WRN HRDC was measured using the DynaPro-801 equipped with DYNAMICS software (Protein Solutions). The sample was prepared at 3.8 mg/ml protein concentration (corresponding to ∼300 μm) in buffer A and filtered using a 0.02-μm membrane. Measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 5 to 55 °C, with increments of 5 °C. Each measurement was repeated 50 times and averaged. Limited Proteolysis—WRN 1142–1242 in GST-tagged and non-tagged forms were purified and prepared at 10 mg/ml in buffer A. Elastase from porcine pancreas (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) was dissolved to 1 mg/ml in the same buffer, which was subsequently added to the samples at increasing concentration from 0 to 300 μg/ml. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the digested samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal sequencing. The products were also analyzed by TOF-MS to define the correct domain boundaries of WRN HRDC. Fluorescence Polarization Assays—Oligonucleotides representing various DNA structures were designed based on the study by Mohaghegh et al. (27Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V. A Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In each substrate, a single oligonucleotide was 3′-end-labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Hokkaido System Science, Japan). The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to the unlabeled complementary strand(s) at a 1:1 molar ratio by incubation at 90 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Purified WRN HRDC was mixed with each substrate in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The final protein concentration ranged from 1 nm to 50 μm, whereas the DNA substrate concentration was 100 pm in all samples. The interaction between protein and DNA was examined by the fluorescence polarization method (28Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using the full-range Beacon 2000 (Invitrogen). Each measurement was performed at 25 °C, repeated ten times, and then averaged. As a positive control, the WRN winged-helix domain comprising residues 949–1079 was purified 4K. Kitano, N. Yoshihara, and T. Hakoshima, unpublished result. and used. Domain Characterization and Crystallization—To date, the purification and structure determination of RecQ family HRDC domains has only been reported for two unicellular proteins, S. cerevisiae Sgs1 (19Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and E. coli RecQ (20Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and there have been no reports on the successful isolation and purification of the HRDC domains from mammalian RecQ proteins. From the sequence alignment with Sgs1 and E. coli RecQ, the literature data limit the WRN HRDC region to residues 1152–1226 (Fig. 1). However, this lacks accuracy given that the primary sequences of the three proteins are significantly divergent. Limited proteolysis of WRN using subtilisin suggested that the HRDC domain may start at Gln1148 (29von Kobbe C. Thoma N.H. Czyzewski B.K. Pavletich N.P. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52997-53006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), whereas no information was available about the C-terminal end of the domain. At first we performed sequence analysis of WRN using the domain linker prediction server (30Miyazaki S. Kuroda Y. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2002; 2: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The program suggested significant flexibility in residues 1132–1147 and 1230–1246 that are at the N and C termini, respectively, of the predicted HRDC region. At the same time, from the sequence alignment of human WRN with mouse and Xenopus WRNs (supplemental Fig. S1), residues 1142–1242 that include the HRDC region were found to represent a conserved cluster region. Taken together, a recombinant WRN HRDC fragment comprising residues 1142–1242 was constructed, which satisfies all of the aforementioned arguments. The HRDC fragment was overexpressed in E. coli as a GST-tagged protein and finally purified in a tag-cleaved form to homogeneity. CD spectral analysis of the protein (supplemental Fig. S2) indicated that the fragment contains a high amount of α-helical content (50%) and a low amount of β-strand content (6%). The helical content is similar to that of Sgs1 and E. coli RecQ structures (19Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the purified fragment folds into a similar domain architecture. Crystallization conditions were screened by the vapor-diffusion method, from which a number of small crystals appeared under conditions that included ammonium sulfate or PEG as a precipitant. Following the refinement of conditions and preliminary x-ray analysis, it was found that the protein crystallizes in two different crystal forms, space groups I4122 and P6222 (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B, respectively). X-ray data sets were collected from the crystals to a resolution limit of 2.3 (I4122) and 2.0 Å (P6222). For the structure determination, phases were obtained by the MR method using S. cerevisiae Sgs1 (19Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and E. coli RecQ (20Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L.

Rfree is the same as Rwork except that a 5% subset of all reflections was held aside throughout the refinement Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—In the electron density maps calculated from the I4122 and P6222 data, the protein density is clear throughout the sequence except for the C-terminal seven residues (1236–1242) being disordered. The two structures, both of which include a model for 1142–1235, are essentially the same when superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.8 Å (94 Cα atoms, supplemental Fig. S3C). Both of the crystals contained one HRDC monomer in the asymmetric unit. The solvent content of the I4122 crystal was considerably high (71.6% of the total volume, cf. 62.7% in the P6222 crystal), which resulted in less contact area between the packed molecules. The following discussion concerns the I4122 structure. The structure revealed that residues 1152–1226 of the WRN fragment fold into a conventional HRDC domain composed of five α-helices and one 310-helix packed together (Fig. 2A). The helices are connected by loops that are well defined in the electron-density map. Many of the hydrophobic residues assemble to form a domain core, in which Leu1160, Leu1184, Met1187, and Ile1219 are especially important for hydrophobic interactions. The four residues are highly conserved in WRN, Sgs1, and E. coli RecQ, as well as hydrophobic in BLM (Fig. 1). Within the range of this conventional HRDC domain (residues 1152–1226), the structure was superimposed on those of Sgs1 (19Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and E. coli RecQ (20Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with root mean square deviations of 2.4 and 2.0 Å, respectively (74 Cα atoms, Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, the additional ∼10 residues at each of the N and C termini of the domain core, which are located beyond the conventional HRDC region and are disordered (or lacking) in Sgs1 and E. coli, were found to form a novel motif unique to WRN (shown by the red molecular surface in Fig. 2A). The N-terminal residues 1147–1151 extend the first helix α1 to the N terminus, yielding a considerably longer helix (25 residues) compared with those in Sgs1 (19 residues) and E. coli (18 residues), whereas the C-terminal residues 1227–1235 form an extended-loop motif that traverses straight along the hydrophobic surface of the domain (described in the next section). The two terminal extensions are in close spatial proximity on top of the do"
https://openalex.org/W2020343635,"Periplasmic substrate binding proteins are known for iron, zinc, manganese, nickel, and molybdenum but not copper. Synechocystis PCC 6803 requires copper for thylakoid-localized plastocyanin and cytochrome oxidase. Here we show that mutants deficient in a periplasmic substrate binding protein FutA2 have low cytochrome oxidase activity and produce cytochrome c6 when grown under copper conditions (150 nm) in which wild-type cells use plastocyanin rather than cytochrome c6. Anaerobic separation of extracts by two-dimensional native liquid chromatography followed by metal analysis and peptide mass-fingerprinting establish that accumulation of copper-plastocyanin is impaired, but iron-ferredoxin is unaffected in DeltafutA2 grown in 150 nm copper. However, recombinant FutA2 binds iron in preference to copper in vitro with an apparent Fe(III) affinity similar to that of its paralog FutA1, the principal substrate binding protein for iron import. FutA2 is also associated with iron and not copper in periplasm extracts, and this Fe(III)-protein complex is absent in DeltafutA2. There are differences in the soluble protein and small-molecule complexes of copper and iron, and the total amount of both elements increases in periplasm extracts of DeltafutA2 relative to wild type. Changes in periplasm protein and small-molecule complexes for other metals are also observed in DeltafutA2. It is proposed that FutA2 contributes to metal partitioning in the periplasm by sequestering Fe(III), which limits aberrant Fe(III) associations with vital binding sites for other metals, including copper."
https://openalex.org/W2071030911,"Engagement of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) initiated by the Src kinase Lyn triggers rapid signaling cascades, leading to proliferation, differentiation or growth arrest of B cells. The Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway, activated through cytokine receptors, mediates similar responses. Hypothesizing that Src and JAK pathways engage in crosstalk in B-cell signaling, we studied wild-type and Lyn-null B-cell lines, which express BCR. We found that activated BCR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-STAT, which required Lyn. To confirm that STAT activation is not due to JAK, we cloned the chicken homologs of JAK1 and JAK2 and made their antisense constructs. In cells expressing antisense JAK1 and JAK2, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT was not inhibited following BCR stimulation. Using activation loop-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies, we did not detect phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2 after BCR stimulation. The JAK inhibitor AG490 did not inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn or STAT after BCR simulation. An in vitro phosphorylation assay showed that Lyn directly phosphorylates STAT3. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, BCR stimulation led to enhanced DNA binding of the STAT3 in DT40, but not in the Lyn-null cells. We conclude that BCR engagement activates the STAT pathway via Lyn, independent of JAK."
https://openalex.org/W1981338646,"Tumor cells often acquire intrinsic resistance to the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β); moreover, TGF-β can confer invasive properties to established tumor cells. In the present study, we show that TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) trigger proper Smad signaling in human endometrial carcinoma cell lines and efficiently inhibit cellular proliferation. These cells, however, exhibit a high degree of resistance to TGF-β pro-apoptotic effects; we found that this resistant phenotype would be acquired through up-regulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) levels. In addition, using RNA interference and pharmacological inhibitors, we show that TGF-β increases cellular invasiveness via two distinct signaling pathways in endometrial carcinoma cells: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-dependent up-regulation of XIAP and protein kinase C-dependent induction of matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression. Additionally, these findings were correlated with clinical observations showing abundant TGF-β immunoreactivity in human endometrial carcinoma tumors in vivo, extending from the epithelial compartment to the stroma upon acquisition of an invasive phenotype (gradually from grades I to III).

Dysregulation of apoptosis is an early event in the pathogenesis of endometrial carcinomas (1.Arends M.J. Histopathology. 1999; 35: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); this inherent resistance to various pro-apoptotic signals may contribute to endometrial tumor resistance to current chemotherapeutic agents.

The three TGF-βs (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) can activate TGF-β receptors (TβRI, TβRII, and TβRIII) with unequal affinity (2.del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. J. Biol.

Activated TβRII serine/threonine kinase receptor recruits, phosphorylates, and activates TβRI; Smad2 and Smad3 directly interact with and become phosphorylated by activated TβRI and subsequently associate with Smad4 to form heterodimeric complexes that translocate to the nucleus, where they can trigger downstream transcriptional responses (4.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). TGF-β can also trigger ERK activation (5.Alabert C. Rogers L. Kahn L. Niellez S. Fafet P. Cerulis S. Blanchard J.M. Hipskind R.A. Vignais M.L. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), again leading to modulation of cellular transcriptional activity. In numerous cell types, TGF-β receptor engagement can also trigger apoptosis; notably, TGF-β signaling leads to the activation of caspases (6.Schrantz N. Blanchard D.A. Auffredou M.T. Sharma S. Leca G. Vazquez A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a family of cysteine proteases that are considered as the main effectors of apoptosis. TGF-β can also promote cell death by down-regulating X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) (7.Gottfried Y. Rotem A. Lotan R. Steller H. Larisch S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8.Shooner C. Caron P.L. Frechette-Frigon G. Leblanc V. Dery M.C. Asselin E. Reprod. Biol.

Although the three TGF-β isoforms are detectable at high levels in endometrial tumors (9.Gold L.I. Saxena B. Mittal K.R. Marmor M. Goswami S. Nactigal L. Korc M. Demopoulos R.I. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2347-2358PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular signaling cascades triggered by individual isoforms in these cells remain largely unknown. Moreover, although TGF-β can modulate the invasive properties of established tumor cells (10.Farina A.R. Coppa A. Tiberio A. Tacconelli A. Turco A. Colletta G. Gulino A. Mackay A.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), little information regarding the effect of specific TGF-β isoforms on the invasiveness of resistant endometrial carcinoma cells is available. We have thus assessed the ability of each TGF-β isoform to activate signaling pathways in human endometrial carcinoma cells and compared their effect on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness. We have also correlated in vitro results with clinical data from human endometrial carcinoma tissue samples. Cell Lines and Reagents−Human endometrial carcinoma KLE and Hec-1A cell lines were purchased from ATCC. KLE cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-Ham’s F-12 medium without HEPES supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/ml gentamycin; Hec-1A cells were maintained in McCoy’s medium supplemented with 5% BGS (bovine growth serum) and 50 mg/ml gentamycin. All of the antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) except for anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Recombinant TGF-βs were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). LY294002 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. RNA Isolation and Analysis−Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First strand cDNA was synthetized from 0.4 μg of RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers for PCR amplification are listed in Table 1. PCRs were conducted in a MJ Research Thermal cycler (model PTC-100), using the following parameters: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at Tm (Table 1), and 1 min at 72 °C for 36 cycles, except for GAPDH (25 cycles). The reaction mixture was size-separated on an agarose gel and visualized using SYBR-Safe™ (Invitrogen) staining upon ultraviolet transillumination.TABLE 1Primers for PCR amplificationGeneForward primerReverse primerTmProduct size (bp)TGF-β1gatagccatttcctcaccgaggtggcgttcatgtaggagt66756TGF-β2gcgacgaagagtactacgccctccattgctgagacgtcaa58218TGF-β3ggttttccgcttcaatgtgtgcagttctcctccaagttgc58556TβRItcaggaagtggctctggtctcgtttccctgaaccatgact60180TβRIIatgacctggctaacagtggggccatggagtagacatcggt58121TβRIIIccaagatgaatggcacacacccatctggccaaccactact60151MMP-9caacatcacctattggatcccgggtgtagagtctctcgct60480TIMP-1accagaccaccttataccagcgggactggaagcccttttcagag60395XIAPgagaagatgacttttaacagttttgattttttgcttgaaagtaatgactgtgt581485GAPDHgtcagtggtggacctgaccttgagcttgacaaagtggtcg58212 Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis−The cells were washed with PBS and submitted to lysis in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete™ from Roche Applied Science) followed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Equal amounts of cell lysates (as determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay) were separated onto 15% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, probed with primary antibody (all of the antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology), washed in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Detection was performed using SuperSignal West Femto™ substrate (Pierce), as described by the manufacturer. MTT Proliferation Assay−The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 9 × 103 cells/well in 200 μl of culture medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which they reached 80% confluence. Recombinant TGF-βs (Cell Signaling Technology) were added to selected wells at the indicated concentrations in 100-μl culture medium, and plates were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. MTT reagent (tetrazolium salt; Sigma) was added to the wells (10 μl of a 0.5% solution in PBS) 3.5 h before the end of incubation period, after which conversion of yellow tetrazolium salt to blue thiazol crystals by metabolically active cells was stopped by adding 100 μl of a 10% SDS, 0.1% HCl in PBS solution to each well. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow complete solubilization of thiazol crystals, and the intensity of blue emission in each well was measured using a FluoStar multiwell plate reader (BMG Laboratories, Durham, NC). The percentage of proliferating cells was calculated as the ratio of optical densities of treated to nontreated (control) cells. Hoechst Nuclear Staining−The treated cells were collected, washed twice in PBS, resuspended at an approximate density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in PBS containing Hoechst 33258 (Sigma), and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C before fluorescence microscopy analysis of apoptotic cells. At least 200 cells were counted for each sample, and a percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic cells (with characteristic apoptotic morphology such as nuclear shrinkage and condensation) to total cell count. Invasion Assay−The invasive properties of treated KLE and Hec-1A cells were measured using Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts (Costar, Corning, NY). Briefly, the cells were treated for a 24-h period with TGF-βs, following a 1-h pretreatment in the presence or absence of 2 μm PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology), 50 nm MMP-9 Inhibitor I (VWR, Montreal, Canada) or 1 μm PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (Sigma), or after down-regulating intracellular XIAP levels using siRNA technology. Transwell inserts with a 8-μm pore size were coated with 2 mg/ml Matrigel, and the cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in respective basal medium without serum. The lower chambers were filled with 600 μl of respective culture medium, and 2 × 105 cells were added to the upper chamber inserts. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. After that incubation period, invasive cells had reached the porous insert, where they adhered, but a proportion of these invasive cells had crossed the porous barrier and reached the lower compartment. Medium filling the lower chamber was collected, and floating invasive cells were recovered by centrifugation (1 min at 6,000 × g) before they were resuspended in 30 μl of PBS and counted using an hemocytometer. A percentage of cell invasion was calculated from the ratio of cells recovered from the lower compartment to the total number of cells loaded in the upper compartment. Gelatin Zymography−Serum-free conditioned medium from KLE cells treated with recombinant TGF-β3 for the indicated times was assessed by zymography for the presence of gelatinolytic enzymes. The samples were applied without heating or reduction to a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). After size separation upon electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice for 60 min with 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS and incubated for 24 h in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained in 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% acetic acid. The proteolytic activity was identified as a clear band on a blue background. Targeting of XIAP or Smad4 by siRNA−The cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well (required to reach ∼75% confluency in 24 h) and allowed to adhere overnight. On the day of the experiment, XIAP (5′-ccaagugguaguccuguuucagcau-3′ and 5′-augcugaaacaggacuaccacuugg-3′), control (5′-acucuaucugcacgcugacuu-3′ and 5′-aagucagcgugcagauagagu-3′), or Smad4 (5′-ggucuuugauuugcgucagtt-3′ and 5′-cugacgcaaaucaaagacctt-3′) siRNAs were mixed with SuperFect™ transfection reagent following the supplier’s instructions (Qiagen) and added to the cells (working concentration, 100 nm). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and medium was replaced with fresh medium containing TGF-β or other agents as indicated in the figure legends. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C before the cells were collected. Immunofluorescence-based Detection of TGF-β3 in Clinical Samples−Human endometrial carcinoma tissue section slides (Cybrdi, Frederick, MD), containing 17 grade I tumor specimens, 33 grade II tumor specimens, 5 grade III tumor specimens, and 3 normal endometrial specimens, were used. The tissues, obtained from biopsies, were already formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded. The slides were deparaffinized by heating at 60 °C for 30 min followed by two washes in NeoClear solvent (VWR Canlab, Mississauga, Canada) and progressively hydrated with successive washes at room temperature in 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol in PBS, 70% ethanol in PBS, and finally PBS. After permeabilization for 6 min in boiling citrate solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1%Triton X-100 in water), the tissue slides were washed twice in PBS at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 1-h incubation with goat serum at room temperature in a humidified chamber, and the tissues were probed with rabbit anti-human TGF-β3 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed twice in PBS, and the tissues were probed with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber protected from light. The slides were washed once in PBS and counterstained with Hoechst nuclear dye followed by two rinses in water. The tissues were covered with prolong anti-fade mounting medium and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis−The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (PRISM software version 3.03; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Differences between experimental groups were were determined by the Tukey’s test. Statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05. TGF-βs and Their Receptors Are Produced by KLE Endometrial Carcinoma Cell Line−Endometrial tumors have been reported to contain the three TGF-β isoforms in vivo (9.Gold L.I. Saxena B. Mittal K.R. Marmor M. Goswami S. Nactigal L. Korc M. Demopoulos R.I. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2347-2358PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether KLE and Hec-1A human endometrial carcinoma cell lines produced TGF-βs and their receptors. In KLE cells TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 transcripts were abundantly expressed, whereas we could only detect a minimal level of TGF-β2 (Fig. 1A), and high levels of the three TGF-β receptors transcripts were present (Fig. 1B), suggesting that TGF-β can exert autocrine action in this cell line. In Hec-1A cell line all three TGF-β receptors, and only TGF-β3, are produced (data not shown). TGF-β Isoforms Inhibit the Growth of Endometrial Carcinoma Cells−We have compared the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β isoforms on endometrial carcinoma cells using MTT proliferation assays. We found that KLE cells are equally sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of the different TGF-βs, except after a prolonged exposure of 72 h when TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were more potent than TGF-β2 to suppress KLE cell proliferation (Fig. 1, C–E). Similar results were also obtained with the Hec-1A cell line (data not shown). TGF-β Isoforms Are Unable to Trigger Apoptosis in Endometrial Carcinoma Cells−We have determined the effect of TGF-β isoforms on apoptosis of endometrial carcinoma cells using Hoechst nuclear staining. The results showed no significant increase in apoptotic cell numbers in TGF-β-treated KLE cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 1F); the Hec-1A cell line was also resistant to pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-βs (data not shown). These results indicate that TGF-β-activated pathway(s) involved in apoptosis are disrupted in endometrial carcinoma cells. TGF-β Isoforms Similarly Activate Smad Signaling in Endometrial Carcinoma Cells−We have examined Smad signaling triggered by TGF-β isoforms in endometrial carcinoma cells. Although Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 levels were not modulated by TGF-β isoforms, we observed a similar increase in the phosphorylation/activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in KLE cells treated with each TGF-β isoform (Fig. 2). Each TGF-β isoform is thus able to activate proper Smad signaling in endometrial carcinoma cells. TGF-β Isoforms Induce the Activation of Effector Caspases in Carcinoma Cells−We have examined whether deficient caspase activation was responsible for the lack of apoptotic effect of TGF-βs. TGF-β isoforms similarly increased the levels of cleaved caspases-3 and -6 in KLE cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that TGF-β signaling disruption takes place downstream from the effector caspases activation in KLE endometrial carcinoma cells. XIAP Expression Is Up-regulated by TGF-β Isoforms−XIAP can block pro-apoptotic caspase signaling upon binding and inhibition of effector caspases activity (11.Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). We have characterized the regulation of expression of XIAP in carcinoma cells by TGF-β isoforms. XIAP is constitutively expressed and dramatically up-regulated upon treatment of both KLE (Fig. 4) and Hec-1A (supplemental Fig. S1) cells with either TGF-β isoform. These results thus identify XIAP as a candidate molecule for the late inhibition of TGF-β pro-apoptotic signaling in resistant carcinoma cells. TGF-β3 Increases Cellular Invasiveness by Activating PI3-K−We have evaluated the effect of TGF-βs on the invasiveness of resistant endometrial carcinoma cells, using Matrigel invasion assay. KLE cells only exhibited moderate intrinsic invasive properties, but invasiveness was selectively increased by TGF-β3 (Fig. 5A). TGF-β3 also selectively up-regulated the invasiveness of Hec-1A cells, which were poorly invasive in basal conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). Specific PI3-K pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 reduced by more than 60% the TGF-β3-induced invasiveness of KLE cells, whereas MEK inhibitor PD98059 and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 had no effect (Fig. 5B). LY294002 also blocked (by more that 70%) the effect of TGF-β3 on the invasiveness of Hec-1A cells, whereas MEK inhibitor PD98059 and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 had no effect (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that TGF-β3 confers invasive properties to endometrial carcinoma cell, in part via PI3-K/AKT activation. XIAP Is Involved in TGF-β3-increased Cellular Invasiveness via PI3-K−We investigated whether PI3-K activity was involved in the up-regulation of XIAP by TGF-β3 in these cells. Indeed, PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the TGF-β3-induced up-regulation of XIAP (Fig. 5, C and D) but not the increase of XIAP induced by TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (Fig. 5, E and F). Because activation of PI3-K by TGF-β3 leads to up-regulation of XIAP levels, as well as increased cellular invasiveness, we have examined whether XIAP could be involved in the invasiveness of KLE cells. When KLE cells were transfected with XIAP siRNA, endogenous XIAP levels were reduced more than 50%, and TGF-β3 could only minimally increase XIAP expression to reach a level similar to cells that had been transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 6, A and B). In these conditions, intrinsic invasive properties of KLE cells were not modulated, but reducing XIAP levels partially impeded the ability of TGF-β3 to increase the invasiveness of KLE cells (Fig. 6C). We also observed that reducing XIAP levels partially blocked the ability of TGF-β3 to increase the invasiveness of Hec-1A cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that although endogenous XIAP levels do not dictate intrinsic invasive properties of endometrial carcinoma cells, the increase of cellular invasiveness by TGF-β3 would be mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of XIAP levels. XIAP Up-regulation Confers Resistance to Pro-apoptotic Effects of TGF-β3−We have determined whether XIAP up-regulation was involved in resistance to pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β3. After exposure to TGF-β3, the apoptotic index was significantly higher in KLE cells that had been transfected with XIAP siRNA compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 6D), indicating that the presence of XIAP blocks TGF-β3-induced apoptosis in KLE cells. In addition, we found that knockdown of XIAP also caused increased apoptotic index in KLE cells upon exposure to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that increased XIAP content in these cells protects from apoptosis induced by each TGF-β isoforms. MMP-9 Is Involved in TGF-β3-increased KLE Invasiveness via PKC Activation−Because MMP-9 actively participates in tumor cell invasion (12.Lakka S.S. Rajan M. Gondi C. Yanamandra N. Chandrasekar N. Jasti S.L. Adachi Y. Siddique K. Gujrati M. Olivero W. Dinh D.H. Kouraklis G. Kyritsis A.P. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8011-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we have examined whether TGF-β3 increased the invasiveness of KLE cells through up-regulation of MMP-9 expression in KLE cells. We found that resting KLE cells do not reproducibly express detectable levels of MMP-9, but exposure to TGF-β3 induced a transient expression of MMP-9 transcript (Fig. 7A) and protein (Fig. 7B). TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were unable to increase the expression of MMP-9 in KLE cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Treatment with LY294002 did not impede the induction of MMP-9 expression in KLE cells by TGF-β3 (Fig. 7C), nor did treatment with PD98059 and SB203580 (supplemental Fig. S3), but selective PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride partly blocked this effect (Fig. 7D), showing a role for PKCs in MMP-9 induction by TGF-β3. Noteworthy, this up-regulation of MMP-9 via PKC activation is involved in the increase in KLE invasiveness by TGF-β3, because MMP-9 Inhibitor I, a selective inhibitor of MMP-9 activity, completely abolished TGF-β3-triggered invasiveness (Fig. 7E), and given that chelerythrine chloride also inhibited TGF-β3-triggered invasiveness (Fig. 7E). TGF-β3-activated Pathways Mediating XIAP and MMP-9 Up-regulation Are Independent−We have examined whether in addition to MMP-9 induction, PKC activation was involved in XIAP up-regulation by TGF-β3 in these cells and whether XIAP, which can act as a transcriptional activator (13.Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was involved in MMP-9 expression in KLE cells. PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride did not block the up-regulation of XIAP by TGF-β3 (Fig. 7D), indicating that PKCs were not involved in XIAP up-regulation. Moreover, reduction of XIAP levels by siRNA did not interfere with MMP-9 induction by TGF-β3 (Fig. 7F), indicating that XIAP is not involved in MMP-9 induction by TGF-β3. Because PI3-K activation, which partly mediates XIAP up-regulation by TGF-β3, was not involved in MMP-9 up-regulation (Fig. 7C), we conclude that PKC-dependent up-regulation of MMP-9, and PI3-K-dependent up-regulation of XIAP, occur independently in KLE cells upon exposure to TGF-β3. TGF-β3-mediated Cell Invasion Is Smad-dependent−To determine whether Smad signaling, which is properly activated by TGF-β3 in KLE cells (Fig. 2), was involved in TGF-β3-induced cellular invasiveness, we silenced Smad4, a necessary component of Smad pathway, in both KLE and Hec-1A cell lines using RNA interference, before treating the cells with TGF-β3. Our results showed that down-regulation of Smad4 protein (Fig. 8, A and C) impaired the ability of TGF-β3 to increase cellular invasiveness (Fig. 8, B and D); in addition, we found that knockdown of Smad4 impaired the ability of TGF-β3 to up-regulate XIAP (Fig. 8, A and C), but not to induce MMP-9 in KLE cells (Fig. 8, E and F). These results indicate a role for Smad signaling in TGF-β3-induced XIAP up-regulation and increased cellular invasiveness. TGF-β3 Is Present in Endometrial Carcinoma Tumors in Vivo−To correlate our observations of a role for TGF-β3 in HEC cell survival and invasiveness with clinical data, we have conducted immunofluorescence analysis on a large number of endometrial carcinoma tissue samples representing various stages of the disease (Fig. 9). In normal endometrial tissue samples, TGF-β3 expression was found to be almost exclusive to epithelial cells, although sparse TGF-β3-expressing cells were present in the stromal compartment (Fig. 9D). In stage I endometrial carcinoma samples, TGF-β3 localized to the basal surface of epithelial lining and, to a similar extent, to adjacent stromal cells (Fig. 9A); in stage II endometrial carcinoma tissues, weak TGF-β3 immunoreactivity was found at the basal surface of epithelial lining, and a few cells in the stromal compartment showed intense TGF-β3 signal, whereas most of the stromal cells showed a constant but weak signal (Fig. 9B); in stage III endometrial carcinoma tissue samples, TGF-β3 immunoreactivity was observed at the basal surface of epithelial compartment and in the stroma where TGF-β3 immunoreactivity was strongly observed (Fig. 9C). Collectively, these results confirm that TGF-β3 is produced in endometrial tumors in vivo, by epithelial as well as stromal cells, consistent with a role for this TGF-β isoform in HEC cells survival and invasiveness. In the early events of epithelial tumorigenesis, TGF-β generally exerts growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cells, thereby suppressing tumor growth. However, tumor cells become increasingly resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β, and in the late stages of carcinogenesis, TGF-β would rather exert tumor promoting effects on tumor cells, notably by stimulating invasion and metastasis. Different types of malignant cells have acquired the ability to override the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β through various mechanisms that include down-regulation or mutation of TGF-β receptors (14.Parekh T.V. Gama P. Wen X. Demopoulos R. Munger J.S. Carcangiu M.L. Reiss M. Gold L.I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2778-2790PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), down-regulation of Smads (16.Maliekal T.T. Antony M.L. Nair A. Paulmurugan R. Karunagaran D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4889-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and increased AKT activity (17.Jin X. Gossett D.R. Wang S. Yang D. Cao Y. Chen J. Guo R. Reynolds R.K. Lin J. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The three mammalian TGF-β isoforms are present in endometrial tumors (9.Gold L.I. Saxena B. Mittal K.R. Marmor M. Goswami S. Nactigal L. Korc M. Demopoulos R.I. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2347-2358PubMed Google Scholar), and several lines of evidence suggest that endometrial carcinoma cells are resistant to TGF-β growth inhibitory effects (reviewed in Ref. 18.Gold L.I. Parekh T.V. Semin. Reprod. Endocrinol. 1999; 17: 73-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); underlying mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. We have examined the signaling pathways activated by each TGF-β isoform in endometrial carcinoma cells and compared their effect on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness, using the KLE and Hec-1A endometrial carcinoma cell lines. High levels of TGF-β1 transcripts are presents in KLE cells, in agreement with previous reports of TGF-β1 production by endometrial carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo (19.Perlino E. Loverro G. Maiorano E. Giannini T. Cazzolla A. Napoli A. Fiore M.G. Ricco R. Marra E. Selvaggi L. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20.Yabushita H. Narumiya H. Hiratake K. Yamada H. Shimazu M. Sawaguchi K. Noguchi M. Nakanishi M. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Res. 2000; 26: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the KLE cell line is tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously in nude mice and invasive (21.Park D.W. Choi D.S. Ryu H.S. Kwon H.C. Joo H. Min C.K. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which indicates a late stage phenotype and legitimates the evaluation of the invasion promoting effects of TGF-βs. Hec-1A cell line is also widely used as a model of endometrial carcinoma cells (22.Watanabe Y. Shibata K. Kikkawa F. Kajiyama H. Ino K. Hattori A. Tsujimoto M. Mizutani S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6497-6503PubMed Google Scholar). We have showed that endometrial carcinoma cell lines KLE and Hec-1A are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β, although to a varying level depending on the isoform. Smad signaling activated by TGF-β reportedly interferes with cell cycle regulation and cellular growth properties, and this growth inhibitory effect of TGF-βs was indeed accompanied by proper activation of Smad components. We also showed that endometrial carcinoma cells were resistant to the pro-apoptotic effect of TGF-βs. Effector caspase-3 was cleaved/activated in KLE carcinoma cells upon exposure to each TGF-β isoform, suggesting that the apoptotic program was indeed initiated in KLE cells upon exposure to TGF-βs but that other cellular mechanisms interfered with late apoptotic events. Indeed, XIAP, which directly inhibits the activity of effector caspases (11.Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), is up-regulated in KLE cells after exposure to each TGF-β isoform and efficiently blocks TGF-β-induced apoptosis in KLE cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a positive regulation of XIAP by TGF-βs. Others had reported that in hepatoma cells, TGF-β1 down-regulates XIAP levels, which would facilitate initiation of apoptosis by caspase-3 (23.Shima Y. Nakao K. Nakashima T. Kawakami A. Nakata K. Hamasaki K. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); this discrepancy may result from cell type specificities. It is known that TGF-β1 can directly confer invasive properties to established cancer cells (10.Farina A.R. Coppa A. Tiberio A. Tacconelli A. Turco A. Colletta G. Gulino A. Mackay A.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24.Shigeoka Y. Igishi T. Matsumoto S. Nakanishi H. Kodani M. Yasuda K. Hitsuda Y. Shimizu E. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 130: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that TGF-β isoforms differ in their ability to modulate the invasive behavior of endometrial carcinoma cells, because only TGF-β3 could increase the invasiveness of KLE and Hec-1A cells. In this regard, only TGF-β3 triggered PI3-K activation and increased AKT phosphorylation/activation; moreover, we showed that TGF-β3 increased the invasiveness of endometrial carcinoma cells through activation of PI3-K. We also found that only TGF-β3 induces the expression of MMP-9 in KLE cells, and MMP-9 activity was necessary for TGF-β3-increased invasiveness of KLE cells; in the clinic levels of MMP-9 were shown to correlate with an advanced stage (involving tissue invasion) of endometrial tumors (25.Aglund K. Rauvala M. Puistola U. Angstrom T. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Zackrisson B. Stendahl U. Gynecol. Oncol. 2004; 94: 699-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, which were unable to trigger MMP-9 expression by these cells, did not stimulate the invasiveness of KLE cells. Others had reported that TGF-β1 increased invasiveness in KLE cells (20.Yabushita H. Narumiya H. Hiratake K. Yamada H. Shimazu M. Sawaguchi K. Noguchi M. Nakanishi M. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Res. 2000; 26: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but in the latter study TGF-β1 increased MMP-9 expression by KLE cells, which nonetheless supports our findings that increased MMP-9 expression confers invasive properties to endometrial carcinoma cells. The fact that TGF-β3 induces the expression of MMP-9 by KLE cells suggests the presence of a positive loop for regulation of autocrine TGF-β3 tumor promoting effect, because MMP-9 can activate latent TGF-β isoforms into their active forms (26.Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that PKC activity was involved in TGF-β3-triggered MMP-9 induction and invasiveness of KLE cells, in accordance with several other studies describing a positive role for PKCs in MMP-9 expression (27.Woo J.H. Lim J.H. Kim Y.H. Suh S.I. Min D.S. Chang J.S. Lee Y.H. Park J.W. Kwon T.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and in cellular invasiveness (28.Zhang J. Anastasiadis P.Z. Liu Y. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22118-22123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our results showed for the first time that XIAP was involved in the regulation of invasiveness of endometrial carcinoma cells that had been exposed to TGF-β3. Given the previous indication that XIAP can function as a cofactor for TGF-β1 in the regulation of gene expression (13.Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it is possible that in endometrial carcinoma cells, up-regulation of XIAP by TGF-β3 leads to the modulation of transcriptional activity of particular genes involved in cellular motility/invasiveness. Our results showed, however, that XIAP alone was not sufficient to induce the expression of MMP-9 in KLE cells, which probably explains why TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 are unable to induce MMP-9 expression, and KLE invasiveness even though XIAP is up-regulated to a level similar to that resulting from TGF-β3 exposure. Alternatively XIAP could, in combination with one or more cellular components selectively mobilized by TGF-β3, activate the expression of components involved in MMP-9 expression. Such a functional link between XIAP and MMP-9 is highly improbable, however, considering that inhibition of PI3-K, which completely abolished XIAP up-regulation by TGF-β3, did not impede MMP-9 induction. Because PKCs are not involved in XIAP up-regulation by TGF-β3 in KLE cells, we conclude that TGF-β3 independently triggers PKC-dependent MMP-9 up-regulation and PI3-K-dependent XIAP up-regulation. Interestingly, TGF-β3 did not induce MMP-9 expression in Hec-1A cells but did increase their invasive properties, indicating that induction of MMP-9 expression is not obligatory for TGF-β3-induced invasion in these cells. Similarly, in KLE cells, blockade of PKC-mediated MMP-9 induction only partially reduced TGF-β3-induced invasion. Importantly, this further suggests that although increased MMP-9 activity promotes HEC cells invasiveness, increased MMP-9 expression is not necessary for TGF-β3-induced invasion in endometrial carcinoma cells in general. In addition, our finding that in Hec-1A cells TGF-β3 promoted XIAP-dependent invasiveness, as observed with KLE cells, but was not able to induce MMP-9 expression in Hec-1A cells strengthens our conclusion that TGF-β3 induces HEC invasiveness through independent up-regulation of both MMP-9 and XIAP. This suggests that XIAP is the critical and key factor in TGF-β3-induced invasion in endometrial carcinoma cells. Finally, we have highlighted the importance of Smad pathway in TGF-β3-induced cellular invasiveness using RNA interference. Others had already reported the involvement of Smad signaling in regulating cancer cell invasiveness in vitro (29.Javelaud D. Delmas V. Moller M. Sextius P. Andre J. Menashi S. Larue L. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7624-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30.Leivonen S.K. Ala-Aho R. Koli K. Grenman R. Peltonen J. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2588-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), notably upon regulation of the expression of particular MMPs (30.Leivonen S.K. Ala-Aho R. Koli K. Grenman R. Peltonen J. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2588-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in the case of endometrial carcinoma cells, TGF-β3-activated Smad signaling is probably not involved in the regulation of MMP-9, which we have showed to play a role in TGF-β3-induced invasiveness. Smad4 is, however, involved in the increase of XIAP protein content by TGF-β3. Noteworthy, our finding that knockdown of Smad4 impairs the up-regulation of XIAP as well as the increase in cellular invasiveness triggered by TGF-β3 strengthens our conclusion of a role for XIAP in cellular invasion. The selective ability of TGF-β3 to increase invasiveness in a XIAP-dependent manner and the fact that each isoform up-regulates XIAP can be explained as follows: 1) only TGF-β3 increases XIAP in a PI3-K-dependent manner in both KLE and Hec-1A cells, suggesting that other factors are also regulated in this TGF-β3-specific pathway and are necessary for XIAP to exert its invasive promoting role, and 2) in KLE cells only TGF-β3 induces MMP-9 expression, which we have shown to partially mediate TGF-β3-induced invasiveness. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that TGF-β3 confers invasive properties to endometrial cancer cells that are resistant to its pro-apoptotic effects through PI3-K-dependent up-regulation of XIAP and through PKC-dependent induction of MMP-9 expression and in a Smad-dependent manner (Fig. 10). Such a role for TGF-β3 in HEC cells survival and invasiveness correlates with clinical data, as we highlighted the presence of TGF-β3 in endometrial carcinoma tumors in vivo. The results demonstrated that upon progression toward a more invasive phenotype (from stage I to stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma), TGF-β3 immunoreactivity gradually extends from the epithelial compartment (in normal tissues) to the stroma (in adenocarcinoma), consistent with a role for TGF-β3 in HEC invasiveness. Currently an experimental metastasis model is under development that will allow us to investigate more precisely the involvement of TGF-β3 in endometrial carcinoma metastasis in vivo."

We have examined the effects of E6 and E7 genes of human papillomaviruses type 16 (HPV-16) on ErbB2 expression in primary human cervical keratinocytes (HCK) immortalized with hTERT (HCK1T). In E6-positive cells (HCK1T-E6 and HCK1T-E6E7), ErbB2 expression levels increased with the cell density. HCK1T-E6E7 showed impaired contact inhibition and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar which were abrogated with introduction of ErbB2-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or an ErbB2 specific inhibitor AG825. Furthermore, increased ErbB2 expression was also observed in HPV16 positive cervical cancer cell lines and this was diminished by introduction of HPV16E6- or E6AP-shRNA. At post-confluence cell densities, ErbB2 protein was stabilized in the presence of E6 whereas increased ErbB2 expression was not obvious with E6 mutants incapable of degrading p53. Furthermore, introduction of p53-shRNA to HCK1T resulted in increased ErbB2 protein stability, indicating possible ErbB2 regulation through p53. Finally, we showed that tumor formation of ErbB2-shRNA introduced SiHa cells were almost abolished. Taken together, these data indicate an important role of ErbB2 regulation by HPV16 E6 in oncogenic transformation of human cervical keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1977575313,"Phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) activation depends on a heterotrimeric complex of adaptor proteins composed of LAT, Gads, and SLP-76. Upon T cell receptor stimulation, a portion of PLC-γ1 is recruited to a detergent-resistant membrane fraction known as the glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (GEMs), or lipid rafts, to which LAT is constitutively localized. In addition to LAT, PLC-γ1 GEM recruitment depended on SLP-76, and, in particular, required the Gads-binding domain of SLP-76. The N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites and P-I region of SLP-76 were not required for PLC-γ1 GEM recruitment, but were required for PLC-γ1 phosphorylation at Tyr783. Thus, GEM recruitment can be insufficient for full activation of PLC-γ1 in the absence of a second SLP-76-mediated event. Indeed, a GEM-targeted derivative of PLC-γ1 depended on SLP-76 for T cell receptor-induced phosphorylation at Tyr783 and subsequent NFAT activation. On a biochemical level, SLP-76 inducibly associated with both Vav and catalytically active ITK, which efficiently phosphorylated a PLC-γ1 fragment at Tyr783 in vitro. Both associations were disrupted upon mutation of the N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SLP-76. The P-I region deletion disrupted Vav association and reduced SLP-76-associated kinase activity. A smaller deletion within the P-I region, which does not impair PLC-γ1 activation, did not impair the association with Vav, but reduced SLP-76-associated kinase activity. These results provide new insight into the multiple roles of SLP-76 and the functional importance of its interactions with other signaling proteins.

Gads, and SLP-76, serve as pathway-specific regulators of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (1Yablonski D. Weiss A. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 93-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 is a ubiquitous enzyme, regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr775 and Tyr783 (2Poulin B. Sekiya F. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When activated, PLC-γ1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, producing the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which trigger calcium flux and contribute to protein kinase C and Ras activation, respectively. In T cells, the coordinated activity of calcium- and Ras-dependent signaling pathways leads to the activation of NFAT, a regulator of interleukin-2 transcription (7Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Given the importance of PLC-γ1-dependent signaling events, it is not surprising that the activation of PLC-γ1 is tightly regulated. The LAT, Gads, and SLP-76 adaptor proteins appear to constitute an integrated signaling unit that couples immunoreceptor-mediated activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases to the activation of PLC-γ1 (1Yablonski D. Weiss A. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 93-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Liu S.K. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6284-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The use of three adaptor proteins to regulate one enzyme is a recurrent theme in complex signaling pathways. In a similar fashion, three adaptors (FRS2, Grb2, and Gab1) cooperate to activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase in the fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway (10Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R.

Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Evidence that LAT, Gads, and SLP-76 work in concert includes their similar expression patterns and localization to the same signaling complex; similar signaling defects observed in LAT- and SLP-76-deficient T cell lines; and similar T cell and mast cell phenotypes observed in LAT-, SLP-76-, and Gads-deficient mice (1Yablonski D. Weiss A. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 93-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Liu S.K. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J.

Most convincingly, SLP-76 alone cannot reconstitute B cell receptor signaling in a B cell line lacking the SLP-76 analog BLNK (B cell linker); rather, cotransfection of SLP-76, LAT, and Gads is required (13Ishiai M.

Over the past years, the mechanisms whereby these adaptors mediate the activation of PLC-γ1 are beginning to be understood, as summarized briefly below. LAT, a transmembrane adaptor protein, is constitutively localized to specialized membrane microdomains known as glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEMs), lipid rafts, or detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (15Lin J.

The PLC-γ1/LAT interaction may serve to recruit PLC-γ1 to the GEMs. Indeed, mutation of the GEM-targeting motif within LAT prevents both tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and activation of PLC-γ1 (15Lin J.

Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), which is recruited to LAT indirectly via Gads (9Liu S.K. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6284-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SLP-76 consists of three domains that mediate interactions with many different signaling proteins: an N-terminal acidic domain containing three tyrosine phosphorylation sites, a large central proline-rich region, and a C-terminal SH2 domain (1Yablonski D. Weiss A. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 93-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Located between the tyrosine phosphorylation sites and the Gads-binding site, a portion of the proline-rich domain known as the P-I region is also required for PLC-γ1 activation (23Houtman J.C.

Whereas deletion of the P-I region abrogates PLC-γ1 activation, a smaller deletion within this region, denoted ΔP-Ib++, does not impair PLC-γ1 activation (33Gonen R. Beach D. Ainey C. Yablonski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8364-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Both deletions equally impair the binding of SLP-76 to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 (33Gonen R. Beach D. Ainey C. Yablonski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8364-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and to date, the biochemical basis for the strikingly different functional consequences of these two similar deletions has not been established. Among the proteins that bind to SLP-76, Vav and ITK appear to be involved, directly or indirectly, in the activation of PLC-γ1. Mice lacking either Vav or ITK exhibit reduced TCR-induced phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 (34Reynolds L. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Exp.

Furthermore, both Vav and Rlk (a kinase related to ITK) can synergize with SLP-76 to activate the NFAT transcription factor (36Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 37Schneider H. Guerette B. Guntermann C. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3835-3840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is currently not clear whether Vav and ITK act independently or as part of an SLP-76-nucleated complex. Their observed co-immunoprecipitation with SLP-76 is consistent with the second possibility; however, both proteins bind SLP-76 with very low stoichiometry. Indeed, some studies have suggested that SLP-76 may function independently of its binding to Vav (38Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16206-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the presence of SLP-76 in the LAT-nucleated, GEM-localized signaling complex, we wondered whether SLP-76 might contribute to the TCR-induced GEM localization of PLC-γ1 and what the significance of this contribution might be. Here, we show that SLP-76 is required for efficient GEM recruitment of PLC-γ1. Nonetheless, GEM recruitment is insufficient to activate PLC-γ1 in the absence of a second SLP-76-mediated function required for PLC-γ1 phosphorylation at Tyr783. Consistent with the second function, we detected an SLP-76-associated kinase activity (identified as ITK) that efficiently phosphorylated a recombinant PLC-γ1 fragment at Tyr783. This activity also appeared to be insufficient for full activation of PLC-γ1, and we present evidence suggesting that the full activity of SLP-76 depends on its assuming a conformation capable of associating with Vav.

All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Stable transfectants were maintained in the same medium but with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mg/ml G418, which was washed out 2–7 days prior to the use of cells for experiments.

Briefly, 100 × 106 cells were washed, preheated to 37 °C for 10 min, and stimulated for 1 min with anti-TCR antibody C305 or mock-stimulated in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 2× MES-buffered saline (MBS) with Brij-58 and protease inhibitors to achieve a final concentration of 1× MBS (25 mm MES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 2 mm orthovanadate) supplemented with 1% Brij-58, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following 20 min on ice, lysates were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Teflon homogenizer and centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. One ml of supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube, mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose dissolved in 1× MBS, overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose in 1× MBS followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in 1× MBS, and centrifuged in an SW 55Ti rotor at 260,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Twelve 400-μl fractions were collected from top to bottom and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were stimulated for 1 min and lysed at a concentration of 108 cells/ml of lysis buffer essentially as described (33Gonen R. Beach D. Ainey C. Yablonski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8364-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, lysis buffer contained 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For in vitro kinase experiments, lysis buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 20 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were cleared by centrifugation at 137,000 × g for 11 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Anti-FLAG immune complexes (prepared from cleared lysates of 15 × 106 cells) were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 100 ng of recombinant GST-PLC-γ1SH2-SH2-SH3 fusion protein (28Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and preheated for 2 min at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 1 μm and terminated after 15 min by the addition of EDTA to 12.5 mm. Supernatants were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed by Western blotting with anti-PLC-γ1 phospho-Tyr783 antibody followed by detection with ECL. Scanning and Densitometry—ECL films were scanned under conditions of transillumination. In all cases in which a figure subsection contains multiple panels probed with the same antibody, all panels were scanned from the same exposure of the same Western blot and were subsequently cropped into separate sections for clarity. Exposures used for densitometry were chosen such that there was no saturation of the bands to be quantified. LAT-mediated Recruitment of PLC-γ1 to the GEMs—Upon TCR stimulation, there is a measurable increase in the amount of PLC-γ1 found in a detergent-resistant buoyant membrane fraction known as the GEMs (16Zhang W.

GEM recruitment of PLC-γ1 peaked at ∼1 min following TCR stimulation (data not shown), approximately coinciding with peak tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT. These kinetics suggested that GEM recruitment of PLC-γ1 may reflect its SH2 domain-mediated binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (19Zhu M. Janssen E. Zhang W. J.

Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), present at high levels in Jurkat-derived cell lines due to their lack of expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase PTEN (47Shan X.

It was therefore not apparent which mechanism is primarily responsible for the TCR-induced GEM recruitment of PLC-γ1. To test the involvement of LAT, we isolated GEM fractions from LAT-deficient or LAT-reconstituted J.CaM2 cells prior to or following TCR stimulation. TCR-induced recruitment of PLC-γ1 to the GEMs was abrogated in the LAT-deficient cell line, but restored in LAT-reconstituted cells (Fig. 1A). To test whether PTEN deficiency is a contributing factor in PLC-γ1 GEM recruitment, we utilized a Jurkat-derived cell line stably transfected with wild-type PTEN under the control of a tetracycline-inducible p"

The catalytic efficiency of the photosynthetic CO2-fixing enzyme d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) has a central role in determining how efficiently plants use their resources of water, fertilizer nutrient, and light (1Andrews T.J.

As the primary port of entry of inorganic carbon into the biosphere, it is surprising that plant Rubisco is not very efficient, particularly at limiting CO2 concentrations where the rate of catalytic turnover is less than one-thousandth that of many other plant enzymes (4Morell M.K. Paul K. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. Aust. J. Bot. 1992; 40: 431-441Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The tendency of Rubiscos to confuse CO2 with the more abundant atmospheric gas, O2, encumbers photosynthesis in higher plants with both a requirement to invest large amounts of protein in Rubisco and also a requirement for an energy-intensive photorespiratory metabolism to recycle the oxygenated waste product. However, higher plant Rubisco is not the pinnacle of evolution as more efficient and specific forms are found in nature, particularly in a number of red algae (5Whitney S.M. Baldett P. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant J. 2001; 26: 535-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The benefits of replacing the Rubisco in C3 crops with these natural variants have been modeled and show substantial improvements that come at no additional energy or resource cost (1Andrews T.J.

The L subunit contains the catalytic site and the S subunits, whose precise role in the structure and function of Rubisco remains poorly understood and which are essential for catalytic viability (7Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 8Parry M.A. Andralojc P.J. Mitchell R.A. Madgwick P.J. Keys A.J. J. Exp.

Indeed, when stripped of S or assembled with foreign S, the catalytic properties of Rubiscos are substantially impaired. Genetically engineering Rubisco in plastids, therefore, needs to attend to both L and S. For the Rubisco L subunit gene (rbcL) located in the plastid genome (plastome), genetic manipulation by plastome transformation in tobacco is a routine but protracted process requiring typically 4–12 months to obtain mature homoplasmic transformants (15Whitney S.M.

In contrast, an appropriate means for engineering the native (or foreign) S subunit genes (RbcS) in higher plants has remained an elusive challenge due to the multiple RbcS copies in higher plant nuclei that essentially precludes them from targeted mutagenic or replacement strategies. Moreover, attempts to incorporate recombinant S into higher plants by transplastomic methods have highlighted how circumventing the assembly of cytosolic-synthesized S with plastid synthesized L into L8S8 complexes is almost immutable unless the endogenous levels of S have been substantially reduced by antisense (17Whitney S.M. Andrews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14738-14743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Dhingra A. Portis A.R. Daniell H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1302-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Resilient expression of the native S is also problematic when transplanting in foreign L subunits, as highlighted by the transplastomic replacement of the tobacco rbcL with sunflower rbcL that produced tobacco-sunflower transformants whose hybrid sunflower L8-tobacco S8 enzyme was kinetically impaired and unable to support autotrophic growth in air (18Kanevski I. Maliga P. Rhoades D.F. Gutteridge S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here a novel strategy for simultaneously engineering Rubisco S and L subunits was examined using the Synechococcus sp. PCC6301 enzyme that, unlike higher plant Rubiscos, is coded by a single rbcL-rbcS operon and can be functionally expressed in Escherichia coli (12Roy H. Andrews T.J. Leegood R.C.

Using different peptide linkers, the PCC6301 L and S were tethered together to produce an array of SL and LS fusion peptides. Presented here are results that show the subunit fusions can correctly fold and assemble into functional Rubisco oligomers in E. coli and that unlinked S is excluded from assembly. Moreover the kinetic properties of the Rubisco oligomers were evaluated and found that the catalytic prowess of most fusion-Rubiscos closely mimicked the wild-type PCC6301 L8S8 enzyme. Materials—Unlabeled and carboxyl-14C-labeled carboxypentitol-P2 was synthesized as described (26Pierce, J., Tolbert, N. E., and Barker, R. (1980) 19, 934-942Google Scholar). Ribulose-P2 was synthesized and purified as described (27Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All cloned DNA sequences were fully sequenced using BigDye terminator sequencing (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3730 sequencer (Biomolecular Resource Facility, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University) following the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). Amplification of Linker Genes—A gene coding for the linker-60 peptide was assembled by splice overlap extension using successive PCR reactions with Herculase Enhanced DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The initial PCR reaction contained 2 μm concentrations each of primers Linker1, Linker2, Linker3, and Linker4 that overlapped with adjacent primers by 20–23 nucleotides (supplemental Fig. 1). The PCR products were diluted 100-fold in a subsequent PCR reaction that amplified the 193-bp full-length linker-60 gene using primers 5′EcoRVlinker and 3′Nde60mer (Fig. 2A). A 208-bp gene coding for a tetrahistidine tagged linker-60 peptide (60H4) was assembled using primer Linker2His-4 instead of Linker2 in the initial PCR reaction (supplemental Fig. 1). Both linker-60 genes were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to give plasmids plinker60TVE and plinker60H4TVE. Genes coding for shorter linker peptides of 20 and 40 amino acids were amplified from plinker60TVE using the primer pairs 5′EcoRVlinker/3′Nde20mer and 5′EcoRVfusion/3′Nde40mer and cloned into pGEM-T Easy to give plasmids plinker20TVE and plinker40TVE.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12213-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using primers 5′NdeCrbcL (5′-CATATGCCCAAGACGCAATCTGCCGCAG-3′, the NdeI site is underlined, and the rbcL initiator codon is in bold) and 3′SacISynS (5′-TGAGCTCTTAGTATCGGCCGGGACGATGAACGAT-3′, the SacI site is underlined, and the complement of rbcS terminator codon is in bold) and the 1851-bp NdeI-SacI product was cloned into pET30Xa/LIC (pET30, Novagen) to give plasmid pETCLS (Fig. 2B). Cloning PCC6301 S-linker-L (CSLL) Rubisco Fusion Genes— The Synechococcus PCC6301 rbcL and rbcS genes were amplified separately from pSH1 using the primer pairs 5′NdeCrbcL/3′SynrbcL (5′-TTAGAGCTTGTCCATCGTTTCAAATTCGAA-3′, the complement of rbcL terminator codon is in bold) and 5′NcoSynS (5′-CCATGGGCATGAAAACTCTGCCCAAAGAG-3′, the NcoI site is underlined, and rbcS initiator codon is in bold)/3′EcoRVSynS (5′-TGATATCGGCCGGGACGATGAACGATG-3′, the EcoRV site is underlined), respectively. The 1422- and 337-bp DNA fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy to give plasmids pCLTVE(NdeI) and pCSTVE(NcoI), respectively. The rbcL gene was excised from pCLTVE(NdeI) with NdeI and NotI, and the 1438-bp fragment was cloned into pET30 to give pETCL. The rbcS gene from pCSTVE(NcoI) was cloned in-frame with different length linker peptides by cloning the 332-bp NcoI-EcoRV fragment into plasmids plinker20TVE, plinker40TVE, plinker60TVE, and plinker60H4TVE to give plasmids pCS20TVE, pCS40TVE, pCS60TVE, and pCS60H4TVE, respectively. The 513-bp NcoI-NdeI rbcS60 gene from pCS60TVE was cloned into pET28a+ (Novagen) to give pETCS60, and then the 552-bp XbaI-NdeI fragment was cloned into pETCL, giving plasmid pETCS60L (Fig. 2B). The 393-bp and 453-bp NcoI-NdeI fragments from pCS20TVE and pCS40TVE were cloned into pETCS60L to give plasmids pETCS20L and pETCS40L, respectively (Fig. 2B). Plasmid pETCS60LS that contains a fused and a non-fused copy of rbcS was assembled by replacing the 1078-bp SphI fragment in pETCLS with the 1589-bp fragment from pETCS60L. The 513-bp NcoI-NdeI rbcS60 fragment was then replaced with the 528-bp NcoI-NdeI rbcS60H4 fragment from pCS60H4TVE to give plasmid pETCS60H4LS (Fig. 2B). Sequence coding for a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned 3′ to rbcL by amplifying the gene with primers 5′NdeCrbcL and 3′XhoSynL (5′-CTCGAGCTTGTCCATCGTTGCAAATTCGAAC-3′, the XhoI site is underlined) and cloning the 1237-bp KpnI-XhoI fragment into pETCS40L to give pETCS40LH6 (Fig. 2B). Cloning the PCC6301 CL40S Rubisco Gene—The rbcL gene from pSH1 was amplified using primers Nae5′SynL (5′-GCCGGCGTGAAGGACTACAAAC-3′, the NaeI site is underlined) and 3′EcoRVSynL (5′-GATATCCCTTGTCCATCGTTTCGAATTCGAACTTG-3′, the EcoRV site is underlined). The 1386-bp DNA product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to give plasmid pCLEVTVE into which the 121-bp EcoRV-NdeI linker-40 gene from plinker40TVE was cloned to give plasmid pCL40TVE. The rbcS gene was amplified from pSH1 using primers 5′NdeSynS (5′-TCATATGAGCATGAAAACTCTGCCCAAAGA-3′, the NdeI site is underlined, and the rbcS initiator codon is in bold) and Syn3SacI, and the 347-bp product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to give plasmid pCSTVE(NS). The 344-bp NdeI-SacI rbcS fragment was then cloned in-frame 3′ to the fused rbcL40 gene in pCL40TVE to give plasmid pCL40S from which the 1757-bp KpnI-SacI fragment was used to replace the corresponding 1665-bp fragment in pETCLS to give pETCL40S (Fig. 2B). Cloning the Tobacco Rubisco TSLL Fusions—Sequence coding 83 nucleotides of the tobacco ribosomal RNA (Prrn) promoter, 63 nucleotides of the T7g10 5′-untranslated region, and a codon modified rbcS gene (cmrbcS) was assembled by splice overlap extension using overlapping primers by successive PCR reactions as described above (supplemental Fig. 1). The translated product from cmrbcS matched that coded by a native Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) Rubisco RbcS (11Whitney S.M. Andrews T.J. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The initial PCR reaction used primers ModSun1, ModSun2, ModTob3, ModTob4r, ModTob5, ModTob6r, ModTob7, and ModTob8rH6 that overlapped by 15 nucleotides with adjoining primers (supplemental Fig. 1). The second PCR reaction amplified a 523-bp Prrn-T7g10 5′-untranslated region-cmrbcS sequence using primers 5′HindPrrn and 3′EcoRVmNtS and was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to give plasmid pPcmSTVE. To clone the linker-40 and -60 genes in-frame to the 3′ end of cmrbcS, the gene was amplified from pPcmSTVE using primers 5′NcoImNtS and 3′EcoRVmNtS, and the 368-bp NcoI-EcoRV cmrbcS gene cloned into plinker40TVE and plinker60TVE to give pTS40 and pTS60, respectively. The 489-bp cmrbcS40 and 549-bp cmrbcS60 NcoI-NdeI fragments were then cloned into pET28a(+) to give plasmids pETTS40 and pETTS60. A tobacco rbcL was cloned in-frame to the 3′ end of the cmrbcS-linker genes by amplifying a copy of rbcL from pLEV3 (15Whitney S.M. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using primers 5′NdeNtL (5′-TCATATGTCACCACAAACAGAGACTAA-3′, the NdeI site is underlined, and the rbcL initiator codon is in bold) and Trb-cLHind (5′-CAAGCTTTTACTTATCCAAAACGTCCAC-3′, the HindIII site is underlined, and the complement of rbcL terminator codon is in bold) and cloning the 1436-bp NdeI-Hin-dIII rbcL fragment into pETTS40 and pETTS60 to give plasmids pETTS40L and pETTS60L, respectively (Fig. 2B). Growth and Expression of Rubisco in E. coli—The Rubisco genes were cloned downstream of the T7 promoter in pET28a(+) and pET30 and transformed into BL21(DE2) cells (Promega). Rubisco expression was auto-induced by growing the cells at 22 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 30 μg·ml-1 kanamycin supplemented with additional carbon sources (0.5% (v/v) glycerol, 2.8 mm glucose, 5.6 mm α-lactose), nutrients (1 mm MgSO4, 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 40 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm Na2HPO4) and trace metals (50 μm FeCl3, 20 μm CaCl2, 2 μm Na2SeO3, 2 μm H3BO3, 10 μm MnCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 2 μm CoCl2, 2 μm CuCl2, 2 μm NiCl2, 2 μm Na2NoO4) (29Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). The cultures (100 ml) were shaken at 200 oscillations per minute for 120 h with final cell densities measured by absorbance at 600 nm between 6.6 and 9.2. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Protein Extraction—E. coli cells pellets were suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (100 mm EPPS-NaOH. pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.043% (w/v) protease inhibitor mixture for bacterial cells (Sigma)) and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell (140 megapascals). An aliquot of lysate sample was mixed with an equal volume of SDS buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and the remainder was centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were either assayed for protein content using the dye binding Pierce Coomassie Plus kit, treated with a equal volume of SDS buffer (soluble protein sample for SDS-PAGE analysis), and diluted 2-fold with Native PAGE buffer (30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) or incubated with 25 mm NaHCO3 at 25 °C for 30 min before measuring Rubisco content ([2-14C]carboxyarabinitol-P2 binding, see below) and carboxylase activity under substrate ribulose-P2-limiting and -saturating conditions (see below). PAGE and Immunoblot Analyses—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing PAGE using 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris and 4–12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), respectively. The Bis-Tris gels were buffered with MES and electrophoresed at 200 V according to the supplier's instructions. Tris-glycine gels were run at 4 °C in 60 mm Tris, 191 mm glycine buffer at 60 volts for 18 h. Protein bands were visualized using Gelcode Blue reagent (Pierce) or blotted onto nitrocellulose (Hybond C, APBiotech) using an Xcell transfer cell (Novex) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (5Whitney S.M. Baldett P. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant J. 2001; 26: 535-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits to pure spinach Rubisco, tobacco Rubisco, or Synechococcus PCC6301 Rubisco. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using AttoPhos reagent (Promega) with a Vistra FluorImager. Rubisco Purification—Rubiscos without histidine tags were purified from E. coli cells by size exclusion chromatography or by ultracentrifugation through sucrose density gradients. Cells that had been stored at -70 °C were suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer, lysed by a French press, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was chromatographed through a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm EPPS-NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8) using an ÁKTA explorer system (APBiotech). Alternatively, a saturated ammonium sulfate solution (pH 7) was slowly added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20% (w/v) on ice, and the extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 2 °C. The supernatant was collected, and Rubisco was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 50% (w/v) and pelleted by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in a 0.7-ml gradient buffer (25 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 31,000 rpm for 26 h at 4 °C through an exponential density gradient (mixing volume, 12.15 ml; gradient volume, 15 ml) of 7–28.8% (w/v) sucrose in gradient buffer using an SW31Ti rotor (Beckman). Fractions collected from the Superdex 200 chromatography (0.3 ml) and the sucrose gradients (1 ml) were assayed for substrate-saturated RuBP carboxylase activity (see below) and an aliquot mixed with an equal volume of SDS or Native PAGE buffer for PAGE analysis. The three fractions with the highest Rubisco activities for each sucrose gradient were pooled and dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C against 2 liters of gradient buffer and then for 90 min against 0.5 liters of gradient buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The dialyzed samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Rubiscos with histidine tags were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). E. coli cells were suspended in ice-cold affinity extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.043% (w/v) bacterial protease inhibitor mixture), lysed by a French press, and centrifuged (as above). The soluble protein was chromatographed through Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and washed with 20 bed volumes of affinity extraction buffer. Bound protein was eluted in 1.5–2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole) and immediately dialyzed with successive changes of gradient buffer and stored as described above. Kinetic Measurements—The Michaelis constant for ribulose-P2 (KmRuBP) and catalytic turnover rate (Vmaxc) were measured in cell free soluble E. coli protein extracts. After lysis and centrifugation (see above), the E. coli-soluble protein extract was preincubated with 25 mm NaHCO3 for 20 min at 25 °C to activate the Rubisco. Carboxylase activities were measured using NaH14CO3 assays (28Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12213-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Paul K. Morell M.K. Andrews T.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10019-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) containing different amounts of substrate ribulose-P2 (0–2 mm). Assays were buffered with 100 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8, containing 20 mm MgCl2 and were performed in duplicate with unbuffered ribulose-P2 added to initiate catalysis. Catalytic turnover rate was calculated by dividing the substrate-saturated carboxylase activity by the concentration of Rubisco active sites measured by the stoichiometric binding of the tight binding inhibitor [2-14C]carboxyarabinitol-P2 as described previously (17Whitney S.M. Andrews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14738-14743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Ruuska S. Andrews T.J. Badger M.R. Hudson G.S. Laisk A. Price G.D. von Caemmerer S. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 859-870Google Scholar). After preincubation with 25 mm NaHCO3, duplicate aliquots of extract were incubated for up to 30 min with 13–39 μm [2-14C]carboxypentitol-P2 (an isomeric mixture of [2-14C]carboxyarabinitol-P2 and [2-14C]carboxyribitol-P2) at 25 °C, and the amount of Rubisco-bound [14C]carboxyarabinitol-P2 was recovered by gel filtration (17Whitney S.M. Andrews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14738-14743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Purified Rubisco preparations were used to measure the Michaelis constants for CO2 (Km(CO)2) and the CO2/O2 specificity (Sc/o at pH 8.3 (32Kane H.J. Viil J. Entsch B. Paul K. Morell M.K. Andrews T.J. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 21: 449-461Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). Km(CO)2 was measured by 14CO2 fixation at 25 °C, pH 8, according to Andrews (28Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12213-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in nitrogen-sparged septum-capped scintillation vials. The assays were initiated by adding purified enzyme (that had been preincubated for 20 min in buffer containing 20 mm MgCl2 and 25 mm NaHCO3) into N2-equilibrated assay buffer (100 mm EPPS-NaOH, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm ribulose-P2, 0.1 mg·ml-1 carbonic anhydrase) containing varying concentrations of NaH14CO3. The assays were stopped after 2 min with 0.5 volumes of 25% (v/v) formic acid and dried at 80 °C, and then the residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of water before adding 2 volumes of scintillant (UltimaGold, Packard Bioscience) for scintillation counting. Engineering Linker Peptides of Different Lengths—Genes coding for linker peptides of different lengths for fusing the large (L) and small (S) subunits of Rubisco from Synechococcus PCC6301 (cyanobacteria) and N. tabacum (tobacco) were synthesized by splice overlap extension using PCR (supplemental Fig. 1). The linker sequences were designed based on flexible Ser-Gly-Gly motif repeats with a basic amino acid every 10th residue that had been previously used to assemble E. coli chaperonin complexes from GroES-GroEL fusions (33Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Chaudhuri T.K. Clare D.K. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3220-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Examination of available x-ray structures for different L8S8 Rubisco hexadecamers indicated considerable variability in the spatial separation between the N and C termini of the adjoining L and S subunits (Fig. 1). Because there were numerous permutations for linking the termini of a subunit to its cognate partners, four different sized linkers were tested that comprised 20, 40, 60, and 65 (60H4) amino acids corresponding to flexible peptides of ∼ 65, 130, 185, and 200 Å. Restriction sites at the 3′ (EcoRV) and 5′ (NdeI) ends were incorporated into the coding sequence of each linker gene to facilitate the in-frame cloning of L and S genes (Fig. 2A). An internal His4 tag comprising the sequence His-Ser-His-His-His-His was engineered into the 60H4 fusion peptide to facilitate purification by affinity chroma"
https://openalex.org/W2048997725,"The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins inhibit cytokine action by direct interaction with Janus kinases or activated cytokine receptors. In addition to the N-terminal and Src homology 2 domains that mediate these interactions, SOCS proteins contain a C-terminal SOCS box. DNA data base searches have identified a number of other protein families that possess a SOCS box, of which the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (Asb) proteins constitute the largest. Although it is known that the SOCS proteins are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling, the biological and biochemical functions of the Asbs are largely undefined. Using a proteomics approach, we demonstrate that creatine kinase B (CKB) interacts with Asb-9 in a specific, SOCS box-independent manner. This interaction increases the polyubiquitylation of CKB and decreases total CKB levels within the cell. The targeting of CKB for degradation by Asb-9 was primarily SOCS box-dependent and suggests that Asb-9 acts as a specific ubiquitin ligase regulating levels of this evolutionarily conserved enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2052732755,"Vertebrate genomes harbor two Atrophin genes, Atrophin-1 (Atn1) and Atrophin-2 (Atn2). The Atn1 locus produces a single polypeptide, whereas two different protein products are expressed from the Atn2 (also known as Rere) locus. A long, or full-length, form contains an amino-terminal MTA-2-homologous domain followed by an Atrophin-1-related domain. A short form, expressed via an internal promoter, consists solely of the Atrophin domain. Atrophin-1 can be co-immunoprecipitated along with Atrophin-2, suggesting that the Atrophins ordinarily function together. Mutations that disrupt the expression of the long form of Atrophin-2 disrupt early embryonic development. To determine the requirement for Atrophin-1 during development we generated a null allele. Somewhat surprisingly we found that Atrophin-1 function is dispensable. To gain a better understanding of the requirement for Atrophin function during development, an analysis of the functional domains of the three different gene products was carried out. Taken together, these data suggest that Atrophins function as bifunctional transcriptional regulators. The long form of Atrophin-2 has a transcriptional repression activity that is not found in the other Atrophin polypeptides and that is required for normal embryogenesis. Atrophin-1 and the short form of Atrophin-2, on the other hand, can act as potent and evolutionarily conserved transcriptional activators.

Atrophin-1 and the short form of Atrophin-2, on the other hand, can act as potent and evolutionarily conserved transcriptional activators. The mouse and human genomes contain two Atrophin genes, the normal functions of which are not clear. Gain-of-function polyglutamine extension mutations in the Atrophin-1 gene (Atn1) cause dentato-rubro-pallidioluysial atrophy, a dominant neurodegenerative disease (1.Nagafuchi S. Yanagisawa H. Sato K. Shirayama T. Ohsaki E. Bundo M. Takeda T. Tadokoro K. Kondo I. Murayama N. et al.Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The Atrophin-2 (Atn2) locus, also known as Arg-Glu repeat-encoding (Rere), was first described as encoding an Atrophin-1-related protein that could heterodimerize with Atn1 in vitro (2.Waerner T. Gardellin P. Pfizenmaier K. Weith A. Kraut N. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Yanagisawa H. Bundo M. Miyashita T. Okamura-Oho Y. Tadokoro K. Tokunaga K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Atn2 locus is more complex than the Atn1 locus, encoding two polypeptides from a larger palette of domains. In addition to the Atrophin domain, the Atn2 locus encodes the BAH, ELM2, SANT, and GATA domains, which are arranged in a configuration similar to that found in MTA-2, a protein that scaffolds the formation of a repressive chromatin remodeling complex, NuRD (4.Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Atn2 and Atn1 gene products can be co-immunoprecipitated from embryo extracts, indicating that Atrophins probably carry out at least some of their cellular functions by acting together in a molecular complex (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The single Atrophin gene products that are produced by the Drosophila melanogaster (Atro or grunge) and Caenorhabditis elegans (EGL-27) genomes have domain structures that are reminiscent of the long form of the vertebrate Atrophin-2 (6.Herman M.A. Ch'ng Q. Hettenbach S.M. Ratliff T.M. Kenyon C. Herman R.K. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that this may be the ancestral function with Atn1 and the short form of Atn2 being a more recent evolutionary specialization. Genetic analysis of Atro in Drosophila indicates that it functions as a transcriptional co-repressor during development with important roles in segmentation and planar polarity (8.Wang L. Rajan H. Pitman J.L. McKeown M. Tsai C.C. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a polyglutamine-expanded version of Atn1 in flies indicates that it too can function as a transcriptional repressor in this context (7.Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with the general idea that Atrophins have an evolutionarily conserved function as transcriptional co-repressors. This is an attractive conclusion, but it cannot be used to explain why evolution has elaborated distinct gene products from an apparently single ancestral form. This evolutionary innovation appears to have been an early and functionally important one, because the teleost, avian, and mammalian lineages all carry two types of Atrophin genes. We have begun to explore the question of distinct functions of the two types of Atrophin gene products using a combination of genetic and biochemical analysis. We previously reported the phenotype of a mutation in Atn2 that selectively disrupts the function of the Atrophin-2 long-form gene product (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Loss of Atr2L causes a diverse set of developmental defects, many of which are associated with a failure in the function of important signaling centers. For example, Shh is not expressed from the anterior notochord, Fgf8 expression in the anterior neural ridge is defective, and the Fgf8-expressing apical ectodermal ridge does not form properly in embryos unable to express Atr2L. Somitogenesis and heart development, processes that are not related in any obvious way to the signaling centers that are defective, also fail to proceed normally indicating that there are additional and diverse roles for Atr2L. To carry the analysis of Atrophin function further, we generated a null allele of Atn1 and carried out in vitro analyses of the Atrophin-2 and Atrophin-1 domains. These data support the idea that the Atrophin domain on its own has a distinct function that is supplied redundantly by the short form of Atrophin-2 (Atr2S) and Atrophin-1. Atrophin-1 Knock-out Mice−The targeting construct was produced by PCR amplification of fragments arms from ES 2The abbreviations used are: ES cell, embryonic stem cell; RERE, Arg-Glu repeat-encoding; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; POD, PML oncogenic domain; Atr2L, Atrophin-2 long form; Atr2S, Atrophin-2 short form; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HDAC, histone deacetylase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; E, embryonic day (e.g. E17). cell DNA. The fragments were assembled together with Lox sites made from synthetic oligonucleotides and a PGK-Neo cassette. The construct was sequence verified before being electroporated into the A14 ES cell lines, which were a kind gift from Dr. Bill Skarnes. Correct targeting events (fNEO allele) were identified using a PCR strategy and confirmed by Southern blotting. A correctly targeted ES cell line was electroporated with a Cre expression plasmid, and Cre-mediated deletion events that produced the Atn1Δ allele were identified using PCR. Both Atn1-fNEO and the Atn1Δ ES cell lines were used to generate chimeras and germ-line transmission. mRNA Expression−Radioactively labeled probes were synthesized from cDNA template using a Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized and stripped according to manufacturer’s guidelines. For detection of Atrophin-2 transcript isoforms, two Atrophin-2 cDNA fragments (residues 1-1242 and 3162-4680) were used as template for 5′ and 3′ probe synthesis, respectively. To detect Atrophin-1, full-length cDNA was used as template. Human α-actin probe was synthesized from template supplied by Clontech. Constructs−Full-length Atrophin-1 and Atrophin-2 cDNAs were described in Zoltewicz et al. (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Truncated versions of Atrophin-2 were constructed from the full-length clones by restriction fragment ligation or PCR amplification from the cloned cDNA using Expanded High Fidelity PCR (Roche Applied Science). All constructs were sequence verified. For transcription activity assays, full-length or fragments of Atrophin cDNA were cloned into pFA-CMV vector (Stratagene) using appropriate restriction enzyme sites to produce the amino-terminal Gal4 fusion protein. Constructs E through O of Fig. 3 encode the following Atrophin-2 amino acid residues: E, 1-616; F, 1-343; G, 344-570; H, 481-1559; I, 571-1140; J, 1055-1559; K, 1011-1360; L, 1011-1360 without “RE” repeat domain; M, 1148-1360; N, 1323-1559; O, 1055-1148. For protein localization studies, full-length or fragments of Atrophin-2 were cloned into pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) to generate carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion proteins. These truncated Atrophin-2-GFP constructs encode the following Atrophin-2 amino acid residues: 1, 1-1559; 2, 571-1559; 3, 1-1219; 4, 571-1140; 5, 571-1409. For Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, amino-terminal-(1-616) and carboxyl-terminal-(481-1559) Atrophin-2 fragments were constructed on pFLAG7 vector (Sigma) to produce amino-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins. Cell Culture, Reporter Assay, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy−COS7, HeLa, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For transcription assay, HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates overnight; when they reached 80∼90% confluence, the cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of pFA-CMV constructs, 500 ng of hRL reporter vector and 50 ng of GL3 internal control plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested and lysed 24 h later. Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Lucy2 luminometer (Anthos Labtec Instruments). COS7 and HeLa cells were cultured and transfected with GFP constructs on 2-well slides. Cells were fixed 24 h later and subjected to a standard immunostaining protocol using antibodies recognizing HDAC1 (Affinity BioReagents), PML, or P300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 fluorescence confocal microscope. Western and Co-Immunoprecipitation−E17 mouse embryos were dissected and genotyped. The hearts were taken for protein extraction and Western blot using Atrophin-2 antibody 286-1 (Zoltewicz et al. (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) and antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon). HEK293 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes overnight to 70-80% confluence and then transfected with either FLAG7 empty vector or amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncated Atrophin-2-FLAG7 constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and lysed with M-PER (Pierce) reagent supplemented with benzonase nuclease (Novagen) and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Soluble extracts, together with either mouse IgG or M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma), were incubated with protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and then bound protein was eluted using lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer (Invitrogen) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Elutions were resolved on 3-8% Tris-acetate gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were probed with anti-FLAG rabbit antibody (Sigma), anti-HDAC1 (ABR), anti-P300 and anti-CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, according to a standard Western protocol. A Null Allele of Atn1−To assess the requirement for Atn1 during development we generated an allele in which six of ten exons are Floxed (Flanked with Lox) sites (Fig. 1A). We then generated mice carrying a germ-line allele in which Cre-mediated recombination deleted the Floxed region, which includes the initiator codon and ∼90% of the coding region. Both PCR and Southern blot analysis were used to confirm the structure of the deletion (data not shown). Intercrosses between heterozygotes produced viable and fertile homozygotes at Mendelian ratios, indicating, somewhat surprisingly, that Atn1 is dispensable under ordinary circumstances. To confirm that the desired mutation had been produced, we also carried out Northern blot analysis using total brain RNA. The predicted truncated message was produced by the deleted allele (Fig. 1B). Given the existence of two Atn genes, a likely explanation is that the Atn2 gene provides a redundant source of Atrophin function. We sought additional information with which to evaluate possible redundancy between Atn1 and Atn2. Previous analysis had indicated widespread expression of Atn1 and Atn2 but had not distinguished between the expression of the two Atn2 gene products (2.Waerner T. Gardellin P. Pfizenmaier K. Weith A. Kraut N. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Yanagisawa H. Bundo M. Miyashita T. Okamura-Oho Y. Tadokoro K. Tokunaga K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To see whether the expression of the Atrophins overlapped during embryogenesis, we probed Northern blots with probes recognizing the Atr2L and Atr2S messages. All three of the gene products are expressed throughout postimplantation embryogenesis at varying levels (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The Atr2L message has fairly uniform expression through most of gestation but is up-regulated as embryos approach term, whereas the Atr2S message has two discrete peaks, early and late in embryogenesis. From this expression pattern, it seems plausible that one or both of the Atrophin-2 gene products could compensate for the loss of Atrophin-1. To determine whether up-regulation of Atn2 expression might contribute to the ability of Atn2 to compensate for loss of Atn1, we measured the protein level of Atn2 in both Atn1 knock-out and wild-type littermates. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of Atr2S protein is unaffected by loss of Atn1. Mutations that disrupt Atr2S expression were not available, but previously we had described two different alleles that block the expression of Atr2L (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To see whether the loss of Atr2L could uncover a requirement for Atrophin-1, we intercrossed the two mutations. Compound heterozygotes were obtained at Mendelian ratios and were viable and fertile. We were also able to obtain Atn1-/- ;Atr2L+/- mice that were viable and fertile without difficulty. Animals that are homozygous for Atr2L mutations are not viable past mid-gestation, which complicated our ability to assess a role for Atr2L in the background of an Atn1-null embryo. Thus, although this analysis had some limitations, it is consistent with the idea that either Atn1 is completely unnecessary or, alternatively, that Atr2S is capable of supplying a similar function that compensates for the loss of Atn1. A number of protein-protein interactions and functional domains have been described for Atrophin-1 and, to a lesser degree, Atrophin-2 (9.Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Ohmi K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10.Wood J.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Duan K. Zhang C. Wang J. Kim Y. Schilling G. Sacchi N. Liu J.M. Ross C.A. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To see whether we could identify functions that were shared between Atrophin-1 and Atr2S we carried out an in vitro analysis of their functional domains. Because Atr2L has unique functions that cannot be provided by Atrophin-1 or Atr2S, identification of its functional domains was carried out as well. Identification of a Conserved Domain for Transcriptional Activation−Prior studies have shown that the disease-causing, poly(Q)-extended version of human Atrophin-1 can function as a transcriptional co-repressor when expressed in Drosophila. The Drosophila Atrophin gene can also function as a co-repressor in this assay system, supporting the idea that this is an inherent property of Atrophins rather than a neomorphic function produced by the dominant poly(Q) mutation. The domain structure of the Drosophila gene product is most similar to that of Atr2L, however, not that of Atrophin-1; and Atrophins can heterodimerize, making it difficult to conclude that co-repression is the only or even the predominant function of Atrophin-1. To address this question more directly, we carried out a comparison of Atrophin-1 and Atrophin-2 functions in a transcriptional reporter assay. A dual luciferase reporter system in mammalian cells was used in which Atrophin-1, Atr2L, and Atr2S were independently fused with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and co-transfected with a luciferase reporter gene carrying five copies of Gal4 binding sites upstream of a basal promotor. Surprisingly, we found that unlike the human poly(Q)-extended Atrophin-1, the wild-type mouse Atrophin-1 has potent transcriptional activation ability, producing ∼14-fold activation (Fig. 3). Atr2S can also function as an effective transcriptional activator in this assay system, driving transcription ∼8-fold. When Atr2L was tested in this assay system, it exhibited only weak transcriptional activation, suggesting that the Atrophin-2 amino-terminal domain may have corepressor ability as implied by its MTA-2 homolog domain and physical association with HDAC1 (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To explore this further we made truncated versions of Atr2L and Atr2S. As shown in Fig. 3, this analysis showed that the MTA-2 homologous amino-terminal region has the ability to repress transcription. Although we did not examine this in detail, repression is most potent with constructs containing the full, Atr2L-specific domain (compare for example constructs E versus F and B versus H). Deletion analysis of Atr2S localized its ability to act as a transcriptional activator to the 94-amino acid stretch between amino acids 1055 and 1148 (Fig. 3). Truncated proteins in which this domain is removed are unable to activate transcription, whereas those constructs containing this domain, even in the absence of other Atrophin-2 sequences, efficiently activate transcription, demonstrating that it is both necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional activation ability of Atn2. This domain is highly conserved between Atrophin-1 and -2 with 71% identity and 78% similarity. The amino acid sequence is rich in serine and proline residues, as has been seen in other transcriptional activation domains. The activation domain that we identified is adjacent to a stretch of repeating arginine and glutamic acid residues (RERE motif). Previous studies pointed toward the involvement of this motif in the interaction of Atrophins with each other. To examine the effect of this motif on transcriptional activation abilities, we deleted these RERE motifs using site-directed mutagenesis and found that they were not required for transcriptional activation (Fig. 3L). Atrophin-2 Is Localized to Subnuclear Domain−Atr2L has three consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, two in the MTA-2 homolog domain and one in the Atrophin homolog domain. Atr2S has one NLS sequence at its aminoterminal tip. A Previous report indicated that Atrophin-2 is localized to a subnuclear domain, the PML oncogenic domain (POD), although at the time of that study only the Atr2L isoform was known (2.Waerner T. Gardellin P. Pfizenmaier K. Weith A. Kraut N. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between the functional domains of Atrophin-2 and its localization, we fused GFP at the carboxyl termini of Atr2L and Atr2S and examined its localization in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 4, both Atr2L and Atr2S are nuclear proteins with a punctate distribution. The cellular localization patterns of the two isoforms are indistinguishable, suggesting that the sequences determining this subnuclear localization only require sequences within Atr2S. This would also imply that the NLS in the Atr2L amino-terminal domain is redundant or inactive. To further pursue the identity of the signal domain, we made a series of constructs with amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncations of Atr2S and Atr2L. Amino-terminal deletions that removed all three NLSs failed to localize to the nucleus (data not shown). Carboxyl-terminal deletions, on the other hand, revealed a domain required for subnuclear localization. Removal of the 150 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of either Atr2S or Atr2L produced a protein with nuclear localization but without the punctate, subnuclear localization characteristic of Atr2S and Atr2L. This indicates that the 150-amino acid carboxyl-terminal motif contains a novel localization signal. A previous report indicated that Atr2L co-localizes with the PML protein in a subnuclear domain. As shown in Fig. 5B, the punctuate nuclear distribution of Atr2L co-localized with PML. This suggests that the 150-amino acid motif at the carboxyl-terminal tip of Atr2S and Atr2L is a required element for the POD-directing signal.FIGURE 5Atrophin-2 co-localizes with HDAC1 and P300 in PODs. A, FLAG-tagged fragments of Atrophin-2 were expressed in HEK293 cells. The top panel shows Western blot detection of FLAG-tagged proteins in extracts (E), control antibody (IgG), or anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (IP). Association of endogenous HDAC1 with the amino-terminal transcriptional repressor region was detected by Western blotting. The association of the histone acetylase P300 with the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activator region of Atrophin-2 was also detectable. CBP, a related histone acetylase, is not associated with either region. HEK293 cells were transfected with either empty vector (first three lanes) or FLAG-tagged fusion constructs. B, the association of Atrophin-2 with HDAC1 and P300 can be seen in vivo where both of these proteins co-localize with Atrophin-2 and the PML protein. Cells were transfected with an Atrophin-2-GFP construct, and GFP was visualized directly. To detect co-localization with endogenous protein, the cells were stained with PML, HDAC1, and P300 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transcriptional Activity Correlates with HDAC1 and P300 Association−The analysis of Atr2L functional domains suggests that Atr2L can either activate or repress transcription, presumably depending upon regulatory factors. Transcriptional activators can act through recruitment of histone acetyltransferases such as P300 or CBP. Repression, on the other hand, is often the result of histone deacetylase recruitment. The 10-30 PODs found in each nucleus are enriched in histone acetylase P300 and in histone deacetylase HDAC1 (12.Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This suggests that Atrophin-2 may affect transcription by assembling transcriptional regulatory complexes in PODs. To test this idea, we chose HDAC1, P300, and CBP as candidate interactors and carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify interacting proteins. As shown in Fig. 5A, when epitope-tagged Atn2 amino- or carboxyl-terminal fragments were immunoprecipitated with M2 antibody, HDAC1 was found to be associated with the amino-terminal fragment, consistent with the involvement of this domain in transcriptional repression. The carboxyl-terminal domain, on the other hand, is associated with P300. CBP was not detected in either of the immunoprecipitation experiments. To test whether this association affects the localization of the endogenous proteins, cells that transfected with the Atr2L-GFP construct were stained with HDAC1 or P300 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5B, HDAC1 was recruited into the Atrophin-2 subnuclear domain. In untransfected cells, HDAC1 was distributed equally throughout the nucleus. P300 had a more irregular nuclear distribution in untransfected cells; however, it also appears to have been recruited into the Atrophin-2 punctuate subnuclear domain. In Drosophila, where there is only one Atrophin gene, loss-of-function mutations produce segmentation effects, cellular polarity defects, and embryonic lethality. The Drosophila Atrophin gene (DAtro) can function as a transcriptional co-repressor by co-operating with the even-skipped and tailless transcription factors to regulate segmentation (7.Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8.Wang L. Rajan H. Pitman J.L. McKeown M. Tsai C.C. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During development of the fly eye, DAtro physically interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of a cell surface molecule, Fat, to regulate planar polarity (13.Fanto M. Clayton L. Meredith J. Hardiman K. Charroux B. Kerridge S. McNeill H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this context it is not clear whether it is also acting as a transcriptional co-repressor in the nucleus. During wing development, genetic studies support the idea that DAtro acts as repressor of genes downstream of the EGFR (14.Charroux B. Freeman M. Kerridge S. Baonza A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 278-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the absence of DAtro function, EGFR target genes are derepressed, effectively producing ectopic EGFR signaling. Mammals have two Atn genes encoding three different isoforms. In a previous report, we described an Atn2 mutation that selectively disrupted expression of one of the two isoforms, Atr2L, expressed from this locus (5.Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure of the Atr2L isoform is the one that is most similar to that of DAtro. Atr2L mutant mice are embryonic lethal, dying around E9.5 with defects in heart looping, telencephalon and somite development, and, loss of Shh and Fgf8 expression from anterior signaling centers. Zebrafish, like mammals, have two types of Atrophin genes, one Atn1 homologue and two Atn2 homologues. Although the protein isoforms expressed by the zebrafish Atn2 homologues have not been described, the genomic structure is consistent with one or both of the loci being capable of expressing both Atr2L-like and Atn2S-like isoforms. There is also evidence suggesting that the function of Atn2 may be more tightly conserved between fish and mammals, as a role for Atn2 in the regulation of Fgf8 signaling has been described that is consistent with that in mice (15.Asai Y. Chan D.K. Starr C.J. Kappler J.A. Kollmar R. Hudspeth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 13: 9069-9074Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function poly(Q) extension mutations in Atn1 cause neurodegenerative disease. The pathologic mechanism of poly(Q)-extended Atrophin-1 is still unknown, but reports showing that Atrophin-1 can directly interact with transcription repressor ETO8, or recruit and repress histone acetylase CBP (16.Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), have led to the suggestion that Atrophin-1 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor. We hypothesize that the essential functions of Atrophin are split unevenly between the two genes. Atn2 encodes two isoforms that seem to encompass all Atrophin function. The function of the Atr2L gene product is unique and essential, whereas that of Atrophin-1 is apparently redundant with that of Atr2S. The two gene products may both function as transcriptional regulators, involved in regulating central nervous system development and maintenance of normal neuronal function at different developmental stages and brain regions. The functions are either similar enough so that Atrophin-1 and Atr2S can compensate for each other's loss, or their functions are both nonessential. We did not observe any developmental phenotypes in Atn1 knock-out mice embryos nor obvious behavioral phenotypes in adults. This is consistent with the idea that Atr2S can compensate for loss of Atrophin-1 and provides additional evidence to support the hypothesis that poly(Q) extension mutations of Atn1 are gain-of-function rather than loss-of-function mutations. In cultured mammalian cells, Atrophin-1 and Atr2S both show a strong transcription activator activity, and we further mapped the activator region to a highly conserved 79-amino acid motif within the Atrophin homology domain. Atr2L contains both an Atrophin homology domain and an amino-terminal MTA domain. Our analysis of the transcriptional regulatory activity of Atrophin-2 domains revealed potent transcriptional activator ability in its carboxyl-terminal domain and transcriptional repressor activity in its amino-terminal region. Consistent with this, the amino-terminal domain is associated with HDAC1, and the carboxyl-terminal domain, also found in Atrophin-1, is associated with histone acetylase P300. These data suggest that DAtro and mammalian Atrophin-2 are bidirectional transcriptional regulators. Their structure and function are highly conserved from Drosophila to vertebrate, with a similar domain structure and with both regulating early developmental process in the central nervous system as well and other tissues. Atrophin-1 and Atr2S are divergent gene products and have retained the ability to function as transcriptional activators, but they have lost the ability to recruit HDAC1. Evolutionary pressures have created two copies of this subset of Atrophin function, providing evidence for its importance; however in the absence of a mutant in which both Atr2S and Atrophin-1 function are absent, elucidation of their functions remains conjectural. The implications of our data for the pathogenesis of poly(Q) extension mutations in Atn1 are significant. It has been suggested that poly(Q)-extended Atrophin-1 behaves as a transcriptional co-repressor. Our studies suggest that Atr2L is a bidirectional transcription regulator, whereas Atrophin-1 and Atr2S function as co-activators. This simple interpretation is complicated, however, by the fact that Atr2L can associate with Atr2S or Atrophin-1, suggesting that activator versus repressor function is determined, at least in part, by the whether Atr2L is associated with Atr2S/Atrophin-1. This suggests that poly(Q) extension in Atrophin-1 may inhibit the ability of Atrophin-1 to associate with activator complex component and/or may enhance its association with Atr2L. This would shift the balance away from activation and toward repression. The alternative, that poly(Q) confers a novel ability to act as a repressor upon Atrophin-1, is also possible. Atrophin-2 localization to PODs is regulated by a targeting signal, a requisite part of which at least is at its carboxyl-terminal tip. PODs are a subnuclear domain involved in regulating apoptosis, proliferation, and other important events in cells. More than 30 proteins, such as p53, CBP, and Rb, have been found co-localized in PODs (12.Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, Atrophin-2 localizes to PODs and recruits HDAC1 and P300. This indicates that Atn2 may interact not only with HDAC1 and P300 but perhaps also with other proteins existing in PODs. Interestingly, poly(Q) extension mutants have been shown to accumulate in subnuclear domains reminiscent of PODs under pathogenic conditions (17.Takahashi J. Fujigasaki H. Iwabuchi K. Bruni A.C. Uchihara T. El Hachimi K.H. Stevanin G. Durr A. Lebre A.S. Trottier Y. de The H. Tanaka J. Hauw J.J. Duyckaerts C. Brice A. Neurobiol.

Neurol. 2001; 49: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that this localization may play a role in neurodegeneration. We found that localization to PODs is not required for the transcriptional regulatory ability of Atrophin-2 in our experimental context, although it remains possible that it is required in vivo. We are thankful to members of the Peterson laboratory for helpful discussions and criticism, to Dr. Scott May for providing reagents, and to Dr. Woody Hopf for help with microscopy."

It binds specifically to receptor site 4 on mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels and competes with scorpion β-toxins, such as Css IV from Centruroides suffusus suffusus. As a consequence, Magi 5 shifts the activation voltage of the mammalian rNav1.2a channel to more hyperpolarized voltages, whereas the insect channel, DmNav1, is not affected. To gain insight into toxin-channel interactions, Magi 5 and 23 analogues were synthesized.

The structure clearly resembles the inhibitor cystine knot structural motif, although the triple-stranded β-sheet typically found in that motif is partially distorted in Magi 5. The interactive surface of Magi 5 toward voltage-gated sodium channels resembles in some respects the Janus-faced atracotoxins, with functionally important charged residues on one face of the toxin and hydrophobic residues on the other. Magi 5 also resembles the scorpion β-toxin Css IV, which has distinct nonpolar and charged surfaces that are critical for channel binding and has a key Glu involved in voltage sensor trapping.

A variety of different isoforms of VGSC has been identified (1.Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), with ten mammalian (Nav1.1–Nav1.9 and Nax) and several invertebrate (e.g. Drosophila DmNav1, housefly Vssc1, cockroach ParaCSMA, and cockroach BgNav1-1) VGSCs cloned to date. The Nav1.1–Nav1.9 isoforms all have greater than 50% amino acid sequence identity in the transmembrane and extracellular domains. Most of these VGSCs have been expressed functionally in mammalian cell lines and/or an oocyte expression system and can be studied using electrophysiological techniques (2.Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A putative pharmacophore involved in the interaction of scorpion β-toxins with receptor site 4 on the VGSC was reported by Cohen et al. (16.Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Froy O. Corzo G. Angelovici R. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8206-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to consist of a functional discontinuous surface composed of a number of nonpolar and three charged amino acids clustered around the main α-helical motif and the C-tail. In 2005, Cohen et al. (17.Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Benveniste M. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported the successful recombinant expression of the classical scorpion β-toxin Css IV from Centruroides suffusus suffusus, fused to a His tag and a thrombin cleavage site. A functionally important surface was described, consisting of: 1) a cluster of residues associated with the α-helix, surrounding a putative hot spot (Glu28); 2) a hydrophobic cluster associated mainly with the β2 and β3 strands; 3) a single residue (Trp58) in the C-tail, and 4) a negatively charged residue (Glu15) involved in voltage sensor trapping. Recently, it was found that this receptor site 4 in mammals was also recognized by a spider toxin, Magi 5, from the hexathelid spider Macrothele gigas (Iriomote, Japan) that binds specifically to the receptor site 4 in mammals (12.Corzo G. Gilles N. Satake H. Villegas E. Dai L. Nakajima T. Haupt J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Magi 5 is also found in the venom of the hexathelid spider Macrothele raveni (Guangxi, China), where it was named raventoxin III (21.Zeng X.Z. Xiao Q.B. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 41: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Magi 5 is a 29-residue polypeptide stabilized by three disulfide bridges. It is lethal to mice upon intracranial injection and competes with the scorpion β-toxin Css IV with a Ki of 1.2 nm. Magi 5 and Css IV bind to the same receptor on the sodium channel from rat brain synaptosomes (12.Corzo G. Gilles N. Satake H. Villegas E. Dai L. Nakajima T. Haupt J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Magi 5 is less than half the size of the scorpion β-toxins that act at site 4, making it a valuable tool for defining structure-function relationships and toxin-channel interactions. We have therefore determined its structure by NMR and characterized its mode of action on rNav1.2a. Moreover, we have identified key elements of the VGSC binding surface of Magi 5 by performing an alanine scan of the toxin and assaying these mutants on rNav1.2a expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Peptide Synthesis−All of the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. The C-terminally carboxylated forms (identical to native) of Magi 5, and all of the Magi 5 mutants were chemically synthesized by a solid-phase method using the 0.1-mmol Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology on an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer. Cleavage and deprotection of peptide resins were performed using a chemical mixture composed of 1 g of crystalline phenol, 0.2 g of imidazole, 1 ml of thioanisol, 0.5 ml of 1,2-ethanedithiol in 20 ml of trifluoroacetic acid. The resin was removed by filtration, and the deprotected peptides in solution were precipitated using cold ethyl ether. The precipitated peptide was washed twice with cold ether to remove remaining scavengers and protecting groups. The crude linear synthetic peptides were dissolved in 20% aqueous acetonitrile, and purified by reversed phase HPLC on a semi-preparative C8 column (5C8MS, 10 × 250 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Japan) to 85–90% homogeneity, to eliminate synthetic byproducts and incorrectly assembled peptides. The six free cysteine residues were allowed to oxidize in air for 24 h at room temperature in 0.5 m aqueous ammonium acetate solution (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 mm oxidized glutathione. The folded synthetic toxins were purified on the same semi-preparative C8 reversed phase HPLC column using a 40-min linear gradient from 20 to 60% aqueous acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2 ml/min), followed by cation exchange chromatography as previously described for the native toxins (12.Corzo G. Gilles N. Satake H. Villegas E. Dai L. Nakajima T. Haupt J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The structural identity between synthetic and native Magi 5 was verified by capillary zone electrophoresis and cation exchange HPLC coelution experiments, circular dichroism, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see supplemental materials). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry−Peptides mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Aldrich) were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-PRO system in reflector mode. Mass spectra were calibrated with internal peptide standards (LaserBio Labs, France) and analyzed using Data Explorer software. Circular Dichroism−CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-725 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan). The spectra were measured from 260 to 190 nm in 60% trifluoroethanol (pH 7.1) at room temperature, with a 1-mm-pathlength cell. The data were collected at 0.1 nm with a scan rate of 100 nm/min and a time constant of 1 s. The concentration of the toxins determined by amino acid analysis was 30 μm. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination−Magi 5 was dissolved to a final concentration of ∼2.2 mm in 500 μl containing 5% 2H2O and 0.03% sodium azide. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 without buffer present; pH was measured at room temperature with no correction made for isotope effects. Two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY spectra with a spin lock time of 60 ms, DQF-COSY spectra, and NOESY spectra with mixing times of 70, 200, and 300 ms were recorded on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer at 5 and 25 °C. A 300-ms NOESY was also acquired at 15 °C, and a 300-ms NOESY was acquired at 5 °C on a Bruker Avance-800 spectrometer. The water resonance was suppressed using the WATERGATE pulse sequence (22.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklena´ř V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). Amide exchange rates were monitored by dissolving freeze-dried peptide in 2H2O at pH 3.6 and then recording a series of one-dimensional spectra at 5 °C, followed by 60-ms TOCSY spectra. Once the amides had exchanged completely, 300-ms NOESY and E-COSY spectra were acquired. Diffusion measurements were performed using a pulsed field gradient longitudinal eddy-current delay pulse sequence (23.Gibbs S.J. Johnson C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar, 24.Dingley A.J. Mackay J.P. Chapman B.E. Morris M.B. Kuchel P.W. Hambly B.D. King G.F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as implemented by Yao et al. (25.Yao S. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Version 3.5, Bruker Biospin) and analyzed using XEASY (26.Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) (Version 1.3.13). All of the spectra were collected at 5 °C unless otherwise indicated and referenced to an impurity peak at 0.15 ppm or the water resonance. Magi 5 contains three disulfide bond pairings that were included as restraints in all structure calculations after their correct connectivities were confirmed (see “Results”): Cys2-Cys16, Cys9-Cys21, and Cys15-Cys26. The 3JHNHA coupling constants were measured from a DQF-COSY spectrum and converted to dihedral restraints as follows: 3JHNHα > 8 Hz, ϕ = -120 ± 40 °; 3JHNHα < 6 Hz, ϕ = -60 ± 30 °. If a positive ϕ angle could be excluded on the basis of NOE data (27.Ludvigsen S. Poulsen F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), ϕ angles were restricted to the range -180 to 0 °. A χ1 angle for Leu4 was determined based on analysis of a short mixing NOESY spectrum. No hydrogen bonds were included as structural restraints. The CANDID module of CYANA was used to assign NOE cross-peaks in conjunction with manual assignments. For structure calculations, intensities of NOE cross-peaks were measured in XEASY and calibrated using the CALIBA macro of the program CYANA (version 1.0.6) (28.Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The final constraint set was scaled by a factor of 1.1 to allow for spin diffusion effects and then used to calculate a family of 100 structures using the standard simulated annealing script supplied with XPLOR-NIH (29.Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The 50 lowest energy structures were selected from the 100 calculated initially for energy minimization in a box of water. A family of 20 structures was selected based on energy and stereochemical considerations and was analyzed in PROCHECK-NMR (30.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (31.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (and 51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Structural figures were prepared using MOLMOL and InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The final structures had no experimental distance violations greater than 0.2 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 5 °. The structure of Magi 5 has been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (32.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar) with accession number 2GX1. Voltage-gated Sodium Channel Expression−For expression in X. laevis oocytes, the β1 gene was subcloned into pSP64T (33.Gellens M.E. George Jr., A.L. Chen L.Q. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, β1/pSP64T was linearized with EcoRI. Capped cRNAs were then synthesized from the linearized plasmid using the large scale SP6 mMESSAGE-mMACHINE transcription kit (Ambion). The DmNav1/pGH19-13–5 vector (34.Warmke J.W. Reenan R.A. Wang P. Qian S. Arena J.P. Wang J. Wunderler D. Liu K. Kaczorowski G.J. Van der Ploeg L.H. Ganetzky B. Cohen C.J. J. Gen.

Cell. 1995; 82: 1001-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and rNav1.2a/pNa200 vector (36.Noda M. Ikeda T. Kayano T. Suzuki H. Takeshima H. Kurasaki M. Takahashi H. Numa S. Nature. 1986; 320: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) were linearized with NotI and transcribed with the T7 mMESSAGE-mMACHINE kit (Ambion). The harvesting of oocytes from anesthetized female X. laevis frogs was as described previously (37.Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA at a concentration of 1 ng nl-1 using a Drummond microinjector (Ambion). The solution used for incubating the oocytes contained: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), supplemented with 50 mg liter-1 gentamycin sulfate. Electrophysiological Studies−Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (18–22 °C) using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) controlled by a pClamp data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). Whole cell currents from oocytes were recorded 2–4 days after injection. Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl. Resistances of both electrodes were kept as low as possible (<0.5 mΩ). Bath solution composition was: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Using a four-pole low pass Bessel filter, currents were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Leak subtraction was performed using a -P/4 protocol. Current traces were evoked in an oocyte expressing the cloned sodium channels according to the following protocols: 1) For current-voltage relationships, from a holding potential of -90 mV, the cells were depolarized with a three-step protocol. The first and last depolarization of 25-ms duration ranged from -70 to +40 mV in steps of 10 mV. The second depolarization to a voltage ranging between -20 and -10 mV (depending on the VGSC) was used to prime the channels, ensuring maximal binding of the β-toxin to the channel. The third segment of 25 ms at -120 mV ensured recovery from inactivation. Repetition interval was 5 s. The peak currents elicited in the third depolarization were plotted as a function of voltage, resulting in a current-voltage relationship (I-V curve). This data set was used for assessing toxin effect on channel activation. 2) For steady-state inactivation, the oocytes were depolarized with a two-step protocol. From a holding potential of -90 mV, 500-ms prepulses were generated from -120 to 0 mV with 5-mV increments, followed by a 50-ms test pulse to -10 mV. The interval between these sequences was 5 s. The data were fitted with a Boltzmann equation. 3) For recovery from inactivation, the oocytes were depolarized with a two-step protocol. From a holding potential of -90 mV, a first 50 ms pulse to -10 mV was given, followed by a second depolarization of 10 ms to -10 mV, interspersed by variable time intervals (2–82 ms). The data were fitted with a single exponential fit. 4) For the dose-response curve, the oocytes were depolarized from a holding potential of -90 mV to 100 ms test potentials ranging from -70 to 0 mV with 10-mV increments at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. The data were fitted with the Hill equation. Peptide Synthesis and Characterization−Magi 5 was synthesized with its C terminus as the free carboxyl, as observed for the native toxin by mass spectrometry (12.Corzo G. Gilles N. Satake H. Villegas E. Dai L. Nakajima T. Haupt J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The identity between the synthetic and native polypeptides was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and capillary zone electrophoresis. In a coinjection experiment, native Magi 5 and synthetic Magi 5 coeluted in a single sharp peak (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the circular dichroism spectra of both native Magi 5 and synthetic Magi 5 were also identical (supplemental Fig. S2), and both native Magi 5 and synthetic Magi 5 were able to modify with similar effectiveness the sodium currents in expressed rNav1.2a channels (see below). NMR Spectroscopy−The 1H NMR spectrum of Magi 5 in solution was characterized by broad backbone amide chemical shift dispersion, typical of a structured polypeptide stabilized by disulfide bonds (supplemental Fig. S3). Two-dimensional NOESY spectra recorded at 5, 15, and 25 °C showed that only one conformation was present in aqueous solution. The single proline at position 28 was predominately in the trans conformation; there was no evidence of cis-trans isomerization. Translational diffusion coefficients were measured at 5 and 25 °C, giving values of 1.38 ± 0.03 × 10-10 m2 s-1 (S.D. over 14 resonances of the peptide) and 2.50 ± 0.06 × 10-10 m2 s-1 (17 peaks), respectively. Allowing for viscosity and temperature effects, these values are similar to those obtained for peptides studied by Yao et al. (25.Yao S. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that Magi 5 was monomeric under the solution conditions utilized in the experiments. For comparison, a 19-residue polypeptide cross-linked by a single disulfide had a translational diffusion coefficient of 1.54 ± 0.03 × 10-10 m2 s-1 at 5 °C, slightly faster that Magi 5, as expected from its smaller mass (38.Sabo J.K. Keizer D.W. Feng Z.P. Casey J.L. Parisi K. Coley A.M. Foley M. Norton R.S. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific chemical shift assignments for backbone and side chain protons were made at 600 MHz from analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra. The 1H resonance assignments are tabulated in the Supplementary Data (supplemental Table S1) and have been deposited with BioMagResBank (39.Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), with accession number 7186. The deviations of the backbone NH and CαH chemical shifts from random coil values are plotted in Fig. 1. 3JHNHα coupling constants were determined from a DQF-COSY spectrum; only Ala20, Cys21, Ile25, and Met27 had 3JHNHα > 8 Hz, and none had values <6 Hz. Amide exchange experiments conducted at 5 °C and pH 3.6 indicated that all amide protons exchanged with solvent within minutes of dissolution of the polypeptide in 2H2O; as a result, no hydrogen bonds were used in structure calculations. Distance constraints were derived from NOESY cross-peak volumes at 5 °C and 600 MHz. Constraints were also included from an 800-MHz NOESY spectrum subsequently acquired to resolve overlap and ambiguous NOEs. In the Ramachandran plot, no residues were in the disallowed region as determined by the program PROCHECK-NMR (30.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar), except for Pro and Gly (Table 1).TABLE 1Experimental constraints and structural statistics for Magi 5No. of distance restraints459Intraresidue (i = j)119Sequential (|i – j| = 1)106Medium range (1 < |i – j| < 5)102Long range (|i – j| > 4)132Hydrogen bond restraints0No. of dihedral restraints26EnergiesaThe values for ENOE are calculated from a square well potential with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å2ENOE (kcal mol–1)12.0 ± 1.6Root mean square deviations from experimental dataNOEs (Å)0.023 ± 0.002Dihedrals (deg)0.133 ± 0.128Deviations from idealbThe values for the bonds, angles, and impropers show the deviations from ideal values based on perfect stereochemistryAngles (deg)0.725 ± 0.02Bonds (Å)0.0046 ± 0.0002Impropers (deg)0.571 ± 0.03Root mean square deviationscRoot mean square deviation over the backbone heavy atoms (N, Nα, and C) of all residuesAll heavy atoms1.39Backbone heavy atoms (N, Cα, and C)0.60Ramachandran plotdAs determined by the program PROCHECK-NMR for all residuesMost favored (%)54.2Allowed (%)42.3Additionally allowed (%)3.5Disallowed (%)0a The values for ENOE are calculated from a square well potential with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å2b The values for the bonds, angles, and impropers show the deviations from ideal values based on perfect stereochemistryc Root mean square deviation over the backbone heavy atoms (N, Nα, and C) of all residuesd As determined by the program PROCHECK-NMR for all residues Open table in a new tab Initial structures were calculated using the CANDID module of CYANA. A family of 20 structures determined with no disulfide bonds formed was used to determine the disulfide bonding pattern, because spectral overlap was problematic in the identification of Cys-Cys NOEs. It was clear from these initial structure calculations that Cys2 and Cys16 were much closer to one another than to other Cys side chains, so this disulfide was formed in subsequent rounds of structure calculation. To confirm the other two disulfide connectivities, XPLOR-NIH calculations were repeated with two possible combinations of cysteine pairings: Cys2-Cys16, Cys9-Cys21, and Cys15-Cys26 or Cys2-Cys16, Cys9-Cys26, and Cys15-Cys21. Structural constraints were well satisfied for the combination of Cys2-Cys16, Cys9-Cys21, and Cys15-Cys26, with the lowest energies obtained and fewest NMR restraint violations. This 1-4/2-5/3-6 pattern of disulfide pairings is consistent with those found in polypeptides that show the inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) fold (40.Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1573-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 41.Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Solution Structure of Magi 5−The final experimental constraints and structural statistics for Magi 5 are summarized in Table 1, and stereo views of the superposition of the family of structures over the backbone heavy atoms are shown in Fig. 2. These structures were calculated with the disulfide bonds present at each stage of structure calculations. From Table 1, it could be ascertained that the final family of structures were in good agreement with experimentally derived distance and angle constraints. The family of structures was well defined over most of the polypeptide and has been deposited with the RSBC Protein Data Bank (accession number 2GX1). The angular order parameters (S) for the ϕ, Ψ, and χ1 angles in the final family of structures are plotted as a function of residue number in supplemental Fig. S5. Values of S > 0.8 generally indicate that an angle is well ordered within the family of structures; the backbone ϕ and Ψ angles were well defined, as measured by this parameter, over the majority of residues, the exceptions being Cys16 and Gly17.

PMT causes porcine atrophic rhinitis that is characterized by bone resorption and loss of nasal turbinates, but experimental nasal infection also leads to excess proliferation of bladder epithelial cells. PMT acts intracellularly and activates phospholipase C-linked signals and MAPK pathways via the heterotrimeric Gαq and Gα12/13 proteins. We found that PMT induces activation of STAT proteins, and we identified STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 as new targets of PMT-induced Gαq signaling. Inhibition of Janus kinases completely abolished STAT activation. PMT-dependent STAT phosphorylation remained constitutive for at least 18 h. PMT caused down-regulation of the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3, indicating a novel mechanism to maintain activation of STATs. Moreover, stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with PMT increased transcription of the cancer-associated STAT-dependent gene cyclooxygenase-2. Because constitutive activation of STATs has been found in a number of cancers, our findings offer a new mechanism for a carcinogenic role of PMT.

Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious diseases in animals and humans. It has been isolated from chronic respiratory infections in various animals, and it is principally associated with atrophic rhinitis in pigs, a disease characterized by bone loss of nasal turbinates and inflammation of the nasal mucosa (1Kimman T.G. Löwik C.W.G.M. van de Wee-Pals L.J.A. Thesingh C.W. Defize P. Kamp E.M. Bijvoet O.L.M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2110-2116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the pathogen has been linked to cancer development, as natural infection with P. multocida or injection of its major virulence factor P. multocida toxin (PMT) 2The abbreviations used are: PMT, P. multocida toxin; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; LHRE, lactogenic hormone-responsive element; IRF7, interferon regulatory factor 7; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; qPCR, quantitative PCR. 2The abbreviations used are: PMT, P. multocida toxin; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; LHRE, lactogenic hormone-responsive element; IRF7, interferon regulatory factor 7; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; qPCR, quantitative PCR. causes proliferation of the bladder epithelium in the absence of an inflammatory reaction (2Ward P.N. Miles A.J. Sumner I.G. Thomas L.H. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PMT is a 146-kDa protein toxin that after entering the cell acts through activation of intracellular signaling cascades related to cell growth (reviewed in Ref. 3Lax A.J. Grigoriadis A.E. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is a potent mitogen in vivo and in vitro and is therefore thought to have high carcinogenic potential (4Lax A.J. Pullinger G.D. Baldwin M.R. Harmey D. Grigoriadis A.E. Lakey J.H. Int. J. Med.

Under in vitro conditions, picomolar concentrations of PMT are sufficient to promote re-entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle (6Higgins T.E. Murphy A.C. Staddon J.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E.

Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36701-36707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism of activation has not yet been elucidated. Eventually signals related to phospholipase Cβ (9Wilson B.A. Ponferrada V.G. Vallance J.E. Ho M.F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 80-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the small GTPase RhoA (10Lacerda H.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although some of the pathways that are activated by PMT are linked to known oncogenes, such as RhoA, Src, or Erk kinases, to date there are no data available whether chronic P. multocida infection may facilitate oncogenesis.Even though a number of viruses are now known to be connected to cancer, the relationship between bacterial pathogens and carcinogenesis has been established only recently. The discovery that chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori can cause gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma suggested that bacteria may have a certain impact on the development of cancer (12Court M. Robinson P.A. Dixon M.F. Crabtree J.E. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1348-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Nardone G. Rocco A. Malfertheiner P. Aliment. Pharmacol.

Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 293-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). One possible connection between infections caused by bacteria and cancer is chronic inflammation that supports anti-apoptotic or chronic proliferative conditions eventually allowing tumor onset or promotion (5Lax A.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic necrotizing factor from Escherichia coli, for example, is known to up-regulate the expression of proteins of the Bcl2 family that have an anti-apoptotic effect (16Oswald E. Nougayrede J.P. Taieb F. Sugai M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and H. pylori stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (17Juttner S. Cramer T. Wessler S. Walduck A. Gao F. Schmitz F. Wunder C. Weber M. Fischer S.M. Schmidt W.E. Wiedenmann B. Meyer T.F. Naumann M. Hocker M. Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that is well known for its rapid up-regulation in response to cytokines and to inflammation (18O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar).Binding of cytokines to their cell surface receptors activates receptor-associated members of the Janus kinases (JAKs), JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2 and leads to their auto-phosphorylation and the subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. These phosphotyrosines can then serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs). STATs are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that translocate to the nucleus in their phosphorylated and dimerized state (19Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). It is now clear that STAT proteins are also potential targets of oncogenes (20Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). From knock-out studies it was possible to allocate most STAT proteins to specific cytokine-induced signaling pathways. Stat3 is the only gene whose knock-out leads to embryonic lethality (21Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), although this cannot be sufficiently explained by its functions in gp130-like receptor signaling. It is generally accepted that aberrant STAT activation contributes to malignant transformation of cells through promotion of cell cycle progression and cell survival (20Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Oncogenic activity is particularly associated with constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT5, and in various human cancers STAT3 is persistently activated (20Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). In cell culture experiments, constitutive STAT3 activation can be connected to growth deregulation that enhances transformation or blocks apoptosis of cells. Transcriptional events that are controlled by STAT proteins and that might play a role in cell transformation are cyclin D1, cyclin D2, Bcl-XL, c-Myc, and p21 WAF (23Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 24Martino A. Holmes J.H. Lord J.D. Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Dual Luciferase Assays—Activation of STAT proteins was measured by luciferase activity of 293-derived Phoenix eco cells transfected with pGRR5-Luc for general STAT activation (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), pLHRE-Luc (lactogenic hormone-responsive element) for STAT5 activation (29Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), or pIRF7-Luc (Interferon Regulatory Factor) for STAT1 activation (30Dumoutier L. Tounsi A. Michiels T. Sommereyns C. Kotenko S.V. Renauld J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32269-32274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As an internal control, the pRL-TK vector (Promega) was used. Phoenix cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 100 ng of the reporter cDNAs using calcium phosphate transfection. After 4 h medium was changed, and cells were either preincubated for 1 h with 500 nm JAK inhibitor I (Calbiochem) or stimulated directly with 2 μg/ml PMTWT or PMTC1165S. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and a Microlumat Plus luminometer (Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany).Further transfections included the use of MEF cells and were performed using the nucleofection system (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to the general protocol for nucleofection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution (MEF2) together with 5 μg of reporter plasmids and then electroporated. After nucleofection, cells were recovered by addition of 800 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and seeded into 8 wells of a 96-well plate. After 4 h, inhibitors or toxins were added, and the cells were treated as described before.Whole Cell Extracts and Immunoprecipitation—One confluent T175 flask of Swiss 3T3 cells was stimulated overnight with 2 μg/ml PMT or left untreated. Cells were detached by using a cell scraper. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 750 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10% glycerol for 45 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, lysates were either immunoprecipitated overnight with 1.5 μg of JAK1 or JAK2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively) bound to protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with antibodies specific for the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of JAK1 and JAK2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at a dilution of 1:1000, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at a dilution of 1:1000 and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence.Cytosolic and Nuclear Extracts—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts from human Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described (31Haspel R.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached with a cell scraper in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Washed cells were pelleted and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation for 1 min, supernatants containing cytosolic fractions were used for direct immunoblotting or frozen at -80 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in cold high salt lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors). Nuclear extracts were collected after a 10-min centrifugation at maximum speed, and the protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay.Protein samples from cytosolic or nuclear fractions (50 μg) were migrated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with TBST containing 5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate STAT antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at a dilution of 1:1000. An anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used at a dilution of 1:1000, and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Serum-starved mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with or without PMTWT, PMTC1165S (each 1 μg/ml, 18 h), IFN-γ (20 ng/ml, 2 h). RNA was extracted with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically. Samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis. Then cDNA was prepared using QuantiTect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In brief, 700 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed (30 min, 42 °C) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by heating to 93 °C for 3 min.Aliquots of the cDNA were used for quantitative PCR analysis with the Mx3000P qPCR system (Stratagene) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the following primers: GAPDH, sense, 5′-tcccattcttccacctttgatg-3′, and antisense, 5′-gtccaccaccctgttgctgta-3′; S12, sense, 5′-ggcatagctgctggaggtgtaa-3′, and antisense, 5′-gggcttggcgcttgtctaa-3′; COX-2, sense, 5′-aaaggcctccattgaccagag-3′, and antisense, 5′-gccatttccttctctcctgtaagttc-3′; SOCS-3, sense, 5′-cgcgggcacctttcttatc-3′, and antisense, 5′-tcacactggatgcgtaggttct-3′. The results were analyzed using the MxPro qPCR software (Stratagene). For further analysis results were exported to Excel (Microsoft) and calculated by qCalculator 1.0 (32Gilsbach R. Kouta M. Bonisch H. Bruss M. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All results were normalized with respect to the housekeeping genes (Gapdh and S12).Expression and Purification of PMT Proteins—Recombinant PMT and PMTC1165S were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). In brief, GST fusion proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose, followed by proteolytic cleavage using 3.25 units of thrombin/mg of recombinant GST fusion protein. Thrombin was removed by incubation with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (33Busch C. Orth J. Djouder N. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3628-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).RESULTSPMT Activates Transcriptional Activity of STAT Proteins— PMT is known to interact with various intracellular host signaling pathways to exert its mitogenic activity. To investigate whether PMT is able to activate latent cytoplasmic transcription factors of the STAT family, we transiently transfected human 293-derived Phoenix cells with the STAT-specific reporter plasmid pGRR5-Luc (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity was assessed in a luciferase assay after overnight incubation with 2 μg/ml of either PMTWT or a biologically inactive mutant PMTC1165S (2Ward P.N. Miles A.J. Sumner I.G. Thomas L.H. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Busch C. Orth J. Djouder N. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3628-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that stimulation of cells with PMTWT leads to an increase in activity of about 4-fold when compared with untreated cells. To exclude unspecific activation caused by the preparation of recombinant PMT, an inactive mutant, PMTC1165S, was employed. Because this mutant toxin is not able to activate STAT activity, the increase in luciferase activity through wild-type PMT is a specific effect of this toxin.To further investigate PMT-induced STAT activation, luciferase assays were performed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Cells were incubated overnight with PMT at concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 5 μg/ml. Already at the lowest concentrations, a small but reproducible increase in luciferase activity could be monitored. STAT activation mounted rapidly with increasing PMT concentrations, and more than half-maximal induction was attained at 0.05 μg/ml PMT.PMT-mediated STAT Activation Depends on Gαq Protein— Because it is well known that PMT can signal via two families of heterotrimeric G proteins, Gα12/13 or Gαq, we wanted to determine whether STAT activation by PMT depends on either of these proteins. For that purpose we made use of a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that is deficient for Gα12/13 (25Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Orth J. Lang S. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34150-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The STAT reporter construct pGRR5-Luc was transfected into these cells using the nucleofection system (Amaxa Biosystems). Freshly transfected cells were grown in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and were stimulated with PMT overnight (2 μg/ml) or left untreated. In Gα12/13-deficient cells PMT-dependent luciferase activity could still be monitored, and an increase in transcriptional activity of about 5-fold compared with the negative control was observed (Fig. 2). This result indicates that Gα12/13 is not necessary for PMT-mediated induction of STAT activation. Interestingly, when we preincubated these cells with the Gαq/11-specific inhibitor YM-254890 (35Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) before addition of PMT, STAT activity was completely abolished. These data suggest that Gαq but not Gα12/13 is essential for PMT-mediated STAT activation. To corroborate this result, we repeated the described experiment in Gαq/11-deficient MEF cells to determine their ability to activate STAT proteins after PMT incubation, and we found that the Gαq/11 gene knock-out does completely abrogate the activation of STAT proteins in luciferase assays. We therefore conclude that the heterotrimeric Gαq protein is necessary and sufficient for PMT-induced transcriptional activity of STAT proteins.FIGURE 2Analysis of STAT activation in G protein-deficient cells. Gα12/13- and Gαq/11-deficient (inset) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were assayed for STAT transcriptional activity using the pGRR5-Luc plasmid and pRL-TK as a control. Cells were either preincubated with the Gαq/11 specific inhibitor YM-254890 for 60 min or left untreated and then intoxicated overnight with 2 μg/ml PMTWT.

Thus we prepared cytosolic and nuclear extracts from Swiss 3T3 cells. To determine whether STAT proteins were expressed in these cells, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, and proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and blotted with antibodies specific for STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. All three proteins and their known splice variants could be detected (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Analysis of STAT protein activation and phosphorylation through PMT. A, Swiss 3T3 cells were starved in serum-free medium for 4 h before addition of 2 μg/ml PMTWT for overnight incubation. Cytosolic extracts of Swiss 3T3 were prepared, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Expression of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 proteins was detected using specific antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. B, nuclear extracts of Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared, and 50 μg of protein were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and STAT proteins were detected in their activated states by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-701 STAT1, Tyr(P)-705 STAT3, Ser(P)-727 STAT3, and Tyr(P)-674 STAT5 as indicated. C, quantification of STAT5 transcriptional activity by a luciferase assay.

To monitor nuclear STAT proteins, Swiss 3T3 cells were starved, and nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated cells and cells that had been incubated overnight with 2 μg/ml PMT. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with specific antibodies recognizing STAT proteins in their tyrosine- or serine-phosphorylated state, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, PMT is able to induce activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 as detected by phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 of STAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of residue 694 of STAT5. In the case of STAT3 phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 and serine 727 was detected, whereas extracts from unstimulated cell extracts showed only a weak activation for all STAT proteins examined.To further strengthen these data, we performed luciferase assays with reporter constructs containing the interferon regulatory factor-7 site that is specific for STAT1 and STAT2 (pIRF7-Luc (30Dumoutier L.

Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). Transfected Phoenix cells were intoxicated overnight with 2 μg/ml PMT or left unstimulated, and cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity. As Fig. 3, C and D, shows, an increase in PMT-induced luciferase activity of about 5-fold could be detected with both reporter plasmids, confirming the specific activation of these two transcription factors.Time Course of STAT3 Activation—Because cytokine-induced STAT activation is a transient event that occurs within minutes after binding of a cytokine to its cognate receptor, we wanted to determine the kinetics of PMT-induced STAT3 activation. It is known that there is delay of about 1 h between addition of PMT and the earliest cellular events caused by the receptor-mediated uptake of PMT (7Rozengurt E. Higgins T. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Staddon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Wilson B.A. Aminova L.R. Ponferrada V.G. Ho M. Infect.

Cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with 2 μg/ml PMTWT, and cell lysates of stimulated cells were prepared at the indicated times (Fig. 3E). One additional time point was taken after overnight stimulation with PMTWT, corresponding to an 18-h incubation. STAT activation was then analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 3, E and F, illustrate that PMT-induced STAT3 activation can be seen as early as 2 h after stimulation, with a peak in activity after 3 h. The signal then slightly decreases but remains stable on a lower level and can still be detected at the same intensity 18"

Direct functional or structural data of the transport complex are, however, not known so far. After screening expression in various hosts, Mdl1 was overexpressed 100-fold to 1% of total mitochondrial membrane protein in S. cerevisiae. Based on detergent screens, Mdl1 was solubilized and purified to homogeneity. Mdl1 showed a high binding affinity for MgATP (Kd = 0.26 μm) and an ATPase activity with a Km of 0.86 mm (Hill coefficient of 0.98) and a turnover rate of 2.6 ATP/s. Mutagenesis of the conserved glutamate downstream of the Walker B motif (E599Q) or the conserved histidine of the H-loop (H631A) abolished ATP hydrolysis, whereas ATP binding was not affected. Mdl1 reconstituted into liposomes showed an ATPase activity similar to the solubilized complex. By single particle electron microscopy, a first three-dimensional structure of the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter was derived at 2.3-nm resolution, revealing a homodimeric complex in an open conformation. The ATP-binding cassette half-transporter Mdl1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proposed to be involved in the quality control of misassembled respiratory chain complexes by exporting degradation products generated by the m-AAA proteases from the matrix. Direct functional or structural data of the transport complex are, however, not known so far. After screening expression in various hosts, Mdl1 was overexpressed 100-fold to 1% of total mitochondrial membrane protein in S. cerevisiae. Based on detergent screens, Mdl1 was solubilized and purified to homogeneity. Mdl1 showed a high binding affinity for MgATP (Kd = 0.26 μm) and an ATPase activity with a Km of 0.86 mm (Hill coefficient of 0.98) and a turnover rate of 2.6 ATP/s. Mutagenesis of the conserved glutamate downstream of the Walker B motif (E599Q) or the conserved histidine of the H-loop (H631A) abolished ATP hydrolysis, whereas ATP binding was not affected. Mdl1 reconstituted into liposomes showed an ATPase activity similar to the solubilized complex. By single particle electron microscopy, a first three-dimensional structure of the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter was derived at 2.3-nm resolution, revealing a homodimeric complex in an open conformation. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 4The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; EM, electron microscopy; FC-14, tetradecylphosphocholine; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD, transmembrane domain. 4The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; EM, electron microscopy; FC-14, tetradecylphosphocholine; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD, transmembrane domain. superfamily constitutes a large class of active transporters found in all kingdoms of life. They couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the transport of substrates across membranes. ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The TMDs form the translocation pore, whereas the NBDs are responsible for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, thus energizing substrate transport (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 2Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes and archaea, they can function as importers together with a substrate-binding protein, but generally ABC transporters operate as exporters. The TMDs and NBDs are found as homo- or heterodimers and can be arranged in any combination, e.g. as separate polypeptides, as single polypeptides, or as half-size transporters with fused TMD and NBD. The NBDs contain the highly conserved Walker A and B motifs as well as the C-, H-, and D-loops. Structural and biochemical data demonstrated that ATP binding induces dimerization of two NBDs in a head-to-tail orientation leading to a structure where both ATPs are sandwiched on the interface of the dimer (reviewed in Ref. 3van der Does C. Tampé R. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each of the two nucleotide-binding sites in the dimer is formed by the Walker A and B motifs from one NBD and C-loop residues of the other NBD. The MDL1 gene encodes a membrane protein of 695 amino acids with a TMD followed by a NBD (4Dean M. Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Kistler A. Shafer B. Michaelis S. Strathern J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity and sequence homology analysis suggested that the TMD contains six transmembrane helices with the N and C termini located in the matrix. The minimal functional unit has been suggested to be a homodimer residing in the inner mitochondrial membrane (5Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mdl1 is a component of the mitochondrial quality control system and is involved in translocation of peptides with a length of 6–20 amino acids from the matrix into the inter membrane space (5Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These products are generated by degradation of non-assembled inner mitochondrial membrane complexes by m-AAA (matrix-oriented ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) proteases (6Arnold I. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although Mdl1 is not essential for cell viability, it is tempting to speculate that it plays a physiological role in the communication between the mitochondrion and the cellular environment. Homologues of Mdl1 have been identified in mammals, e.g. ABCB8 (M-ABC1) and ABCB10 (ABC-me, M-ABC2) (7Hogue D.L. Liu L. Ling V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Shirihai O.S. Gregory T. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Weiss M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Zhang F. Hogue D.L. Liu L. Fisher C.L. Hui D. Childs S. Ling V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several other functions for Mdl1 have, however, been suggested, e.g. Mdl1 partially restores Atm1 function (10Chloupkova M. LeBard L.S. Koeller D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ABC transporter Atm1 serves as a link between mitochondrial and cytosolic iron homeostasis, presumably by exporting iron-sulfur clusters assembled in the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space (11Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Mdl1 in Δatm1 cells results in a reduction of mitochondrial iron content and decreased sensitivity to H2O2 and transition metal toxicity, thus suggesting a role for Mdl1 in the regulation of cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Here, we report the overexpression, purification, and functional reconstitution into proteoliposomes of Mdl1, which allowed us to study the biochemical properties of a mitochondrial ABC transporter for the first time. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of the ABC transport complex was obtained at 2.3-nm resolution by electron microscopy and single particle analysis. Materials— 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Peptide libraries were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry (12Uebel S. Meyer T.H. Kraas W. Kienle S. Jung G. Wiesmüller K.H. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18512-18516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For immune detection, rabbit antisera were raised against the C terminus of Mdl1 (KGGVIDLDNSVAREV) and affinity-purified. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Pierce). Digitonin was purchased at Calbiochem, and all other detergents were from Anatrace. Cloning—By the use of unique restriction sites, MDL1 was systematically divided in three cassettes, facilitating exchange between different constructs. The cassettes were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. Cassette I encodes the N terminus of Mdl1 until a silent ClaI site, which was introduced at the nucleotides corresponding to residue S221. Cassette II includes the central region of Mdl1 from the ClaI site to an intrinsic and unique BamHI site comprising amino acids Ser221–Lys422. Cassette III encodes the NBD from amino acid Asp423 to the C terminus including an additional His8 tag. A variant of cassette III was cloned without a C-terminal tag and named IIIa. Cassette I was also constructed without the first 68 amino acids, predicted to include the mitochondrial leader sequence, and named Ia. Primers used to generate the cassettes are described in the on-line supplemental material (supplemental Table S1). The cassettes I, II, and III were sequentially ligated into pET401 (13van der Sluis E.O. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) resulting in vector pMDL1(pre). Construction of Expression Plasmids—The MDL1 gene from vector pMDL1(pre) was cloned in different cloning and expression vectors for either Escherichia coli or Lactococcus lactis (supplemental Table S2). To integrate the MDL1 gene behind the strong PDR5 promotor, a PCR fragment was created by using pMDL1(pre) as template as well as the pc4(f) and pc4(r) primers. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with AscI and PacI and ligated into pFA6a-His3MX6 (14Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). This vector was used as a template to generate a PCR fragment with the primers pc5(f) and pc5(r), which was then used for homologous recombination in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YALF-A1 (15Wolfger H. Mahe Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To generate the yeast overexpression vector, the MDL1 gene from vector pMDL1(pre) was amplified by PCR using the primers pc6(f) and pc3(r) and cloned into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) via the TOPO TA Expression kit (Invitrogen). This resulted in a galactose-inducible Mdl1 construct with a C-terminal 4-Gly spacer, a factor Xa cleavage site and an His8 tag. Expression in E. coli and L. lactis—The E. coli expression plasmids were transformed into different E. coli strains, e.g. BL21(DE3) (Novagen), C41 (16Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar), C43 (16Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar), SF100 (17Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TOP10 (Invitrogen). The strains were grown in LB medium at different temperatures (18, 25, 30, and 37 °C). Depending on the respective system, the expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.025, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mm) or arabinose (0.004, 0.04, and 0.4%) at different A600 (0.2, 0.6, and 1.0) for different times (1, 2, 3, and 6 h and overnight). The different plasmids were co-transformed into strains containing plasmids encoding for rare tRNAs (pRARE). To assist membrane insertion, the MDL1 gene cloned into pK184 (18Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5315-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was co-expressed with the SecY, SecE, SecG, and YidC components of the E. coli translocase (19van der Laan M. Houben E.N. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For expression in L. lactis, strain NZ9000 (20de Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pNZ8084-Mdl1fl. The expression was tested under conditions where extra chaperones were produced, e.g. in the presence of 1 m sorbitol, 2% ethanol, or at 42 °C. The membranes were isolated as described (21van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and separated on SDS-PAGE (10%), and the expression levels were evaluated by quantitative immunoblotting and immunodetection using an anti-Mdl1 antibody. Purified Mdl1-NBD was used as reference (22Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and quantification was carried out with a Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche Applied Science) and the LumiAnalyst software (version 3.1). Overexpression in S. cerevisiae—S. cerevisiae strain BY4743 (MATa/MATα; his3Δ1/his3Δ1; leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; met15Δ0/MET15; LYS2/lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) (23Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) was transformed with the plasmid pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-Mdl1fl, pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-Mdl1fl_EQ, or pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-Mdl1fl_HA and grown overnight in SC medium (24Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar), supplemented with amino acids without uracil and 2% glucose. The cells were harvested and resuspended to an A600 of 0.4 in SC medium supplemented with amino acids without uracil and 2% galactose. Growth was continued at 30 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation 8 h after induction. The mitochondria were isolated as described (25Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (10%), and the expression levels were evaluated by Coomassie staining and quantitative immunoblotting. Detergent Screens—To test the solubilization efficiencies, the mitochondria (5 mg/ml) were solubilized for 30 min in 100 μl of buffer S (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) supplemented with DDM, FC-14, or digitonin at ρ values of either 15 or 50 (Equation 1; where [lipid] is 0.1 times (w/w) the protein concentration, the average molecular mass of a lipid was taken as 875 Da, and CMC is the critical micelle concentration). ρ=[detergent]-CMC[lipid](Eq. 1) After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), solubilized and nonsolubilized Mdl1 were compared by immunoblotting using an Mdl1-specific antibody. Chemiluminescent signals were quantified, and the percentage of solubilized protein was calculated. To analyze the stability and oligomeric state of Mdl1 mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein in 100 μl of final volume) were solubilized in different detergents (1% each). Solubilized proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and analyzed by Blue native electrophoresis (gradient 6.0 to 16.5%) as described (26Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa) were used as markers. Purification of Mdl1—Mitochondria (5 mg/ml) were solubilized in buffer S supplemented with 1% digitonin (ρ value of 15) and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle shaking. Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to an IDA-column (GE Healthcare) loaded with Ni2+ and equilibrated with IMAC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm imidazole, 0.1% digitonin, pH 7.5). The column was washed with 60 and 120 mm imidazole. Specifically bound protein was eluted in IMAC buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The protein was identified by immunoblotting and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight peptide mass fingerprint analysis after trypsin digestion, using Mascot (data base NCBInr 20040521). Nucleotide Binding Assays—Nucleotide binding was measured by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP photo cross-linking experiments. Purified Mdl1 (0.5 μm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP for 5 min on ice and UV-irradiated for 5 min. For concentrations of 10 μm and above, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was supplemented 1:5 with nonradioactive 8-azido-ATP. Subsequently, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%). The gels were dried and exposed to a Kodak SO230 phosphor screen. Photo cross-linked protein was quantified by phosphorimaging (Phosphor-Imager 445Si, Molecular Dynamics). Intensities (I) were plotted against the 8-azido-ATP concentration and fitted with a (1:1) Langmuir isotherm. To determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for MgATP, Equation 2 was used (where bg displays background intensity). I=Imax1+[8-azido-ATP]IC50slope+bg(Eq. 2) Applying the Cheng-Prusoff equation (27Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar), the dissociation constant Kd for ATP was derived from the IC50 value for ATP and the Kd value for 8-azido-ATP (Equation 3). Kd(ATP)=IC501+[8-azido-ATP]Kd(8-azido-ATP)(Eq. 3) ATP Hydrolysis Assay—The ATPase activity was determined essentially as described (28Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of ATP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) with varying concentrations of ATP supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi; Hartmann Analytic) and 0.02% (w/v) FC-14, 0.02% (w/v) DDM or 0.1% (w/v) digitonin was mixed with 25 μl of purified Mdl1 (final concentration, 0.5 μm) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of reagent A (10 mm ammonium molybdate in 1 n HCl), 15 μl of 20 mm H3PO4, and 2 ml of reagent B (isobutanol, cyclohexane, acetone, and reagent A in a ratio of 5:5:1:0.1). The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 30 s. After phase separation, 1 ml of the organic phase was mixed with scintillation fluid (Microscint; Packard BioScience), and the release of inorganic phosphate was determined by β-counting (Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter). Vmax and Km were derived by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. A similar protocol was used to determine the ATPase activity of reconstituted Mdl1. Reconstitution of Mdl1—E. coli total lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) were resuspended in buffer R (50 mm Tris, 25 mm KCl, pH 7.5) at a concentration of 4 mg/ml. The lipid suspension was extruded (Avanti Mini-Extruder) 11 times through a 0.4-μm polycarbonate filter (Avestin). The liposome suspension was titrated to a final DDM concentration of 4.2 mm, mixed with solubilized Mdl1 in a molar lipid-to-protein ratio of 200, and incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. Polystyrene beads (Bio-beads SM-2; Bio-Rad) were washed three times with methanol, washed five times with buffer R, and incubated with E. coli total lipids (4 mg/ml in buffer R) before use. These Bio-beads (80 mg/ml final) were then added to the protein/detergent/lipid mixture and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Bio-beads were replaced by freshly prepared beads (80 mg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of the Bio-beads, proteoliposomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (190,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), resuspended in buffer R, applied to a sucrose step gradient (10, 20, and 30% (w/v)), and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 18 h, 4 °C). The sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined with an Abbé refractometer. The lipid concentration was determined as described (29Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5807) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl samples were mixed with the same volume of 70% (v/v) perchloric acid, and after incubation for two hours at 200 °C, 700 μl of reagent C (2.5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, 12.5% perchloric acid) and 700 μl of 3% (w/v) ascorbic acid were added. Finally, the samples were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C, and absorbance at 820 nm was measured and compared with a phosphate standard (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein concentration in the different fractions was determined by quantitative immunoblotting using isolated Mdl1 as a reference. To elucidate the orientation of reconstituted Mdl1, proteoliposomes were treated with the protease factor Xa at 10 μg/ml for 2 h at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Freeze Fracture Electron Microscopy—Proteoliposome preparations were placed between two small copper blades and rapidly frozen in liquid ethane. The samples were prepared in a freeze fracture unit (400T Balzers) and shadowed with platinum/carbon at an angle of 45°. Replicas reinforced by pure carbon shadowing at an angle of 90° were cleaned from organic material in chromo-sulfuric acid and analyzed by a Philips EM208S electron microscope. Peptide Transport Assays—Iodination of peptide libraries and peptide transport was performed as described (30Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes (0.5 μg of Mdl1) were preincubated with 4.8 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 in 50 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) for 1 min at 30 °C. The transport reaction was started by the addition of 125I-labeled X8 or X23 peptide libraries to a final concentration of 2 μm. The reaction was stopped after 6 min at 30 °C by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold transport buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed, and radioactivity was quantified by γ-counting. To determine background activities, the samples were treated with apyrase (1 unit) instead of MgATP. Single Particle Electron Microscopy—Purified Mdl1(H631A) was concentrated (Amicon Ultra-4; molecular weight cut-off 100 kDa) to 1 mg/ml, subjected to gel filtration (Superdex 200 PC 3.2), and equilibrated with buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% digitonin, pH 7.5). Peak fractions containing Mdl1 were pooled, applied on a carbon grid, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy (EM) images were recorded on film under low dose conditions in a FEI F30 electron microscope. For three-dimensional reconstruction, tilt pairs were collected at 0° and 48° tilt and corresponding micrographs digitized on a Zeiss SCAI Scanner with 7-μm pixel size. Particle images were analyzed using the SPIDER package (31Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). XMIPP software (32Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Velazquez-Muriel J. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) was used for classification of untilted images based on the Kohonen neural network. The maps were obtained from a total data set of 2 × 1404 projections by the random conical tilt method (33Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The 2-fold symmetry typical for homodimers was imposed after verification at the latest step. After multiple refinements of all three Euler angles, the final volume was computed. The resolution was determined by the Fourier shell correlation criterion (cut-off at five times the noise correlation, FSC5). The atomic structure of the open MsbA (Protein Data Bank code 1JSQ (34Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar)) was fitted into the electron density map of Mdl1 using Chimera software (35Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26024) Google Scholar). To collect the first biochemical and structural data of a mitochondrial ABC transporter, we set out to screen optimal conditions for expression, solubilization, purification, and reconstitution of Mdl1. In S. cerevisiae, Mdl1 is expressed at low levels (36Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2952) Google Scholar) and is almost unaffected by various stimuli (environmental stress) as shown by microarray techniques (db.yeastgenome.org). Quantitative immunoblotting using the isolated NBD of Mdl1 as reference (22Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Mdl1 is expressed to approximately 0.01% (w/w) of total mitochondrial protein (Table 1). We first tested expression of Mdl1 in E. coli. High and low copy number plasmids with different inducible promotors were studied under varying growth conditions and in different strains. The expression level of Mdl1 was determined by quantitative immunoblotting as described above. To promote Mdl1 expression, chaperones were induced by growth at 42 °C either in the presence of 2% ethanol or 1 m sorbitol. In addition, we tested coexpression with rare tRNAs or the SecY, SecE, SecG, and YidC components of the E. coli translocase. However, none of these factors improved the expression level of Mdl1 (0.005% of total membrane protein; Table 1). Because L. lactis has been demonstrated to be a suitable host for overexpression of mitochondrial proteins (37Kunji E.R. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), Mdl1 was also expressed in this gram-positive bacteria. Expression of Mdl1 under control of a strong, nisin-inducible promotor led to an ∼2-fold higher expression level (0.01% of total membrane protein) compared with E. coli, but the expression level was still very low (Table 1).TABLE 1Expression level of Mdl1 in various hostsS. cerevisiae wild typeaMitochondrial membranesPlasmid-driven expressionE. coliL. lactisS. cerevisiaeaMitochondrial membranes%%Amount/total membrane protein (w/w)0.010.0050.011a Mitochondrial membranes Open table in a new tab Because only low expression levels were obtained in either E. coli or L. lactis, we initiated expression screens in S. cerevisiae. MDL1 was cloned behind a strong constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promotor (p426GPD) or strong glycerol-dependent AAC2 (ADP/ATP carrier protein) promotor (pYES3PA2AAC2). Surprisingly, both approaches resulted in lower than intrinsic levels of Mdl1 (Table 1). Alternatively, Mdl1 was cloned behind the PDR5 promotor, which is under control of the PDR network in the S. cerevisiae strain YALF-A1 (15Wolfger H. Mahe Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This system has been successful in the expression of membrane proteins in yeast (38Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M.

We next examined expression from a multicopy plasmid under the inducible GAL1 promotor. Here, Mdl1 was overexpressed 100-fold, reaching 1% of total mitochondrial protein (Table 1). Mdl1 expression was strongly time-dependent, reaching its maximum 8 h after induction and then decreasing (Fig. 1A). This finding indicates that high Mdl1 levels are disfavored and result in increased instability or degradation of the protein. The degradation pathway is presently not known and is the focus of future studies. However, using this expression system, high levels of Mdl1 suitable for functional and structural studies were obtained. We subsequently tested various detergents at different concentrations (ρ value) for optimal solubilization of Mdl1 from isolated mitochondria. n-Tetradecylphosphocholine (FC-14) showed by far the highest solubilization efficiency (>70% at ρ = 50) followed by n-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (66%), sodium cholate (56%), Triton X-100 (53%), and finally DDM (48%), octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (46%), digitonin (44%), n-octyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (42%), and n-decanoyl-N-hydroxy ethylenglucamide (35%) (Fig. 1B). We then investigated the stability and oligomeric state of Mdl1 in different detergents by Blue native electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Mdl1 migrated as a defined band at 250 kDa in Triton X-100, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether, digitonin, n-undecyl-β-d-maltoside, DDM, and n-octyl-α-d-glucopyranoside. In case of digitonin, Mdl1 was found in an almost monodisperse state corresponding to a homodimeric complex. Only a very broad smear was observed if Mdl1 was solubilized in FC-14 (not shown). Mdl1 was isolated by metal affinity chromatography utilizing a C-terminal His8 tag. Purification was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Like many integral membrane proteins, Mdl1 migrates at lower molecular mass than predicted (62 kDa instead of 71 kDa). Mdl1 was further identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Three detergents were selected for further analysis: FC-14 as the most efficient deterg"
https://openalex.org/W2059786964,"C4 photosynthetic NADP-malic enzyme (ME) has evolved from non-C4 isoforms and gained unique kinetic and structural properties during this process. To identify the domains responsible for the structural and kinetic differences between maize C4 and non-C4-NADP-ME several chimeras between these isoforms were constructed and analyzed. By using this approach, we found that the region flanked by amino acid residues 102 and 247 is critical for the tetrameric state of C4-NADP-ME. In this way, the oligomerization strategy of these NADP-ME isoforms differs markedly from the one that present non-plant NADP-ME with known crystal structures. On the other hand, the region from residue 248 to the C-terminal end of the C4 isoform is involved in the inhibition by high malate concentrations at pH 7.0. The inhibition pattern of the C4-NADP-ME and some of the chimeras suggested an allosteric site responsible for such behavior. This pH-dependent inhibition could be important for regulation of the C4 isoform in vivo, with the enzyme presenting maximum activity while photosynthesis is in progress.

NAD(P)-malic enzyme (NAD(P)-ME) 4The abbreviations used are: NADP-ME, NAD(P)-malic enzyme; PEPC, phospho-enolpyruvate carboxylase.4The abbreviations used are: NADP-ME, NAD(P)-malic enzyme; PEPC, phospho-enolpyruvate carboxylase. (EC 1.1.1.38, 1.1.1.39, and 1.1.1.40) catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to yield carbon dioxide and pyruvate with the concomitant reduction of NAD(P) (1Chang G.-G. Tong L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12721-12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The enzyme is found in most living organisms, because the products of the reaction are used as a source of carbon and reductive power in different cell compartments. The amino acid sequences of malic enzymes are highly conserved among many organisms, from bacteria to human. However, malic enzymes do not show recognizable amino acid sequence homology to other proteins such as dehydrogenases, decarboxylases, or other oxidative decarboxylases, comprising a new class of oxidative decarboxylases (2Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In plants, both plastidic and cytosolic NADP-ME (EC 1.1.1.40) playing photosynthetic as well as non-photosynthetic roles have been identified (3Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The photosynthetic plastidic isoform, which is expressed in bundle sheath cells of some C4 plants, represents a unique and specialized form of NADP-ME with particular kinetic, structural, and regulatory properties, and all of these make this enzyme suitable to participate in the CO2 concentrating mechanism that increases the photosynthetic yield of NADP-ME C4 plants (3Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4Edwards E. Andreo C.S. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, C4 non-photosynthetic NADP-ME isoforms are expressed in the cytosol (5Lai L.B. Tausta S.L. Nelson T.M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and plastids (6Lai L.B. Wang L. Nelson T.M.

Because these non-photosynthetic isoforms represent ancestors of the C4-specific enzyme they are ideal candidates for studying the evolution process toward the current C4-NADP-ME. In maize, the plastidic non-photosynthetic NADP-ME (ZmChlMe2) represents the more recent and direct ancestor of the C4-NADP-ME (ZmChlMe1, Ref. 9Tausta S.L. Coyle H.M. Rothermel B. Stiefel V. Nelson T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This enzyme is constitutively expressed in maize and plays housekeeping roles; in contrast to the C4 isoenzyme (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P. Maurino V.G. Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Tausta S.L. Coyle H.M. Rothermel B. Stiefel V. Nelson T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By cloning and expressing both the maize plastidic photosynthetic (C4) and non-photosynthetic NADP-ME (also known as non-C4-NADP-ME) as functional proteins in Escherichia coli, we identified several structural and kinetic differences between these two proteins (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P. Maurino V.G. Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Detarsio E. Gerrard Wheeler M.C. Campos Bermúdez V.A. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13757-13764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among these structural differences, the most relevant is the oligomeric state: the C4-NADP-ME assembles as a tetramer and the non-C4-NADP-ME as a dimer. With regard to the kinetic differences, one of the most outstanding is the inhibition of the C4-NADP-ME by the substrate malate in a pH-dependent way. The non-C4-NADP-ME is not inhibited by high concentrations of this substrate at all. This inhibition may be relevant in regulating the C4 isoform in vivo, by allowing the enzyme to increase its activity when photosynthesis is in progress. The goal of the present work was to identify the segments of the primary structure of the C4 and non-C4 isoforms that are responsible for the C4-specific properties in maize NADP-ME. The high sequence similarity between these two enzymes (85%) allowed us to swap the corresponding segments between the two isoforms, constructing several chimeras. The structural and kinetic properties of the resulting chimerical enzymes were studied identifying segments involved in the tetramerization process and in the inhibition by the substrate malate at low pH. Construction of Chimerical NADP-ME Sequences—Maize C4 (pET-ME, Ref. 10Detarsio E. Gerrard Wheeler M.C. Campos Bermúdez V.A. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. J. Biol.

Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) sequences were inserted into the pET32 expression vector (Novagen). The sequences correspond to the mature proteins (without transit peptides) in both cases. The plasmids pET-ME and pET-RME were treated with the corresponding restriction endonucleases (Fig. 1) and the fragments obtained were purified and recombined to obtain the chimerical NADP-ME sequences into the expression vector pET-32. The plasmids obtained were named as follows: pET-LR-NADP-ME, pET-RL-NADP-ME, pET-RpL-NADP-ME, and pET-LpR-NADP-ME (see Fig. 1). Two more plasmids (pET-LRL-NADP-ME and pET-RLR-NADP-ME) were constructed by changing only the segment between the cleavage sites for the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI (Fig. 1). The inserts of all the chimerical constructs were sequenced to verify correct swapping of the corresponding fragments and that no mistakes were made due to subcloning procedures. BL21(DE3) E. coli was then transformed with the pET plasmid containing the chimerical NADP-MEs. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Chimerical NADP-ME—The pET-chimeric ME expression vectors contained a His tag sequence and the resulting fusion proteins were purified using a His-Bind column (Novagen). Induction and purification of the fusion proteins were done as previously described for the photosynthetic NADP-ME (10Detarsio E. Gerrard Wheeler M.C. Campos Bermúdez V.A. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13757-13764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and non-photosynthetic NADP-ME (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P. Maurino V.G. Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fusion enzymes were then concentrated on Centricon YM-30 (Amicon) and desalted using Buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0,1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Purified fusion NADP-ME proteins were then incubated with enterokinase (1:100, w/w) in buffer B at 10 °C for 2 h to remove the N terminus encoded by the expression vector. Proteins were further purified by affinity chromatography (Affi-Gel Blue), and eluted with buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 0,1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Eluted enzymes were then concentrated and desalted on Centricon YM-30 (Amicon) using Buffer B. Purified enzymes were stored at –80 °C in Buffer B (with 50% glycerol) for further studies. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1.0-cm path length cell and averaging five repetitive scans between 250 and 200 nm. Typically, 50 μgofC4, non-C4, or chimerical NADP-MEs in phosphate buffer (20 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) were used for each assay. NADP-ME Activity Assays—NADP-ME activity was determined spectrophotometrically as previously described (10Detarsio E. Gerrard Wheeler M.C. Campos Bermúdez V.A. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13757-13764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies were performed by varying the concentration of one of the substrates around its Km while keeping the concentration of the other substrates at saturating levels. All kinetic parameters were calculated at least by triplicate determinations and subjected to non-linear regression. All substrate concentrations reported refer to the free, uncomplexed, reactant concentrations and were calculated considering the dissociation constant of the different complexes formed (Mg2+-NADP or Mg2+-malate). When testing different compounds as possible inhibitors or activators of the enzymatic activity, NADP-ME activity was measured in the presence of 2 or 5 mm of each effector (fumarate, succinate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, glucose-6-P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, or fructose-6-P), and saturating or non-saturating concentrations of malate (typically, 1/5 or 1/10 of the Km, malate value). When analyzing the inhibition of NADP-ME by high malate concentration at pH 7.0, the model that fitted best the kinetic data was in which the free enzyme is capable of binding malate at two different sites, one catalytic and the other allosteric (regulatory). In this kinetic scheme, E symbolizes the enzyme, Mc the malate bound to the catalytic binding site (with dissociation constant Kc), Mr malate bound to the regulatory allosteric site (with dissociation constant Kr), and P the products of the enzymatic reaction. Thus, two different catalytic constants are postulated, namely k1 and k2, to indicate product formation when the allosteric site is empty or occupied, respectively. Considering k2 = φ × k1, the following expression for the initial rate of malate oxidative decarboxylation obtained, v=Vmax[M/Kc+φ/KcKr][1+M/Kc+M/Kr+M2/KcKr](Eq. 2) where v is the activity measured at a specific malate concentration (M); Vmax is the maximum activity; Kc and Kr are the dissociation constants of the catalytic and regulatory site, respectively; and φ is the ratio between k2 and k1. This last value (φ) should be less than 1, as the activity when the allosteric site is occupied is less than when it is empty. When no inhibition by high substrate concentration was found, the kinetic data obtained were fit to typical Michaelis-Menten equations. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed in 8 or 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. The membrane was incubated with affinity purified anti-maize recombinant photosynthetic NADP-ME antibodies (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P. Maurino V.G. Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were located with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma). Native PAGE was performed employing a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide separating gel. Gels were analyzed by Western blotting or assayed for malic enzyme activity as described in Ref. 8Saigo M. Bologna F.P.

Metabolites Tested as Effectors of Maize C4 and Non-C4-NADP-ME—To detect other regulatory differences between maize C4 and non-C4-NADP-ME, in addition to the previously reported malate inhibition at pH 7.0 of the C4 isoform, we analyzed several metabolites as effectors of the activity of these two enzymes. No definitive activation by fumarate or succinate was found for both maize NADP-ME isoforms, although these metabolites were characterized as activators of other MEs. On the other hand, partial inhibition of both isoforms (up to 40%) was found in the case of citrate and α-ketoglutarate, probably due to competition with the substrate malate. Other metabolites tested (glucose-6-P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose-6-P) did not show any significant effect on NADP-ME activity for either of the two isoforms. In this way, the pH-dependent inhibition of C4-NADP-ME by malate represents the major metabolite regulation difference found between maize photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic NADP-ME isoforms. Construction and Expression of Chimerical Maize NADP-ME—To examine the sequence determinants responsible for the structural and kinetic differences between both maize NADP-MEs, we constructed six chimeras of these proteins by interchanging different sequence segments using two conserved restriction sites (BamHI at position 306 and EcoRI at position 749 of the cDNA of maize C4-NADP-ME) (Fig. 1). We will refer to the C4 and non-C4-NADP-ME as L (leaf) and R (root), respectively, considering the tissues where the isoforms are highly expressed. The chimerical proteins were named: LR-NADP-ME, LpR-NADP-ME, RL-NADP-ME, RpL-NADP-ME, LRL-NADP-ME, and RLR-NADP-ME (Fig. 1). All of these chimerical proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity. They presented molecular masses between 62 and 66 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE and reacted with antibodies against maize recombinant C4-NADP-ME (not shown). They also presented NADP-ME activity, so they were kinetically and structurally characterized in the same way as the parental enzymes. To determine whether the construction of the chimerical proteins resulted in a loss of overall structural integrity, CD spectra for all chimerical and parental proteins were compared. In all cases, the CD spectra obtained were superimposable after corrections for protein concentration (not shown). In this way, the structural changes should be minimal, without causing a severe loss of protein secondary structure. Kinetic Characterization of Chimerical NADP-MEs at pH 8.0—Kinetic characterization of chimerical NADP-MEs, L-NADP-ME and R-NADP-ME was performed at pH 8.0 (optimum for the L and R isoforms, Table 1) and pH 7.0 (required for malate inhibition of the C4 isoform, Table 2).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters assayed at pH 8.0 for the recombinant maize C4-NADP-ME (10Detarsio E.

Open table in a new tab The chimerical NADP-MEs analyzed (RL, LR, LpR, RpL, LRL, and RLR) showed less specific activity (kcat) than the L and R isoforms at pH 8.0 (Table 1). The kcat values obtained for RL, RpL, and LpR were between 39 and 58% of the value obtained for the L isoform; whereas LRL and RLR presented considerably lower specific activities, between 2 and 12% of the value for the L isoform (Table 1). However, chimerical protein LR-NADP-ME displayed the lowest kcat value of all the recombinant proteins analyzed (more than 2 orders of magnitude, Table 1). Nevertheless, the KNADP of this chimerical enzyme was more than 2 times lower than that for the non-C4 counterpart (Table 1), indicating that, at least, the binding site for NADP is integral in this chimerical NADP-ME. The catalytic efficiency for the non-C4 and chimerical NADP-MEs when using NADP as substrate ranged from nearly 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than for the C4 counterpart (Table 1). On the other hand, the Kmalate value at pH 8.0 for all the NADP-ME isoforms analyzed was very similar, with the L isoform showing the lower value followed by RpL-NADP-ME (Table 1). No inhibition by high malate concentration (up to 30 mm) was observed for any of the NADP-ME isoforms at pH 8.0 (Fig. 2). Kinetic Characterization of Chimerical NADP-MEs at pH 7.0—Purified NADP-ME from maize green leaves is inhibited by high concentrations of the substrate malate in a pH-dependent way, that is, the inhibition is observed only at pH lower than 8.0 (12Drincovich M.F. Iglesias A.A. Andreo C.S. Physiol. Plant. 1991; 81: 462-466Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This kinetic behavior was also observed when maize photosynthetic NADP-ME was expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli (10Detarsio E. Gerrard Wheeler M.C. Campos Bermúdez V.A. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13757-13764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but was not observed in the case of maize recombinant non-photosynthetic NADP-ME (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P. Maurino V.G. Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To locate the differences in the primary structure of these two enzymes that could account for malate inhibition, the activity of the chimerical NADP-MEs as a function of malate concentration was studied (Fig. 2 and Table 2). First of all, a detailed study of the activity of recombinant L and R isoforms as a function of malate concentration at both pH 7.0 or 8.0 was performed. Fig. 2 clearly shows that inhibition by malate concentrations higher than 0.5 mm is observed for the L isoform at pH 7.0 but not at pH 8.0 (Fig. 2). Data obtained for the L isoform (pH 8.0, L8) and the R isoform (pH 7.0 and 8.0; R7 and R8; Fig. 2) were fit to a typical Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding parameter values indicated in Tables 1 and 2. On the other hand, in the case of the L isoform at pH 7.0 (L7, Fig. 2), the data obtained fitted very well to an equation in which two different binding sites for malate are considered, one catalytic (Kc,malate) and the other allosteric (Kr,malate) (see Model 1 and Equation 1 under “Experimental Procedures”). This second allosteric site decreases the activity of the enzyme when occupied, rendering a partial inhibition of the activity. It is worth mentioning that lower regression fitting values were obtained when kinetic data were fit to other models and equations for inhibition by high substrate concentrations (13Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes.Third Ed. Academic Press Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). Malic enzyme activity as a function of malate concentration at pH 7.0 was assessed for the chimerical NADP-ME LR, LpR, RL, RpL, LRL, and RLR (Fig. 2C) to identify segments in the primary structure implicated in malate inhibition. RL-NADP-ME, RpL-NADP-ME, and LRL-NADP-ME were the only chimerical NADP-MEs analyzed showing inhibition by malate concentrations higher than 0.5 mm at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C). Data obtained fitted very well to the same equation used in the case of the L isoform at pH 7.0 and the kinetic parameters obtained after data fitting were compared with the values obtained for the C4 isoform (Table 2). On the other hand, LR-NADP-ME, LpR-NADP-ME, and RLR-NADP-ME did not show inhibition by high malate concentrations at pH 7.0 (as the R isoform), and the Michaelis-Menten equation was the best-fitting model for the data obtained for these chimeras (Fig. 2C). Table 2 shows a summary of the kinetic parameters obtained at pH 7.0 for the chimerical NADP-MEs, in comparison to the L and R isoforms. When inhibition by high malate concentrations is observed, the data fitted correctly the equation indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” obtaining two different binding constants for malate, one catalytic (Kc,malate) and the other regulatory (Kr,malate). When comparing the kcat, lower values are observed at pH 7.0 versus 8.0 for all the recombinant NADP-MEs, with the exception of RpL-NADP-ME and LRL-NADP-ME (Table 1 versus 2). Nevertheless, the decrease in kcat at pH 7.0 range from 47% (L isoform) to only 16%, as is the case for the R isoform. The Kc,malate at pH 7.0 for the L isoform, RpL-NADP-ME, and LRL-NADP-ME is nearly 1 order of magnitude lower at pH 7.0 than at 8.0, and for the case of RL-NADP-ME, is nearly 3 times lower. However, in the case of the R isoform and all the other chimerical NADP-MEs that are not inhibited by malate, this value is almost invariant when comparing measurements at pH 7.0 versus 8.0. In this way, a correlation between lower Kc,malate values at pH 7.0 than at pH 8.0 and inhibition by high malate concentration is observed (Table 2). With regard to the inhibition by high malate concentrations, the Kr,malate is very similar among the four NADP-MEs that showed inhibition (L isoform, RL-NADP-ME, RpL-NADP-ME, and LRL-NADP-ME). The decrease ratio in the kcat value (φ) is also similar among these isoforms when malate is bound to the enzyme (Table 2). Quaternary Structure of Chimerical NADP-ME from Maize—Previous work in our laboratory showed that recombinant L and R isoforms aggregate as tetramers or dimers, respectively (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P.

Drincovich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13757-13764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The native molecular masses of both proteins were measured by size-exclusion chromatography and correlated with data obtained by native electrophoresis (8Saigo M. Bologna F.P. Maurino V.G. Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subsequently and to determine the factors associated with NADP-ME oligomerization, native activity gels were performed with the chimerical NADP-MEs obtained in the present work. The data obtained indicate that whereas active forms of LR-NADP-ME and RpL-NADP-ME migrate in native electrophoresis as the L isoform (molecular mass consistent with a tetramer); RL-NADP-ME and LpR-NADP-ME migrate as the R isoform (molecular mass consistent with a dimeric state) (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the region located between amino acid residues 102 and 247 of the L isoform (flanked by BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites) is strongly associated with the oligomerization state of maize NADP-ME. In other words those chimerical proteins containing region 102–247 from the L isoform are tetrameric, whereas those carrying the homologous region from the R isoform are dimeric (Fig. 1). To assess this hypothesis, the 145-residue region between BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites was exchanged between the L and R isoforms, obtaining the chimeras LRL-NADP-ME and RLR-NADP-ME. Native electrophoresis of these two proteins indicate that whereas the active form of LRL-NADP-ME migrate as a dimer, the chimera RLR-NADP-ME present an equilibrium between tetrameric and dimeric states (Fig. 3). Because the C4-NADP-ME isoenzyme (L isoform) has evolved from the non-C4-NADP-ME (R isoform), we searched for changes in the primary structure of maize C4-NADP-ME responsible for its C4 properties, allowing it to participate in a highly active metabolism such as photosynthesis. The results obtained analyzing different recombinant chimeras of the maize L and R isoforms allowed us to find key sequence elements associated with the more relevant kinetic and structural differences between these isoforms: inhibition by malate and oligomeric state. All the chimerical NADP-MEs obtained in the present work were functional. Nevertheless, the kcat obtained for LR-NADP-ME at both pH 7.0 and 8.0 was significantly lower than the value obtained for the other chimerical NADP-MEs, including the reciprocal RL-NADP-ME (Tables 1 and 2). However, all the Km values estimated for LR-NADP-ME are in the same range as those of others chimeras (Tables 1 and 2), suggesting that one or more residues are not appropriately located for catalysis in this particular enzyme, although the binding of substrates is not seriously affected. The Allosteric Binding Site for Fumarate and Malate as Activators of Non-plant MEs Are Not Found in Maize NADP-ME—Human mitochondrial NAD(P)-ME can be regulated (activated) allosterically by fumarate, which binds at the dimer interface of this protein (14Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure. 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By site-directed mutagenesis, 4 amino acid residues have been suggested to be involved in binding fumarate at this allosteric site: Arg-67, Arg-91, Glu-59, and Asp-102 (14Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure. 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Hung H.-C. Kuo M.-W. Chang C.-C. Liu C.-Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). With regard to maize C4-NADP-ME, among the 4 residues found to be involved in fumarate activation of human NAD(P)-ME, only Asp-102 is conserved, which is in agreement with the fact that this enzyme is not activated by fumarate at all (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, Ascaris suum NAD-ME is activated by both malate and fumarate, which bind to different binding sites that act synergically (17Karsten W.E. Pais J.E. Rao J. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9712-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

With the therapeutic intention of reactivating latent virus to induce a cure, in this study we assessed the impact of cell synchronizers on HIV gene activation in latently infected U1 cells and investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for such effect. Latently infected U1 cells were treated with 10 drugs including hydroxyurea (HU) and HIV-1 replication monitored using a p24 antigen capture assay. We found that HU was able to induce HIV-1 replication by 5-fold. HU has been used in the clinical treatment of HIV-1-infected patients in combination with didanosine; therefore, we investigated the impact of HU on HIV-1 activation in the presence of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). IL-6 or TNF-α alone induced HIV replication by 18- and ∼500-fold, respectively. Of interest, in the presence of HU, IL-6-mediated HIV-1 activation was enhanced by >90-fold, whereas TNF-α-mediated activation was inhibited by >30%. A reporter gene assay showed that HU and IL-6 synergized to activate HIV promoter activity via the Sp1 binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed increased binding of the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to this region. Western blot analysis showed that HU and IL-6 co-stimulation resulted in increased levels of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. In contrast, treatment with HU plus TNF-α down-regulated the expression of NF-κB. These findings suggest that Sp1/Sp3 is involved in controlling the HU/IL-6-induced reactivation of HIV-1 in latently infected cells.

Lisziewicz J. J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 2000; 14: 45-48PubMed Google Scholar). HU has been reported to possess antiretroviral activity due to its ability to deplete the intracellular dNTP pool, thereby directly inhibiting viral DNA synthesis (2Gao W.Y. Cara A. Gallo R.C.

It is thought that by reducing endogenous levels of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, HU may potentiate the effects of certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors (6Romanelli F. Hoven A.D. Curr. Pharm.

Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The persistence of latent HIV-infected cellular reservoirs despite prolonged treatment with HAART represents the major hurdle to virus eradication. These latently infected cells are a permanent source for virus reactivation and lead to a rebound of the virus load after interruption of HAART (21Pierson T. McArthur J. Siliciano R.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 665-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 22Quivy V. Adam E. Collette Y. Demonte D. Chariot A. Vanhulle C. Berkhout B. Castellano R. de Launoit Y. Burny A. Piette J.

Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 1712-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) or CD4+ T lymphocytes not fully activated, which carry the integrated provirus in a non-replicative state until the activation process is complete (24Marcello A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The reservoir that appears to be the major barrier to eradication is composed of latently infected cells that carry an integrated provirus that is transcriptionally silent (25Chun T.W. Finzi D. Margolick J. Chadwick K. Schwartz D. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 26Chun T.W. Carruth L. Finzi D. Shen X. DiGiuseppe J.A. Taylor H.

The extremely long half-life of these cells combined with a tight control of HIV-1 expression has been reported (24Marcello A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to make the reservoir ideally suited to maintain hidden copies of the virus, which are in turn able to trigger a novel systemic infection upon discontinuation of therapy. At the cellular level, preintegration and postintegration latency have been described in HIV-1 (27McCune J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The U1 promonocytic cell line is one of the most thoroughly characterized models of postintegration latency. The U1 cell line was derived from a population of U937 cells and harbors two copies of integrated proviruses (28Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S.

Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of stimulation, U1 cells maintain a pattern of low viral mRNA expression. Several studies have shown that the relative state of latency in U1 cells is as a result of defective Tat, the HIV transactivating protein (30Cannon P. Kim S.H. Ulich C. Kim S. J.

Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). These agents have been shown to activate HIV-1 expression in U1 cells by affecting distinct steps of the virus life cycle, including NF-κB-dependent transcription in the case of TNF-α and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (33Osborn L.

To further understand the mechanism of HIV gene activation, we investigated the impact of another synchronizer, HU, on HIV-1 gene activation in latently infected U1 cells. We demonstrate here for the first time that HU activates HIV-1 replication in latently infected U1 cells and synergizes with IL-6 to enhance HIV-1 gene reactivation and that binding of the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to the LTR promoter is critical for this synergism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—The promonocytic cell line, U1 (28Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1987; 238: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (Rockville, MD). U1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan UT), 10 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Quality Biologics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). HU was purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant IL-6 and recombinant TNF-α were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN).Plasmid Constructions—The 5′ LTR region of HIV was subcloned upstream of luciferase reporter gene as follows. MluLTR5 (5′-ACGCGTTGGAAGGGCTAATTTGCT) and HindLTR3 (5′-AAGCTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACT) primers were used for amplification of full-length of the 5′ LTR from a cloned proviral pNL4.3 (obtained from M. Martin through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) (38Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified product was purified and cloned into the TOPO TA cloning pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resultant clone, pCRLTR, was then digested with MluI and HindIII, and a 0.6-kbp fragment containing the LTR region was subcloned into the corresponding sites of similarly digested pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resultant clone is named p461. To construct a clone (designated as p470) lacking the sequence upstream of the NF-κB binding site from the full-length of 5′ LTR, pCRLTR was digested with MluI and then an inverted PCR was performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a primer set of MluR (5′-TACGCGTAGCCGAATTCCAGCACAC-3′) and NF-κB(5′-GGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTT-3′). PCR product was purified, treated with T4 kinase (Promega), and then self-ligated using PanVera Takara ligation kit II (Madison, WI). The intended clone was digested with MluI and HindIII, and the 180-bp fragment was subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. Using the same procedure, clones lacking the upstream sequence from Sp1 site (p5006) or TATA box (p5007) were constructed from pCRLTR using primer sets of the MulR and SP1F (5′-GGGCGGGACTGGGGAGTGGCGAG-3′) or MulR and TATAF (5′-CATATAAGCTGCTTTTTGCCTG-3′). To construct a Tat expression plasmid, the full-length of Tat gene including intron region in pNL4.3 was PCR amplified using the primers FTAT/F (5′-ATGGAGCCAGTAGATCCTAG-3′(sense)) and FTAT/R (5′-CTATTCCTTCGGGCCTGTCGGG-3′ (antisense)). A 2585-bp PCR product obtained was cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax TOPO vector (Invitrogen). To delete the intron region in the PCR product (216–2539 nucleotides), an inverted PCR was performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the primer set Tat/R (5′-TGCTTTGATAGAGAAGCTTGATG) and Tat/F (5′-ACCACCTCCCAATCCCGAG-3′). The PCR product was purified and treated with T4 kinase (Promega) and then self-ligated using the PanVera Takara ligation kit II (Madison, WI). The resultant clone named p494 was verified by Western blot to confirm the expression of Tat protein. All the constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.HIV Replication Assays—Latently infected U1 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105/ml. All conditions were performed in 96-well microplates for 4 days at 37 °C. On day 4, cell-free supernatants were collected, and virus replication was measured using a p24 antigen capture assay (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). Each culture was performed in quadruplicate. Results are the means of three independent experiments. For cytokine assays, U1 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105/ml and stimulated with HU (200 μm), IL-6 (15 ng/ml), TNF-α (5 ng/ml), or a combination of HU and IL-6 or HU and TNF-α. Replication assays were carried out as above. HIV-1 replication kinetics was performed as previously described (36Imamichi T. Murphy M.A. Adelsberger J.W. Yang J. Watkins C.M. Berg S.C. Baseler M.W. Lempicki R.A. Guo J. Levin J.G. Lane H.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, U1 cells were cultured at 2.0 × 105/ml in the presence or absence of stimulation. Culture supernatants were collected every day for 4 days, and HIV-1 replication was monitored using the p24 antigen capture assay.Cell Cycle Analysis—U1 cells were treated with 200 μm HU at 37 °C for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described (36Imamichi T. Murphy M.A. Adelsberger J.W. Yang J. Watkins C.M. Berg S.C. Baseler M.W. Lempicki R.A. Guo J. Levin J.G. Lane H.C. J.

The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with DNase-free RNase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 15 min. Propidium iodide was added to the cell suspension, which was then incubated on ice for at least 30 min. The stained cells were analyzed for red fluorescence (FL3) on a Coulter XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter) with doublet discrimination achieved with an amorphous gate based on linear and peak FL3 signal, and the distribution of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was calculated from the resulting DNA histogram with Multicycle AV software, based on a zero order polynomial S-phase model (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Levels of IL-6 and TNF-α production in culture supernatants were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for human IL-6 and human TNF-α (R&D systems), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions.Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted at 48 or 72 h from treated and untreated cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). A total of 30 μg of RNA was loaded per lane and separated on a 1.2% agarose, formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran SuperCharge nylon membrane using the TurboBlotter System (Schleicher & Schuell). After transfer, RNA was cross-linked onto the membrane by UV irradiation. Gene-specific DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using the Prime-It RmT Random Primer labeling kit (Stratagene). The membrane was prehybridized for 30 min and then hybridized with the probe in the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) at 56 °C overnight. After hybridization, the membrane was washed at 56 °C for 20 min under low stringency condition (2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS) and high stringency conditions (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS). Then the membrane was exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MS film at –80 °C for 1–4 h. Ethidium bromide-stained 28 S and 18 S RNAs were used as internal controls for RNA loading. Quantification of the intensity of the bands was done using FujiFilm FLA 5100 phosphorimaging.Transient Transfection Assays—U1 cells were transiently transfected using Transit Transfection Reagent, FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with the HIV-1 LTR luciferase reporter constructs. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 200 μm HU, 15 ng/ml IL-6, or HU plus IL-6 for 48 h. For co-transfection experiments cells were transiently transfected with Tat plasmid (p494) and either p461, p5006, or p5007 reporter constructs and cultured in the presence or absence of HU plus IL-6 for 48 h. Cells were washed, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized by total cellular protein measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from U1 cells treated or untreated with HU (200 μm) IL-6 (15 ng/ml), TNF-α (5 ng/ml), or a combination of HU plus IL-6 or HU plus TNF-α according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motive, Carlsbad, CA), and protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay. Sense and corresponding antisense synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed to form double-stranded oligonucleotides. Sp1 consensus and HIV-specific Sp1 oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). A total of 10 μg of nuclear extract was first incubated at room temperature for 10 min in binding buffer (Promega) in the absence of the probe. A 50-fold excess of cold probe or AP2 oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixture as specific and nonspecific competitor DNAs, respectively. 20,000 cpm of probe was then added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For the supershift assay, polyclonal antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, STAT3, and C/EBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min on ice before the addition of radiolabeled probe. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on native 6% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for 20 min at –80 °C.Western Immunoblot Assays—U1 cells were stimulated with HU (200 μm), IL-6 (15 ng/ml), TNF-α (5 ng/ml), or a combination of HU plus IL-6 or HU plus TNF-α. Cells were cultured at 2.0 × 105 cells/ml for 48 h at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts were obtained as described above, and protein amount were measured by the BCA assay. 30 μg of nuclear protein was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with anti-Sp1, Sp3, p50 NF-κB polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-TFII-I polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) as an internal control for nuclear transcription factors. Primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat or anti-rabbit IgG (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Signals were detected with ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—U1 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105/ml, treated or untreated with 200 μm HU and 15 ng/ml IL-6, and cultured at 37 °C. Total cellular RNAs were isolated at 24 and 48 h using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). After DNase treatment, the RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis system for RT-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Sp1 gene-specific primers used were sense, 5′-CTG GTC ATA CTG TGG GAA ACG C-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGT TGG CAA GAC GGG CAA TG-3′. Sp3 gene-specific primers used were sense, 5′-GGA AAA AGA CTT CGG AGG GTA GC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCA AGG TGG TCA CTT CTC ATA AAG C-3′. β-Actin gene-specific primers were used as the internal control. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C), then 7 min at 72 °C. PCR-generated fragments were verified on 1.2% agarose gel. The PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequence.Real-time Quantitative PCR—As above, U1 cells were mock-treated or treated with HU and IL-6, and total RNAs were extracted after 24 and 48 h. RNAs were DNase-treated and reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) employing a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The oligonucleotide primers used for the detection of Sp1, Sp3, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from TaqMan gene amplification assays (Applied Biosystems). In each instance the amount of real-time quantitative PCR product for the genes of interest (Sp1 and Sp3) was normalized to the amount of the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the same sample.RESULTSHU Activates HIV-1 Replication in the Chronically Infected Promonocytic Cell Line, U1—U1 cells, an HIV-1 latently infected cell line, harbors two integrated provirus DNA copies (28Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1987; 238: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 29Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J. Poli G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of stimulation with certain stimulants, culturing of U1 cells leads to little virus expression. To investigate the molecular process that leads to HIV-1 reactivation, U1 cells were treated with 10 known drugs (actinomycin D, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, butyrolactone, trichostatin A, paclitaxel, dexamethasone, acyclovir, tunicamycin, rapamycin, or HU) for 7 days. HIV-1 replication was monitored by measuring p24 antigen in the cell culture supernatant. Of the drugs tested, only actinomycin D and HU induced HIV-1 activation by 5–7-fold (Fig. 1A). Because HU has been used in clinical treatment of HIV-infected patients in combination with ddI, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, we further investigated in detail the molecular mechanisms of HU-induced HIV-1 reactivation in U1 cells. U1 cells were mock-treated or treated with increasing concentrations of HU (0. 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 μm) and assayed for p24 antigen in culture supernatant after 4 days of culture. Results presented in Fig. 1B showed that HU induced HIV reactivation in dose-dependent manner. At 200 μm, HU enhanced the reactivation by 7-fold compared with control. Concentration of HU greater than 800 μm did not induce the reactivation (data not shown). This was due to cytotoxicity. Because the highest increase in replication was observed at 200 μm HU, this concentration was, therefore, used in all stimulations with HU in the present study. It is known that HU is able to induce cell cycle arrest. To determine whether HU induced an arrest in U1 cells, cell cycle analysis was performed. U1 cells were treated or untreated with HU (200 μm), cultured for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h, and subjected to the analysis. Our data showed an overall increase in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and no arrest at the G1 phase (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2HU did not induce cell cycle arrest in U1 cells. U1 cells were cultured for 24 h (A), 48 h (B), 72 h (C), or 96 h (D) in the absence or presence of 200 μm HU. The cell cycle analysis was studied by propidium iodide staining and evaluated by flow cytometry. The left peaks constitute cells in G0/G1, the right peaks constitute cells in G2/M, and cells in S phase are between the G0/G1 and G2/M peaks. The percentages of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle phases were calculated from the resulting DNA histogram by using Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HU Enhances IL-6-mediated HIV-1 Activation, Suppresses TNF-α—Several proinflammatory cytokines, for example IL-6 and TNF-α, induce HIV-1 activation in U1 cells (28Folks T.M.

Deficits in PDX-1 expression result in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. We previously found that the glucose-responsive transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) activates the insulin promoter in part by increasing expression levels of PDX-1. We now report that Egr-1 binds and activates multiple regulatory sites within the pdx-1 promoter. We identified consensus Egr-1 recognition sequences within proximal and distal regions of the mouse pdx-1 promoter and demonstrated specific binding of Egr-1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Overexpression of Egr-1 increased transcriptional activation of the –4500 proximal pdx-1 promoter and of the highly conserved regulatory Areas I, II, and III. Mutagenesis of a specific Egr-1 binding site within Area III substantially decreased Egr-1-mediated activation. Egr-1 increased the transcriptional activation of Areas I and II, despite the absence of Egr-1 recognition sequences within this promoter segment, suggesting that Egr-1 also can regulate the pdx-1 promoter indirectly. Egr-1 increased, and a dominant-negative Egr-1 mutant repressed, the transcriptional activation of distal pdx-1 promoter sequences. Mutagenesis of a specific Egr-1 binding site within regulatory Area IV reduced basal and Egr-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Our data indicate that Egr-1 regulates expression of PDX-1 in pancreatic β-cells by both direct and indirect activation of the pdx-1 promoter. We propose that Egr-1 expression levels may act as a sensor in pancreatic β-cells to translate extracellular signals into changes in PDX-1 expression levels and pancreatic β-cell function.

We recently demonstrated that early growth response-1 (Egr-1), a zinc finger transcription factor that also is known as zif268, NGFI-A, Krox24, and TIS8, regulates PDX-1 expression levels in clonal pancreatic β-cells (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As an immediate early response gene, pulses of increased Egr-1 expression levels can be rapidly induced by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and nutrients (32Thiel G. Cibelli G. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 193: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells Egr-1 expression levels are known to be regulated by changes in extracellular glucose, membrane depolarization, and intracellular cAMP and calcium levels (33Frodin M. Sekine N.

Reduction of Egr-1 expression in insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells decreases insulin mRNA expression (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and cellular proliferation (36Garnett K.E. Chapman P. Chambers J.A. Waddell I.D. Boam D.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 35: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In our studies of Egr-1-mediated regulation of insulin production in β-cells, we found that Egr-1 positively regulated the transcriptional activation of the rat insulin I promoter. Egr-1 activated the insulin promoter in part via the glucose-responsive A boxes that serve as PDX-1 recognition sites. Interestingly, the overexpression of Egr-1 in INS-1 cells increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of PDX-1. Thus, we proposed that Egr-1 regulates insulin gene transcription through the activation of PDX-1 expression (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In these studies, we have examined mechanisms by which Egr-1 regulates the expression of PDX-1 in pancreatic β-cells. Our results indicate that changes in Egr-1 expression levels influence the transcriptional activation of both proximal and distal regulatory segments of the mouse pdx-1 promoter. We have identified Egr-1 recognition sites within the pdx-1 promoter that contribute to its responsiveness to regulation by Egr-1. We propose that Egr-1 provides a route by which extracellular signals modify the transcriptional activation of the pdx-1 promoter to regulate PDX-1 expression levels and pancreatic β-cell function. Screening Analysis of Mouse pdx-1 Promoter Sequences for Egr-1 Consensus Binding Sites—Approximately 10 kb of mouse pdx-1 promoter sequences available in GenBank™ public databases were analyzed with GENETYX-MAC (10.1) software (Genetyx, Tokyo, Japan) and screened for consensus nonameric Egr-1 recognition sites as defined by Swirnoff and Milbrandt (37Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Sequences of potential Egr-1 recognition sites were confirmed by automated sequencing analysis of sense and antisense strands of corresponding regions of mouse genomic DNA amplified by PCR. Plasmids—The plasmids pcDNA3/Egr-1 and pcDNA3/DN-Egr-1 were constructed as previously reported (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Chapman N.R. Perkins N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4719-4725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 4500 WT/luc plasmid consists of –4531 bp of the proximal mouse pdx-1 promoter cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter in the vector pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) and was previously designated –4.6 IDX-pGL3 (39Thomas M.K. Lee J.H. Rastalsky N. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The plasmid Area 123 WT/luc spans nucleotides –2821 to –1563 to include regulatory Areas I, II, and III of the mouse pdx-1 promoter. Area 123 WT/luc was constructed by cloning a product of PCR amplification from the 4500 WT/luc plasmid template generated with the primers 5′-AGATCTAGTCCAAACAGCCTTTGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTGGGATCACCGAGGGAACTCT-3′ into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3/basic. The plasmid Area 12 WT/luc spans nucleotides –2821 to –1885 to include regulatory Areas I and II of the mouse pdx-1 promoter. Area 12 WT/luc was constructed by cloning a product of PCR amplification from the 4500 WT/luc plasmid template generated with the primers 5′-AGATCTAGTCCAAACAGCCTTTGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTGGGACAAAGATAGGGACCTT-3′ into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3/basic. The plasmid Area 3 WT/luc spans nucleotides –1898 to –1563 to include regulatory Area III of the mouse pdx-1 promoter. Area 3 WT/luc was constructed by cloning a product of PCR amplification from the 4500 WT/luc plasmid template generated with the primers 5′-AGATCTTTGTCCCAAGTCTCGCTCA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTGGGATCACCGAGGGAACTCT-3′ into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3/basic. The plasmid Area 4 WT/luc spans nucleotides –6529 to –6047 to include regulatory Area IV of the mouse pdx-1 promoter. Area 4 WT/luc was constructed by first cloning a product of PCR amplification from FVB mouse genomic DNA template generated with the primers 5′-CTCGAGTCTAGAGAGTTCTTCTGTTTGCTAGATAAG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCAGCTTCCTTTAAAGGTAAATGAATT-3′ into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen), subsequent excision of the promoter segment with XhoI and Hind III, and cloning into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3/basic. The plasmids 4500 mut/luc, Area 123 mut/luc, Area 3 mut/luc, and Area 4 mut/luc were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of Egr-1 recognition sites within 4500 WT/luc, Area 123 WT/luc, Area 3 WT/luc, and Area 4 WT/luc constructs, respectively, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were as follows: 4500 mut/luc, Area 123 mut/luc, and Area 3 mut/luc, 5′-CTTGCCGCTGATCCAAACCAACCCTCGGGCCCTTT-3′ and 5-AAAGGGCCCGAGGGTTGGTTTGGATCAGCGGCAAG-3′; and Area 4 mut/luc, 5′-TGCCCTTTACTCAGGAGCCCCAGAACAGAAAGTAAATAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTATTTACTTTCTGTTCTGGGGCTCCTGAGTAAAGGGCA-3′ (mutations underlined). All constructs generated by cloning and mutagenesis experiments were confirmed by automated sequencing analyses. Cell Culture and Transfections—Rat INS-1 cells (gift of C. Wollheim, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland) and mouse MIN6 cells (gift of J. Miyazaki, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan) were cultured as previously reported (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). CMV-rtTA/Tet-Egr-1 INS-1 stable cell lines were generated and maintained under selection with G418 and hygromycin (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For induction of Egr-1 expression, CMV-rtTA/Tet-Egr-1 INS-1 cells were grown in vehicle or 1000 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h prior to harvest. Transfections were conducted with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were harvested 48 or 72 h after transfection, and luciferase activities within cell lysates were measured in replicate samples and normalized by cellular protein content (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Data from transfections were analyzed by Student’s t tests or by one-way analysis of variance for multiple group comparisons. Differences between samples of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—EMSAs were conducted according to previously described methods (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Double-stranded 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes were either incubated with nuclear extracts prepared according to the method of Schreiber (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) from CMV-rtTA/Tet-Egr-1 INS-1 stable cells pretreated with doxycycline or vehicle or incubated with in vitro translated proteins prepared from pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/Egr-1. Binding reactions were conducted in a buffer composed of polydeoxyinosinic-polydeoxycytidylic acid (Sigma), 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 4.7 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ZnSO4, 0.85 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min. In some reactions, proteins were preincubated with anti-Egr-1 antibody (Ab1, rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1 (sc110 (588)); Ab2, rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1 (sc189 (C-19)), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or excess unlabeled wild-type or mutant double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor probes for 20 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE and autoradiography. Oligonucleotide probe sequences (sense strands) were as follows: WT probe 1, 5′-TGCCCTTTACTCAGGAGTGGGAGAACAGAAAGT-3′; mut probe 1, 5′-TGCCCTTTACTCAGGAGCCCCAGAACAGAAAGT-3′; WT probe 2, 5′-CCTTGCGCTGATCCACCCCCACCCTCGGGCCCTTT-3′; mut probe 2, 5′-CCTTGCCGCTGATCCAAACCAACCCTCGGGCCCTTT-3′; WT probe 3, 5′-GGGGTCTATCCCTAAGGGGGTGACCAGGTGAAGGA-3′; and mut probe 3, 5′-GGGGTCTATCCCTAATGGTTGACCAGGTGAAGGA-3′ (mutations underlined). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assays were conducted with previously reported methods (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using CHIP-IT kits from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and genomic DNA was purified and sheared by sonication. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), and complexes were precipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1(C-19) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), negative control normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or positive control rabbit polyclonal anti-PDX-1 antiserum (gift from J. Habener, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Primer pairs used for PCR amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA were as follows: mouse Area I, 5′-CCAGTATCAGGGAGGACTAT-3′ (nt –2712 to –2692) and 5′-CTGAGATACCCAGCCATTAG-3′ (nt –2567 to nt –2558); mouse Area III, 5′-TGGCCACTAGGTAGATTATCTGTG-3′(nt –1851 to –1828) and 5′-TGCCTCAATGAGTCCATTGTTCAG-3′ (nt –1720 to –1697); mouse Area IV, 5′-GTCGCTAGCTGGTCTGTGACAGAT-3′ (nt –6331 to –6308) and 5′-ACTGGTTAACAACATGGGGCTAAC-3′ (nt –6102 to –6079); rat Area IV, 5′-CTTAGCTGGTCAGTGACAGA-3′ (nt –5990 to –5971) and 5′-GGTTAACAACATCAGGCTGA-3′ (nt –5826 to –5807). Products were generated by PCR with a melting step of 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30–35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), terminal extension at 72 C for 3 min and subsequent separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA Expression Analyses—mRNA expression levels for selected transcriptional regulators of the pdx-1 promoter were determined by quantitative real-time TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR on an ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detection system, using total RNA derived from CMV-rtTA/Tet-Egr-1 INS-1 stable cell lines treated with 0–1000 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h prior to harvest. Replicate samples were analyzed, and expression levels were normalized to cyclophilin expression. Student’s t tests were employed to detect significant differences in expression levels. Identification of Egr-1 Recognition Sequences within Proximal and Distal Regions of the Mouse pdx-1 Promoter—We previously discovered that PDX-1 mRNA expression levels were increased in clonal pancreatic β (INS-1)-cells in response to increasing Egr-1 expression levels (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Egr-1 regulates the pdx-1 promoter. We analyzed ∼10 kb of upstream mouse pdx-1 promoter sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers AC127549, AC115847, AF192495, and AF334615) to identify sequence elements similar to nonameric consensus Egr-1 recognition sites or their reverse complements as defined by Swirnoff and Milbrandt (Fig. 1A) (37Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). From this analysis we identified three potential Egr-1 binding sites within highly conserved regulatory regions of the mouse pdx-1 promoter, one in the distal region within regulatory Area IV (–6529 to –6047 bp) and two within the proximal region encompassing regulatory Areas I, II, and III (–2761 to –1600 bp) (Fig. 1B). Egr-1 Binds a Consensus Sequence within Regulatory Area III of the Mouse pdx-1 Promoter—To evaluate whether any of these potential Egr-1 recognition sites were of functional significance, we first examined the sites identified within the proximal region of the pdx-1 promoter. In DNA binding assays, in vitro translated Egr-1 bound to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (Probe 2) that spanned nucleotides –1817 to –1782 within regulatory Area III of the mouse pdx-1 promoter and included the sequence 5′-CACCCCCAC-3′ (Fig. 2A, lane 3 as compared with lane 2). Preincubation of in vitro translated Egr-1 with anti-Egr-1 antibodies attenuated specific Egr-1 binding to this site (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 9 as compared with lane 3). The specificity of the Egr-1 recognition sequence was demonstrated by the failure of Egr-1 to bind to a radiolabeled mutant probe 2 with the nonameric sequence 5′-CAAACCAAC-3′ (mutations underlined, Fig. 2A, lane 12 as compared with lane 3). The addition of excess unlabeled wild-type (Fig. 2A, lane 5 as compared with lane 3), but not mutant (Fig. 2A, lane 7 as compared with lane 3), probe reduced binding of Egr-1 to the radiolabeled probe 2 in competition assays. We employed a cellular model for the inducible overexpression of Egr-1 that we previously established, stable CMV-rtTA/Tet-Egr-1 INS-1 cells in which the administration of doxycycline increases Egr-1 expression (31Eto K. Kaur V. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), to prepare nuclear extracts with basal or enhanced Egr-1 expression levels. Nuclear proteins derived from CMV-rtTA/Tet-Egr-1 INS-1 cells bound radiolabeled probe 2 in DNA binding assays in a doxycycline-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, lane 3 as compared with lane 2), and specific Egr-1 protein-DNA complexes were identified by attenuation of binding by preincubation with anti-Egr-1 antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 9 as compared with lane 3). These complexes were not observed in DNA binding assays conducted with radiolabeled mutant probe 2 (Fig. 2B, lane 12 as compared with lane 3). In contrast, we did not observe evidence for direct binding of in vit"

Here we expressed rat SNAT3 in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and reinvestigated its transport modes using two-electrode voltage clamp and pH-sensitive microelectrodes. In addition to the established coupled Na+-glutamine-cotransport/H+ antiport, we found that there are three conductances associated with SNAT3, two dependent and one independent of the amino acid substrate. The glutamine-dependent conductance is carried by cations at pH 7.4, whereas at pH 8.4 the inward currents are still dependent on the presence of external Na+ but are carried by H+. Mutation of threonine 380 to alanine abolishes the cation conductance but leaves the proton conductance intact. Under Na+-free conditions, where the substrate-dependent conductance is suppressed, a substrate-independent, outwardly rectifying current becomes apparent at pH 8.4 that is carried by K+ and H+. In addition, we identified a glutamine-dependent uncoupled Na+/H+ exchange activity that becomes apparent upon removal of Na+ in the presence of glutamine. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in addition to coupled transport, SNAT3 mediates four modes of uncoupled ion movement across the membrane.

The activity of ion-coupled membrane transporters can be associated with currents that de- or hyperpolarize the cell membrane. These currents may be due to electrogenic transport stoichiometry and/or to a non-stoichiometrical ion conductance (1Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Transport-associated ion conductances have been identified in a number of transporters but have been particularly well studied in several neurotransmitter transporters (2Blakely R.D. Defelice L.J.

The currents associated with glutamate transporters of the SLC1 family have two components, a current elicited by the thermodynamically coupled cotransport of 3Na+ and 1H+ into the cell during glutamate uptake and an uncoupled conductance, which is carried by anions (7Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The ratio between uncoupled and coupled current varies between the different glutamate transporter isoforms (8Ryan R.M. Vandenberg R.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2005; 32: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Substrate-induced anion currents are also observed for the ASC-type neutral amino acid transporters, which are sequence related to the glutamate transporters (9Broer A. Wagner C. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 705-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these conductances has not been clarified but could be significant for EAAT4, which shows little transport but a high conductance (11Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance has been better documented for a chloride conductance associated with the dopamine transporter (12Ingram S.L. Prasad B.M. Amara S.G. Nat.

Interestingly, transport-associated conductances have also been observed in electroneutral transporters that do not carry out net charge movement (3Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J.

Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The serotonin transporter, for example, has several conductance states although its transport cycle involves the cotransport of 1Na+, 1Cl-, and the antiport of 1K+ with each serotonin(+) molecule. Accordingly, the uptake of serotonin is unaffected by the membrane potential, but substrate application to oocytes expressing the rat 5-HT transporter results in significant inward currents (3Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Very similar observations were made in the case of the glutamine transporter SNAT3. Uptake of glutamine is coupled to the cotransport of 1Na+ and the antiport of 1H+ and hence is unaffected by changes of the membrane potential (15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H.

Initially, the transporter was thought to be electrogenic (17Fei Y.J. Sugawara M. Nakanishi T. Huang W. Wang H. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23707-23717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but this was refuted by two subsequent studies (14Chaudhry F.A. Krizaj D. Larsson P. Reimer R.J.

Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the currents showed that the reversal potential of the substrate-induced currents varies with pH, and as a result a proton conductance was proposed by Chaudhry et al. (14Chaudhry F.A. Krizaj D. Larsson P. Reimer R.J. Wreden C. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D. Kavanaugh M. Edwards R.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7041-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Broer et al. (15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), by contrast, did not detect such a shift and proposed a slippage mechanism in the transporter or the activation of oocyte endogenous nonspecific ion channels. To resolve these discrepancies, we reinvestigated ion transport activities associated with SNAT3 expression in oocytes in more detail. Our results suggest the presence of two substrate-induced conductances, one of which is carried by cations and the other by protons. In addition, we identified a substrate-independent cation conductance and a Na+/H+ exchange activity. Oocytes and Injections—Xenopus laevis oocytes (stages V and VI) were isolated by collagenase treatment as described (18Broer S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 227: 245-258PubMed Google Scholar) and allowed to recover overnight. The surgical removal of ovarian tissue was performed under anesthesia (20-min immersion in 1% MS-222) and was approved by the animal ethics committee of the University of Kaiserslautern. Rat SNAT3 was used as described previously (15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Oocytes were microinjected with 5–20 nl of rSNAT3 cRNA in water at a concentration of 1 μg/μl by using a microinjection device (WPI, Sarasota, Fl) or remained uninjected in the controls. pH Measurements with Microelectrodes—Double-barrelled pH-sensitive microelectrodes to measure intracellular pH (pHi) 3The abbreviation used is: pHi, intracellular pH. and membrane potential in frog oocytes were prepared as previously described (19Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the electrodes were pulled in two stages and silanized by filling a drop of 5% tri-N-butylchlorosilane in 99.9% pure carbon tetrachloride into the prospective ion-selective barrel and then baking the pipette on a hot plate at 475 °C for 4.5–5 min. For pH-selective microelectrodes a small amount of H+-ionophore mixture (Fluka 95291) was backfilled into the tip of the silanized barrel and the remainder filled with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The reference barrel was filled with 2 m potassium acetate. Electrodes were accepted for experiments if their response exceeded 50 mV/unit change in pH and if they reacted faster in the bath during calibration before and after each experiment than the fastest pHi changes recorded upon glutamine addition. On average, electrodes responded with a change of 54 mV to a change in pH by one unit. The recording arrangement was the same as described previously (20Munsch T. Deitmer J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1994; 474: 43-53Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The central and the reference barrels were connected by chlorided silver wires to the headstages of an electrometer amplifier. As described previously (21Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) optimal pH changes were detected when the electrode was located near the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This was achieved by carefully rotating the oocyte with the impaled electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C). Only oocytes with a membrane potential <-25 mV were used for experiments. Electrophysiological Recording—A borosilicate glass capillary, 1.5 mm in diameter, was pulled to a micropipette and backfilled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of the electrode measured in oocyte saline was ∼1 mΩ. For voltage clamp recordings, both electrodes were connected to the head stages of an Axo-clamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The experimental bath was grounded with a chloride-treated silver wire coated by agar dissolved in oocyte saline. Oocytes were clamped at -40 mV unless indicated otherwise. To measure ion conductances associated with SNAT3 expression, short voltage jumps were applied during recordings in increments of 20 mV ranging from -100 to + 20 mV. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The following primers were used (only sense primers shown, amino acid changing mutation in uppercase): N76H, ttc aat ctc agc Cac gcc atc atg ggc; G210A, atg cga cag ctt gCc tac ctg ggc tac; S215A, tac ctg ggc tac Gcc agt ggc ttc tct; H300Q, gcc ttt gtc tgc caA cct gag gtg ctg; T343A, ttc ggc tac ctc Gcc ttc tat gac ggg; R370Q, atc ttg tgt gtg cAG gtg gcc gtg ctg; and T380A, gcg gtc aca ctt Gcg gtt ccg atc gtt. Surface Biotinylation—To determine plasma membrane expression, 15 oocytes were washed three times with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. Subsequently, oocytes were incubated in 0.5 ml of sulfo-NHS-lc-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The reagent was removed by washing oocytes four times with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. Subsequently, oocytes were lysed by incubation in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at top speed in a tabletop centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with 30 μl of streptavidin-coated agarose particles (Pierce). The suspension was incubated at 4 °C overnight with slight agitation. Agarose particles were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and the pellet subsequently resuspended in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and an aliquot of 30 μl loaded on the gel. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. SNAT3 was detected using an anti-peptide antibody at a 1:1000 dilution that was raised against a rat SNAT3 peptide (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions using the provided secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—The figures display typical recordings from individual oocytes combined with a statistical analysis of current-voltage relationships derived from these recordings. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean. The number of oocytes (n) from separate experiments used to calculate the means is given in the figure legends. Statistical differences were tested using Student's t test in Origin 7.0. Means were defined as statistically different at an error probability of *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; or ***, p < 0.005. Coupled Transport of Na+ and H+ Together with Glutamine— When expressed in X. laevis oocytes, SNAT3 carries out an electroneutral transport of glutamine, asparagine, and histidine coupled to the cotransport of 1Na+ and an antiport of 1H+ (15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Accordingly, superfusion of oocytes with glutamine caused a concentration-dependent alkalinization of the oocyte cytosol (Fig. 1, A, lower trace, and D). Ion Conductances Linked to SNAT3 Activity—In addition, a cation conductance 4Throughout this report we use the term “transport” for the coupled transport process involving amino acid substrate, Na+ and H+. To avoid confusion, we refer to the uncoupled unidirectional movement of ions as “conductances,” although technically these are transport processes as well. Uncoupled Na+/H+ exchange refers to an antiport activity that does not affect glutamine transport by SNAT3 but is only visible during glutamine transport. is observed, the nature of which has been discussed controversially (14Chaudhry F.A. Krizaj D. Larsson P. Reimer R.J. Wreden C. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D. Kavanaugh M. Edwards R.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7041-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To measure coupled transport and conductance in parallel, we recorded the intracellular pH and the conductance at the same time (Fig. 1). Oocytes were held at -40 mV, which is close to the resting potential. As a result, holding currents were close to 0 nA in the absence of substrate. The conductance was measured by applying short voltage jumps in increments of 20 mV from -100 to + 20 mV during the recordings (Fig. 1A, upper trace). The coupled transport was measured by recording intracellular pH (lower trace). Similar to the alkalinization, the transport-associated conductance increased with increasing glutamine concentrations (Fig. 1, B and E). Conductance and pH changes, however, showed a different substrate specificity. At a concentration of 5 mm, glutamine caused the largest pH changes, followed by histidine and asparagine (Fig. 1, A and D). The conductance, by contrast, followed the order asparagine (2.2 μS) >glutamine (1.0 μS) >histidine (0.7 μS) (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). This result suggests that the velocity of coupled transport is governed by different principles than the ion conductance. Noninjected oocytes showed a basic conductance that was not affected by addition of glutamine (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the conductance and alkalinization is associated with SNAT3 expression. Ion Dependence of the Transport-associated Conductance—To identify the ion species mediating the SNAT3-associated ion conductance, we determined the reversal potential at different pH (Fig. 3, A and B). At a concentration of 10 mm glutamine, the conductance increased from 5.5 to 7.5 and 15 μS, when the pH was raised from 6.4 to 7.4 and 8.4, respectively. This increase most likely reflects the increase of the transport velocity from pH 6.4 to 8.4 (15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The reversal potential of the conductance changed from -14.8 to -9.2 and to -30.7 mV when the extracellular pH was changed from 6.4 to 7.4 and 8.4, respectively. For a conductance to be carried entirely by protons a reversal potential of ∼0 mV would be expected at pH 7.4 (pHi ≅ pHo), moving to -60 mV at pH 8.4 and to +60 mV at pH 6.4. The results therefore suggest that protons contribute to the conductance above pH 7.4 but not at acidic pH. The presence of a proton conductance at pH 8.4 was further supported by the observation that the reversal potential of the glutamine-induced conductance was not affected by changes of the Na+ concentration (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, the magnitude of the currents was not affected by changes of the Na+ concentration, although the velocity of substrate-dependent transport depends on the Na+ concentration. At pH 7.4, by contrast, a significant change of the reversal potential was observed at different Na+ concentrations, and the amplitude of the conductance depended on the Na+ concentration (Fig. 4, A and C). The observed changes were smaller than expected for a Na+-selective conductance and also the reversal potential was more negative than expected for a Na+ conductance, suggesting that the conductance is nonspecific for cations. At pH 6.4 and reduced Na+ concentrations, currents were too small to be evaluated.FIGURE 4Sodium dependence of SNAT3-associated conductance at different external pH. A, typical recording of the current and intracellular pH associated with activating SNAT3 by 10 mm glutamine at different external Na+ concentrations (85, 28.5, and 8.5 mm) and at external pH 7.4 and 8.4. Current-voltage relationships were measured by applying voltage jumps in increments of 20 mV from -100 to +20 mV at different stages of the recording; in the intervening periods oocytes were held at -40 mV. B and C, evaluation of current-voltage relationships at different external Na+ concentrations of glutamine-activated currents at pH 8.4 (B, n = 8) and at pH 7.4 (C, n = 8). Note the shift in reversal potential (Erev) of the currents at pH 7.4, but not at pH 8.4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the hallmarks of SNAT3 is its ability to mediate transport when Na+ ions are replaced by Li+ ions (16Chaudhry F.A.

A. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed significant alkalinization during superfusion of SNAT3-expressing oocytes with glutamine in Na+-free LiCl buffer (Fig. 5). The glutamine-induced conductance was also observed in LiCl buffer. Upon replacing NaCl by LiCl, the reversal potential changed from -5.6 to +21.4 mV at pH 7.4, suggesting that Li+ can permeate the conductance pathway (Fig. 5B). At pH 8.4, by contrast, the reversal potential remained unaltered at ∼-30 mV in the presence of both cations (Fig. 5C). Substrate-independent SNAT3-associated Conductance— Glutamine transport via SNAT3 strongly increases with pH due to an allosteric proton binding site on the transporter (15Broer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Broer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As pointed out above, the transport-associated conductance also increases with pH. In the absence of substrate, by contrast, the conductance appeared to be pH independent (Fig. 6A). Removal of Na+ in the absence of substrate, in addition, revealed a substrate-independent conductance that increased with pH (Fig. 6B). Similar to the substrate-induced conductance, the current was not carried by Cl-, because it remained unaltered when Cl- was replaced by gluconate- (Fig. 6C). Addition of glutamine in the absence of Na+ did not change the conductance, suggesting that it is induced by the dissociation of Na+ from the transporter. Analysis of the voltage dependence of this conductance showed that it mediates outward rectifying currents at depolarized voltages with a reversal potential of about -60 mV in the absence of Cl- and Na+ (Fig. 6D). When currents at pH 7.4 were subtracted from the currents at pH 8.4, the reversal potential moved to -80 mV (Fig. 6E). Native oocytes showed only a small conductance that hardly reacted to changes of the pH upon removal of Na+ or addition of glutamine (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that the substrate-independent conductance observed at high pH was not caused by an oocyte endogenous ion channel, unless it is upregulated by expression of the transporter. A reversal potential in the range of -60 to -80 mV is consistent with the presence of a potassium-selective channel (24Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 441-470Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, the reversal potential changed from -66 to -49 and -41 mV when the K+ concentration was changed from 2.5 mm to 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 7A). Thus, it appears that SNAT3-expressing oocytes show a potassium conductance that under physiological conditions is suppressed by the presence of Na+. Non-injected oocytes displayed a similar conductance, albeit at lower magnitude (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Substrate-independent current of SNAT3-expressing oocytes is partly carried by potassium. Current-voltage relationships of the substrate-independent current in the absence of Na+ in SNAT3-expressing oocytes (A, n = 6) and in H2O-injected oocytes (B, n = 4) at different external K+ concentrations (2.5, 10, 20 mm). All measurements were made in the absence of Na+ comparing conductance at pH 7.4 and 8.4. The current-voltage relationships were measured by applying voltage jumps in increments of 20 mV from -100 to +20 mV at different stages of the recording; in the intervening periods oocytes were held at -40 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sodium-Hydrogen Exchange Activity—Removal of Na+ in the absence of glutamine resulted in a slow and negligible acidification of the oocyte cytosol, suggesting that endogenous substrate concentrations are too low to sustain reverse operation of SNAT3 (Fig. 8A). After preloading of oocytes with glutamine, however, removal of Na+ resulted in a fast and long-lasting acidification well beyond the resting pHi (Fig. 8A). Release of the preloaded glutamine should bring the pH back to its resting value but not any further, because only very slow compensatory proton movements are exerted by oocyte endogenous regulatory mechanisms (21Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). No additional currents are observed upon removal of Na+ in the presence of glutamine (pH 7.4), excluding electrogenic influx of protons through the SNAT3-associated conductance (Fig. 8B, open circles). The acidification overshoot observed here suggests the presence of an electroneutral Na+/H+ exchanger activity that is activated either by elevated intracellular levels of glutamine or by an alkaline cytosolic pH. Once activated, the Na+/H+ exchanger remained active even after removal of glutamine, resulting in a shift of the resting pH of the oocyte. Re-addition of external Na+ in the presence of glutamine returned the cytosolic pH to the value observed upon the first addition of glutamine (Fig. 8A). Subsequent removal of glutamine induced a similar intracellular acidification as the removal of external Na+. A significant steady-state conductance increase was, however, only recorded in the presence of both glutamine and Na+ at pHo 7.4 (Fig. 8A at points b and d and Fig. 8B). Glutamine induced significantly larger changes of the intracellular pH than equivalent concentrations of asparagine (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether this difference results from a lack of uncoupled Na+/H+ exchange activity, we repeated this protocol also with asparagine as the substrate for SNAT3. In this experiment we compared the pHi changes when external Na+ was removed in the presence of glutamine or asparagine (Fig. 8, C and D). As shown, the cytosol acidified much faster and to a lower pH value in the presence of glutamine than in the presence of asparagine (Fig. 8C, lower trace). The rate of H+ change induced by asparagine was ∼40% of that induced by glutamine, being 8.8 ± 1.5 nm H+/min and 23.1 ± 2.8 nm H+/min, respectively (n = 8; p < 0.001; Fig. 8D). Removing asparagine resulted in a similarly low rate of cytosolic acidification of 5.5 ± 1.0 nm H+/min as observed upon removal of Na+ in the presence of asparagine. As shown before, the conductance increase in asparagine was larger than in glutamine and was only evident in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 8C, upper trace). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To identify the molecular basis of the ion conductances, we tried to identify critical residues for this function. SNAT3 belongs to the SLC38 family of system A and N transporters, which are all Na+-coupled transporters (25Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pflugers Archive Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The SLC38 family is further related to the SLC36 family of proton amino acid transporters (26Boll M. Daniel H. Gasnier B. Pflugers Archive Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and to the vesicular GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter (SLC32), which is a proton exchanger (27Gasnier B. Pflugers Archive Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To identify residues critical for Na+ binding in SNAT3, we identified residues that are conserved in the SLC36 family, but not in the proton-dependent transporters of the SLC32 and SLC38 families. We further looked for residues"
https://openalex.org/W2074897214,"Elf3 is an epithelially restricted member of the ETS transcription factor family, which is involved in a wide range of normal cellular processes. Elf3 is also aberrantly expressed in several cancers, including breast cancer. To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which Elf3 regulates these processes, we created a large series of Elf3 mutant proteins with specific domains deleted or targeted by point mutations. The modified forms of Elf3 were used to analyze the contribution of each domain to DNA binding and the activation of gene expression. Our work demonstrates that three regions of Elf3, in addition to its DNA binding domain (ETS domain), influence Elf3 binding to DNA, including the transactivation domain that behaves as an autoinhibitory domain. Interestingly, disruption of the transactivation domain relieves the autoinhibition of Elf3 and enhances Elf3 binding to DNA. On the basis of these studies, we suggest a model for autoinhibition of Elf3 involving intramolecular interactions. Importantly, this model is consistent with our finding that the N-terminal region of Elf3, which contains the transactivation domain, interacts with its C terminus, which contains the ETS domain. In parallel studies, we demonstrate that residues flanking the N- and C-terminal sides of the ETS domain of Elf3 are crucial for its binding to DNA. Our studies also show that an AT-hook domain, as well as the serine- and aspartic acid-rich domain but not the pointed domain, is necessary for Elf3 activation of promoter activity.

Gene knockout studies have shown that Elf3 plays essential roles during development, in particular the development of the gut. Thirty percent of Elf3 null fetuses die in utero, and the remaining 70% die shortly after birth. These mice exhibit severe alterations in the cellular architecture of the small intestine (5Ng A.Y.

Interestingly, the disruption of Elf3 activity leads to significant decreases in HER2 expression, which strongly suggests that Elf3 influences HER2 expression (6Asada S. Choi Y. Yamada M. Wang S.C.

Although it is unclear whether the effect of Elf3 on HER2 is direct or indirect, Elf3 has been shown to directly regulate other promoters. This has been shown most clearly in the case of the type II TGF-β-receptor (TβR-II) promoter.

Elf3 not only binds to the promoter of TβR-II in vivo, both over- and underexpression studies have directly implicated Elf3 in the regulation of the endogenous TβR-II gene (11Kim J.H. Wilder P.J.

Elf3 has also been implicated in the expression of at least 10 other genes, including the collagenase-1 gene (MMP-1, interstitial collagenase, and collagenase type I) (7Eckel K.L. Tentler J.J. Cappetta G.J. Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a gene important in extracellular matrix remodeling and tumorigenesis (16Brinckerhoff C.E. Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4823-4830PubMed Google Scholar). The collagenase-1 promoter contains closely spaced AP-1 and ets sites, which allow cooperation between transcription factors (17Westermarck J.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2297-2306PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperative action of Elf3 with other transcription factors has also been observed in the case of the nitric-oxide synthetase (NOS2) gene, where Elf3 cooperates with NF-κB, by binding to adjacent ets and κB sites (19Rudders S.

Although there is growing evidence that Elf3 regulates a number of important genes that are involved in a wide range of cellular activities, Elf3 structure and function have not been studied in-depth. The work described in this study focuses on the domains of Elf3 required for DNA binding and the activation of gene transcription. Based in part on sequence analysis, Elf3 contains five defined domains (Fig. 1). The N terminus contains a pointed domain (PNT), which is located in residues 63–127 (1Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This domain has been implicated in protein-protein interaction for other ETS proteins (26Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Foulds C.E. Nelson M.L. Blaszczak A.G. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10954-10964Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus far, the PNT domain in Elf3 has not been assigned a functional role. The transactivation domain (TAD), which has been studied more extensively, is located in residues 129–159 (6Asada S. Choi Y. Yamada M. Wang S.C. Hung M.C. Qin J. Uesugi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Chang C.H. Scott G.K. Baldwin M.A. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3682-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unlike TADs of many other transcription factors, the TAD of Elf3 appears to contain an α-helix (6Asada S. Choi Y. Yamada M. Wang S.C. Hung M.C. Qin J. Uesugi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and point mutations in this α-helix disrupt its ability to activate promoter activity as well as its interaction with the coactivator Med23 (CRSP3, Drip130, and Sur2) and the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) (6Asada S. Choi Y. Yamada M. Wang S.C. Hung M.C. Qin J. Uesugi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Chang C.H. Scott G.K. Baldwin M.A. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3682-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Elf3 also contains a serine- and aspartic acid-rich (SAR) domain located in residues 189–229 (4Chang C.H. Scott G.K. Kuo W.L. Xiong X. Suzdaltseva Y. Park J.W. Sayre P. Erny K. Collins C. Gray J.W. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Prescott J.D. Koto K.S. Singh M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5548-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is unique. This domain appears to influence cellular transformation when Elf3 is localized to the cytoplasm, but a nuclear function for this domain has not been identified (29Prescott J.D. Koto K.S. Singh M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5548-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unlike other ETS proteins, Elf3 appears to contain two AT-hook domains located within residues 236–267, which have not been examined in detail. AT-hook domains were initially identified in high mobility group (HMG) family members, where they are believed to be involved in nonsequence-specific binding to AT-rich regions of DNA, as well as protein-protein interactions (30Reeves R. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 803-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhang X.M. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20235-20243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This region of Elf3 also contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (29Prescott J.D. Koto K.S. Singh M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5548-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Do H.J. Song H. Yang H.M. Kim D.K. Kim N.H. Kim J.H. Cha K.Y. Chung H.M. Kim J.H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1865-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, the ETS domain, which is required for DNA binding, is located in residues 272–354 (1Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The ETS domain of Elf3 has not been characterized, but it is expected to be structurally similar to those of other ETS family members (1Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Earlier studies argue that Elf3, like eight other ETS proteins, possesses an autoinhibitory domain (AID), which limits its binding to DNA (11Kim J.H. Wilder P.J. Hou J. Nowling T. Rizzino A. J. Biol.

Many proteins are held in an autoinhibited state in vivo until the correct physiological conditions are met (39Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 421-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For transcription factors, a common target of autoinhibition is DNA binding, and there is growing evidence that many transcription factors possess AIDs. Because the ETS domains of most, if not all, ETS proteins are likely to be very similar structurally and bind to similar DNA sequences in vitro, specificity is believed to be achieved, at least in part, through autoinhibition (39Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 421-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition limits promiscuous binding of these transcription factors to gene regulatory regions in vivo in the absence of partner proteins or signaling events. Currently, two different models have been proposed to explain how autoinhibition affects DNA binding of ETS family members. The model for Ets1-like autoinhibition posits that regions flanking its ETS domain fold together to form an inhibitory module, which interacts with the ETS domain and, as a result, lowers its affinity for DNA (40Greenall A.

Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vivo, Ets1 autoinhibition is believed to be relieved when a partner protein interacts with either the autoinhibitory module or the ETS domain itself (42Goetz T.L. Gu T.L. Speck N.A. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Baillat D. Begue A. Stehelin D. Aumercier M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, a different model for autoinhibition has been proposed for Elk1 (50Yang S.H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 51Yang S.H. Bumpass D.C. Perkins N.D. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5036-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which involves three separate regions (TAD, B-box, and R-domain) acting in a collective manner to regulate Elk1 activity through autoinhibition (50Yang S.H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 51Yang S.H. Bumpass D.C. Perkins N.D. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5036-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The primary AID affecting DNA binding is within the TAD of Elk1, and phosphorylation of the TAD affects the domain-domain interaction within Elk1 for release of autoinhibition (50Yang S.H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although previous studies argue that Elf3 contains an AID, it is unclear what region(s) of the protein is involved in limiting its binding to DNA (11Kim J.H. Wilder P.J. Hou J. Nowling T. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17520-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and how autoinhibition is regulated mechanistically. To identify the regions of Elf3 that affect autoinhibition, as well as the regions that affect its activation of transcription, we created and tested an extensive series of Elf3 mutant proteins with specific domains deleted or targeted by point mutations. We determined that the PNT domain does not appear to be needed for Elf3 to activate the promoter of either the TβR-II or collagenase-1 gene, whereas the SAR domain is needed for both promoters. Interestingly, we show that one of the AT-hook domains is required to activate transcription in a promoter-specific manner. We also determined that several regions outside the ETS domain influence Elf3 binding to DNA both in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of our findings, we present a model of autoinhibition that implicates intramolecular interactions in the creation of the autoinhibited state. Moreover, we propose that the release of autoinhibition is facilitated by interactions with a coactivator, which disrupts intramolecular interactions within Elf3 and increases the affinity of the ETS domain for DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2155442000,"γ-Aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor α1 subunits containing a cysteine mutation at a position in the channel mouth (H109C) surprisingly formed a spontaneous cross-link with each other in receptors composed of α1H109C, β3, and γ2 subunits. Cross-linking of two α1H109C subunits did not significantly change the affinity of [3H]muscimol or [3H]Ro15-1788 binding in α1H109Cβ3γ2 receptors, but GABA displayed a reduced potency for activating chloride currents. On reduction of the disulfide bond, however, GABA activation as well as diazepam modulation was similar in mutated and wild-type receptors, suggesting that these receptors exhibited the same subunit stoichiometry and arrangement. Disulfide bonds could not be reoxidized by copper phenanthroline after having been reduced in completely assembled receptors, suggesting that cross-linking can only occur at an early stage of assembly. The cross-link of α1H109C subunits and the subsequent transport of the resulting homodimers to the cell surface caused a reduction of the intracellular pool of α1H109C subunits and a reduced formation of completely assembled receptors. The formation of α1H109C homodimers as well as of correctly assembled GABAA receptors containing cross-linked α1H109C subunits could indicate that homodimerization of α1 subunits via contacts located in the channel mouth might be one starting point of GABAA receptor assembly. Alternatively the assembly mechanism might have started with the formation of heterodimers followed by a cross-link of mutated α1 subunits at the heterotrimeric stage. The formation of cross-linked α1H109C homodimers would then have occurred independently in a separate pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2082848264,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binds to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors termed type II (TbetaR-II) and type I (TbetaR-I). TGF-beta is unable to bind to TbetaR-I in the absence of TbetaR-II, and initiates receptor assembly by binding with high affinity to TbetaR-II. Previous structural analysis of the TGF-beta3-TbetaR-II complex has suggested that two charged amino acid residues, D55 and E142 of TbetaR-II, are binding sites of TGF-beta. In the present study, we have shown that mutations of the amino-acid residues, D55 and E142 of TbetaR-II, resulted in loss of TGF-beta binding and downstream signaling activity. Moreover, we found that 3,5,7,2',4'-pentahydroxyflavone (Morin) inhibits TGF-beta binding to TbetaR-II, and suppresses phosphorylation of Smad2 and expression of a TGF-beta target gene Smad7 induced by TGF-beta. Our findings may thus provide useful information for designing therapeutic agents for various diseases induced by TGF-beta, including advanced cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2021960210,"Understanding how disruption of differentiation contributes to the cancer cell phenotype is required to identify alterations essential for malignant transformation and provide experimental basis for their correction. We investigated whether primary quail neuroretina cells, transformed by a conditional v-Src mutant (QNR/v-srcts), could revert to a normal phenotype, in response to the stable expression of constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN). This model system was chosen because Notch signaling plays an instructive role in cell fate determination during NR development, and because the intrinsic capacity of QNR cultures to differentiate is blocked by v-Src.We report that stable ICN expression results in suppression of QNR/v-srcts cell transformation in the presence of an active oncoprotein. This phenotypic reversion coincides with a major switch in cell identity, as these undifferentiated cells acquire glial differentiation traits. Both changes appear to be mediated by CBF, a transcription factor that binds to ICN and activates target genes. Cells restored to a normal and differentiated phenotype have undergone changes in the functioning of signaling effectors, essentially regulating cell morphology and cytoskeleton organization. This dominant interference may be partially mediated by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, as revertant cells secrete a factor(s), which inhibits transformation properties of QNR/v-srcts cells."

Sequence discrimination by DNA-binding proteins is one of the most remarkable examples of molecular recognition in biochemistry. Restriction-modification (R-M) 4The abbreviations used are: R-M, restriction-modification; REase, restriction endonuclease; MTase, methyltransferase; CCC, covalently closed circular; OC, open circular; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. systems are paradigms for the study of protein-DNA recognition. More than 3600 R-M enzymes have been identified so far, and they manifest 218 unique recognition specificities (1Roberts R.J. Vincze T. Posfai D. Macelis J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These enzymes represent the largest family of functionally related enzymes. R-M systems comprise pairs of intracellular enzymatic activities; that is, restriction endonuclease (REase) activity and DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity. The REase recognizes specific sequences and catalyzes cleavage of double-stranded DNA. The MTase prevents the REase from digesting endogenous DNA by modifying the same target sequence with the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) (2Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). R-M enzymes are classified into types I, II, III, and IV, based on their recognition sequence, subunit composition, cleavage position, and cofactor requirements (3Roberts R.J. et al.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The simplest R-M systems are the type II enzymes. These generally consist of two separate enzymes, one responsible for restriction and the other for modification of the cognate DNA sequences. The orthodox type II REases are homodimers that typically recognize a palindromic sequence of 4–8 bp and cut the DNA within or close to their recognition sequence in the presence of Mg2+ to give a 5′-phosphate and a 3′-hydroxyl end. Although thousands of type II REases are known, the structures of only 19 have been reported to date (4Pingoud A. Fuxreiter M. Pingoud V. Wende W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 685-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Structural and mutational analysis of several type II REases reveal that the sequence PDXn(D/E)XK(n = 1–30 residues) acts as a catalytic/Mg2+ binding signature motif (5Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 3: 11-19Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For the great majority of type II REases, Mg2+ is an essential cofactor that can be substituted with Mn2+. The essential divalent ion cofactor is bound to the two carboxylates and the main carbon of the hydrophobic residue X of the PDXn(D/E)XK motif as well as to one of the non-bonding oxygens of the phosphate to be attacked. The fact that many REases have a common catalytic sequence motif suggests that they follow the same mechanism with at least one obvious exception, BfiI restriction endonuclease, which does not require a divalent metal ion cofactor (6Lagunavicius A. Sasnauskas G. Halford S.E. Siksnys V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Type III R-M systems are multisubunit and multifunctional enzymes that exhibit both restriction and modification activities. These enzymes are composed of two subunits, products of the res and mod genes, and require ATP, AdoMet, and Mg2+ for restriction. The Mod subunit alone functions as a methyltransferase in the presence of AdoMet and determines the specificity for methylation and restriction, whereas restriction activity requires the cooperation of both the Res and Mod subunits (7Dryden D.T.F. Murray N.E. Rao D.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3728-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage and ATP hydrolysis are functions of the Res subunit. The Res subunit lacks a DNA recognition function and is active only in conjunction with the Mod subunit. Type III R-M enzymes characteristically recognize DNA sequences that lack symmetry and cleave 25–27 bp downstream of the sequence. Two inversely oriented (→ ←) unmethylated sites are the substrates for cleavage by type III restriction enzymes (8Meisel A. Bickle T.A. Kruger D.H. Schroeder C. Nature. 1992; 355: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, methylation proceeds regardless of the number and orientation of recognition sequences. It has been shown that ATP hydrolysis is required for DNA cleavage by the type III enzymes (9Saha S. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar). EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase (M.EcoP15I), a member of the type III R-M systems, adds a methyl group to the second adenine in the recognition sequence 5′-CAGCAG-3′ in the presence of AdoMet and magnesium (10Meisel A. Kruger D.H. Bickle T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using a Fenton chemistry affinity cleavage assay, we identified the magnesium binding-like motif as amino acids 355–377 (11Bist P. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41837-41848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sequence homology comparisons between EcoP15I DNA MTase and other restriction endonucleases allowed us to identify a PDXn(D/E)XK-like sequence as the putative magnesium ion binding site (Fig. 1). In M.EcoP15I, a PDXn(D/E)XK-like motif is present in which the partially conserved proline is replaced by methionine. Mutational analysis of this region and detailed biochemical characterization of mutant MTases are consistent with the fact that acidic amino acid residues of this region 355–377 in M.EcoP15I are important for the critical positioning of magnesium ions for catalysis. This is the first example of a metal-dependent function for a DNA methyltransferase (11Bist P. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41837-41848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have not found any MTases in the Protein Data Bank containing the Mg2+ binding motif that is present in M.EcoP15I. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Wild type EcoP15I DNA MTase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells by transforming with plasmid pDN8, which harbors wild type M.EcoP15I. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain was used as a host for transformation of pET15b constructs carrying the mutant EcoP15I MTases. E. coli strain ER2566 (a kind gift from New England Biolabs) was also used as host strain for transformation of mutant and wild type EcoP15I MTases. Plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 were used as substrates for methylation and cleavage assays. Plasmids pMDS32 (a kind gift from Dr. Mark D. Szczelkun, University of Bristol) and pUM1 were used as substrates in cleavage assays. E. coli strain DH5α was used as a host for preparing plasmids pUC18, pUC19, pMDS32, and pUMI. BL21(DE3)pLysS strain harboring pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I-M357P was plated on LB agar with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, cells harboring pACY184 M.EcoP15I were plated on LB agar with 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the double transformants were plated on LB agar with both ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Overexpression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant M.EcoP15I—Wild type EcoP15I DNA MTase was expressed and purified as described earlier (12Rao D.N. Page M.G. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs (pET15b-M357P and pET15b-M357A) were transformed separately into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells harboring the mutant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in terrific broth (TB) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 8 h (A600 1.0), IPTG (0.5 mm) added and grown for an additional 2 h. M.EcoP15I-M357P and M.EcoP15I-M357A were purified to near homogeneity as described earlier (12Rao D.N. Page M.G. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme preparations were judged as being greater than 99% on SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). pET15b-M357P construct was also transformed into E. coli strain ER2566. In this strain the endA1 gene has been deleted. M.EcoP15I-M357P enzyme was expressed in this strain and purified as described above. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was done to introduce proline or alanine at position 357. The sequence of primer 1 (Table 1) was designed to change the methionine at position 357 to proline and create an SmaI restriction site. The sequence of primer 2 was designed to change the methionine 357 to alanine and to create a restriction site (PvuII). A single strand DNA template containing uracil residues was prepared for E. coli strain CJ 236 that harbored pGEM3Zf(–)M.EcoP15I (11Bist P. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41837-41848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Primers 1 and 2 were hybridized separately to the single-stranded DNA, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (14Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids were termed pGEM3zf(-)M.EcoP15I-M357P and pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I-M357A. The NcoI-BamHI fragment from these constructs carrying the mutant gene was cloned into NcoI-BamHI-digested pET15b. The mutants were identified by digesting the plasmid DNA with SmaI (M357P) or PvuII (M357A). The mutant genes were sequenced, and no other mutations except for the intended ones were found.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides and duplexes used in this studyPrimerSequenceAmino acid changedRestriction site created (+)/eliminated (-)15′-AAGCCTATCGGGTGTATCTCCCGGGAA-3′Met-357 to ProSmaI (+)25′-AAGCCTATCAGCTGTATCTA-3′Met-357 to AlaPvuII (+)35′-GAAGCCTATCCATTGTAGCTAATGGAAAACGGTATCC-3′Asp-355 to AlaEcoRV (-)45′-CCATTAGATACACCTGCTAGGCTTCTGTCTG-3′Asp-358 to AlaAarI (+)55′-ATTTGTTTTCATCTGCACCGAAGATGATC-3′Asp-370 to AlaBsgI (+)65′-CTAAATTTTGTTTGCATATCGCCGAGATG-3′Glu-372 to AlaBtgZI (+)75′-GTTGTATAATTTTGTTTGCGTCATCACCGAGATG-3′Glu-377 to AlaHgaI (+)85′-GTATTTGGTATCTGCGCTCTGCTTAAGCCAGTTACC-3′AfIII (+)95′-GGTAACTGGCTTAAGCAGAGCGCAGATACCAAATAC-3′AfIII (+)105′-AAGGATCTAGGTGAAGATCC-3′115′-GTGTAGGTCGTTCGCTCC-3′Duplex I5′-TAGGTCAGAATTCAGCAGACCCTAAGTAGC-3′3′-ATCCAGTCTTAAGTCGTCTGGGATTCATCG-5′Duplex II5′-TAGGTCAGAATTCAGCTGACCCTAAGTAGC-3′3′-ATCCAGTCTTAAGTCGACTGGGATTCATCG-5′ Open table in a new tab Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis of D355A, D358A, D370A, E372A, and E377A was carried out with primers 3–7 (Table 1) using pET15b-M357P as the template in separate PCR reactions. In this protocol, the entire lengths of both strands of the plasmid DNA are amplified in a linear fashion during several cycles of thermal cycling, generating a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks on opposite strands (15Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The constructs expressing the mutant proteins were initially screened by digestion with the corresponding restriction endonucleases (Table 1). Preparation of 3H-Labeled pUC19 DNA—pUC19 plasmid was used to transform E. coli HB101, and the transformants were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 37 MBq/liter of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, India). After continued growth at 37 °C overnight, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and a covalently closed circular form of the plasmid was purified as described (15Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Analysis of the purified plasmid by electrophoresis through agarose showed that generally 95% of the DNA was the covalently closed circular form. DNA concentrations were assessed by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Plasmid DNA preparation in which ∼95% supercoiled form was used as substrate in cleavage reactions. Methylation Assay—Methylation assays monitored incorporation of tritiated methyl groups into DNA by using a modified ion-exchange filter assay (16Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Methylation assays were carried out in a reaction mixture containing 300 nm supercoiled pUC18 DNA, 1 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet in HEPES buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0) with wild type (1 μm), M.EcoP15I-M357P (1 μm), or M.EcoP15I-M357A (1 μm). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Increasing concentrations of wild type (0–5 μm) or mutant MTase (0–5 μm) were incubated with 100 nm 5′-end-labeled duplex I or II (Table 1) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min on ice. Electrophoresis was performed as described (16Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for 16–20 h. Photolabeling of Wild Type and Mutant EcoP15Is with [methyl-3H]AdoMet—Cross-linking wild type and mutant enzyme with AdoMet was done as described previously (17Reddy Y.V. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23866-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). M.EcoP15I (0.6 and 1.2 μm) or M.EcoP15I-M357P (0.6 and 1.2 μm) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) were irradiated in the presence of 6.6 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet (80 Ci/mmol). Photolabeled enzyme was visualized by exposing the dried gel to x-ray film at –70 °C. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Native molecular masses of wild type and M.EcoP15I-M357P were determined by gel filtration chromatography using a calibrated Superdex 200 column. The molecular masses of wild type and M.EcoP15I-M357P were calculated from the plot of Ve/Vo versus log molecular weight. Cleavage Assays—DNA cleavage reactions with wild type and mutant enzymes were performed in HEPES buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm Mg2+ at 37 °C for 30 min (unless otherwise stated) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. DNA cleavage reactions with purified EcoP15I restriction endonuclease (R.EcoP15I) were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in the HEPES buffer in the presence of 1 mm ATP in a reaction volume of 20 μl. All other restriction digestions were performed with respective reaction conditions according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cleavage products were analyzed on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. Kinetic Methods—Steady-state kinetics were typically carried out by diluting the stock solution of M.EcoP15I-M357P enzyme to 20 nm and then adding a sample of the diluted enzyme to a solution of 3H-labeled pUC19 in buffer at 20 °C. Compositions of solutions given under “Results” and “Discussion” omit components from the enzyme dilution buffer. Samples were removed from the reaction mixture at timed intervals and immediately vortexed with 5 μl of stop mix (100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 60% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.03% μg/ml bromphenol blue, pH 8.0). Each sample was then analyzed by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose in Tris borate containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 5 V/cm. Under these conditions the covalently closed circular form of pUC19 had a higher mobility than the open circle form of this DNA. For each sample from the reaction, slices of the gel that covered the covalently circular and linear forms of the DNA were excised, dissolved by incubation for 2 h at 67 °C in 0.5 ml of 5 m NaClO4, and added to 3 ml of water and 10 ml of scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity in each was determined by scintillation counting (18Vipond I.B. Baldwin G.S. Oram M. Erskine S.G. Wentzell L.M. Szczelkun M.D. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 4: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Values for the amount of each form of the DNA were calculated as the percentage of the total DNA in that sample. For steady-state kinetic experiments, zero time points were taken by adding stop mix to a sample of the DNA before the enzyme. For every reaction a sample from the same solution of DNA was also incubated with enzyme dilution buffer (but lacking enzyme) for the duration of the reaction. In all of the reactions described here, <1% of the covalently closed circular DNA was linearized in this control. Hence, the observed reactions must be due to M.EcoP15I-M357P enzyme rather than any contaminant nuclease that might have been present in the buffer. In a series of similar reactions containing M.EcoP15I-M357P (20 nm) and 3H-labeled pUC19 DNA, the concentration of DNA was varied in the range of 50–600 nm. An Eadie-Scatchard plot (v/[S] versus v) allowed the determination of KmDNA and Vmax. The turnover number (kcat) was calculated as the ratio of Vmax to the enzyme concentration used. Data obtained were analyzed by regression analysis using Sigma Plot. The equations used to obtain the kinetic constants, Vmax, KmDNA, and kcat were as described (19Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 208Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all enzyme activity data were the average of at least triplicate determinations. Construction of Plasmid with No CAGCAG Sites (pUM1)—pMDS32, which has a single CAGCAG site, was used as a template to make a plasmid with no sites. The mutagenic primers used for changing CAGCAG to AAGCAG are listed in Table 1 (primers 8 and 9). The primers were designed such that an AflII site would be generated if the mutation occurred. Both the primers contain the desired mutation and have the same starting and ending position on opposite strands of the plasmid DNA. In this method the entire lengths of both strands of the plasmid DNA are amplified in a linear fashion during several cycles of thermal cycling, generating a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks on opposite strands (15Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The products of the PCR are treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI, which specifically cleaves fully methylated GMe6ATC sequences. DpnI will, therefore, digest the bacterially generated DNA used as a template for amplification. DpnI-resistant molecules, which are rich in desired mutants, are recovered by transforming DH5α cells with ampicillin as a selection marker. Plasmids with no CAGCAG sites were scored by AflII digestion. Mapping the Cleavage Site—Two primers were designed (primers 10 and 11, Table 1) for mapping the cleavage site. Although the forward primer (primer 10) sequence was 240 bp upstream, the reverse primer (primer 11) was 214 bp downstream of the CAGCAG site in pMDS32 DNA. Plasmid pMDS32 was cleaved by M.EcoP15I-M357P, and the reaction products were sequenced. EcoP15I Methylated pUC18 DNA—pUC18 DNA was methylated by incubating with purified M.EcoP15I at 37 °C for 60 min in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 mm EDTA, 6.4 mm MgCl2, 11 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μm AdoMet. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and used as a substrate in cleavage reactions. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Mutant EcoP15I MTases—Site-directed mutagenesis of Met-357 to Pro-357 or Ala-357 was carried out using primers 1 and 2 (Table 1) whose sequences were designed to change the methionine at position 357 to proline or alanine and create a SmaI or a PvuII restriction site, respectively. Single-stranded DNA template containing uracil residues was prepared from E. coli strain CJ236 that harbored pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I. The mutant primers were hybridized separately to the single-stranded DNA, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed (14Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis of D355A, D358A, D370A, E372A, and E377A was carried out with primers 3–7 (Table 1) using pET15b-M357P as template in separate PCR reactions. The resultant plasmids were termed pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I-M357P, pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I-M357A, pET15b-M.EcoP15I-M357P-D355A, pET15b-M.EcoP15I-M357P-D358A, pET15b-M.EcoP15I-M357P-D370A, pET15b-M.EcoP15I-M357P-E372A, and pET15b-M357P-E377A Surprisingly, transformation of pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I-M357P resulted in the lysis of host cells BL21(DE3)pLysS (Fig. 2B). This toxicity was not observed when the host cell was transformed with pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, when host cells expressing wild type M.EcoP15I (pACYC184-M.EcoP15I) (Fig. 2C) was transformed with pGEM3zf(–)M.EcoP15I-M357P, double transformants were seen to grow on LB plates containing both ampicillin and chloramphenicol (Fig. 2D). Similar toxicity was observed for pET15b-M.EcoP15I-M357P-D358A and pET15b-M.EcoP15I-M357P-D370A when plated on LB plates containing 1 mm IPTG (Table 2). On the other hand, substitutions at positions 372 and 377 seem to abolish the toxicity effect as the number of colonies was almost the same in the presence or absence of IPTG (Table 2). Therefore, we conclude that the acidic residues at these two positions may be important for Mg2+ binding and consequently in DNA cleavage. DNA isolated from single colonies harboring the wild type and mutant MTases (Fig. 2D) was amplified using PCR and the PCR-amplified products cloned into NcoI-BamHI-digested pET15b and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE) pLysS. Single colonies would harbor either the plasmid containing the wild type M.EcoP15I insert or mutant M357P insert. DNA isolated from single colonies was subjected to SmaI digestion, and thus, the pET15b construct harboring the mutant insert was identified.TABLE 2In vivo assay for putative endonuclease activityPlasmid constructsNumber of coloniesaValues are average values determined from three independent experiments.-IPTG+IPTGM.EcoP15I (wild type)212224M.EcoP15I-M357P136M.EcoP15I-M357P-D355A2015M.EcoP15I-M357P-D358A64M.EcoP15I-M357P-D370A10721M.EcoP15I-M357P-E372A5844M.EcoP15I-M357P-E377A168149a Values are average values determined from three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab A 500-ml culture harboring pET15b-M357P or pET15b-M357A was grown for 8 h (A600 nm = 1.0), IPTG (0.5 mm) was added, and the culture was grown for an additional 2 h. At this point of time, cell lysis occurred. Using this as starting material, M.EcoP15I-M357P and M.EcoP15I-M357A were purified separately to homogeneity as described earlier (12Rao D.N. Page M.G. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purified M.EcoP15I-M357P enzyme was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3A) for alterations in electrophoretic mobility, and no apparent changes were detected vis à vis the wild type protein. Similarly, gel filtration analysis clearly showed that both the wild type and M.EcoP15I-M357P eluted as symmetric peaks at a position corresponding to a globular protein of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 3B). It was observed that whereas the purified wild type M.EcoP15I was stable for at least 2 months when stored at 4 °C, the mutant M.EcoP15I-M357P lost all of its endonuclease activity within a week when stored under similar conditions. Methylation Activity and Substrate Binding Properties of M.EcoP15I-M357P—In vitro methylation assays (16Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that measured the ability to transfer 3H-labeled methyl group from [methyl-3H]AdoMet clearly showed that the mutant M.EcoP15I-M357P was inactive. Another mutant enzyme, where methionine at 357 was replaced by alanine (M.EcoP15I-M57A), was catalytically active (Fig. 4A). We reasoned that the loss of activity of M.EcoP15I-M357P could be due to conformational changes in the protein structure or altered substrate binding properties. The effect of placing a proline at position 357 in EcoP15I DNA MTase was determined by measuring (for wild type and mutant enzymes) relative susceptibilities to proteolysis, UV, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Gross conformational changes could not be detected between wild type and mutant enzymes (data not shown). To test if the ability of binding of substrates, DNA, and AdoMet were affected because of the substitution, binding properties of the wild type and mutant MTase were investigated. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, both the wild type and mutant enzyme (M.EcoP15I-M357P) were shown to bind DNA almost with the same affinity (Fig. 4B). Exposure of wild type and M.EcoP15I-M357P to UV light in the presence of [methyl-3H]AdoMet results in strong photolabeling (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the mutant enzyme is still able to bind AdoMet. DNA Cleavage Properties of M.EcoP15I-M357P—Incubation of M.EcoP15I-M357P with unmethylated supercoiled pUC18 DNA, which contains three EcoP15I recognition sites but with only one pair in the inverse orientation (→←), resulted in linearization of supercoiled pUC18 (Fig. 5Ac). On the other hand, incubation of pUC18 DNA with wild type M.EcoP15I or M.EcoP15I-M357A did not result in any cleavage (Fig. 5A, a and b). One could argue that the endonuclease-like activity could be due to a contaminating endonuclease, possibly the product of the endA1 gene present in the E. coli strain used. Therefore, we transformed the pET15b-M357P construct into E. coli strain, ER2566. In this strain, the endA1 gene has been deleted. The mutant enzymes purified from this strain gave identical results to those described above (data not shown). When pUC18 DNA was premethylated by wild type EcoP15I MTase and used as a substrate in the above reaction, no linearization occurred (Fig. 5B, lane 3). This result clearly demonstrates that the M.EcoP15I-M357P recognizes unmethylated CAGCAG sequences and cuts DNA (Fig. 5B, lane 6). As a control, we performed digestion of unmethylated and methylated pUC18 DNA with the holoenzyme R.EcoP15I, which as stated earlier is composed of both the Mod and Res subunits. As can be seen clearly, the holoenzyme linearizes only unmethylated DNA (Fig. 5B, lane 5) and not methylated DNA (lane 2). When the holoenzyme was used, ATP was necessary, in the absence of which there was no cleavage (data not shown). The digestions with M.EcoP15I-M357P mutant enzyme were carried out only in the presence of Mg 2+. We tested the effects of Mn2+, Ca2+, Co2+, and Zn2+, but none supported the DNA cleavage activity, although with Mn2+ there was cleavage but to a lesser extent (Fig. 5C). Only Mg2+ serves as a metal cofactor in the DNA cleavage reaction. Recognition Site Requirement of M.EcoP15I-M357P—To unequivocally demonstrate that the mutant enzyme is not a nonspecific endonuclease, we constructed a plasmid pUM1, a derivative of pUC18 that does not contain any CAGCAG sequence (Fig. 6A). When this plasmid was used as a substrate in the DNA cleavage assays, the mutant enzyme or even the holoenzyme did not cleave the DNA (Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). pUM1 has one AflII site, and when this plasmid was digested with AflII, supercoiled DNA was converted to a linear form, thus demonstrating that the plasmid DNA was cleavable (Fig. 6A, lane 4). A single mutation in the recognition sequence such as changing 5′-CAGCAG-3′ to 5′-AAGCAG-3′ abolished M357P REase activity (Fig. 6A). The specificity of the mutant endonuclease was, thus, established. Type III restriction enzymes R.EcoP15I and R.EcoP1I require two copies of the recognition sequence for efficient cleavage (20Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Bickle T.A. Kruger D.H. Schroeder C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been unequivocally demonstrated that covalently closed circular plasmid containing one EcoP15I recognition site is not a substrate for DNA cleavage by R.EcoP15I. On the other hand, we showed earlier that linear DNA molecules containing a single EcoP15I recognition site could be cleaved by R.EcoP15I (21Raghavendra N.K. Rao D.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5703-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested to find out if M.EcoP15I-M357P mutant enzyme would cleave either of these two substrates. pMDS32 (22Peakman L.J.

Gross C.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). On the basis of functional and phylogenetic criteria, the σ factors of the major family σ70 have been assigned to one group of primary and up to four groups of non-essential factors (1Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 2Dupuy B. Matamouros S. Res.

In each bacterial species, there is one primary σ factor that is essential for growth and closely related to σ70 of Escherichia coli and that predominantly ensures transcription initiation during the exponential phase of growth, i.e. of the housekeeping genes. In addition, there are variable numbers of the non-essential (including the alternative) σ factors that are involved in the transcription mostly of genes activated under various forms of stress or in response to signals from outside of the cytoplasm (5Wosten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 6Paget M.S. Helmann J.D. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 203Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Forty or fifty odd genes of alternative σ factors have been identified, respectively, in the Bacteroides species Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (7Kuwahara T. Yamashita A. Hirakawa H. Nakayama H. Toh H. Okada N. Kuhara S. Hattori M. Hayashi T. Ohnishi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Xu J.

In contrast to the primary σ factors studied so far, which interact with promoters comprising the two highly conserved –35 and –10 hexamers (9Lisser S. Margalit H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the corresponding factor σA of B. fragilis specifically recognizes the particular vegetative promoters of this species, which comprise the consensus sequences TTTG (–33) and TAnnTTTG (–7) (10Bayley D.P. Rocha E.R. Smith C.J. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000; 193: 149-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Structurally, σA of B. fragilis is distinct from most other primary σ factors and is the smallest such factor described to date (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although containing the conserved regions 1.2 through 4.2 (1Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), this σA lacks the strongly acidic region 1.1, which is replaced by a unique short basic segment of ten amino acids. It also displays a typical amino acid signature made up of 35 residues that are identically conserved in the primary σ factors of members of the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An additional feature of the B. fragilis σA factor, unusual for the primary σ of a Gram-negative bacterium, is the absence of the non-conserved region between regions 1.2 and 2.1. Region 1.1 is considered to be a constant part of the primary σ factors (5Wosten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Hinton D.M. Vuthoori S.

This unstructured and largely unconserved region (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 14Borukhov S. Nudler E. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) constitutes an autoinhibitory domain that has been reported to prevent free σ70 of E. coli and free σA of Thermotoga maritima from binding to DNA unless shortened or otherwise mutationally altered (16Camarero J.A. Shekhtman A. Campbell E.A. Chlenov M. Gruber T.M. Bryant D.A. Darst S.A. Cowburn D. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This inhibition is thought to result from indirect effects, steric or electrostatic or both, of region 1.1 on region 4.2, which ensures RNAP binding to the –35 promoter element (12Hinton D.M. Vuthoori S. Mulamba R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 16Camarero J.A. Shekhtman A. Campbell E.A. Chlenov M. Gruber T.M. Bryant D.A. Darst S.A. Cowburn D. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternating interaction of the highly negatively charged region 1.1 has been shown to occur with remarkably implicit flexibility with the positively charged double-stranded DNA binding channel in the holoenzyme and with the similarly charged β pincer in the RNAP-promoter open complex (20Mekler V. Kortkhonjia E. Mukhopadhyay J. Knight J. Revyakin A. Kapanidis A.N. Niu W. Ebright Y.W. Levy R. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2002; 108: 599-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). With respect to function within the holoenzyme, region 1.1 has been suggested to serve as a modulator of promoter binding and to support or inhibit efficient transcription initiation in a promoter-dependent manner (15Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Vuthoori S. Bowers C.W. McCracken A. Dombroski A.J. Hinton D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been found to have a moderating effect on RNAP inhibition by the bacteriophage protein AsiA and on its activation by MotA/AsiA and to substantially increase the stabilization of the interaction between σ70 and the RNAP core in E. coli (12Hinton D.M. Vuthoori S. Mulamba R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As for Bacillus subtilis, region 1.1 was concluded not to be required for the function of σA either in vitro or in vivo but to be able to negatively modulate the promoter DNA-binding activity of the holoenzyme (22Hsu H.H. Huang W.C. Chen J.P. Huang L.Y. Wu C.F. Chang B.Y. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2366-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In light of the abundant (although not fully conclusive) data on region 1.1 supporting its intrinsic role in the behavior of free σ and on its contribution to the function of previously studied RNAP holoenzymes, it was the aim of the present study to analyze the possible relationship between the unusually short N-terminal region and functional properties of σA of B. fragilis. We also tested the importance of some residues of the typical amino acid signature for the function of this factor, the prototype of a novel subgroup of primary σ factors that naturally lack region 1.1. Strains, Plasmids, Standard DNA Manipulations, and Site-directed Mutagenesis —The E. coli strains TG1, ER2566 (New England Biolabs) and XL1 Blue (Stratagene) used in this study for plasmid or protein production were grown under standard conditions with antibiotics added as required. B. fragilis strains 638R (23Breuil J. Dublanchet A. Truffaut N. Sebald M. Plasmid. 1989; 21: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and 638R rpoC-His8 (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), grown anaerobically, were used as sources of chromosomal DNA and core RNAP, respectively. Total bacterial DNA was extracted using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). Plasmids were prepared with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and introduced into E. coli by electroporation. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Restriction fragments and PCR amplification products were recovered from agarose gels using the QIAEX II gel extraction Kit (Qiagen). PCRs were performed in a Primus 25 thermal cycler (BIO SERV) with Taq, VENT, or Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Plasmids pDV28 and pDV29 carrying the B. fragilis promoters P942 and rrsP1, respectively (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and pDV30 were used for in vitro transcription assays. Plasmid pDV30, carrying the rrsP2 promoter of the 16 S rRNA gene of B. fragilis 638R, was constructed by ligating a 128-bp PCR-generated fragment using primers Oli279 (5′-GAATTCGACAGCATTTAATTTTGACATG-3′; EcoRI site underlined) and Oli280 (5′-GGATCCTCGCTCTGCGAATCGGACTGC-3′; BamHI site underlined) into the EcoRI/BamHI-digested plasmid pJCD01 (24Marschall C. Labrousse V. Kreimer M. Weichart D. Kolb A. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). σA mutants with the N-terminal basic segment of 12 amino acids truncated (σA ΔNBS) or with a segmental, N-terminal negative charge (σA NAS) were constructed by PCR after amplification of the corresponding DNA fragments using VENT DNA polymerase and total DNA from B. fragilis 638R as the template. The resulting fragments were digested with NdeI/SapI and cloned into the similarly digested plasmid pTYB1 (New England Biolabs, IMPACT-CN kit) and the recombinant plasmids introduced into E. coli ER2566. The respective forward primers σA ΔNBS-F (5′-CATATGGAGAGCGCTTCTCTTGACAAGTATTTGC-3′; NdeI underlined) and σA NAS-F (5′-CATATGgaaCAACTAgagATTACCgaaAGTATCACTAACAGAGAGAGCGCTTCTCTTGAC-3′; altered codons in lowercase) were used together with σA wild type (WT)-R (5′-GGTGGTTGCTCTTCCGCATCCCAAGTAAGATTTGAGCAATTTACTACG-3′, SapI site underlined). Single point mutations in σA were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with Phusion DNA polymerase, using overlapping primers and plasmid pDV18 (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), carrying the wild type sigA gene as the template. After digestion with DpnI, the DNA fragments were introduced into E. coli XL1 Blue competent cells. The primers for the respective mutants were σA D19A-F (5′-ACAGAGAGAGCGCTTCTCTTgccAAGTATTTGCAGGAAATCGG-3′), σA D19A-R (5′-CCGATTTCCTGCAAATACTTggcAAGAGAAGCGCTCTCTCTGT-3′), σA D19R-F (5′-ACAGAGAGAGCGCTTCTCTTaggAAGTATTTGCAGGAAATCGG-3′), σA D19R-R (5′-CCGATTTCCTGCAAATACTTcctAAGAGAAGCGCTCTCTCTGT-3′), σA F61L-F (5′-GACACGCGCCAATCTTCGTttgGTCGTATCCGTAGCTAAGC-3′), σA F61L-R (5′-GCTTAGCTACGGATACGACcaaACGAAGATTGGCGCGTGTC-3′), σA Q116A-F (5′-GGATTCGCCAATCTATTTTGgcgGCATTGGCAGAGCAGTCCCG-3′), σA Q116A-R (5′-CGGGACTGCTCTGCCAATGCcgcCAAAATAGATTGGCGAATCC-3′), σA Q116R-F (5′-GGATTCGCCAATCTATTTTGaggGCATTGGCAGAGCAGTCCCG-3′), σA Q116R-R (5′-CGGGACTGCTCTGCCAATGCcctCAAAATAGATTGGCGAATCC-3′), σA G133E-F (5′-GTCTTCCGTTGAACCAGGTTgagTCGCTGAACAAAATCAGC-3′), σA G133E-R (5′-GCTGATTTTGTTCAGCGActcAACCTGGTTCAACGGAAGAC-3′), σA H179P-F (5′-CGCTGAAAGTATCCGGCCGTccaATTTCGGTGGATGCTCCTTTCG-3′), σA H179P-R (5′CGAAAGGAGCATCCACCGAAATtggACGGCCGGATACTTTCAGCG-3′), σA L256V-F (5′-GGAAATCGGCGACAAATTTGGTgtcACACGTGAGCGTGTTCGTCAG-3′), σA L256V-R (5′-CTGACGAACACGCTCACGTGTgacACCAAATTTGTCGCCGATTTCC-3′), σA K265E-F (5′-CGTGAGCGTGTTCGTCAGATTgaaGAAAAAGCAATCAGAAGATTAAG-3′), and σA K265E-R (5′-CTTAATCTTCTGATTGCTTTTTCttcAATCTGACGAACACGCTCACG-3′; altered codons in lowercase). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification, Limited Proteolysis with Trypsin, and Holoenzyme Reconstitution—The σA mutant proteins were produced in E. coli ER2566 after intein tagging and purified on chitin beads following the supplier's instructions, as previously described for σA (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The σ preparations were estimated to be >90% pure after denaturing gel electrophoresis. The proteins were stored at –80 °C in buffer (Tris-HCl, 10 mm, pH 7.9; MgCl2, 10 mm; NaCl, 150 mm; EDTA, 0.1 mm; glycerol, 50% (v/v); dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm). B. fragilis core RNAP containing a chromosome-encoded His-tagged β' subunit was prepared from strain 638R rpoC-His8 as previously described using nickel affinity, molecular sieve and ion exchange chromatography (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Comparative limited proteolysis of wild type and mutant σA proteins was essentially carried out as previously described (25Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16316-16321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at a σA/trypsin weight ratio of 1:1000 in buffer (Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.9; NaCl, 100 mm). Holoenzymes were reconstituted by incubating typically ∼5 pmol of B. fragilis core RNAP with WT or mutant σA at a 5-fold molar excess for 20 min at 37 °C. The reconstituted holoenzymes were diluted at room temperature in K-Glu buffer (HEPES at 20 mm, pH 8.0, potassium glutamate at 50 mm, magnesium chloride at 10 mm, dithiothreitol at 5 mm, and bovine serum albumin at 500 μg/ml) prior to use for in vitro experiments. Dithiothreitol was omitted from the buffer for permanganate (KMnO4) reactivity experiments. Determination of σA Binding to B. fragilis Core RNAP Using an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Using a procedure adapted from André et al. (26Andre E. Bastide L. Villain-Guillot P. Latouche J. Rouby J. Leonetti J.P. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2004; 2: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 96-well microtitration plates (Maxisorp™, Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with increasing amounts (0.1–3 pmol) of purified B. fragilis σA, wild type or mutant, in 100 μl of buffer A (Tris-HCl at 20 mm, pH 7.9, NaCl at 100 mm, and Tween 20 at 0.1% (v/v)). After washing three times with 200 μl of buffer A, the wells were saturated with 250 μl of buffer A containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (buffer B) for 1 h at room temperature. B. fragilis core RNAP (1 pmol) diluted in buffer B (100 μl) was added and the mixture incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with 250 μl of buffer A, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-α subunit antibodies (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I.

Core binding was revealed after the addition of peroxydase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and H2O2/o-phenylenediamine. Absorbency was measured at 490 nm. Runoff Transcription Assays—Plasmids pDV28, pDV29, and pDV30, and linear DNA fragments amplified from each plasmid using primers E7 (5′-TGGCAGATGCGTCTTCCG-3′) and J7 (5′-GGATTTGTCCTACTCAGGAG-3′) were used as templates. σA-dependent transcripts (94, 110, and 104 nucleotides, respectively) were expected to end at the rrnBT1T2 terminators of pJCD01. Multiple round transcription assays were performed (in a total volume of 12 μl) with supercoiled or linear template at 10 nm and reconstituted holoenzyme at 50 nm. Each holoenzyme variant was added to DNA to allow open complex formation at 37 °C for 30 min. RNA polymerization was started by the addition of a nucleotide solution (200 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 20 μm of [α-32P]UTP (4 Ci/mmol) and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. Single round transcription assays were performed in the presence of heparin (120 μg/ml), with the reaction allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with a mixture of urea (8 m) and xylene cyanol blue (0.5%). After heating to 90 °C, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide (8%) gel, followed by autoradiography and imaging with a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). Abortive Initiation Assays—Abortive initiation was assayed on a linear 287-bp rrsP2 template as for runoff experiments, except that ApG dinucleotide and UTP were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and 0.01 mm, respectively. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min and samples submitted to chromatography in WASP buffer (ammonium sulfate at 3.2 m, EDTA, pH 8.0, at 5 mm, isopropanol at 2% (v/v)) on Whatman 3M paper treated with EDTA (100 mm). The trinucleotide transcripts were quantified using a phosphorimaging device. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Linear P942, rrsP1, and rrsP2 DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from pDV27, pDV28 and pDV29, respectively, and both strands radiolabeled through 5′-phosphorylation of primers E7 or J7 using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reconstituted holoenzymes (10 to 30 nm) and the DNA fragments (3 nm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in K-Glu buffer in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a native polyacrylamide (5.5%) gel after the addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (sucrose at 50%, xylene cyanol at 0.5%, bromphenol blue at 0.5%, and heparin at 100 μg/ml). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. DNA was quantified with the phosphorimaging device. Testing of the KMnO4 Reactivity of DNA—Complexes between the labeled promoter regions (5 nm) and the mutant holoenzymes (50 nm) were allowed to form for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of K-Glu buffer. KMnO4 (3 μl, 18 mm) was added and the reaction stopped after 10 s at 37 °C with 3 μl of dithiothreitol (200 mm) and 200 μl of stop buffer (sodium acetate at 0.4 m, EDTA at 2.5 mm, and salmon sperm DNA at 60 μg/ml). The samples were treated with phenol and the DNA precipitated with absolute ethanol and washed with ethanol (70%). The precipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of piperidine (1 m), heated for 30 min at 90 °C, evaporated to dryness, and washed with 20 μl of water twice. The samples were resuspended in 10 μl of formamide containing 20 mm EDTA, bromphenol, and xylene cyanol blue. After heating to 90 °C, samples (5 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide (8%) gel, followed by autoradiography and imaging with a phosphorimaging device. Molecular Modeling—Modeling using the C-α backbone of the Thermus thermophilus holoenzyme structure (27Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1IW7) was done as previously described (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Alteration of Several but Not All Amino Acids Constituting the Typical B. fragilis σA Signature Affects the Transcriptional Activity of the Holoenzyme—To study the functional relevance of structural features of σA described previously (11Vingadassalom D. Kolb A. Mayer C. Rybkine T. Collatz E. Podglajen I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 888-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we constructed 11 mutants with changes in several of the 35 amino acids that make up the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi σA signature. Two mutants, ΔNBS and NAS, were altered in the N-terminal segment; a segment of 12 N-terminal amino acids was deleted in ΔNBS and replaced by an acidic segment (R2E, K5E, and K8E) in NAS (Fig. 1A). The nine remaining mutants were point mutants, D19A and D19R in region 1.2, F61L in region 2.1, Q116A and Q116R in region 2.4, G133E in region 3.0, H179P in region 3.2, and L256V and K265E in region 4.2; the underlined amino acids are those conserved in the corresponding positions in almost all –35 and –10 box-recognizing primary σ factors (13Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 335: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The activities of the holoenzymes reconstituted with the individual σ mutants and tested on supercoiled DNA in multiple round runoff transcription using promoters P942, rrsP1, and rrsP2 (Fig. 1B) are shown in Fig. 2. The presence of σA mutants ΔNBS, NAS, and H179P entailed a reduction in transcriptional activity between ∼40 and 60%, whereas that of mutants F61L and K265E all but abolished this activity. Mutants D19A, D19R, Q116A, Q116R, G133E, and L256V were at least as active as WTσA, and there were no important promoter-dependent differences in the relative transcriptional activities except for rare ∼20–50% increases with P942 or rrsP1 (Fig. 2B). Very similar results were obtained with all mutants in single round runoff transcription (data not shown).FIGURE 2Relative transcriptional activities of wild type- and mutant σA-containing holoenzyme of B. fragilis. Runoff transcription was assayed in vitro on supercoiled templates containing promoters P942, rrsP1, and rrsP2. A, transcripts as visualized by autoradiography after electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. B, densitometric quantification of transcripts from three independent assays. Activities were normalized with respect to the activities determined for the wild type σA-containing holoenzyme. The standard deviations are indicated. The amounts of labeled UMP incorporated by the wild type enzyme into the transcripts initiated at the rrsP2, rrsP1, and P942 were, respectively, 15, 8, and 5 mmol/mol of UTP added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To rule out the possibility that the altered transcriptional activities of ΔNBS, NAS, F61L, H179P, and K265E were connected with substantial disturbance of the global folding of the σA mutants or of their binding to the RNAP core, we carried out limited proteolysis with trypsin and assayed σ-core binding in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. No gross differences between the digestion patterns of WT σA and the mutants and notably of the most affected, F61L and K265E, were observed, with the exception of NAS (supplemental Fig. S1). Digestion of this mutant yielded a fragment with an apparent molecular weight of ∼22 kDa, with the N-terminal sequence MEQLE as determined by Edman degradation (the analysis was carried out at the Plate-forme Analyse et Microséquençage des Protéines, Pasteur Institute). The particular migration of this fragment is suspected to result from decreased SDS binding due to its high negative charge. The size of its wild type equivalent of ∼20 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1) is compatible with proteolysis at the σ3.2 loop of the linker domain (28Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester-Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and its variant migration behavior is therefore not considered to reflect an alteration of the mutant protein structure. There were also no notable alterations in the amounts of core RNAP that were bound by the σA mutants (supplemental Fig. S2). These observations then suggested that the residues, the replacement of which resulted in reduced transcriptional activity, should be involved in steps at or after holoenzyme binding to DNA. To study open complex formation in greater detail, runoff transcription was carried out with linear templates. Although the absolute amounts of transcript were reduced ∼2-fold (data not shown), the relative amounts with respect to the wild type holoenzyme were hardly altered (compare Figs. 2 and 4; see below). Heparin-resistant Complex Formation Is Not Correlated with Transcriptional Activity of ΔNBS-containing Holoenzyme—The binding of holoenzyme reconstituted with σA mutants to radiolabeled DNA fragments containing promoters P942, rrsP1, or rrsP2 was tested for in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay after treatment of the preformed complexes with heparin. The fractions of bound DNA (Fig. 3A) were measured and normalized with respect to the DNA bound by the WT holoenzyme (Fig. 3B). Promoter binding of the holoenzyme was only marginally affected when H179P, which afforded a close to 40% reduction in transcriptional activity, was present. The reduction in transcriptional activity in the presence of mutants NAS and F61L was accompanied by a substantial reduction in promoter binding, although there was no perfect correlation between the two activities. On the other hand, in the presence of mutant K265E, there was no promoter binding and no transcriptional activity. Mutant ΔNBS displayed an unexpected behavior, in that promoter binding in its presence was increased by factors between 2 and 3.5 (depending on the individual promoter tested; see Fig. 3B), whereas the transcriptional activity was reduced by almost one-half (Fig. 2). This suggested the possibility that the formation of unusually heparin-resistant complexes resulted in impaired initiation or elongation or both. Holoenzyme with ΔNBS, F61L, or K265E Synthesizes Disproportionately High Amounts of Abortive Transcripts—Abortive transcription was assayed with linear template containing rrsP2, the only promoter (of the three used in this study) that supported transcription initiation with a dinucleotide, i.e. ApG. Trinucleotide (ApGpU) synthesis, as related to overall transcriptional activity, is shown in Fig. 4. Although runoff and abortive transcriptional activities were reduced in similar proportions when NAS or H179P were present (∼40%), abortive transcription with mutants F61L and K265E was substantially less reduced (∼35–50%) than runoff transcription (90–95%).
