https://openalex.org/W3026019136,"A hexanucleotide-repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic variant that contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia1,2. The C9ORF72 mutation acts through gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms to induce pathways that are implicated in neural degeneration3-9. The expansion is transcribed into a long repetitive RNA, which negatively sequesters RNA-binding proteins5 before its non-canonical translation into neural-toxic dipeptide proteins3,4. The failure of RNA polymerase to read through the mutation also reduces the abundance of the endogenous C9ORF72 gene product, which functions in endolysosomal pathways and suppresses systemic and neural inflammation6-9. Notably, the effects of the repeat expansion act with incomplete penetrance in families with a high prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia, indicating that either genetic or environmental factors modify the risk of disease for each individual. Identifying disease modifiers is of considerable translational interest, as it could suggest strategies to diminish the risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia, or to slow progression. Here we report that an environment with reduced abundance of immune-stimulating bacteria10,11 protects C9orf72-mutant mice from premature mortality and significantly ameliorates their underlying systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. Consistent with C9orf72 functioning to prevent microbiota from inducing a pathological inflammatory response, we found that reducing the microbial burden in mutant mice with broad spectrum antibiotics-as well as transplanting gut microflora from a protective environment-attenuated inflammatory phenotypes, even after their onset. Our studies provide further evidence that the microbial composition of our gut has an important role in brain health and can interact in surprising ways with well-known genetic risk factors for disorders of the nervous system."

Here we describe a CRISPR–Cas9-based synchronous programmable adenine and cytosine editor (SPACE) that can concurrently introduce A-to-G and C-to-T substitutions with minimal RNA off-target edits. SPACE expands the range of possible DNA sequence alterations, broadening the research applications of CRISPR base editors. A base editor that concurrently modifies both adenine and cytosine broadens the potential applications of base editing."

https://openalex.org/W3030239116,"New methods for investigating human astrocytes are urgently needed, given their critical role in the central nervous system. Here we show that CD49f is a novel marker for human astrocytes, expressed in fetal and adult brains from healthy and diseased individuals. CD49f can be used to purify fetal astrocytes and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes. We provide single-cell and bulk transcriptome analyses of CD49f+ hiPSC-astrocytes and demonstrate that they perform key astrocytic functions in vitro, including trophic support of neurons, glutamate uptake, and phagocytosis. Notably, CD49f+ hiPSC-astrocytes respond to inflammatory stimuli, acquiring an A1-like reactive state, in which they display impaired phagocytosis and glutamate uptake and fail to support neuronal maturation. Most importantly, we show that conditioned medium from human reactive A1-like astrocytes is toxic to human and rodent neurons. CD49f+ hiPSC-astrocytes are thus a valuable resource for investigating human astrocyte function and dysfunction in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3031103936,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) perform diverse roles and can modulate therapy responses1. The inflammatory environment within tumours also influences responses to many therapies, including the efficacy of oncolytic viruses2; however, the role of CAFs in this context remains unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the cell signalling triggered by heterotypic cancer cell-fibroblast contacts and about what activates fibroblasts to express inflammatory mediators1,3. Here, we show that direct contact between cancer cells and CAFs triggers the expression of a wide range of inflammatory modulators by fibroblasts. This is initiated following transcytosis of cytoplasm from cancer cells into fibroblasts, leading to the activation of STING and IRF3-mediated expression of interferon-β1 and other cytokines. Interferon-β1 then drives interferon-stimulated transcriptional programs in both cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts and ultimately undermines the efficacy of oncolytic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo. Further, targeting IRF3 solely in stromal fibroblasts restores oncolytic herpes simplex virus function."

https://openalex.org/W3032032492,"Most drugs acting on G-protein-coupled receptors target the orthosteric binding pocket where the native hormone or neurotransmitter binds. There is much interest in finding allosteric ligands for these targets because they modulate physiologic signaling and promise to be more selective than orthosteric ligands. Here we describe a newly developed allosteric modulator of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), AS408, that binds to the membrane-facing surface of transmembrane segments 3 and 5, as revealed by X-ray crystallography. AS408 disrupts a water-mediated polar network involving E1223.41 and the backbone carbonyls of V2065.45 and S2075.46. The AS408 binding site is adjacent to a previously identified molecular switch for β2AR activation formed by I3.40, P5.50 and F6.44. The structure reveals how AS408 stabilizes the inactive conformation of this switch, thereby acting as a negative allosteric modulator for agonists and positive allosteric modulator for inverse agonists. A negative allosteric modulator of the G-protein-coupled receptor β2-adrenergic receptor binds to a membrane-facing surface adjacent to a molecular switch for receptor activation, and its binding disrupts a water-mediated polar network stabilizing an inactive switch conformation."
https://openalex.org/W3032034681,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) is commonly overexpressed in human cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). While Pin1 is dispensable for viability in mice, it is required for activated Ras to induce tumorigenesis, suggesting a role for Pin1 inhibitors in Ras-driven tumors, such as PDAC. We report the development of rationally designed peptide inhibitors that covalently target Cys113, a highly conserved cysteine located in the Pin1 active site. The inhibitors were iteratively optimized for potency, selectivity and cell permeability to give BJP-06-005-3, a versatile tool compound with which to probe Pin1 biology and interrogate its role in cancer. In parallel to inhibitor development, we employed genetic and chemical-genetic strategies to assess the consequences of Pin1 loss in human PDAC cell lines. We demonstrate that Pin1 cooperates with mutant KRAS to promote transformation in PDAC, and that Pin1 inhibition impairs cell viability over time in PDAC cell lines."

However, the roles of specific tsRNAs in early embryo development remain to be elucidated. Here, using pigs as a research model, we probed the tsRNA dynamics during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation and demonstrated the delivery of tsRNAs from semen-derived exosomes to spermatozoa. By microinjection of antisense sequences into in vitro fertilized oocytes and subsequent single-cell RNA-seq of embryos, we identified a specific functional tsRNA group (termed here Gln-TTGs) that participate in the early cleavage of porcine preimplantation embryos, probably by regulating cell cycle–associated genes and retrotransposons.

We conclude that specific tsRNAs present in mature spermatozoa play significant roles in preimplantation embryo development. Couples suffering from male factor infertility are often treated by testicular sperm extraction followed by oocyte fertilization using intracellular sperm injection (ICSI). However, this treatment completely bypasses the final stage of sperm maturation that takes place in the epididymis and involves uptake of small RNA molecules that are carried over to the zygote through fertilization (1Zhou W. De Iuliis G.N. Dun M.D. Nixon B. Characteristics of the epididymal luminal environment responsible for sperm maturation and storage.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2018; 9 (29541061): 5910.3389/fendo.2018.00059Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The nature and function of these small RNAs during fertilization and early embryo development have not yet been sufficiently investigated. One of the most well-known groups of RNA molecules are transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which have a well-defined role in transferring amino acids during translation (2Hoagland M.B. Stephenson M.L. Scott J.F.

However, much less known, tRNAs can be processed to form tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). Emerging evidence has demonstrated that these tsRNAs are present in various cell types and able to regulate RNA stability, translation, stress response, and cell proliferation (3Thompson D.M. Lu C. Green P.J. Parker R. tRNA cleavage is a conserved response to oxidative stress in eukaryotes.RNA. 2008; 14 (18719243): 2095-210310.1261/rna.1232808Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Spermatogenesis is a complex process involving proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia, the meiotic divisions of spermatocytes, and spermiogenesis. During the spermiogenesis stage, the haploid round spermatids undergo dramatic morphological and cellular changes to form the highly specialized elongated spermatids and finally form spermatozoa (4Mistry B.V.

Although they can be used to fertilize oocytes via ICSI, these testicular spermatozoa normally first leave the testis to the epididymis to further mature into fully functional spermatozoa (5Jan S.Z.

As a family of transposable elements, mouse endogenous retrovirus type L (MERVL) drives the expression of transcripts specific to embryo genomic activation (EGA) and totipotency (15Macfarlan T.S.

Previous studies have shown that depletion of sperm tsRNAs could derepress MERVL-linked genes (6Sharma U. Conine C.C. Shea J.M. Boskovic A. Derr A.G. Bing X.Y. Belleannee C. Kucukural A. Serra R.W.

Pigs (Sus scrofa) are increasingly utilized as a large-animal model in biomedical research (17Swindle M.M. Makin A. Herron A.J. Clubb F.J. Frazier K.S. Swine as models in biomedical research and toxicology testing.Vet. Pathol. 2012; 49 (21441112): 344-35610.1177/0300985811402846Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is relatively easy to collect the porcine epididymis and ejaculated spermatozoa. We therefore used pigs as model animals to study the tsRNA dynamics during spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, and embryo development. We found that tRNAGln-TTG–derived small RNAs (Gln-TTGs) were highly enriched in ejaculated spermatozoa and that Gln-TTGs played a role during the early cleavage stages of embryo development. Hence, our findings demonstrate that a spermatozoon confers specific tsRNAs to the zygote that play significant roles during preimplantation embryo development. To uncover the expression profiles of tsRNAs in porcine spermatogenic cells and ejaculated spermatozoa, we first analyzed the small RNA-seq data generated from porcine spermatogonia (SG), pachytene spermatocytes (PS), round spermatids (RS), and ejaculated spermatozoa (SP) in our previous study (18Chen X.X.

Of these, the tsRNA sizes range from 25 to 35 nt (Fig. 1, A–D, and Table S1), with 2.1, 2.8, 4.4, and 7.2% falling into the category of tsRNAs in SG, PS, RS, and SP, respectively (Fig. 2A). We then analyzed the derivation of tsRNAs. The majority of these tsRNAs (85–88%) were derived from the 5′ end of tRNAs (Fig. 2B), and tRNAs with the uniform 5′ sequence could produce seven tsRNA families with the uniform 5′ sequence but marginally differing at the 3′ end of the sequence (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Profiling of composition of small RNAs during porcine spermatogenesis.

In contrast, our analysis revealed that Glu-CTCs and Gly-GCCs were moderately present in all porcine testicular germ cells and ejaculated spermatozoa (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we specifically identified that one tsRNA family, tRNAGln-TTG–derived small RNAs (Gln-TTGs), were only moderately expressed in testicular germ cells but highly enriched in ejaculated spermatozoa (Fig. 3A). Gln-TTGs were derived from two subfamilies of tRNAGln-TTG, i.e. tRNATGln-TTG and tRNAGGln-TTG, which only differ in one nucleotide at the ninth position (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the cleavage sites showed that most cleavages occurred at positions 32–34 flanking the anticodon loop to generate the 32–34-nt tsRNAs (Fig. 3B and Table S2), indicating that these tRNAs are cleaved by specific enzymes rather than random tRNA degradation. The enrichment of tsRNAs in ejaculated spermatozoa prompted us to investigate the dynamics of tsRNAs during sperm maturation using the caput, cauda epididymal, and ejaculated spermatozoa from the same individuals (Fig. 4A). We found that the percentage of tsRNAs among all small RNAs decreased from 19.5 to 16.1% during the transit from caput to cauda epididymis (not statistically significant, Fig. 4B). Then the percentage of tsRNAs among all small RNAs further decreased to 10% in the ejaculated spermatozoa (p < 0.01), significantly different from that in caput spermatozoa (Fig. 4B, p < 0.05). Because 5′ end tsRNAs were mainly present in spermatogenic cells and spermatozoa (Fig. 2B), we turned to analyze their dynamics. Intriguingly, the analysis revealed that 5′ end tsRNAs had a significant drop (∼13%, p < 0.05) during maturation in epididymis, followed by a significant increase (∼7%, p < 0.05) after ejaculation (Fig. 4C), suggesting the gain of 5′ end tsRNAs in the ejaculated spermatozoa. We also observed that Gln-TTGs were significantly enriched in the ejaculated spermatozoa (Fig. 4D), which was further confirmed by a qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4E, p < 0.05). Next, we isolated exosomes from the caput, corpus, cauda epididymis, and semen (Fig. 5A), and characterized their small RNA payload by an RNA-seq analysis. This revealed that miRNA abundance experienced an increase from caput to cauda exosomes and reached 31% in semen exosomes. By contrast, tsRNA abundance increased from caput (7.5%) to cauda (59.6%) but decreased in semen exosomes (9.9%, Fig. 5B). Notably, 5′ end tsRNAs consistently dominated the tsRNA population (over 90%) in the exosomes from epididymis and declined in semen exosomes (67.8%, Fig. 5C). Nonetheless, tsRNA and miRNA expression profiles in spermatozoa were significantly correlated with those in the corresponding exosomes, as shown by the Spearman's correlation analysis (r2 = 0.58–0.77; p < 2.2e-16, Fig. 5D). Hence, semen exosomes, in addition to exosomes from the epididymis, may also deliver tsRNAs to spermatozoa. To pinpoint this, we incubated the cauda spermatozoa with semen exosomes or without semen exosome incubation. Later, we detected the abundance of tsRNAs in caput, cauda, and ejaculated spermatozoa. Like Gln-TTGs (Fig. 4D), Glu-CTCs and Gly-GCCs were enriched in the ejaculated spermatozoa (Fig. 6, A and B), and all three tsRNA categories could be efficiently shaped by semen exosome incubation (Fig. 6C). Overall, our data demonstrate that semen exosomes can deliver tsRNAs to spermatozoa. Subsequently, we explored the roles of sperm tsRNAs in fertilized oocytes. We first determined the abundance of tsRNAs in IVF oocytes during oocyte maturation and early embryo development. The results revealed that Glu-CTCs and Gly-GCCs were moderately up-regulated from MII to the two-cell stage (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, Glu-CTCs and Gly-GCCs were increased from the two-cell stage to the four-cell stage (Fig. 7A). However, Gln-TTGs displayed distinct dynamic changes, i.e. they were considerably down-regulated from MII to the one-cell stage and then remained stable (Fig. 7A). Next, we microinjected 20 μm of the synthesized Glu-CTCs, Gly-GCCs, and Gln-TTGs (overexpression (OE) group); the antisense oligonucleotides of Glu-CTCs, Gly-GCCs, and Gln-TTGs (Anti group); or the scrambled sequence (NC group) into porcine IVF oocytes. We found that the rates of two-cell, four-cell, and blastocyst embryos decreased in the Anti Gln-TTG group (Fig. 7B), whereas depletion of Glu-CTCs or Gly-GCCs had no significant impact on embryo development (Fig. 7C). The reduced rates of embryos at the four-cell and blastocyst stages in the Anti-Gln-TTG group might be attributed to the aberrant first cleavage and therefore the affected two-cell embryos. To exclude the possibility of the artifact caused by excessive exogenous RNAs, we set 10 μm (half of the initial concentration) and 2 μm (amounting to the total RNAs from ∼10 spermatozoa) of RNAs for microinjection (13Chen Q. Yan M.H. Cao Z.H. Li X. Zhang Y.F. Shi J.C. Feng G.H. Peng H.Y. Zhang X.D. Zhang Y. Qian J.J. Duan E.K. Zhai Q.W. Zhou Q. Sperm tsRNAs contribute to intergenerational inheritance of an acquired metabolic disorder.Science. 2016; 351 (26721680): 397-40010.1126/science.aad7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Consistently, the reduced concentrations of the antisense sequence of Gln-TTGs led to a similar decrease in the two-cell rate (Fig. 7D). To substantiate the specificity of the observed phenotype, we later conducted a rescue experiment for Gln-TTGs and found that either microinjection of the antisense oligonucleotides (Anti group) followed by the synthesized Gln-TTGs (OE group) or injection of the synthesized Gln-TTGs (OE group) followed by the antisense oligonucleotides (Anti group) could mitigate the effects induced by these RNAs alone (Fig. 7E). In addition, the cleavage rate did not significantly change when the antisense sequence annealed with the sense sequence was injected (Fig. 7E). The overall data thus demonstrate that sperm Gln-TTGs regulate the first cleavage of porcine IVF oocytes. To probe the underlying mechanisms for the reduced cleavage rate in the Anti Gln-TTG-IVF oocytes, we performed a single-cell RNA-seq analysis for the Anti Gln-TTG group versus the NC group in two-cell IVF oocytes. This analysis identified 717 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 335 were up-regulated and 382 were down-regulated in the Anti-IVF group (Fig. 8A and Table S3). Gene ontology (GO)–biological process annotation analysis indicated that DEGs in the Anti-IVF group were predominantly linked to cell cycle–associated processes including organelle fission, nuclear division, mitotic cell cycle process, and organelle organization (Fig. 8B), lending further support to the notion that depletion of Gln-TTGs in IVF oocytes causes aberrant cell cycle progress. Retrotransposon expression is a conventional event in preimplantation embryos (20Göke J. Lu X.Y. Chan Y.S. Ng H.H. Ly L.H. Sachs F. Szczerbinska I.

It has been reported that microinjection of the antisense oligonucleotides of Gly-GCCs into zygotes activated ERVs, a family of transposons (6Sharma U. Conine C.C. Shea J.M. Boskovic A. Derr A.G.

We therefore analyzed the expression of transposons upon Gln-TTG depletion. Overall, the global transcriptomic composition of transposons in the Anti group resembled that in the NC group (Fig. 8B). Further analysis revealed 16 differentially expressed transposons in the Anti-IVF group (Fig. 8C). Of the four REs (LTR4D_SS, LTR6_SS, MLT1I-int, and L1M3b) differentially expressed in the Anti-IVF group (Fig. 8D), LTR4D_SS and L1M3b were predicted to be potential targets of Gln-TTGs by miRanda (Fig. 8E), suggesting potential regulatory roles of Gln-TTGs in retrotransposons (21Luo S.

To gain insights into the potential interaction between Gln-TTGs and proteins in embryos, we conducted a Gln-TTG RNA-protein pulldown followed by LC–MS/MS. Because an RNA-protein pulldown requires a large number of embryos, the experiment was instead performed with mature porcine oocytes. Of the proteins pulled down by the synthesized Gln-TTGs, RNA- (e.g. HNRNPA2B1, IGF2BP3, and EF1A1) and DNA-binding proteins (e.g. YBX2) were clearly identified (Table S4).

https://openalex.org/W3028650102,"Tissue remodelling during Drosophila embryogenesis is notably driven by epithelial cell contractility. This behaviour arises from the Rho1–Rok-induced pulsatile accumulation of non-muscle myosin II pulling on actin filaments of the medioapical cortex. While recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms governing the emergence of Rho1–Rok–myosin II pulsatility, little is known about how F-actin organization influences this process. Here, we show that the medioapical cortex consists of two entangled F-actin subpopulations. One exhibits pulsatile dynamics of actin polymerization in a Rho1-dependent manner. The other forms a persistent and homogeneous network independent of Rho1. We identify the formin Frl (also known as Fmnl) as a critical nucleator of the persistent network, since modulating its level in mutants or by overexpression decreases or increases the network density. Absence of this network yields sparse connectivity affecting the homogeneous force transmission to the cell boundaries. This reduces the propagation range of contractile forces and results in tissue-scale morphogenetic defects. Dehapiot et al. show two actin networks at the cell surface in Drosophila embryos. While the pulsatile network controls local deformation, the Frl-dependent persistent network promotes force propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3029395773,"Several nucleoside antibiotics are structurally characterized by a 5″-amino-5″-deoxyribose (ADR) appended via a glycosidic bond to a high-carbon sugar nucleoside (5'S,6'S)-5'-C-glycyluridine (GlyU). GlyU is further modified with an N-alkylamine linker, the biosynthetic origin of which has yet to be established. By using a combination of feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors and characterization of recombinant proteins from multiple pathways, the biosynthetic mechanism for N-alkylamine installation for ADR-GlyU-containing nucleoside antibiotics has been uncovered. The data reveal S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the direct precursor of the N-alkylamine, but, unlike conventional AdoMet- or decarboxylated AdoMet-dependent alkyltransferases, the reaction is catalyzed by a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent aminobutyryltransferase (ABTase) using a stepwise γ-replacement mechanism that couples γ-elimination of AdoMet with aza-γ-addition onto the disaccharide alkyl acceptor. In addition to using a conceptually different strategy for AdoMet-dependent alkylation, the newly discovered ABTases require a phosphorylated disaccharide alkyl acceptor, revealing a cryptic intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3032221447,"Changes in the cellular environment modulate protein energy landscapes to drive important biology, with consequences for signaling, allostery and other vital processes. The effects of ubiquitination are particularly important because of their potential influence on degradation by the 26S proteasome. Moreover, proteasomal engagement requires unstructured initiation regions that many known proteasome substrates lack. To assess the energetic effects of ubiquitination and how these manifest at the proteasome, we developed a generalizable strategy to produce isopeptide-linked ubiquitin within structured regions of a protein. The effects on the energy landscape vary from negligible to dramatic, depending on the protein and site of ubiquitination. Ubiquitination at sensitive sites destabilizes the native structure and increases the rate of proteasomal degradation. In well-folded proteins, ubiquitination can even induce the requisite unstructured regions needed for proteasomal engagement. Our results indicate a biophysical role of site-specific ubiquitination as a potential regulatory mechanism for energy-dependent substrate degradation."

Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4) plays oncological roles in various solid tumors. Herein, we examined TRPM4 protein expression profile by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in breast cancer cases compared with normal breast ducts, its association with clinico-demographical parameters, and its potential function in breast cancers by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Data-mining demonstrated that TRPM4 transcript levels were significantly higher in The Cancer Genome Atlas series of breast cancer cases (n = 1,085) compared with normal breast tissues (n = 112) (p = 1.03 x 10-11). Our IHC findings in tissue microarrays showed that TRPM4 protein was overexpressed in breast cancers (n = 83/99 TRPM4+; 83.8%) compared with normal breast ducts (n = 5/10 TRPM4+; 50%) (p = 0.022). Higher TRPM4 expression (median frequency cut-off) was significantly associated with higher lymph node status (N1-N2 vs N0; p = 0.024) and higher stage (IIb-IIIb vs I-IIa; p = 0.005). GSEA evaluation in three independent gene expression profiling (GEP) datasets of breast cancer cases (GSE54002, n = 417; GSE20685, n = 327; GSE23720, n = 197) demonstrated significant association of TRPM4 transcript expression with estrogen response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene sets (p<0.01 and false discovery rate<0.05). These gene sets were not enriched in GEP datasets of normal breast epithelium cases (GSE10797, n = 5; GSE9574, n = 15; GSE20437, n = 18). In conclusion, TRPM4 protein expression is upregulated in breast cancers associated with worse clinico-demographical parameters, and TRPM4 potentially regulates estrogen receptor signaling and EMT progression in breast cancer."

The present study was, therefore, undertaken to understand the spatial distribution pattern of available micronutrients (zinc (Zn), boron (B), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu)), available sulphur (S), and soil properties (soil acidity (pH), electrical conductivity (EC) and organic carbon (SOC) content) in soils of intensively cultivated Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India and to delineate soil MZs for efficient management of soil nutrients. Totally, 55101 soil samples from 0-15 cm depth were obtained from 167 districts of IGP during 2014 to 2017 and were analysed for different soil parameters. Soil pH, EC and SOC content varied from 4.44 to 9.80, 0.02 to 2.13 dS m-1 and 0.10 to 1.99%, respectively. The concentration of available Zn, B, Fe, Mn, Cu and S varied from 0.01 to 3.27, 0.01 to 3.51, 0.19 to 55.7, 0.05 to 49.0, 0.01 to 5.29 and 1.01 to 108 mg kg-1, respectively. Geostatistical analysis resulted in varied distribution pattern of studied soil parameters with moderate to strong spatial dependence. The extent (% area) of nutrient deficiencies in IGP followed the order: S > Zn > B > Mn > Cu > Fe.

The developed MZ maps could also be utilized for prioritization and rationalization of nutrients supply in IGP of India."

The purpose was to investigate the deep and superficial neck extensor muscles with peri-traumatic computed tomography (CT) and longitudinal measures of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in participants with varying levels of whiplash-related disability. Thirty-six underwent standard care imaging of the cervical spine with CT at a level-1 trauma designated emergency department. All 36 participants were assessed with MRI of the cervical spine at <1-week, 2-weeks, 3-, and 12-months post-injury and classified into three groups using initial pain severity and percentage scores on the Neck Disability Index (recovered (NDI of 0–8%), mild (NDI of 10–28%), or severe (NDI ≥ 30%)) at 3-months post MVC. CT muscle attenuation values were significantly correlated to muscle fat infiltration (MFI) on MRI at one-week post MVC. There was no significant difference in muscle attenuation across groups at the time of enrollment. A trend of lower muscle attenuation in the deep compared to the superficial extensors was observed in the severe group. MFI values in the deep muscles on MRI were significantly higher in the severe group when compared to the mild group at 1-year post MVC. This study provides further evidence that the magnitude of 1) deep MFI appears unique to those at risk of and eventually transitioning to chronic WAD and that 2) pre- or peri-traumatic muscular health, determined by CT muscle attenuation, may be contribute to our understanding of long-term recovery."

Design Prospective cohort study Setting We recruited from 12 obstetrical, family medicine, and midwifery centers in Ontario, Canada Participants We recruited English-speaking women with singleton pregnancies between 8+0–20+6 weeks. Of 1296 women approached, 1050 were recruited (81%). Of those, 970 women had complete data (970/1050, 92%) and were recruited at a mean of 14.8 weeks. Primary outcome measure We collected data on psychological, physical, and social factors and used stepwise logistic regression analysis to develop a multivariable model predicting our primary outcome of excess pregnancy weight gain, with random selection of 2/3 of women for training data and 1/3 for testing data. Results Nine variables were included in the final model to predict excess pregnancy weight gain. These included nulliparity, being overweight, planning excessive gain, eating in front of a screen, low self-efficacy regarding pregnancy weight gain, thinking family or friends believe pregnant women should eat twice as much as before pregnancy, being agreeable, and having emotion control difficulties. Training and testing data yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.80) and 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.68), respectively. Conclusions In this first validated prediction model in early pregnancy, we found that nine psychological, physical, and social factors moderately predicted excess pregnancy weight gain in the final model. This research highlights the importance of several predictors, including relatively easily modifiable ones such as appropriate weight gain plans and mindfulness during eating, and lays an important methodological foundation for other future prediction models."

Therefore, in order to shorten no-flow times in cardiac arrest, several police-based first responder systems equipped with automated external defibrillators (Pol-AED) were established in urban areas, which subsequently allow early BLS and AED administration by police officers. However, data on the quality of BLS and AED use in such a system and its impact on patient outcome remain scarce and inconclusive. Methods A total of 85 Pol-AED cases were randomly assigned to a gender, age and first rhythm matched non-Pol-AED control group (n = 170) in a 1:2 ratio. Data on quality of BLS were extracted via trans-thoracic impedance tracings of used AED devices. Results Comparing Pol-AED cases and the control group, we observed a similar compression rate per minute (p = 0.677) and compression ratio (p = 0.651), mirroring an overall high quality of BLS administered by police officers. Time to the first shock was significantly shorter in Pol-AED cases (6 minutes [IQR: 2–10] vs. 12 minutes [IQR: 8–17]; p<0.001). While Pol-AED was not associated with increased sustained return of spontaneous circulation (p = 0.564), a strong and independent impact on survival until hospital discharge (adj. OR: 1.85 [95%CI: 1.06–3.23; p = 0.030]) and a borderline significance for the association with favorable neurological outcome (adj. OR: 1.58 [95%CI: 0.96–2.89; p = 0.052) were observed. Conclusion We were able to demonstrate an early start and a high quality of BLS and AED use in Pol-AED assessed OHCA cases. Moreover, the presence of Pol-AED care was associated with better patient survival and borderline significance for favorable neurological outcome."

RJ has been used in cosmetics, beverages, medicines, and supplements worldwide. However, allergy is a concerning issue for RJ, especially in atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma patients. In some cases, allergic reactions are seen after the first intake of RJ, suggesting the existence of allergens cross-reactive with RJ. Information about the cross-reactive allergens is very important for the safe application of RJ; however, study of this cross-reactivity is quite limited. In this study, we attempted to identify allergens cross-reactive with RJ by using serum samples from 30 AD patients who had never been exposed to RJ. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiment, RJ-binding IgE antibodies were detected in the serum of 10 out of 30 patients, and their antibody titers ranged from 4- to 2,048-fold dilution ratios. Additionally, 3 AD patients were determined to be positive in a skin-prick test (SPT) with an RJ solution. Significant correlations were observed between the anti-RJ antibody titer and nonspecific IgE and between the anti-RJ antibody titer and the Eczema Area and Severity Index score. We further examined the cross-reactivity between RJ and 14 typical allergens by using an ELISA-inhibition assay and demonstrated that the following 6 allergens showed cross-reactivity with RJ: the European house dust mite (HDM) (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), American HDM (Dermatophagoides farinae), snow crab (Chionocetes spp.), edible crab (Cancer pagurus), German cockroach (Blatella germanica), and honeybee venom (Apis mellifera).

Mechanistically, CHIR-124 (a potent inhibitor of Chk1 kinase) inhibited Pgp activity in both multidrug-resistant cell lines (KB-V1 and A2780-Pac-Res) as determined through cell-based Pgp-efflux assays. Other three inhibitors on the contrary, were effective in Pgp-overexpressing resistant cells without increasing the cellular accumulation of a Pgp substrate, indicating that they overcome resistance by avoiding efflux through Pgp. None of these compounds modulated the expression of Pgp in resistant cell lines. PIK-75, a PI3 Kinase inhibitor, was also determined to inhibit Pgp activity, despite being equally potent in only one of the two pairs of resistant and parental cell lines. Strong binding of both CHIR-124 and PIK-75 to Pgp was predicted through docking studies and both compounds inhibited Pgp in a biochemical assay. The inhibition of Pgp causes accumulation of these compounds in the cells where they can modulate the function of their target proteins and thereby inhibit cell proliferation. In conclusion, we have identified compounds with various cellular targets that overcome multidrug resistance in Pgp-overexpressing cell lines through mechanisms that include Pgp inhibition and efflux evasion. These compounds, therefore, can avoid challenges associated with the co-administration of Pgp inhibitors with chemotherapeutic or targeted drugs such as additive toxicities and differing pharmacokinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W3028968840,"Prodigiosin is an important secondary metabolite produced by Serratia marcescens. It can help strains resist stresses from other microorganisms and environmental factors to achieve self-preservation. Prodigiosin is also a promising secondary metabolite due to its pharmacological characteristics. However, pigmentless S. marcescens mutants always emerge after prolonged starvation, which might be a way for the bacteria to adapt to starvation conditions, but it could be a major problem in the industrial application of S. marcescens. To identify the molecular mechanisms of loss of prodigiosin production, two mutants were isolated after 16 days of prolonged incubation of wild-type (WT) S. marcescens 1912768R; one mutant (named 1912768WR) exhibited reduced production of prodigiosin, and a second mutant (named 1912768W) was totally defective. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the two mutants had either mutations or deletions in rpoS. Knockout of rpoS in S. marcescens 1912768R had pleiotropic effects. Complementation of rpoS in the ΔrpoS mutant further confirmed that RpoS was a positive regulator of prodigiosin production and that its regulatory role in prodigiosin biosynthesis was opposite that in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006, which had a different type of pig cluster; further, rpoS from Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 and other strains complemented the prodigiosin defect of the ΔrpoS mutant, suggesting that the pig promoters are more important than the genes in the regulation of prodigiosin production. Deletion of rpoS strongly impaired the resistance of S. marcescens to stresses but increased membrane permeability for nutritional competence; competition assays in rich and minimum media showed that the ΔrpoS mutant outcompeted its isogenic WT strain. All these data support the idea that RpoS is pleiotropic and that the loss of prodigiosin biosynthesis in S. marcescens 1912768R during prolonged incubation is due to a mutation in rpoS, which appears to be a self-preservation and nutritional competence (SPANC) trade-off."
https://openalex.org/W3029935300,"High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) has become a staple in modern molecular biology, with applications not only in quantifying gene expression but also in isoform-level analysis of the RNA transcripts. To enable such an isoform-level analysis, a transcriptome assembly algorithm is utilized to stitch together the observed short reads into the corresponding transcripts. This task is complicated due to the complexity of alternative splicing - a mechanism by which the same gene may generate multiple distinct RNA transcripts. We develop a novel genome-guided transcriptome assembler, RefShannon, that exploits the varying abundances of the different transcripts, in enabling an accurate reconstruction of the transcripts. Our evaluation shows RefShannon is able to improve sensitivity effectively (up to 22%) at a given specificity in comparison with other state-of-the-art assemblers. RefShannon is written in Python and is available from Github (https://github.com/shunfumao/RefShannon)."
https://openalex.org/W3030857089,"Objectives miR-155 plays a critical role in the inflammatory process and in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). miR155 gene expression is regulated by its gene promoter region CpG island methylation. Previous studies have shown inconsistent changes in circulating levels of mir-155 in RA patients. The aims of our study were to evaluate miR-155 levels in plasma, to investigate its gene methylation level, and to correlate these levels with RA disease activity. Methods One hundred and twenty-five patients with RA, and 30 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Whole blood and plasma samples were collected and stored at -80°C until analysis. DAS28 score at the time of the blood draw was used to assess RA disease activity. The methylation status of miR-155 host gene was determined in whole blood by quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR (qPCR). miR-155 expression levels were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results We found significantly lower circulating miR155 levels in RA patients compared to HC. Interestingly, the miR-155 gene methylation level was significantly higher in RA patients than in HC. miR-155 levels did not correlate with ACPA or RF positivity or disease activity. Conclusions We show here higher miR-155 methylation in whole blood and lower plasma miR155 expression in RA patients in comparison to HC. The evaluation of miR-155 host gene methylation status or miR155 plasma level might be a potentially useful marker in RA determination."
https://openalex.org/W3032618966,"Nitrogen transformation in soil is a complex process and the soil microbial population can regulate the potential for N mineralization, nitrification and denitrification. Here we show that agricultural soils under standard agricultural N-management are consistently characterized by a high presence of gene copies for some of the key biological activities related to the N-cycle. This led to a strong NO3- reduction (75%) passing from the soil surface (15.38 ± 11.36 g N-NO3 kg-1 on average) to the 1 m deep layer (3.92 ± 4.42 g N-NO3 kg-1 on average), and ensured low nitrate presence in the deepest layer. Under these circumstances the other soil properties play a minor role in reducing soil nitrate presence in soil. However, with excessive N fertilization, the abundance of bacterial gene copies is not sufficient to explain N leaching in soil and other factors, i.e. soil texture and rainfall, become more important in controlling these aspects."
https://openalex.org/W3029241522,"Facial expressions in sign languages are used to express grammatical functions, such as question marking, but can also be used to express emotions (either the signer’s own or in constructed action contexts). Emotions and grammatical functions can utilize the same articulators, and the combinations can be congruent or incongruent. For instance, surprise and polar questions can be marked by raised eyebrows, while anger is usually marked by lowered eyebrows. We investigated what happens when different emotions (neutral/surprise/anger) are combined with different sentence types (statement/polar question/wh-question) in Kazakh-Russian Sign Language (KRSL), replicating studies previously made for other sign languages. We asked 9 native signers (5 deaf, 4 hearing children of deaf adults) to sign 10 simple sentences in 9 conditions (3 emotions * 3 sentence types). We used OpenPose software to track eyebrow position in the video recordings. We found that emotions and sentence types influence eyebrow position in KRSL: eyebrows are raised for polar questions and surprise, and lowered for anger. There are also some interactions between the two factors, as well as some differences between hearing and deaf native signers, namely a smaller effect of polar questions for the deaf group, and a different interaction between emotions and wh-question marking in the two groups. We thus find evidence for the complex influences on non-manual behavior in signers of sign languages, and showcase a quantitative approach to this field."
https://openalex.org/W3030849936,"The aim of this study was to determine the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of humic acid (HA) on foxtail millet (Setaria italica Beauv.) under drought conditions. The rainless climate of the Shanxi Province (37°42'N, 112°58'E) in China provides a natural simulation of drought conditions. Two foxtail millet cultivars, Jingu21 and Zhangza10, were cultivated in Shanxi for two consecutive years (2017–2018) based on a split-plot design. Plant growth, grain quality, and mineral elements were analyzed in foxtail millet treated with HA (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg L-1) and those treated with clear water. Transcriptome sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis was performed on plants in the normal control (CK), drought treatment (D), and drought + HA treatment (DHA) groups. Results were verified using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). HA at a concentration of 100–200 mg L-1 caused a significant increase in the yield of foxtail millet and had a positive effect on dry weight and root-shoot ratio. HA also significantly increased P, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mg content in grains. Moreover, a total of 1098 and 409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in group D vs. CK and D vs. DHA, respectively. A protein-protein interaction network and two modules were constructed based on DEGs (such as SETIT_016654mg) between groups D and DHA. These DEGs were mainly enriched in the metabolic pathway. In conclusion, HA (100 mg L-1) was found to promote the growth of foxtail millet under drought conditions. Furthermore, SETIT_016654mg may play a role in the effect of HA on foxtail millet via control of the metabolic pathway. This study lays the foundation for research into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the alleviating effects of HA on foxtail millet under drought conditions."

In this study, we investigated the influence of 4E-BP1 translational apparatus on the regulation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced anabolic signaling in chondrocytes. The level of 4E-BP1 expression was significantly higher in human OA cartilage than normal cartilage. TGF-β1 increased total protein synthesis, including aggrecan (ACAN) and collagen type II (Col II), together with activation of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR silencing significantly suppressed ACAN and Col II expressions through decreasing TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. On the contrary, 4E-BP1 knockdown promoted total protein synthesis but suppressed Col II and ACAN expressions with decreased expression of Smad2/3 and Smad4 and increased expression of inhibitory Smad6 and Smad7. TGF-β1 suppressed the interaction of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E and subsequently enhanced protein synthesis. Furthermore, 4E-BP1 regulated translation levels of inhibitory Smads, which decreased the accumulation of nuclear Smad2/3 complexes on the promoter of ACAN and Col II genes, subsequently affecting transcription of ACAN and Col II. These results demonstrated that TGF-β1-modulated phosphorylation of 4EBP1 plays a role in the expression of Col II and ACAN through differential alteration of Smad signaling pathway."

There is a clear need for biochemical studies with defined components to advance our understanding of the signaling mechanisms of these complex receptors. Peptide agonist binding to CLR follows the class B “two-domain” model in which the C-terminal half of the peptide binds to the CLR extracellular domain (ECD) and the N-terminal half binds the membrane-embedded CLR transmembrane domain (TMD). This is thought to occur in two steps with the first ECD-binding step bringing the N-terminal domain of the agonist in proximity to the TMD, thereby facilitating the second binding event and its resulting activation of the receptor (19Hoare S.R. Mechanisms of peptide and nonpeptide ligand binding to class B G-protein–coupled receptors.Drug Discov.

A disulfide-linked loop structure near the agonist N terminus is required for activation, and truncated peptides that lack this element are competitive antagonists. The RAMPs have an ECD that interacts with the CLR ECD and a single transmembrane helix that contacts the CLR TMD.

In contrast to our growing understanding of RAMP-modulated peptide binding, our knowledge of how the agonists and RAMPs affect CLR transducer interactions is limited. The cryo-EM structures showed how the active state receptors bind Gs, but how the agonists compare in their abilities to promote Gs recruitment and how the RAMPs affect this remain unclear. In addition, the contributions of agonist engagement of each of the two CLR domains to transducer recruitment remain poorly defined. Moreover, the CGRP and AM receptors exhibit pleiotropic G-protein coupling with the ability to also signal through Gq and Gi (27Walker C.S. Conner A.C. Poyner D.R. Hay D.L. Regulation of signal transduction by calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors.Trends Pharmacol.

Two groups used cell-based signaling assays in HEK293 or COS-7 cells to examine this issue and found evidence for either dramatic or subtler ligand- and RAMP-dependent G protein signaling bias (28Garelja M.L.

Differences in these reports may be due to the different cell lines used and/or the inherent challenge of studying the signaling bias of these complex heterodimeric receptors in cell-based assays. Here, we used a biochemical approach to characterize G-protein coupling to the CGRP and AM receptors. We developed a time- and cost-efficient native PAGE assay to assess the formation and thermostabilities of detergent-solubilized, fluorescent protein–tagged CLR·RAMP heterodimers expressed in mammalian cells. Receptor coupling to G proteins was assessed using purified G protein surrogate mini-G (mG) proteins that were developed for structural studies of active state GPCRs (30Carpenter B. Tate C.G.

The Gsα subunit was engineered with several deletions and amino acid substitutions to stabilize it and uncouple receptor binding from nucleotide exchange to create mGs (30Carpenter B. Tate C.G.

Chimeric mGsq and mGsi and mG12 proteins were developed to extend the mG toolkit to all four families of α subunits (31Nehmé R. Carpenter B. Singhal A. Strege A. Edwards P.C. White C.F. Du H. Grisshammer R. Tate C.G.

The mG proteins were shown to be powerful probes for active state GPCRs in living cells (33Wan Q. Okashah N. Inoue A. Nehmé R. Carpenter B. Tate C.G. Lambert N.A. Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells.J. Biol.

We found that agonist-promoted CGRP and AM receptor coupling to mGs was visible as a mobility-shifted quaternary complex gel band in the native PAGE assay, and we used the assay to measure the apparent binding affinities of each agonist for the mGs-coupled receptors and of mGs for each receptor occupied with each agonist. We also characterized receptor coupling to the mGsq and mGsi chimeras. Finally, the value of the native PAGE assay for defining physiologically relevant receptor biochemistry was demonstrated by its ability to predict the cAMP-signaling potencies of novel agonist peptide chimeras. Our results provide important insights into the two-domain agonist-binding and transducer-recruitment mechanism for the CGRP and AM receptors and define how the three agonist peptides and three RAMP accessory proteins control CLR G protein coupling. This work provides a biochemical foundation for understanding commonalities and differences in CGRP, AM, and AM2/IMD signaling through their shared receptors and will aid future structural studies and the development of therapeutic peptide analogs. We designed CLR and RAMP expression constructs with C-terminal EGFP and mCitrine tags, respectively (Fig. 1A). N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) tags were originally included on both subunits for purification purposes, but these tags also seemed to promote more defined bands in native PAGE. We used polyethyleneimine (PEI)–mediated transient transfection to express the MBP–CLR–EGFP and MBP–RAMP–mCitrine constructs in HEK293S GnT1− cells (35Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G. Structure and function in rhodopsin: high-level expression of rhodopsin with restricted and homogeneous N-glycosylation by a tetracycline-inducible N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I–negative HEK293S stable mammalian cell line.Proc.

We reasoned that the homogenous N-glycosylation provided by this cell line would facilitate sharp bands on the native gels. After receptor expression in adherent cultures in 48-well plates, the cells were solubilized with lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG)/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), the lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed in a bench-top microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were analyzed by hrCNE (36Wittig I. Karas M. Schägger H. High resolution clear native electrophoresis for in-gel functional assays and fluorescence studies of membrane protein complexes.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6 (17426019): 1215-122510.1074/mcp.M700076-MCP200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) with visualization of the detergent-solubilized receptors by in-gel fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of the tagged CLR and RAMPs resulted in the appearance of intense sharp bands that migrated slower than the CLR and RAMP alone consistent with formation of the heterodimeric complexes. Analysis of the supernatants by denaturing SDS-PAGE revealed fluorescent bands of the expected molecular masses for the CLR and RAMP constructs (Fig. S1A). A control experiment with each of the RAMPs co-expressed with another class B GPCR, the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R), showed no evidence for detergent-stable PTH1R·RAMP1, -2, or -3 complexes (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B), demonstrating specificity. To prove that the starred bands in the native gel (Fig. 1B) were CLR·RAMP complexes, we excised these bands and placed the gel slices in the wells of a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel followed by electrophoresis. Fluorescent imaging revealed the presence of two bands of the correct sizes for the tagged CLR and RAMP constructs (Fig. 1D). We were also able to use the native PAGE assay in a thermostability format to test the receptor stabilities in different detergents. Aliquots of the solubilized supernatants were incubated at various temperatures for 30 min, followed by centrifugation and analysis of the supernatant by hrCNE. Of the three detergent systems tested, the CLR·RAMP complexes were least stable in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM)/CHS with the RAMP1 complex falling apart at 20–28 °C, the RAMP2 complex being unstable at all temperatures tested, and the RAMP3 complex breaking down above 28 °C (Fig. S2A). The three receptor complexes had similar thermostabilities in LMNG/CHS and LMNG/glyco-diosgenin (GDN)/CHS, with each complex being stable up to at least 37 °C (Fig. S2, B and C). All experiments hereafter used LMNG/CHS because it solubilized well and gave similar stabilities for the three CLR·RAMP complexes. We sought to use the native PAGE assay to characterize peptide ligand and mini-G protein binding to the CLR·RAMP complexes. Toward this end we generated new MBP–RAMP constructs with their native C termini to eliminate the possibility of steric hindrance of mG coupling from the mCitrine tag (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of these constructs with MBP–CLR–EGFP in HEK293S GnT1− cells, solubilization, and hrCNE analysis revealed formation of detergent-stable complexes visible by in-gel fluorescence from the EGFP (Fig. 2B). To ensure that these complexes maintained cAMP signaling properties comparable with the untagged receptors, we co-expressed each of the three tagged complexes in COS-7 cells and measured cAMP accumulation in response to the αCGRP, AM, and AM2/IMD agonists (Fig. 2, C–E). All three complexes exhibited agonist selectivity profiles comparable with those observed for the WT receptors (Fig. 2F), and AM2/IMD was a partial agonist at the RAMP2 complex as reported (37Musa H. Hendrikse E.R. Brimble M.A. Garelja M.L. Watkins H.A. Harris P.W.R. Hay D.L. Pharmacological characterization and investigation of N-terminal loop amino acids of adrenomedullin 2 that are important for receptor activation.Biochemistry. 2019; 58 (31328503): 3468-347410.1021/acs.biochem.9b00571Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Table S1 summarizes the potencies obtained in the signaling assays. The agonist potencies were slightly reduced at the tagged constructs as compared with WT receptors, but this effect was minor. The tagged constructs were thus good surrogates for use in experiments to define the ligand and mG-binding properties of the complexes using the hrCNE gel assay. To measure peptide ligand and mG binding to the receptor complexes, we turned to the use of membrane preparations to enable uniform receptor addition across multiple reactions. Large-scale transfections of HEK293S GnT1− cells were performed for each of the three MBP–CLR–EGFP·MBP–RAMP complexes, the cells were harvested, and crude membranes were prepared. The heterodimer concentration in each preparation was estimated by LMNG/CHS solubilization followed by analysis on SDS-PAGE with comparison to known amounts of purified MBP–EGFP (Fig. S3A). The membrane preparations were each estimated to contain ∼100 nm heterodimer enabling their use as 10× stocks to give ∼10 nm receptor heterodimer final concentrations in the reactions. All hrCNE experiments hereafter used the membrane preparations. We expressed the mGs, mGsq, and mGsi proteins as N-terminally His6-tagged SUMO–mG fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified them by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S3B). We originally intended to remove SUMO from the fusion proteins, but we found that the fusions worked better in the native PAGE assay, presumably because of their larger size (see below). In the course of studies to assess peptide and mG binding to the receptor complexes by hrCNE assay, we noticed the tendency of the purified mG proteins to form disulfide-linked oligomers. The presence of multiple disulfide bonds in the CGRP and AM receptors and a disulfide bond in the peptide agonists prevented the use of DTT or TCEP to solve this problem. Fortunately, we found that a GSH/GSSG redox buffer could maintain the purified mG proteins in a largely reduced monomeric state without damaging the receptors a"
https://openalex.org/W3030044246,"Adenoviruses are responsible for a spectrum of pathogenesis including viral myocarditis. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43, gene name GJA1) facilitates rapid propagation of action potentials necessary for each heartbeat. Gap junctions also propagate innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses, but how viruses may target these structures is not understood. Given this immunological role of Cx43, we hypothesized that gap junctions would be targeted during adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) infection. We find reduced Cx43 protein levels due to decreased GJA1 mRNA transcripts dependent upon β-catenin transcriptional activity during Ad5 infection, with early viral protein E4orf1 sufficient to induce β-catenin phosphorylation. Loss of gap junction function occurs prior to reduced Cx43 protein levels with Ad5 infection rapidly inducing Cx43 phosphorylation events consistent with altered gap junction conductance. Direct Cx43 interaction with ZO-1 plays a critical role in gap junction regulation. We find loss of Cx43/ZO-1 complexing during Ad5 infection by co-immunoprecipitation and complementary studies in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived-cardiomyocytes reveal Cx43 gap junction remodeling by reduced ZO-1 complexing. These findings reveal specific targeting of gap junction function by Ad5 leading to loss of intercellular communication which would contribute to dangerous pathological states including arrhythmias in infected hearts."

Consistent with detection of characteristic oxidized guanine lesions (8-oxodG) in the treated cells, we observed significantly increased relative cII mutant frequency in the treated pre-senescent cells which was augmented in their immortalized counterparts. The predominant mutation type in the treated pre-senescent cells was G:C→T:A transversion, whose frequency was intensified in the treated immortalized cells. Conversely, the prevailing mutation type in the treated immortalized cells was A:T→C:G transversion, with a unique sequence-context specificity, i.e. flanking purines at the 5′ end of the mutated nucleotide. This mutation type was also enriched in the treated pre-senescent cells, although to a lower extent. The signature mutation of G:C→T:A transversions in the treated cells accorded with the well-established translesion synthesis bypass caused by 8-oxodG, and the hallmark A:T→C:G transversions conformed to the known replication errors because of oxidized guanine nucleosides (8-OHdGTPs). The distinctive features of photosensitization-induced mutagenesis in the immortalized cells, which were present at attenuated levels, in spontaneously immortalized cells provide insights into the role of oxidative stress in senescence bypass and immortalization.

It is widely believed that prolonged exposure of cells to supraphysiological concentrations of atmospheric oxygen (20%) used in standard cell culture incubators is a main contributor to senescence and immortalization (10Parrinello S.

The nonphysiological O2 tension, which imposes a significant burden of oxidative stress on the cells, leads to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce promutagenic DNA damage, among other macromolecular changes, such as epigenetic modifications (8Tommasi S.

The genome of Big Blue® MEF contains multiple copies of the chromosomally integrated, and easily recoverable, λLIZ shuttle vector, which carries two mutation reporter genes, namely the LacI and cII transgenes (11Besaratinia A. Zheng A. Bates S.E. Tommasi S. Mutation analysis in cultured cells of transgenic rodents.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 (29337872): 26210.3390/ijms19010262Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have constructed a comprehensive catalogue of spontaneous and photosensitization-induced mutations in a mammalian genome by interrogating the cII gene from λ phage in transgenic Big Blue® MEF during the transition from primary culture through senescence and immortalization. More specifically, we have determined the mutant frequency of cII transgene as well as characterized the spectra of cII mutation in Big Blue® MEF treated with methylene blue plus visible light and counterpart untreated cells both before senescence and after immortalization. Methylene blue is a photosensitizer that, upon excitation with visible light, produces reactive oxygen species (mainly singlet oxygen (1O2)) which primarily cause oxidation of purine and pyrimidine bases in the DNA, with oxidized guanine residues, such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), being the predominant and highly mutagenic lesion (13Epe B.

To verify the effectiveness of methylene blue plus light treatment in inducing promutagenic DNA damage in vitro, we subjected the genomic DNA of the treated and untreated cells to enzymatic digestion with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), which cleaves 8-oxodG and other oxidized/ring-opened purines (16Boiteux S.

A flowchart of the study is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of MEF with methylene blue plus light was dose-dependently cytotoxic. Dependent on both the concentration of methylene blue and the duration of light exposure, cell viability decreased as the administered dose increased. Treatment with 2 μm methylene blue plus 5 min light exposure resulted in 80.0 ± 2.7% cell viability that met the threshold limit of cytotoxicity set for our mutagenicity experiments. Higher doses of methylene blue plus light were prohibitively cytotoxic as they caused high to excessive cell death in the treated MEF (Fig. 2A). As indicated earlier, moderate to high cell survival post treatment is optimal and most amenable for mutagenicity studies (12White P.A. Luijten M. Mishima M. Cox J.A. Hanna J.N. Maertens R.M.

We also note that methylene blue treatment alone or light exposure only at the tested conditions did not cause any detectable cytotoxicity in MEF (data not shown). Primary MEF treated with methylene blue plus light showed dose-dependent formation of oxidative DNA damage as illustrated by increasing levels of Fpg-sensitive sites, which are indicative of 8-oxodG and other oxidized/ring-opened purines (16Boiteux S.

The extent of the induced DNA damage was directly related to both the concentration of methylene blue and the length of light exposure. As shown in Fig. 2B, a substantial and readily detectable level of oxidative DNA damage was observed in cells treated with 2 μm methylene blue plus 5 min light exposure. Consistent with the cytotoxicity results (above), this observation ensured that such treatment is effective in inducing promutagenic DNA damage for our mutagenicity experiments. To investigate the role played by oxidative stress–induced DNA damage and mutagenesis in cellular senescence and immortalization, we have determined the cII mutant frequency and mutation spectrum in Big Blue® MEF treated with methylene blue plus light and counterpart untreated cells both before senescence (T2) and after immortalization (T3). Based on the cytotoxicity and DNA damage results, we selected 2 μm methylene blue treatment plus 5 min light exposure for the mutagenicity experiments. Table 1 summarizes the cII mutant frequency data for the treated and control cells before senescence (at T2) and after immortalization (at T3). As shown in Table 1, the cII mutant frequencies were significantly increased in the treated cells relative to controls both before senescence (13.6 ± 2.5 versus 5.2 ± 1.3 × 10−5, p = 0.0326) and after immortalization (50.8 ± 6.8 versus 9.3 ± 1.8 × 10−5, p = 0.002). More specifically, there were 2.6-fold and 5.4-fold increases in relative cII mutant frequencies in the treated cells at T2 and T3, respectively (versus counterpart controls). In both the treated and control cells, the cII mutant frequencies were higher at T3 than T2; in the immortalized treated and control cells, respectively, the cII mutant frequencies were 3.4-fold and 1.8-fold higher than those in the corresponding pre-senescent cells (p = 0.0079 and p = 0.06527, respectively).Table 1cII Mutant frequency in Big Blue® MEF treated with methylene blue plus light and counterpart untreated cells before senescence (T2) and after immortalization (T3)SampleTotal screened plaques (pfu*Plaque forming unit.)Putative cII mutant plaquesVerified cII mutant plaques(re-plated)†Putative cII mutant plaques were first re-plated for verification and then sequenced for reconfirmation.Reconfirmed cII mutant plaques(sequenced)†Putative cII mutant plaques were first re-plated for verification and then sequenced for reconfirmation.Adjusted cII mutant frequency(× 10−5)‡The cII mutant frequency was adjusted based on the total number of plaques that were first verified by re-plating and then reconfirmed by DNA sequencing.

Open table in a new tab To establish the mutation spectra of the cII gene in the treated and control cells before senescence and after immortalization, we performed direct DNA sequencing on the mutant plaques detected in the respective samples. We sequenced 140 and 165 putative mutant plaques from the pre-senescent and immortalized treated cells, respectively, and 114 and 149 plaques from the corresponding control cells. Of these, 129, 164, 79, and 126, respectively, had a minimum of one mutation in the cII gene, as detected by DNA sequencing. This is well within the historical range for the cII assay because in the Big Blue® λLIZ system, WT cII-bearing phages with a mutation in the cI gene can also give rise to a phenotypically expressed mutant plaque (11Besaratinia A.

Table 2 is a compilation of data on the types of mutation found in the cII gene in the treated and control cells before senescence (T2) and after immortalization (T3).

The remainder mutations were almost exclusively single insertions or deletions (Table 2).Table 2Types of mutation in the cII gene in Big Blue® MEF treated with methylene blue plus light and counterpart untreated cells before senescence (T2) and after immortalization (T3)Mutation typeControl (T2)Control (T3)Methylene blue + light (T2)Methylene blue + light (T3)Single mutation75 (94.9%)121 (96.0%)129 (100.0%)162 (98.8%)Multiple mutations4 (5.1%)5 (4.0%)0 (0.0%)2 (1.2%)Base substitution79 (95.2%)126 (96.2%)124 (96.1%)159 (95.8%)IndelInsertion3 (3.6%)3 (2.3%)2 (1.6%)0 (0.0%)Deletion1 (1.2%)2 (1.5%)3 (2.3%)7 (4.2%)Percentages are indicated in brackets. Open table in a new tab Percentages are indicated in brackets. To compare and contrast the frequency distribution of mutations detected in the cII gene in the treated and control cells before senescence and after immortalization, we calculated the frequency of each specific type of mutation (e.g. transition, transversion, indel) in the respective groups. The frequency of each type of mutation in a group was determined by multiplying the percentage of its occurrence to the cII mutant frequency of the corresponding group. As shown in Fig. 3A, the frequency distribution of the induced cII mutations in the treated cells both at T2 and T3 differed from those in the respective controls; of note, the differences were mostly augmented at T3. There were statistically significant increases in frequencies of G:C→T:A transversions (8.9-fold), A:T→G:C transitions (3.6-fold), A:T→C:G transversions (2.8-fold), indels (2.1-fold), and G:C→A:T transitions (1.6-fold) in the treated cells at T2 (pre-senescent) relative to respective controls (Fig. 3B). The treated cells at T3 (immortalized) showed statistically significant rises in frequencies of A:T→C:G transversions (23.0-fold), G:C→C:G transversions (13.7-fold), G:C→T:A transversions (11.3-fold), indels (8.6-fold), G:C→A:T transitions (2.7-fold), and A:T→G:C transitions (2.1-fold) relative to pre-senescent controls. The immortalized control cells (at T3) also showed higher frequencies of G:C→T:A transversions and A:T→T:A transversions (3.3-fold), and G:C→C:G transversions (2.4-fold) relative to pre-senescent control cells (at T2) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we constructed a detailed map of the location and type of mutations detected in the cII gene in the treated and control cells before senescence and after immortalization. As shown in Fig. 4, single or recurring mutations were found at various nucleotide positions along the cII gene in the treated and control cells both at T2 and T3. We also performed sequence-context analysis on the detected mutations in the treated and control cells before senescence and after immortalization. Mutations occurring at A:T base pairs were more frequent in the immortalized treated cells than counterpart controls (p = 0.0162) and pre-senescent treated cells (p = 0.0217) (Fig. 5A). Mutations within CpG-containing sequences were proportionally similar across the treated and control cells (both at T2 and T3) (Fig. 5B). However, G:C→A:T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, which are attributed to spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine (21Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Mutagenic deamination of cytosine residues in DNA.Nature. 1980; 287 (6999365): 560-56110.1038/287560a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), were slightly overrepresented in the pre-senescent and immortalized control cells relative to respective treated cells (Fig. 5C).

https://openalex.org/W3032476894,"Investigating the role of historical and ecological factors structuring assemblages is relevant to understand mechanisms and processes affecting biodiversity across heterogeneous habitats. Considering that community assembly often involves scale-dependent processes, different spatial scales may reveal distinct factors structuring assemblages. In this study we use arboreal and leaf-litter lizard abundance data from 83 plots to investigate assemblage spatial structure at two distinct scales in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. At a regional scale, we test the general hypothesis that the Madeira River acts as a barrier to dispersal of some lizard species, which results in distinct assemblages between river banks. At a local scale, we test the hypothesis that assemblages are not evenly distributed across heterogeneous habitats but respond to a continuum of inadequate-to-optimal portions of environmental predictors. Our results show that regional lizard assemblages are structured by the upper Madeira River acting as a regional barrier to 29.62% of the species sampled. This finding suggests species have been historically isolated at one of the river banks, or that distinct geomorphological features influence species occurrence at each river bank. At a local scale, different sets of environmental predictors affected assemblage composition between river banks or even along a river bank. These findings indicate that environmental filtering is a major cause of lizard assemblage spatial structure in the upper Madeira River, but predictor variables cannot be generalized over the extensive (nearly 500 km) study area. Based on a single study system we demonstrate that lizard assemblages along the forests near the banks of the upper Madeira River are not randomly structured but respond to multiple factors acting at different and hierarchical spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W3029679375,"Shared opinions are an important feature in the formation of social groups. In this paper, we use the Axelrod model of cultural dissemination to represent opinion-based groups. In the Axelrod model, each agent has a set of features which each holds one of a set of nominally related traits. Survey data has a similar structure, where each participant answers each of a set of items with responses from a fixed list. We present an alternative method of displaying the Axelrod model by representing it as a bipartite graph, i.e., participants and their responses as separate nodes. This allows us to see which feature-trait combinations are selected in the final state. This visualisation is particularly useful when representing survey data as it illustrates the co-evolution of attitudes and opinion-based groups in Axelrod's model of cultural diffusion. We also present a modification to the Axelrod model. A standard finding of the Axelrod model with many features is for all agents to fully agree in one cluster. We introduce an agreement threshold and allow nodes to interact only with those neighbours who are within this threshold (i.e., those with similar opinions) rather than those with any opinion. This method reliably yields a large number of clusters for small agreement thresholds and, importantly, does not limit to single cluster when the number of features grows large. This potentially provides a method for modelling opinion-based groups where as opinions are added, the number of clusters increase."
https://openalex.org/W3031055237,"Farmland management and irrigation scheduling are vital to a productive agricultural economy. A multistage stochastic programming model is proposed to maximize farmers’ annual profit under uncertainty. The uncertainties considered include crop prices, irrigation water availability, and precipitation. During the first stage, pre-season decisions including seed type and plant density are made, while determinations of when to irrigate and how much water to be used for each irrigation are made in the later stages. The presented case study, based on a farm in Nebraska, U.S.A., showed that a 10% profit increase could be achieved by taking the corn price and irrigation water availability uncertainties into consideration using two-stage stochastic programming. An additional 13% profit increase could be achieved by taking precipitation uncertainty into consideration using multistage stochastic programming. The stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model, especially when there are limited water supplies. These results indicate that multistage stochastic programming is a promising method for farm-scale irrigation management and can increase farm profitability."
https://openalex.org/W3032118097,"During the past decade, Drosophila suzukii has established itself as a global invasive fruit pest, enabled by its ability to lay eggs into fresh, ripening fruit. In a previous study, we investigated the impact of different strawberry accessions on the development of D. suzukii eggs, in the search of natural resistance. We identified several accessions that significantly reduced adult fly emergence from infested fruit. In the present study, we aimed at understanding the chemical basis of this effect. We first noted that one of the more resistant accessions showed an unusual enrichment of methyl anthranilate within its fruit, prompting us to investigate this fruit compound as a possible cause limiting fly development. We found that methyl anthranilate alone triggers embryo lethality in a concentration-dependent manner, unlike another comparable organic fruit compound. We also showed that a chemical fraction of the resistant strawberry accession that contains methyl anthranilate carries some activity toward the egg hatching rate. Surprisingly, in spite of the lethal effect of this compound to their eggs, adult females are not only attracted to methyl anthranilate at certain concentrations, but they also display a concentration-dependent preference to lay on substrates enriched in methyl anthranilate. This study demonstrates that methyl anthranilate is a potent agonist molecule against D. suzukii egg development. Its elevated concentration in a specific strawberry accession proven to reduce the fly development may explain, at least in part the fruit resistance. It further illustrates how a single, natural compound, non-toxic to humans could be exploited for biological control of a pest species."

This study has two goals 1) to assess feline oesophageal foreign bodies in feline patients using physical, radiologic and endoscopic examination and, how their location influences treatment plans and complications. 2) How the anatomical sharp angle of the oesophagus contribute to foreign body lodgement. Thirty-five cats were enrolled in this study; 30 of them were clinically ill, and five cats were used for anatomical study.Cats with clinical signs underwent complete clinical and radiologic examination. Endoscopy was performed in only five cases. The site with the highest occurrence of foreign body lodgement was the oesophageal entrance, caudal to the pharynx (63.3%), followed by the thoracic inlet (26.7%) and the mid-cervical region of the oesophagus (10%). Two types of foreign bodies were identified: sewing needles (25/30) and bone (5/30). Radiography was able to identify the location and nature of the foreign body in all 30 affected cats. Therapeutic regimens were applied according to the nature and location of the foreign body and any associated complications. Removal of the foreign body was achieved using Rochester pean artery forceps in 17/30 cases, using full surgical intervention in 8/30 cases, and during endoscopy in 5/30 cases.The results suggest that the location of the foreign body is strongly related to combination of consumed foreign body type and anatomic features of the cat oesophagus. The feline oesophagus has a variety of sharp angles that facilitate the entrapment of rigid linear and angular foreign bodies. Radiographic imaging remains the most frequently used diagnostic modality for determining the lodgement site and nature of radiopaque foreign bodies. Over all complication rate was low (6/30)."

Methods Hepatic fat, BM fat, and PSM fat from proton density fat fraction of liver MRI between June 2015 and April 2019 were quantitatively evaluated on axial images of the fat map at the mid-level of T11-L2 vertebral bodies for BM fat and at the mid-level of L2 for PSM fat. Age, height, and weight at the time of MRI were recorded and BMI was calculated. Correlation analysis was performed. Results A total of 147 patients (114 male) were included with a mean age of 13.3 ± 2.9 years (range 7–18 years). The mean fat fractions were 24.3 ± 13.0% (2–53%) in liver, 37.4 ± 8.6% (17.3–56%) in vertebral BM, and 2.7 ± 1.1% (1.0–6.9%) in PSM. Age, height, weight, and BMI were not correlated with liver fat or BM fat. However, weight (ρ = 0.174, p = 0.035) and BMI (ρ = 0.247, p = 0.003) were positively correlated with PSM fat.

The mean number of different non-supplement medicines dispensed during pregnancy increased from 2.5 to 3.2. Dispensing during pregnancy was weakly associated with body mass index, smoking status and ethnicity. Pregnancy exposure was highest for Antibacterials (26.0%), Analgesics (16.7%) and Antinausea & Vertigo Agents (11.0%).From 2005-2015, both the proportion of exposed pregnancies and the number of different medicines dispensed to pregnant women in New Zealand increased."
https://openalex.org/W3030688842,"Cognitive control and incentive sensitivity are related to overeating and obesity. Optimal white matter integrity is relevant for an efficient interaction among reward-related brain regions. However, its relationship with sensitivity to incentives remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the incentive sensitivity and its relationship to white matter integrity in normal-weight and overweight groups. Seventy-six young adults participated in this study: 31 were normal-weight (body mass index [BMI] 18.5 to < 25.0 kg/m2, 14 females) and 45 were overweight (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2, 22 females). Incentive sensitivity was assessed using an antisaccade task that evaluates the effect of incentives (neutral, reward, and loss avoidance) on cognitive control performance. Diffusion tensor imaging studies were performed to assess white matter integrity. The relationship between white matter microstructure and incentive sensitivity was investigated through tract-based spatial statistics. Behavioral antisaccade results showed that normal-weight participants presented higher accuracy (78.0 vs. 66.7%, p = 0.01) for loss avoidance incentive compared to overweight participants. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis revealed a positive relationship between fractional anisotropy and loss avoidance accuracy in the normal-weight group (p < 0.05). No relationship reached significance in the overweight group. These results support the hypothesis that white matter integrity is relevant for performance in an incentivized antisaccade task."

Growing interest in the latest approved cabazitaxel taxane drug has markedly increased due to the survival benefits conferred when used at an earlier stage of the disease, its promising new therapeutic combination and formulation, and its differential toxicity. Still cabazitaxel's mechanisms of resistance are poorly characterized. The goal of this study was thus to generate a new model of acquired resistance against cabazitaxel in order to unravel cabazitaxel's resistance mechanisms.Du145 cells were cultured with increasing concentrations of cabazitaxel, docetaxel/ taxane control or placebo/age-matched control. Once resistance was reached, Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Translation (EMT) was tested by cell morphology, cell migration, and E/M markers expression profile. Cell transcriptomics were determined by RNA sequencing; related pathways were identified using IPA, PANTHER or KEGG software. The Wnt pathway was analyzed by western blotting, pharmacological and knock-down studies.While age-matched Du145 cells were sensitive to both taxane drugs, docetaxel-resistant cells were only resistant to docetaxel and cabazitaxel-resistant cells showed a partial cross-resistance to both drugs concomitant to EMT. Using RNA-sequencing, the Wnt non-canonical pathway was identified as exclusively activated in cabazitaxel resistant cells while the Wnt canonical pathway was restricted to docetaxel-resistant cells. Cabazitaxel-resistant cells showed a minimal crossover in the Wnt-pathway-related genes linked to docetaxel resistance validating our unique model of acquired resistance to cabazitaxel. Pharmacological and western blot studies confirmed these findings and suggest the implication of the Tyrosine kinase Ror2 receptor in cabazitaxel resistant cells. Variation in Ror2 expression level altered the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to both drugs identifying a possible new target for taxane resistance.Our study represents the first demonstration that while Wnt pathway seems to play an important role in taxanes resistance, Wnt effectors responsible for taxane specificity remain un-identified prompting the need for more studies."
https://openalex.org/W3030406110,"Identifying children who are at-risk for developmental delay, so that these children can have access to interventions as early as possible, is an important and challenging problem in developmental research. This research aimed to identify latent subgroups of children with developmental delay, by modelling and clustering developmental milestones. The main objectives were to (a) create a developmental profile for each child by modelling milestone achievements, from birth to three years of age, across multiple domains of development, and (b) cluster the profiles to identify groups of children who show similar deviations from typical development. The ensemble methodology used in this research consisted of three components: (1) Bayesian sequential updating was used to model the achievement of milestones, which allows for updated predictions of development to be made in real time; (2) a measure was created that indicated how far away each child deviated from typical development for each functional domain, by calculating the area between each child’s obtained sequence of posterior means and a sequence of posterior means representing typical development; and (3) Dirichlet process mixture modelling was used to cluster the obtained areas. The data used were 348 binary developmental milestone measurements, collected from birth to three years of age, from a small community sample of young children (N = 79). The model identified nine latent groups of children with similar features, ranging from no delays in all functional domains, to large delays in all domains. The performance of the Dirichlet process mixture model was validated with two simulation studies."
https://openalex.org/W3031060542,"In urothelial cell type non-muscle invasive urinary bladder carcinoma, TNM stage and WHO grade are widely used to classify patients into low and high‑risk groups for prognostic and therapeutic decision-making. However, stage and grade reproducibility and prediction accuracy are wanting. This may lead to suboptimal treatment. We evaluated whether proliferation features, nuclear area of the epithelial cancer cells and the composition of stromal and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have independent prognostic value. In 183 primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients with long follow-up (median for stage progression cohort: 119 months, range 5-173; median for tumor recurrence cohort: 82, range 3-165) proliferation features Ki67, PPH3 and Mitotic Activity Index (MAI), Mean Nuclear Area (MNA), lymphocyte subsets (CD8+, CD4+, CD25+) and plasma cells (CD138+) were assessed on consecutive sections. Post-resection instillation treatments (none, mitomycin, BCG) were strictly standardized during the intake period. Risk of recurrence was associated with expression of Ki67 (≤ 39 vs. > 39) and Multifocality (p = 0.01). Patients with low Ki67 had a higher recurrence rate than those with high Ki67. Lymphocyte composition did not predict recurrence. Stage progression was strongly associated with high values for MAI (>15) and CD25+ (>0.2%). In a multivariate analysis the combination of MAI and CD25+ was the single most prognostic feature (p<0.001). Validation of these results in additional, independent studies is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2948707668,"In the last years, there has been a considerable increase of research into the neuroimaging correlates of inter-individual temperament and character variability—an endeavour for which the term ‘personality neuroscience’ was coined. Among other neuroimaging modalities and approaches, substantial work focuses on functional connectivity in resting state (rs-FC) functional magnetic resonance imaging data. In the current paper, we set out to independently query the questions asked in a highly cited study that reported a range of functional connectivity correlates of personality dimensions assessed by the widely used ‘Big Five’ Personality Inventory. Using a larger sample (84 subjects) and an equivalent data analysis pipeline, we obtained widely disagreeing results compared to the original study. Overall, the results were in line with the hypotheses of no relation between functional connectivity and personality, when more precise permutation-based multiple testing procedures were applied. The results demonstrate that as with other neuroimaging studies, great caution should be applied when interpreting the findings, among other reasons due to multiple testing problem involved at several levels in many neuroimaging studies. Of course, the current study results can not ultimately disprove the existence of some link between personality and brain’s intrinsic functional architecture, but clearly shows that its form is very likely different and much more subtle and elusive than was previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W3029634799,"The tomato AGC protein kinase Adi3 is a Ser/Thr kinase that functions as a negative regulator of programmed cell death through cell death suppression (CDS) activity in the nucleus. In this study, to understand the mechanism of Adi3 CDS, peptide microarrays containing random Ser- and Thr-peptide phosphorylation substrates were used to screen for downstream phosphorylation substrates. In the microarray phosphorylation assay, Adi3 showed promiscuous kinase activity more toward Ser-peptides compared to Thr-peptides, and a preference for aromatic and cyclic amino acids on both Ser- and Thr-peptides was seen. The 63 highest phosphorylated peptide sequences from the Ser-peptide microarray were selected as queries for a BLAST search against the tomato proteome. As a result, 294 candidate nuclear Adi3 substrates were selected and categorized based on their functions. Many of these proteins were classified as DNA/RNA polymerases or regulators involved in transcription and translation events. The list of potential Adi3 substrates was narrowed to eleven and four candidates were tested for phosphorylation by Adi3. Two of these candidates, RNA polymerase II 2nd largest subunit (RPB2) and the pathogen defense related transcription factor Pti5, were confirmed as Adi3 phosphorylation substrates by in vitro kinase assays. Using a mutational approach two residues, Thr675 and Thr676, were identified as Adi3 phosphorylation sites on RPB2. This study provides the foundation for understanding Adi3 CDS mechanisms in the nucleus as well as other cellular functions."
