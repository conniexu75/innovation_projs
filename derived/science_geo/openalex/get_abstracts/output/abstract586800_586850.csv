https://openalex.org/W2613518054,"Across markets accounting for 80 per cent of global diesel vehicle sales, more than a third of diesel nitrogen oxide emissions are in excess of certification limits, causing many deaths. Vehicle emissions such as nitrogen oxides contribute to air pollution that can be harmful to human health and the environment. Diesel vehicles produce about 20 per cent of global nitrogen oxide emissions and emit more under real-world operating conditions than during laboratory certification testing. This paper finds that across 11 markets, representing about 80 per cent of global diesel vehicle sales, nitrogen oxide emissions exceed certification limits for one-third of on-road heavy-duty vehicles and for over half of light-duty vehicles. In 2015, the 'excess' diesel-related nitrogen oxide emissions were associated with around 38,000 deaths related to fine particulate matter and ozone worldwide, including roughly 10 per cent of all ozone-related deaths in the European Union member states. The authors find that heavy-duty vehicles are the dominant contributor to excess diesel-related nitrogen oxide emissions and associated health impacts in most regions. Vehicle emissions contribute to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone air pollution, affecting human health1,2,3,4,5, crop yields5,6 and climate5,7 worldwide. On-road diesel vehicles produce approximately 20 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are key PM2.5 and ozone precursors8,9. Regulated NOx emission limits in leading markets have been progressively tightened, but current diesel vehicles emit far more NOx under real-world operating conditions than during laboratory certification testing10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Here we show that across 11 markets, representing approximately 80 per cent of global diesel vehicle sales, nearly one-third of on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicle emissions and over half of on-road light-duty diesel vehicle emissions are in excess of certification limits. These excess emissions (totalling 4.6 million tons) are associated with about 38,000 PM2.5- and ozone-related premature deaths globally in 2015, including about 10 per cent of all ozone-related premature deaths in the 28 European Union member states. Heavy-duty vehicles are the dominant contributor to excess diesel NOx emissions and associated health impacts in almost all regions. Adopting and enforcing next-generation standards (more stringent than Euro 6/VI) could nearly eliminate real-world diesel-related NOx emissions in these markets, avoiding approximately 174,000 global PM2.5- and ozone-related premature deaths in 2040. Most of these benefits can be achieved by implementing Euro VI standards where they have not yet been adopted for heavy-duty vehicles."

Immunofluorescence and single-cell RNA sequencing found CD115+ and CCR2+ monocytes and M2-like macrophages accumulating in the lung during the peak of type 2 alveolar epithelial stem cell (AEC2) proliferation. Genetic loss of function in mice and adoptive transfer studies revealed that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) traffic to the lung through a CCL2-CCR2 chemokine axis and are required for optimal lung regeneration, along with Il4ra-expressing leukocytes. Our data suggest that these cells modulate AEC2 proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we provide evidence that group 2 innate lymphoid cells are a source of IL-13, which promotes lung regeneration. Together, our data highlight the potential for immunomodulatory therapies to stimulate alveologenesis in adults.

The past few decades have brought many discoveries about the identities and behaviors of epithelial stem cells in the lung (Hogan et al., 2014Hogan B.L. Barkauskas C.E. Chapman H.A. Epstein J.A.

These data have intensified efforts toward stimulating the regeneration of the human lung from endogenous progenitors to ameliorate declining function associated with aging and progressive end-stage disease. However, the realization of this goal requires a more complete knowledge of the molecular and cellular events mediating lung homeostasis, pathological remodeling, and regeneration. In some species, partial pneumonectomy (PNX), the surgical removal of one or more lung lobes, stimulates compensatory growth in the remaining lobes that restores the alveolar surface area and diffusion capacity (Buhain and Brody, 1973Buhain W.J.

Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tissue macrophages in different organs are heterogeneous with respect to origin, marker expression, and functions. Recent work has helped to delineate these parameters for macrophages in the lung (Tan and Krasnow, 2016Tan S.Y. Krasnow M.A. Developmental origin of lung macrophage diversity.Development. 2016; 143: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Three main subpopulations of lung macrophages have been characterized by their ontogeny, mode of maintenance, and location within the tissue. Two of these, “primitive” interstitial macrophages and alveolar macrophages, are derived from hematopoietic progenitors arising from the yolk sac and fetal liver, respectively. The third population of “definitive” interstitial macrophages is derived from circulating bone marrow-derived monocytes and replaces the primitive interstitial macrophages over time. Recent data suggest that lung macrophages are maintained independently by self-renewal under steady-state conditions (Guilliams et al., 2013Guilliams M. De Kleer I. Henri S. Post S. Vanhoutte L.

Subramanian M. Cohen T.S. Prince A.S. Bhattacharya J. Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity.Nature. 2014; 506: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), little is known about how macrophages might modulate lung regeneration, including adult alveologenesis. The pathology of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice was worsened when inflammatory monocytes were adoptively transferred during the fibrotic stage but also when macrophages were depleted during the recovery stage (Gibbons et al., 2011Gibbons M.A. MacKinnon A.C. Ramachandran P. Dhaliwal K. Duffin R. Phythian-Adams A.T. van Rooijen N. Haslett C. Howie S.E.

Increased numbers of alveolar macrophages have been reported in the context of PNX-induced lung regeneration (Chamoto et al., 2012Chamoto K. Gibney B.C. Ackermann M. Lee G.S. Lin M.

(Amst.). 2013; 10: 267-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and parabiosis experiments demonstrated that this results from local proliferation rather than recruitment from the circulation (Chamoto et al., 2012Chamoto K. Gibney B.C. Ackermann M. Lee G.S. Lin M. Konerding M.A. Tsuda A. Mentzer S.J. Alveolar macrophage dynamics in murine lung regeneration.J. Cell. Physiol. 2012; 227: 3208-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Whether these cells affect lung regeneration was not addressed. This same group showed that Cd11b is required for optimal regeneration (Chamoto et al., 2013aChamoto K. Gibney B.C. Lee G.S. Ackermann M. Konerding M.A. Tsuda A. Mentzer S.J. Migration of CD11b+ accessory cells during murine lung regeneration.Stem Cell Res. (Amst.). 2013; 10: 267-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the nonspecific expression of Cd11b by a number of leukocyte subpopulations, both interstitial and in the airspace, leaves many unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms by which resident and recruited cells promote lung regeneration. When macrophages arrive at their site of action, they are polarized along a spectrum by microenvironmental cues (Martinez and Gordon, 2014Martinez F.O. Gordon S.

Cytokines associated with type 2 immunity, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 signaling through IL-4-Rα heterodimers, can induce M2 macrophage polarization and variably activate transcription of Arg1, Fizz1, Ym1 (Chil3), and Mrc1 (Stein et al., 1992Stein M.

The polarization state of macrophages in the regenerating lung following PNX has not been reported. Here we use flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and both population-level and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the dynamics of macrophage subpopulations following PNX. Myeloid cells in the regenerating lung were most abundant at the peak of AEC2 stem cell proliferation. We use genetic loss of function and adoptive transfer experiments to demonstrate that recruited CCR2 monocytes and type 2 cytokine signaling are critical components of the regenerative niche required for lung regeneration post-PNX. Our data suggest that monocytes and macrophages stimulate AEC2 progenitor cell behaviors. Finally, we provide evidence that type 2 innate lymphoid cells are a source of IL-13 in the regenerating lung. These data establish important roles for myeloid cells in promoting regenerative alveologenesis. Immunofluorescence on sections of lungs from Csf1r-GFP reporter mice, in which macrophages, monocytes, and some dendritic cells express GFP (Rae et al., 2007Rae F. Woods K. Sasmono T. Campanale N.

These cells were localized throughout the tissue, in close proximity to AEC2s, and at the periphery of the lung, where the majority of alveologenesis is thought to occur (Figure S1; Konerding et al., 2012Konerding M.A. Gibney B.C.

Flow cytometry showed that CSF1R-GFP+, F4/80+ lung macrophages were significantly increased 7 days post-PNX (18.6% ± 2.8% of total live cells) compared with 7 days post-sham littermate controls (14.4% ± 2.1%) (Figure 2B). These data are consistent with a previous report demonstrating an increase in lung macrophages after PNX (Chamoto et al., 2012Chamoto K. Gibney B.C. Ackermann M. Lee G.S. Lin M.

Both interstitial macrophages/circulating monocytes (F4/80+, CD11b+) and alveolar macrophages (F4/80+, CD11c+) were significantly increased 7 days after PNX (29.1% ± 3.2% of CD45+ and 15.4% ± 2.1% of CD45+, respectively) compared with sham surgery (19.9% ± 2.7% and 9.6% ± 1.6%) (Figures 1C–1F).

This integrated approach reveals the mechanisms guiding olfactory lineage trajectories and provides a model for deconstructing similar hierarchies in other stem cell niches. A fundamental challenge in stem cell biology is to define both the cell fate potential of a given stem cell and where cell fates are specified along a developmental trajectory. Moreover, detailed lineage trajectory maps are necessary for identifying the regulatory networks that govern the cell fate transitions underlying tissue maintenance and regeneration and are essential for designing strategies to manipulate cells for therapeutic applications. Lineage tracing—a technique for permanently labeling the descendants of a targeted cell—has long been established as a powerful tool for elucidating the cell fate potential of progenitor cells (Dymecki and Tomasiewicz, 1998Dymecki S.M.

However, this approach alone cannot readily identify all intermediate stages in a lineage or pinpoint when, in a branching lineage, multiple cell fates arise. Whole-transcriptome profiling of single cells by RNA sequencing (single-cell RNA-seq) has recently emerged as a powerful method for discriminating the heterogeneity of cell types and cell states in a complex population (Wagner et al., 2016Wagner A. Regev A. Yosef N. Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 1145-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). New statistical approaches have further enabled the ordering of cells along developmental lineages based on gradual changes in gene expression detected at the single-cell level (Trapnell et al., 2014Trapnell C. Cacchiarelli D. Grimsby J. Pokharel P. Li S. Morse M. Lennon N.J. Livak K.J. Mikkelsen T.S. Rinn J.L. The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). However, current approaches struggle to overcome the challenge of identifying where lineages diverge in more complex branching trajectories of multipotent progenitors, a problem that is only beginning to be addressed (Setty et al., 2016Setty M. Tadmor M.D. Reich-Zeliger S. Angel O. Salame T.M. Kathail P. Choi K. Bendall S. Friedman N. Pe’er D. Wishbone identifies bifurcating developmental trajectories from single-cell data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Importantly, even the most sophisticated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data can only provide predictions that require independent experimental validation. The olfactory epithelium maintains a steady-state population of mature olfactory sensory neurons via continual neurogenesis in the postnatal animal (Graziadei and Graziadei, 1979bGraziadei P.P. Graziadei G.A. Neurogenesis and neuron regeneration in the olfactory system of mammals. I. Morphological aspects of differentiation and structural organization of the olfactory sensory neurons.J.

Cell dynamics in the adult mouse olfactory epithelium: a quantitative autoradiographic study.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 979-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Olfactory neurogenesis is normally sustained through differentiation of globose basal cells (GBCs), which are the actively proliferating neurogenic progenitor cells in the niche (Caggiano et al., 1994Caggiano M.

Retroviral lineage studies of the rat olfactory epithelium.Chem. Senses. 1994; 19: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Upon targeted destruction of the sensory neurons or more severe injury to the entire tissue, the olfactory epithelium can regenerate (Graziadei and Graziadei, 1979aGraziadei G.A. Graziadei P.P. Neurogenesis and neuron regeneration in the olfactory system of mammals. II. Degeneration and reconstitution of the olfactory sensory neurons after axotomy.J. Neurocytol. 1979; 8: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Following such injury, horizontal basal cells (HBCs)—the normally quiescent, reserve stem cells of the niche—become activated to differentiate and reconstitute all major cell types in the epithelium (Iwai et al., 2008Iwai N. Zhou Z. Roop D.R. Behringer R.R. Horizontal basal cells are multipotent progenitors in normal and injured adult olfactory epithelium.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Leung et al., 2007Leung C.T. Coulombe P.A. Reed R.R. Contribution of olfactory neural stem cells to tissue maintenance and regeneration.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). With its relative simplicity and experimental accessibility, the postnatal olfactory epithelium provides an attractive system for studying the activation and specification events that occur during the differentiation of multiple cell lineages from an adult stem cell. A number of questions relevant to other adult stem cell niches can also be addressed. For example, although lineage tracing suggests that cells arising from HBCs transition through proliferative GBC progenitors to generate olfactory sensory neurons (Leung et al., 2007Leung C.T. Coulombe P.A. Reed R.R. Contribution of olfactory neural stem cells to tissue maintenance and regeneration.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the epithelium’s other cell types arise via a common GBC intermediate. Similarly, characterizing the transitions in gene expression that occur throughout a developing lineage is a prerequisite for disentangling the gene regulatory networks that underlie cell fate decisions. In the present study, we combined a statistical approach for making branching lineage assignments from single-cell RNA-seq data with in vivo lineage tracing to map the developmental trajectories of the multiple cell lineages arising from the olfactory epithelium’s HBC stem cell. The first major bifurcation in the HBC lineage trajectory occurs prior to cell division, producing either sustentacular (support) cells or GBCs. The GBC lineage, in turn, branches to give rise to olfactory sensory neurons, microvillous cells, and cells of the Bowman’s gland. Olfactory neurogenesis involves an expansion of the progenitor pool via proliferative GBCs, but sustentacular cells can instead arise via direct fate conversion of quiescent HBCs, a process that does not require cell division. Moreover, the multipotency of HBCs as a population reflects independent unipotent cell fate decisions made at the single-cell level. Finally, we identified and validated canonical Wnt signaling as a regulator that drives HBCs from quiescence toward neuronal differentiation. Our combined approach serves more generally as a model for illuminating and deconstructing branching lineages that arise from multipotent stem cells. We applied single-cell RNA-seq to identify the cell state transitions during differentiation of olfactory HBC stem cells into proliferating progenitors and mature cell types. HBCs and their descendants were obtained using two complementary approaches (Figure 1). In the first, we used inducible Cre-lox lineage tracing to label HBCs and their progeny. To obtain resting HBCs (controls), we harvested cell samples 72 or 96 hr following tamoxifen-induced Cre activation in 3-week-old mice (Figure 1C). To obtain differentiating cells descended from HBCs, we used conditional knockout of Trp63 in HBCs to “release” HBCs from their quiescent state (Figures 1B and 1C; Fletcher et al., 2011Fletcher R.B. Prasol M.S. Estrada J. Baudhuin A. Vranizan K. Choi Y.G. Ngai J. p63 regulates olfactory stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Neuron. 2011; 72: 748-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the second approach, using a Sox2EGFP knockin reporter gene (Arnold et al., 2011Arnold K. Sarkar A. Yram M.A. Polo J.M. Bronson R. Sengupta S. Seandel M. Geijsen N. Hochedlinger K. Sox2(+) adult stem and progenitor cells are important for tissue regeneration and survival of mice.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 317-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), we purified Sox2-EGFP-positive, ICAM1-negative, SCARB1/F3-negative cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain a population of cells enriched for GBCs, later neuronal intermediates, and microvillous cells over sustentacular cells. Single-cell RNA-seq was carried out on FACS-purified cells using the Fluidigm C1 microfluidics cell capture platform followed by Illumina sequencing (see STAR Methods for these and associated statistical methods). Single-cell data from yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) lineage tracing experiments and Sox2-EGFP experiments were combined into one dataset, a strategy designed to maximize the representation of cell states along the developmental trajectories. Sequencing data from a total of 687 cells (542 from YFP lineage-traced cells and 145 from Sox2-EGFP-expressing cells) remained after filtering based on various quality control metrics (Figure 1E). Resampling-based ensemble clustering (RSEC) was applied to the first 50 principal components of the expression matrix to generate stable and tight clusters, yielding a final repertoire of 13 clusters (Figures S1 and S2; STAR Methods). To visualize cellular heterogeneity, we projected the data onto two dimensions via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE; van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008van der Maaten L. Hinton G. Visualizing Data using t-SNE.J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2008; 9: 2579-2605Google Scholar), which confirms that our clustering procedure led to well defined, distinct groups (Figure 2A). Preliminary cell type assignments were made based on the expression of known and/or validated marker genes for HBCs, GBCs, immediate neuronal precursors (INP1-3), immature and mature olfactory sensory neurons (iOSNs and mOSNs), immature and mature sustentacular cells (iSus and mSus), and microvillous cells (MV1 and MV2) (Figure 2B; Figure S2; see STAR Methods for details). Interestingly, two clusters (ΔHBC1 and ΔHBC2) contain cells in which the canonical HBC stem cell markers Trp63, Krt5, and Krt14 appear to be variably downregulated from cell to cell (Figure S2), suggesting the existence of at least one transition state in which HBCs first begin to differentiate. Mapping transcriptional changes as cells transition from stem cells to specialized cell types is essential for understanding the mechanisms regulating cell and tissue differentiation. In differentiating lineages, cells are thought to undergo gradual transcriptional changes, where the relationship between states can be represented as a continuous lineage dependent on an underlying spatial or temporal variable. This representation, often referred to as pseudotemporal ordering (Trapnell et al., 2014Trapnell C. Cacchiarelli D. Grimsby J. Pokharel P. Li S. Morse M. Lennon N.J. Livak K.J. Mikkelsen T.S. Rinn J.L. The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar), can provide a basis for understanding how and when cell fate decisions are made. The task of assigning and ordering cells in a lineage in the olfactory HBC stem cell niche is complicated by the requirement to accommodate multiple branching cell fate trajectories that give rise to the multiple cell types. To address this problem, we applied Slingshot, a statistical framework for inferring branching lineage assignments and developmental distances (STAR Methods). Three distinct trajectories were identified, each starting from the resting HBC stage and leading to the three defined mature cell types (Figures 2D and 2E). All three trajectories were predicted to pass together through the two transitional HBC stages, at which point the first branching in the lineage occurs. One path leads to immature and then mature sustentacular cells (magenta). The other path connects transitional HBCs to GBCs, from which the remaining two lineages diverge: one to form microvillous cells (blue) and one to form olfactory sensory neurons (orange). The latter trajectory passes through GBCs, three discrete stages of immediate neuronal precursors (INP1–3), and immature olfactory sensory neurons before concluding in mature olfactory sensory neurons. We next sought to order all cells and analyze transitions in their transcriptional states as they differentiate to become sustentacular cells and olfactory sensory neurons. Slingshot assigned developmental positions of cells along the lineage trajectories (analogous to the concept of pseudotime; Trapnell et al., 2014Trapnell C. Cacchiarelli D. Grimsby J. Pokharel P. Li S. Morse M. Lennon N.J. Livak K.J. Mikkelsen T.S. Rinn J.L. The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar by orthogonal projection of each cell’s principal coordinates onto its respective curve (displayed as one dimensional plots in Figures 3A and 3C ). From this analysis, it is evident that the transition from ΔHBC2 to GBCs entails a relatively large jump in gene expression space. Similarly, there is a larger gap between the INP1 and INP2 stages compared with the other transitions following the GBC stage in this lineage. Such jumps in developmental distance may represent major transcriptional changes in which distinct networks of genes are turned on or off. To gain insight into the coordinated patterns of gene expression that underlie the cell fate transitions in the neuronal and sustentacular cell lineages, we identified and clustered the most differentially expressed genes within each lineage (Figure S3; Table S1; STAR Methods). The average scaled expression profiles for the gene clusters in the neuronal and sustentacular cell lineages are displayed using heatmaps in Figures 3B and 3D, presented in developmental order according to the predictions made by Slingshot. This comparison highlights the dramatic difference in coordinated gene expression through developmental progression in the two lineages. In the neuronal lineage, many modules of genes are transiently turned on and off, patterns that contrast with the more gradual wave-like changes in gene expression exhibited by the sustentacular lineage. Moreover, there is a longer distance traversed in the neuronal lineage both in terms of the number of distinct cell states and the number of genes showing significant changes at each transition (Figure S3; Table S2). Consistent with recent studies (Hanchate et al., 2015Hanchate N.K. Kondoh K. Lu Z. Kuang D. Ye X. Qiu X. Pachter L. Trapnell C. Buck L.B.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that GBCs represent the major proliferative progenitor cell in the uninjured olfactory epithelium (Caggiano et al., 1994Caggiano M. Kauer J.S. Hunter D.D.

We therefore examined the expression of cell cycle-associated genes (Kowalczyk et al., 2015Kowalczyk M.S. Tirosh I. Heckl D. Rao T.N. Dixit A. Haas B.J. Schneider R.K. Wagers A.J. Ebert B.L. Regev A.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1977-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar; Figure S3) to determine whether and where expansion occurs in the neuronal and sustentacular cell lineages. As judged by expression of cell proliferation markers, GBCs and INP1 cells comprise the two actively proliferating progenitor cell types in the neuronal lineage (Figure 3B; Figure S3). In striking contrast, cells progress through the sustentacular cell lineage without a concerted upregulation of cell proliferation markers (Figure 3D; Figure S3). Thus, HBCs appear to transdifferentiate into sustentacular cells through a process that does not require cell division. A number of testable predictions can be made from the in silico branching lineage assignments and developmental ordering of differentiating olfactory cells shown in Figures 2 and 3. First, the initial branching of the sustentacular cell and neuronal lineages at the transitional HBC stage and in the absence of active cell proliferation suggests that, when stimulated to differentiate, each HBC adopts a unique cell fate; i.e., GBC versus sustentacular cell. In this scenario, the multipotency of the population of HBCs is driven by independent unipotent differentiation events that occur at the single-cell level. To test this prediction, we performed clonal lineage tracing in vivo. HBCs were labeled and stimulated to differentiate by induction of Cre recombinase activity with doses of tamoxifen adjusted to elicit sparse activation of HBCs in Krt5-CreER; Trp63lox/lox; Rosa26Confetti mice. Animals were sacrificed 7 and 14 days after tamoxifen induction, and the expression of fluorescent protein reporters encoded by the Rosa26Confetti locus was assessed using an anti-GFP antibody. Representative examples of labeled clones are shown in Figures 4A–4D. Consistent with Slingshot’s prediction that individual HBCs initially give rise to single lineages, at 14 days of differentiation, 90 of 99 clones contained cells representing either the combined neuronal/microvillous cell lineage (80, comprising 13 GBC-containing, 56 neuron only, 1 neuron + Bowman’s gland, 9 neuron + microvillous cell only, and 1 microvillous cell only) or sustentacular cells (10) but not cells from both lineages (Figure 4E). Clones containing a mixture of sustentacular cells and neurons comprise the remaining nine clones. Only one labeled Bowman’s gland was detected among the 99 clones scored for this analysis; the scarcity of lineage-traced Bowman’s glands mirrors their apparent absence in our analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data, suggesting that these cells arise only rarely from HBCs in the normal, uninjured epithelium. Similar results were obtained from clones scored at 7 days of differentiation (Figure S5). A second hypothesis based on our analysis with Slingshot is that sustentacular cells are formed through direct fate conversion from HBCs without cell division, whereas the neuronal lineage expands via proliferation of GBC and INP1 progenitors. Indeed, using our sparse lineage tracing strategy, we observed a marked disparity in the numbers of neurons and sustentacular cells per clone. At 14 days of differentiation, neuron-containing clones contained 13.5 ± 1.0 neurons (mean ± SEM) (Figure 4F), whereas sustentacular cells are present at one to two cells per clone (1.3 ± 0.1 cells; Figure 4G). The average number of neurons per clone increases from 7 days (8.8 ± 1.0 cells/clone) to 14 days, whereas the number of sustentacular cells per clone remains essentially unchanged over this interval (1.2 ± 0.1 cells/clone at 7 days; compare Figures 4F and 4G with Figure S5). Moreover, most sustentacular cell-containing clones contain only a single sustentacular cell, confirming the assignment of the first major branchpoint in the HBC-derived lineage to an early, non-proliferative transitional HBC stage. Complementing the predicted lineage trajectories, these observations provide strong evidence that HBCs differentiate directly into sustentacular cells in the absence of cell division. Alternatively, the presence of a single cell per clone may reflect proliferation of a sustentacular cell progenitor followed by apoptotic cell death, leaving, on average, a single mature daughter cell per differentiating stem cell. However, the very low frequency of activated caspase-3 expression in YFP lineage-traced cells (0%–0.6%; Figure 4I; Figure S5) is inconsistent with apoptosis as a significant contributor in the differentiation of mature cell types from HBC stem cells (Fletcher et al., 2011Fletcher R.B. Prasol M.S. Estrada J. Baudhuin A. Vranizan K. Choi Y.G. Ngai J. p63 regulates olfactory stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Neuron. 2011; 72: 748-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The presence of two sustentacular cells in a minority fraction of clones may reflect the proliferative capacity of the sustentacular cells themselves (Weiler and Farbman, 1998Weiler E. Farbman A.I. Supporting cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium decreases postnatally.Glia. 1998; 22: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and/or the occasional proliferation of resting HBCs (Fletcher et al., 2011Fletcher R.B. Prasol M.S. Estrada J. Baudhuin A. Vranizan K. Choi Y.G.

Consistent with these possibilities, rare proliferating cells can be observed at both the HBC and late sustentacular cell stages (Figure 3D). The third major prediction of our branching lineage assignment is that microvillous cells and olfactory sensory neurons arise from a common sub-lineage that branches at the GBC stage to give rise to these two cell types. In support of this prediction, nine of ten clones containing microvillous cells also contain neurons (Figure 4E). Microvillous cells are rare in comparison with olfactory sensory neurons (Hansen and Finger, 2008Hansen A. Finger T.E. Is TrpM5 a reliable marker for chemosensory cells?

https://openalex.org/W2614830473,"In medicine, it is critical that clinicians demonstrate both empathy (perceived as warmth) and competence. Perceptions of these qualities are often intuitive and are based on nonverbal behavior. Emphasizing both warmth and competence may prove problematic, however, because there is evidence that they are inversely related in other settings. We hypothesize that perceptions of physician competence will instead be positively correlated with perceptions of physician warmth and empathy, potentially due to changing conceptions of the physician's role. We test this hypothesis in an analog medical context using a large online sample, manipulating physician nonverbal behaviors suggested to communicate empathy (e.g. eye contact) and competence (the physician's white coat). Participants rated physicians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior as more empathic, warm, and more competent than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior, adjusting for mood. We found no warmth/competence tradeoff and, additionally, no significant effects of the white coat. Further, compared with male participants, female participants perceived physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior as less empathic. Given the significant consequences of clinician empathy, it is important for clinicians to learn how nonverbal behavior contributes to perceptions of warmth, and use it as another tool to improve their patients' emotional and physical health."

Unfortunately, lack of agreement in the literature on what constitutes recurrence makes it nearly impossible to compare the multiple treatments alternatives available today. The aim of this study is to bring an unbiased pool of experts to agree upon what would be considered a recurrence of DD after treatment; and from that consensus establish a much-needed definition for DD recurrence.To reach an expert consensus on the definition of recurrence we used the Delphi method and invited 43 Dupuytren's research and treatment experts from 10 countries to participate by answering a series of questionnaire rounds. After each round the answers were analyzed and the experts received a feedback report with another questionnaire round to further hone in of the definition. We defined consensus when at least 70% of the experts agreed on a topic.Twenty-one experts agreed to participate in this study. After four consensus rounds, we agreed that DD recurrence should be defined as ""more than 20 degrees of contracture recurrence in any treated joint at one year post-treatment compared to six weeks post-treatment"". In addition, ""recurrence should be reported individually for every treated joint"" and afterwards measurements should be repeated and reported yearly.This study provides the most comprehensive to date definition of what should be considered recurrence of DD. These standardized criteria should allow us to better evaluate the many treatment alternatives."

A two-step approach, including a 50-g, 1-h GCT and 100-g, 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), was employed for the diagnosis of GDM at weeks 23-32. The mid-pregnancy HbA1c level was measured at the time the OGTT was performed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the relationship between the mid-pregnancy HbA1c level and GDM. Multiple logistic regression models were implemented to assess the relationships between the mid-pregnancy HbA1c level and adverse pregnancy outcomes.An ROC curve demonstrated that the optimal mid-pregnancy HbA1c cut-off point to predict GDM, as diagnosed by the Carpenter-Coustan criteria using a two-step approach, was 5.7%. The area under the ROC curve of the mid-pregnancy HbA1c level for GDM was 0.70. Compared with the levels of 4.5-4.9%, higher mid-pregnancy HbA1c levels (5.0-5.4, 5.5-5.9, 6.0-6.4, 6.5-6.9, and >7.0%) were significantly associated with increased risks of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, preterm delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, low birth weight, and macrosomia (the odds ratio [OR] ranges were 1.20-9.98, 1.31-5.16, 0.88-3.15, 0.89-4.10, and 2.22-27.86, respectively).The mid-pregnancy HbA1c level was associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes in high-risk Taiwanese women. However, it lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace the two-step approach in the diagnosis of GDM. The current study comprised a single-center prospective study; thus, additional, randomized control design studies are required."
https://openalex.org/W2616638923,"Human neutrophil elastase impacts on atherosclerotic plaque stability by inducing apoptosis in endothelial cells. Our aim was to investigate the proapoptotic mechanism of elastase on endothelial cells and to evaluate the presence of elastase in human plaque material. Human endothelial cells were treated with purified human neutrophil elastase. Apoptosis was assayed by capsase-3/7 activation, TUNEL, and sub-G1 assay. Activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) effector molecules binding Ig protein, soluble X-binding protein-1, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and Western blot. Genetic silencing of CHOP was achieved by small interfering RNA. Elastase induces autophagic–apoptotic forms of endothelial cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner, in conjunction with a significant increase in phosphorylation/expression of the canonical UPR-activation markers PERK and CHOP. By using CHOP knockdown, we identified CHOP as a key mediator of elastase-induced endothelial cell death. Immunohistochemical analysis of human rupture-prone plaque specimens confirmed the presence of elastase and colocalization with apoptosis. We have demonstrated for the first time that the PERK-CHOP branch of the UPR is causally involved in elastase-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells. Ex vivo analysis of human rupture-prone plaques confirmed the presence of elastase and its colocalization with markers of apoptosis. This novel role of elastase underlines the potential of combined targeting of elastase and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the prevention of plaque progression and cardiovascular events.—Grechowa, I., Horke, S., Wallrath, A., Vahl, C.-F., Dorweiler, B.

Using the baseline data of the COSYCONET cohort we addressed this question. Data from 1746 COPD patients (GOLD stage 1–4; mean age 64.6 y, mean FEV1%pred 57%) were evaluated, focusing on the comorbidities hyperlipidemia, diabetes and cardiovascular complex (CVC; including arterial hypertension, cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease). Risk factors comprised age, gender, BMI, and packyears of smoking. The results of linear and logistic regression analyses were implemented into a path analysis model describing the multiple relationships between parameters. Hyperlipidemia (prevalence 42.9%) was associated with lower intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) and higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) when adjusting for its multiple relationships to risk factors and other comorbidities. These findings were robust in various statistical analyses. The associations between comorbidities and risk factors were in accordance with previous findings, thereby underlining the validity of our data. In conclusion, hyperlipidemia was associated with less hyperinflation and airway obstruction in patients with COPD. This surprising result might be due to different COPD phenotypes in these patients or related to effects of medication."
https://openalex.org/W2951530942,"The Honghe-Hani landscape in China is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site due to the beauty of its thousands of rice terraces, but these structures are in danger from the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish dig nest holes, which collapse terrace walls and destroy rice production. Under the current control strategy, farmers self-report crayfish and are issued pesticide, but this strategy is not expected to eradicate the crayfish nor to prevent their spread since farmers are not able to detect small numbers of crayfish. Thus, we tested whether environmental DNA (eDNA) from paddy-water samples could provide a sensitive detection method. In an aquarium experiment, Real-time Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) successfully detected crayfish, even at a simulated density of one crayfish per average-sized paddy (with one false negative). In a field test, we tested eDNA and bottle traps against direct counts of crayfish. eDNA successfully detected crayfish in all 25 paddies where crayfish were observed and in none of the 7 paddies where crayfish were absent. Bottle-trapping was successful in only 68% of the crayfish-present paddies. eDNA concentrations also correlated positively with crayfish counts. In sum, these results suggest that single samples of eDNA are able to detect small crayfish populations, but not perfectly. Thus, we conclude that a program of repeated eDNA sampling is now feasible and likely reliable for measuring crayfish geographic range and for detecting new invasion fronts in the Honghe Hani landscape, which would inform regional control efforts and help to prevent the further spread of this invasive crayfish."
https://openalex.org/W2616459304,"Skeletal muscle is capable of phenotypic adaptation to environmental factors, such as nutrient availability, by altering the balance between muscle catabolism and anabolism that in turn coordinates muscle growth. Small noncoding RNAs, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), repress the expression of target mRNAs, and many studies have demonstrated that miRNAs regulate the mRNAs of catabolic and anabolic genes. We evaluated muscle morphology, gene expression of components involved in catabolism, anabolism and energetic metabolism and miRNAs expression in both the fast and slow muscle of juvenile pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) during food restriction and refeeding. Our analysis revealed that short periods of food restriction followed by refeeding predominantly affected fast muscle, with changes in muscle fiber diameter and miRNAs expression. There was an increase in the mRNA levels of catabolic pathways components (FBXO25, ATG12, BCL2) and energetic metabolism-related genes (PGC1α and SDHA), together with a decrease in PPARβ/δ mRNA levels. Interestingly, an increase in mRNA levels of anabolic genes (PI3K and mTORC1 complex: mTOR, mLST8 and RAPTOR) was also observed during food restriction. After refeeding, muscle morphology showed similar patterns of the control group; the majority of genes were slightly up- or down-regulated in fast and slow muscle, respectively; the levels of all miRNAs increased in fast muscle and some of them decreased in slow muscle. Our findings demonstrated that a short period of food restriction in juvenile pacu had a considerable impact on fast muscle, increasing the expression of anabolic (PI3K and mTORC1 complex: mTOR, mLST8 and RAPTOR) and energetic metabolism genes. The miRNAs (miR-1, miR-206, miR-199 and miR-23a) were more expressed during refeeding and while their target genes (IGF-1, mTOR, PGC1α and MAFbx), presented a decreased expression. The alterations in mTORC1 complex observed during fasting may have influenced the rates of protein synthesis by using amino acids from protein degradation as an alternative mechanism to preserve muscle phenotype and metabolic demand maintenance."

Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is a close relative of the Brassica and most radish accessions are immune to the clubroot disease.

To predict the possibility to transfer the clubroot resistance trait from the RR subgenome of allotetraploid Brassicoraphanus (RRCC, 2n = 36) into Brassica napus (AACC, 2n = 38), we analyzed the frequency of chromosome pairings in the F1 hybrids produced from a cross between B. napus cv. HS5 and the allotetraploid, characterize the genomic composition of some backcrossed progeny (BC1) using GISH, BAC-FISH and AFLP techniques. The level of intergenomic pairing between A and R genomes in the F1 hybrid was high, allosyndetic bivalents formed in 73.53% PMCs indicative of significant level of homeologous recombination between two genomes and high probability of incorporating chromosomal segments/genes from R-genome into A/C-genomes. The BC1 plants inherited variant extra R chromosomes or fragments from allotetraploid as revealed by GISH and AFLP analysis. 13.51% BC2 individuals were resistant to clubroot disease, and several resistance lines had high pollen fertility, Overall, the genetic material presented in this work represents a potential new genetic resource for practical use in breeding B. napus clubroot resistant cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2614596316,"In 95% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, recurrence is observed following chemotherapy. Findings from several studies have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are resistant to anticancer agents and may be involved in cancer recurrence and metastasis. The CD44 protein is a major CSC marker, and CD44 also plays an indispensable role in the CSC properties in several cancers, including pancreatic cancer; however, no clinical approach exists to inhibit CD44 activity. Here, we have performed knock-in/knockdown experiments, and we demonstrate that the forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)/liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator-1β (PGC-1β)/pyruvate dehydrogenase-A1 pathway is essential for CD44 expression and CSC properties. We observed that patients exhibiting high pyruvate dehydrogenase-A1 expression have a poor prognosis. Systemic PGC-1β knock-out mice are fertile and viable and do not exhibit an overt phenotype under normal conditions. This suggests that cGMP induction and PGC-1β inhibition represent potential strategies for treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."

We revealed that fasting up-regulated the expression of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) components, including Argonaute and GW182, and the miRNA-processing enzyme DRSH-1 (the ortholog of the Drosophila Drosha enzyme). Our lifespan measurements demonstrated that IF-induced longevity was suppressed by knock-out or knockdown of miRISC components and was completely inhibited by drsh-1 ablation.

https://openalex.org/W2616375055,"Climate change threatens natural landscapes through shifting distribution and abundance of species and attendant change in the structure and function of ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how climate-mediated variation in species' environmental niche space may lead to large-scale fragmentation of species distributions, altered meta-population dynamics and gene flow, and disrupted ecosystem integrity. Such change may be especially relevant when species distributions are restricted either spatially or to a narrow environmental niche, or when environments are rapidly changing. Here, we use range-wide environmental niche models to posit that climate-mediated range fragmentation aggravates the direct effects of climate change on species in the boreal forest of North America. We show that climate change will directly alter environmental niche suitability for boreal-obligate species of trees, birds and mammals (n = 12), with most species ranges becoming smaller and shifting northward through time. Importantly, species distributions will become increasingly fragmented, as characterized by smaller mean size and greater isolation of environmentally-suitable landscape patches. This loss is especially pronounced along the Ontario-Québec border, where the boreal forest is narrowest and roughly 78% of suitable niche space could disappear by 2080. Despite the diversity of taxa surveyed, patterns of range fragmentation are remarkably consistent, with our models predicting that spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis), boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), moose (Alces americanus) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) could have entirely disjunct east-west population segments in North America. These findings reveal potentially dire consequences of climate change on population continuity and species diversity in the boreal forest, highlighting the need to better understand: 1) extent and primary drivers of anticipated climate-mediated range loss and fragmentation; 2) diversity of species to be affected by such change; 3) potential for rapid adaptation in the most strongly-affected areas; and 4) potential for invasion by replacement species."

Unfortunately, at present, it is difficult to determine the maturity level of peach fruits by artificial methods. The objectives of this study were to develop quadratic polynomial regression models using near-infrared spectroscopy that could determine the peel color difference, fruit firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), soluble sugar, organic acid components, and their relationships with the absorbance of chlorophyll (index of absorbance difference, IAD) in late maturing 'Xiahui 8' peach and 'Xiaguang' nectarine fruits. The analysis was based on data for fruits at veraison, fruits at harvesting maturity, and all fruits. The results showed that firmness has the highest correlation coefficient with IAD. Prediction models for fruit maturity were established between firmness and the IAD of the two cultivars using the quadratic polynomial regression method. Further variance analysis on the one degree term and quadratic term of each equation showed that every partial regression coefficient reached a significant or extremely significant level. No significant difference was observed between estimated and observed values after regression prediction. The regression equations seem to fit well. Other peach and nectarine varieties were used to test the feasibility of maturity prediction by this method, and it was found that maturity was successfully predicted in all the samples. The result indicated that the IAD can be used as an index to predict peach fruit maturity."

https://openalex.org/W2616726006,"Purpose 
We have shown previously that non-enzymatic nitration (NEN) of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which serves as a model of Bruch’s membrane (BM) aging, has a profound effect on the behavior of the overlying retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, including altered phagocytic ability, reduced cell adhesion, and inhibition of proliferation. We know that transplanted RPE monolayers will encounter a hostile sub-RPE environment, including age-related alterations in BM that may compromise cell function and survival. Here we use our previous NEN model of BM aging to determine the effects of NEN of the ECM on growth factor release and complement activation in RPE cells.


Methods 
Human induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into RPE cells, and confirmed by immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction. IPSC-derived RPE cells were plated onto RPE-derived ECM under untreated or nitrite-modified conditions. Cells were cultured for 7 days and barrier function measured by transepithelial resistance (TER). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and complement component C3a were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).


Results 
On average nitrite-modified ECM increased VEGF release both apically and basally by 0.15 ± 0.014 ng/mL (p 0.05)). Nitrite-modified ECM increased production of C3a in iPSC-derived RPE cells by 0.52 ± 0.123 ng/mL (p <0.05).


Conclusion 
Nitrite-modified ECM increased VEGF, PEDF release, and C3a production in human iPSC-derived RPE cells. This model demonstrates changes seen in the basement membrane can lead to alterations in the cell biology of the RPE cells that may be related to the development of age-related macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2615739608,"After centuries of range contraction, many megafauna species are recolonizing parts of Europe. One example is the red deer (Cervus elaphus), which was able to expand its range and is now found in half the areas it inhabited in the beginning of the 19th century. Herbivores are important ecosystem engineers, influencing e.g. vegetation. Knowledge on their habitat selection and their influence on ecosystems might be crucial for future landscape management, especially for hybrid and novel ecosystems emerging in post-industrial landscapes. In this study, red deer habitat selection was studied in a former brown-coal mining area in Denmark. Here, natural settings were severely changed during the mining activity and its current landscape is in large parts managed by hunters as suitable deer habitat. We assessed red deer habitat preferences through feces presence and camera traps combined with land cover data from vegetation sampling, remote sensing and official geographic data. Red deer occurrence was negatively associated with human disturbance and positively associated with forage availability, tree cover and mean terrain height. Apparently, red deer are capable of recolonizing former industrial landscapes quite well if key conditions such as forage abundance and cover are appropriate. In the absence of carnivores, human disturbance, such as a hunting regime is a main reason why deer avoid certain areas.

Methods Using data from a nationwide, multicenter, prospective study in Japan, we evaluated 198 biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)-naïve RA patients who were in remission or had LDA at study entry after being treated with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). CRRP was defined as the yearly progression of modified total Sharp score (mTSS) >3.0 U. We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to explore the factors to predict CRRP at 1 year. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to estimate the performance of relevant variables for predicting CRRP. Results The mean Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) was 2.32 ± 0.58 at study entry. During the 1-year observation, remission or LDA persisted in 72% of the patients. CRRP was observed in 7.6% of the patients. The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent variables to predict the development of CRRP were: anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) positivity at baseline (OR = 15.2, 95%CI 2.64–299), time-integrated DAS28-ESR during the 1 year post-baseline (7.85-unit increase, OR = 1.83, 95%CI 1.03–3.45), and the mTSS at baseline (13-unit increase, OR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.06–1.42). Conclusions ACPA positivity was the strongest independent predictor of CRRP in patients with RA in remission or LDA. Physicians should recognize ACPA as a poor-prognosis factor regarding the radiographic outcome of RA, even among patients showing a clinically favorable response to DMARDs."

Hypercapnia (elevated blood pCO2 >≈50 mm Hg) is a feature of several lung pathologies, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hypercapnia is associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and suppression of inflammatory signaling. The NF-κB pathway has been implicated in these effects; however, the molecular mechanisms underpinning cellular sensitivity of the NF-κB pathway to CO2 are not fully elucidated.

A cohort of RelB protein-protein interactions (e.g. with Raf-1 and IκBα) are altered by CO2 exposure, although others are maintained (e.g. with p100). RelB is processed by CO2 in a manner dependent on a key C-terminal domain located in its transactivation domain. Loss of the RelB transactivation domain alters NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity, and loss of p100 alters sensitivity of RelB to CO2. Thus, we provide molecular insight into the CO2 sensitivity of the NF-κB pathway and implicate altered RelB/p100-dependent signaling in the CO2-dependent regulation of inflammatory signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2616509746,"Stress at work is a public health concern. Phone operators in emergency medical dispatch centers are particularly at risk. We aimed to demonstrate that the most stressful time for emergency medical dispatchers is the shift when they receive emergency incoming calls, with cortisol as a biomarker of stress. For each emergency medical dispatcher, we measured outcomes over a control day and during three types of shift: Incoming emergency call, Dispatch and Re-assessment. The pattern of shifts was randomized. Saliva was sampled every 15 minutes for 2 hours, i.e. 6 consecutive times, starting 15 minutes after the first life-and-death incoming emergency call between 2 and 5 pm during three types of shift. We measured saliva cortisol every 2 hours over a control day, from 7am to 9pm. Perceived stress was assessed by a visual analog scale. We recruited 22 phone operators aged 36.4+/-10.8 years old (14 women and 8 men). Cortisol values were higher during the Incoming emergency call shift than during the Dispatch (p = .04) and Re-assessment (p = .04) shifts. The increase in cortisol levels was greater in men than in women (p = .009). There were no differences between control values and those of the three shifts. The kinetics of cortisol increased with greater perceived stress overall (p < .001) and for each type of shift (Incoming emergency call, p = .02; Dispatch p = .03; Re-assessment: p < .001). The kinetics of cortisol in response to incoming emergency calls was greater when the call was an absolute emergency (p = .03), and also tended to further increase when a subsequent absolute incoming emergency call was received (p = 0.07). In conclusion, the incoming emergency call shift carries particular risk for dispatchers, who have greater perceived stress and a greater increase in cortisol levels."

However, the role played by PDK1 is not studied in retinoblastoma (RB). In this study, we have evaluated the expression of PDK1 in RB clinical samples, and studied its inhibition as a strategy to decrease cell growth and migration. We show that PDK1 is specifically overexpressed in RB patient samples especially in vitreous seeds and hypoxic regions and cell lines compared to control retina using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Our results further demonstrate that inhibition of PDK1 using small molecule inhibitors dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and dichloroacetophenone (DAP) resulted in reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis. We also confirm that combination treatment of DCA with chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin further enhanced the therapeutic efficacy compared to single drug treatment. In addition, we observed changes in glucose uptake, lactate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as decreased cell migration in response to PDK1 inhibition. Additionally, we show that DCA treatment led to inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway and reduction in PDK1 protein levels. Overall, our data suggest that targeting PDK1 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for RB."
https://openalex.org/W2616263643,"Introduction Knee osteoarthrosis (KOA) is commonly associated with a dysfunction of the quadriceps muscle which contributes to alterations in motor performance. The underlying neuromuscular mechanisms of muscle dysfunction are not fully understood. The main objective of this study was to analyze how KOA affects neuromuscular function of the quadriceps muscle during different contraction intensities. Materials and methods The following parameters were assessed in 20 patients and 20 healthy controls: (i) joint position sense, i.e. position control (mean absolute error, MAE) at 30° and 50° of knee flexion, (ii) simple reaction time task performance, (iii) isometric maximal voluntary torque (IMVT) and root mean square of the EMG signal (RMS-EMG), (iv) torque control, i.e. accuracy (MAE), absolute fluctuation (standard deviation, SD), relative fluctuation (coefficient of variation, CV) and periodicity (mean frequency, MNF) of the torque signal at 20%, 40% and 60% IMVT, (v) EMG-torque relationship at 20%, 40% and 60% IMVT and (vi) performance fatigability, i.e. time to task failure (TTF) at 40% IMVT. Results Compared to the control group, the KOA group displayed: (i) significantly higher MAE of the angle signal at 30° (99.3%; P = 0.027) and 50° (147.9%; P < 0.001), (ii) no significant differences in reaction time, (iii) significantly lower IMVT (-41.6%; P = 0.001) and tendentially lower RMS-EMG of the rectus femoris (-33.7%; P = 0.054), (iv) tendentially higher MAE of the torque signal at 20% IMVT (65.9%; P = 0.068), significantly lower SD of the torque signal at all three torque levels and greater MNF at 60% IMVT (44.8%; P = 0.018), (v) significantly increased RMS-EMG of the vastus lateralis at 20% (70.8%; P = 0.003) and 40% IMVT (33.3%; P = 0.034), significantly lower RMS-EMG of the biceps femoris at 20% (-63.6%; P = 0.044) and 40% IMVT (-41.3%; P = 0.028) and tendentially lower at 60% IMVT (-24.3%; P = 0.075) and (vi) significantly shorter TTF (-51.1%; P = 0.049). Conclusion KOA is not only associated with a deterioration of IMVT and neuromuscular activation, but also with an impaired position and torque control at submaximal torque levels, an altered EMG-torque relationship and a higher performance fatigability of the quadriceps muscle. It is recommended that the rehabilitation includes strengthening and fatiguing exercises at maximal and submaximal force levels."
https://openalex.org/W2616264215,"Herbivores often move among spatially interspersed host plants, tracking high-quality resources through space and time. This dispersal is of particular interest for vectors of plant pathogens. Existing molecular tools to track such movement have yielded important insights, but often provide insufficient genetic resolution to infer spread at finer spatiotemporal scales. Here, we explore the use of Nextera-tagmented reductively-amplified DNA (NextRAD) sequencing to infer movement of a highly-mobile winged insect, the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), among host plants. The psyllid vectors the pathogen that causes zebra chip disease in potato (Solanum tuberosum), but understanding and managing the spread of this pathogen is limited by uncertainty about the insect’s host plant(s) outside of the growing season. We identified 1,978 polymorphic loci among psyllids separated spatiotemporally on potato or in patches of bittersweet nightshade (S. dulcumara), a weedy plant proposed to be the source of potato-colonizing psyllids. A subset of the psyllids on potato exhibited genetic similarity to insects on nightshade, consistent with regular movement between these two host plants. However, a second subset of potato-collected psyllids was genetically distinct from those collected on bittersweet nightshade; this suggests that a currently unrecognized source, i.e., other nightshade patches or a third host-plant species, could be contributing to psyllid populations in potato. Oftentimes, dispersal of vectors of pathogens must be tracked at a fine scale in order to understand, predict, and manage disease spread. We demonstrate that emerging sequencing technologies that detect genome-wide SNPs of a vector can be used to infer such localized movement."

In this pilot study, we tested if horses show the capacity of MSR. Four subjects living socially under naturalistic conditions were selected for the experiment. We adopted the classical mark test, which consists in placing a coloured mark on an out-of-view body part, visible only through mirror inspection. If the animal considers the image as its own, it will use its reflection to detect the mark and will try to explore it. We enhanced the classical paradigm by introducing a double-check control. Only in the presence of the reflecting surface, animals performed tactile and olfactory exploration of the mirror and looked behind it. These behaviors suggest that subjects were trying to associate multiple sensory cues (visual, tactile and olfactory) to the image in the mirror. The lack of correspondence between the collected stimuli in front of the mirror and the response to the colored mark lead us to affirm that horses are able to perceive that the reflected image is incongruent when compared with the memorized information of a real horse. However, without replication of data, the self-directed behavior towards the colored marks showed by our horses cannot be sufficient per se to affirm that horses are capable of self-recognition."

The healthy subjects were divided into two populations: a teaching population (n = 40, used to establish choroidal zones) and a validating population (n = 40, used to compare measurements with PD patients). An optic disc 6.0×6.0 mm three-dimensional scan was obtained using Deep Range Imaging (DRI) OCT Triton. A 26×26 cube-grid centered on the optic disc was generated to automatically measure choroidal thickness. Five concentric choroidal zones were established and used to compare PPCT between healthy and PD patients.PPCT was significantly thicker in PD patients compared with controls in all four concentric zones evaluated (p≤0.0001). PPCT followed a similar pattern in controls and PD; it was thicker in the temporosuperior region, followed by the superior, temporal, nasal, and inferior regions.PD patients presented with an increased PPCT in all zones surrounding the optic disc compared with healthy subjects. The peripapillary choroidal tissue showed a concentric pattern, with the thickness increasing with increasing distance from the optic nerve. SS-OCT could be useful for evaluating choroidal thinning in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2949577162,"Antibody libraries are important resources to derive antibodies to be used for a wide range of applications, from structural and functional studies to intracellular protein interference studies to developing new diagnostics and therapeutics. Whatever the goal, the key parameter for an antibody library is its complexity (also known as diversity), i.e. the number of distinct elements in the collection, which directly reflects the probability of finding in the library an antibody against a given antigen, of sufficiently high affinity. Quantitative evaluation of antibody library complexity and quality has been for a long time inadequately addressed, due to the high similarity and length of the sequences of the library. Complexity was usually inferred by the transformation efficiency and tested either by fingerprinting and/or sequencing of a few hundred random library elements. Inferring complexity from such a small sampling is, however, very rudimental and gives limited information about the real diversity, because complexity does not scale linearly with sample size. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has opened new ways to tackle the antibody library complexity quality assessment. However, much remains to be done to fully exploit the potential of NGS for the quantitative analysis of antibody repertoires and to overcome current limitations. To obtain a more reliable antibody library complexity estimate here we show a new, PCR-free, NGS approach to sequence antibody libraries on Illumina platform, coupled to a new bioinformatic analysis and software (Diversity Estimator of Antibody Library, DEAL) that allows to reliably estimate the complexity, taking in consideration the sequencing error."
https://openalex.org/W2614532019,"Celiac disease (CD), a multi-factorial auto-inflammatory disease of the small intestine, is known to occur in both sporadic and familial forms. Together HLA and Non-HLA genes can explain up to 50% of CD's heritability. In order to discover the missing heritability due to rare variants, we have exome sequenced a consanguineous Saudi family presenting CD in an autosomal recessive (AR) pattern. We have identified a rare homozygous insertion c.1683_1684insATT, in the conserved coding region of AK5 gene that showed classical AR model segregation in this family. Sequence validation of 200 chromosomes each of sporadic CD cases and controls, revealed that this extremely rare (EXac MAF 0.000008) mutation is highly penetrant among general Saudi populations (MAF is 0.62). Genotype and allelic distribution analysis have indicated that this AK5 (c.1683_1684insATT) mutation is negatively selected among patient groups and positively selected in the control group, in whom it may modify the risk against CD development [p<0.002]. Our observation gains additional support from computational analysis which predicted that Iso561 insertion shifts the existing H-bonds between 400th and 556th amino acid residues lying near the functional domain of adenylate kinase. This shuffling of amino acids and their H-bond interactions is likely to disturb the secondary structure orientation of the polypeptide and induces the gain-of-function in nucleoside phosphate kinase activity of AK5, which may eventually down-regulates the reactivity potential of CD4+ T-cells against gluten antigens. Our study underlines the need to have population-specific genome databases to avoid false leads and to identify true candidate causal genes for the familial form of celiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2616721631,"Human myosin VIIa (MYO7A) is an actin-linked motor protein associated with human Usher syndrome (USH) type 1B, which causes human congenital hearing and visual loss. Although it has been thought that the role of human myosin VIIa is critical for USH1 protein tethering with actin and transportation along actin bundles in inner-ear hair cells, myosin VIIa's motor function remains unclear. Here, we studied the motor function of the tail-truncated human myosin VIIa dimer (HM7AΔTail/LZ) at the single-molecule level. We found that the HM7AΔTail/LZ moves processively on single actin filaments with a step size of 35 nm. Dwell-time distribution analysis indicated an average waiting time of 3.4 s, yielding ∼0.3 s−1 for the mechanical turnover rate; hence, the velocity of HM7AΔTail/LZ was extremely slow, at 11 nm·s−1. We also examined HM7AΔTail/LZ movement on various actin structures in demembranated cells. HM7AΔTail/LZ showed unidirectional movement on actin structures at cell edges, such as lamellipodia and filopodia. However, HM7AΔTail/LZ frequently missed steps on actin tracks and exhibited bidirectional movement at stress fibers, which was not observed with tail-truncated myosin Va. These results suggest that the movement of the human myosin VIIa motor protein is more efficient on lamellipodial and filopodial actin tracks than on stress fibers, which are composed of actin filaments with different polarity, and that the actin structures influence the characteristics of cargo transportation by human myosin VIIa. In conclusion, myosin VIIa movement appears to be suitable for translocating USH1 proteins on stereocilia actin bundles in inner-ear hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W2614138413,"Background Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered to have similar renoprotective effects; so far there has been no consensus about their priorities. This study aimed to compare ACEIs and ARBs for major renal outcomes and survival in a 15-year cohort of adults with diabetes. Methods This study utilized Taiwan’s medical and pharmacy claims data in the Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients. The primary outcome was long-term dialysis, and secondary outcomes were hospitalization for acute kidney injury, hospitalization for hyperkalemia, all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and non-cardiovascular death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes comparing ACEIs with ARBs. We conducted subgroup analyses and interaction tests among patients with different age and comorbid diseases. Results A total of 34,043 patients received ACEIs and 23,772 patients received ARBs. No differences were found for primary or secondary outcomes in the main analyses. ACEIs showed significantly lower hazard than ARBs for long-term dialysis among patients with cardiovascular disease (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66–0.97, interaction P = 0.003) or chronic kidney disease (0.81, 0.71–0.93, interaction P = 0.001). Conclusions Our analyses show similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes. However, ACEIs might provide additional renoprotective effects among patients who have cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2614981452,"The dilution method is the principal tool used to infer in situ microzooplankton grazing rates. However, grazing is the only mortality process considered in the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of dilution method experiments. Here we evaluate the robustness of mortality estimates inferred from dilution experiments when there is concurrent niche competition amongst phytoplankton. Using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that grazing rates may be overestimated—the degree of overestimation is related to the importance of niche competition relative to microzooplankton grazing. In response, we propose a conceptual method to disentangle the effects of niche competition and grazing by diluting out microzooplankton, but not phytoplankton. Our theoretical results suggest this revised “Z-dilution” method can robustly infer grazing mortality, regardless of the dominant phytoplankton mortality driver in our system. Further, we show it is possible to independently estimate both grazing mortality and niche competition if the classical and Z-dilution methods can be used in tandem. We discuss the significance of these results for quantifying phytoplankton mortality rates; and the feasibility of implementing the Z-dilution method in practice, whether in model systems or in complex communities with overlap in the size distributions of phytoplankton and microzooplankton."
https://openalex.org/W2616072648,"Comparative oncology has shown that naturally occurring canine cancers are of valuable and translatable interest for the understanding of human cancer biology and the characterization of new therapies. This work was part of a comparative oncology project assessing a new, clinical-stage topoisomerase II inhibitor and comparing it with etoposide in dogs with spontaneous lymphoma with the objective to translate findings from dogs to humans. Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor widely used in various humans’ solid and hematopoietic cancer, but little data is available concerning its potential antitumor efficacy in dogs. Etoposide phosphate is a water-soluble prodrug of etoposide which is expected to be better tolerated in dogs. The objectives of this study were to assess the safety, the tolerability and the efficacy of intravenous etoposide phosphate in dogs with multicentric lymphoma. Seven dose levels were evaluated in a traditional 3+3 phase I design. Twenty-seven owned-dogs with high-grade multicentric lymphoma were enrolled and treated with three cycles of etoposide phosphate IV injections every 2 weeks. Adverse effects were graded according to the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group criteria. A complete end-staging was realized 45 days after inclusion. The maximal tolerated dose was 300 mg/m2. At this dose level, the overall response rate was 83.3% (n = 6, 3 PR and 2 CR). Only a moderate reversible gastrointestinal toxicity, no severe myelotoxicity and no hypersensitivity reaction were reported at this dose level. Beyond the characterization of etoposide clinical efficacy in dogs, this study underlined the clinical and therapeutic homologies between dog and human lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2614645256,"Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) infection causes nerve damage and the condition worsens often during and long after treatment. Clearance of bacterial antigens including lipoarabinomannan (LAM) during and after treatment in leprosy patients is slow. We previously demonstrated that M. leprae LAM damages peripheral nerves by in situ generation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Investigating the role of complement activation in skin lesions of leprosy patients might provide insight into the dynamics of in situ immune reactivity and the destructive pathology of M. leprae. In this study, we analyzed in skin lesions of leprosy patients, whether M. leprae antigen LAM deposition correlates with the deposition of complement activation products MAC and C3d on nerves and cells in the surrounding tissue. Skin biopsies of paucibacillary (n = 7), multibacillary leprosy patients (n = 7), and patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (n = 6) or reversal reaction (RR) (n = 4) and controls (n = 5) were analyzed. The percentage of C3d, MAC and LAM deposition was significantly higher in the skin biopsies of multibacillary compared to paucibacillary patients (p = <0.05, p = <0.001 and p = <0.001 respectively), with a significant association between LAM and C3d or MAC in the skin biopsies of leprosy patients (r = 0.9578, p< 0.0001 and r = 0.8585, p<0.0001 respectively). In skin lesions of multibacillary patients, MAC deposition was found on axons and co-localizing with LAM. In skin lesions of paucibacillary patients, we found C3d positive T-cells in and surrounding granulomas, but hardly any MAC deposition. In addition, MAC immunoreactivity was increased in both ENL and RR skin lesions compared to non-reactional leprosy patients (p = <0.01 and p = <0.01 respectively). The present findings demonstrate that complement is deposited in skin lesions of leprosy patients, suggesting that inflammation driven by complement activation might contribute to nerve damage in the lesions of these patients. This should be regarded as an important factor in M. leprae nerve damage pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2614969871,"The role of posttranslational modifications in axonal injury and regeneration has been widely studied but there has been little consensus over the mechanism by which each modification affects adult axonal growth. Acetylation is known to play an important role in a variety of neuronal functions and its homeostasis is controlled by two enzyme families: the Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) and Histone Acetyl Transferases (HATs). Recent studies show that HDAC5 deacetylates microtubules in the axonal cytoplasm as part of an injury-induced regeneration response, but little is known about how acetylation of microtubules plays a role. Alpha-tubulin acetyl transferase (αTAT1) is a microtubule specific acetyl transferase that binds to microtubules and directly affects microtubule stability in cells. We hypothesize that increasing tubulin acetylation may play an important role in increasing the rate of axonal growth. In this study, we infected cultured adult DRG neurons with αTAT1 and αTAT1-D157N, a catalytically inactive mutant, and HDAC5, using lentiviruses. We found that αTAT1 significantly increases tubulin acetylation in 293T cells and DRG neurons but αTAT1-D157N does not. Furthermore, in neurons infected with αTAT1, a significant increase in acetylated tubulin was detected towards the distal portion of the axon but this increase was not detected in neurons infected with αTAT1-D157N. However, we found a significant increase in axon lengths of DRG neurons after αTAT1 and αTAT1-D157N infection, but no effect on axon lengths after infection with HDAC5. Our results suggest that while αTAT1 may play a role in axon growth in vitro, the increase is not directly due to acetylation of axonal microtubules. Our results also show that HDAC5 overexpression in the axonal cytoplasm does not play a crucial role in axonal regeneration of cultured DRG neurons. We expressed these genes in DRG neurons in adult rats and performed a sciatic nerve crush. We found that axons did not regenerate any better when infected with any of the constructs compared with control animals. Thus, while αTAT1 may be important for axonal growth in vitro, neither αTAT1 nor HDAC5 had an effect in vivo on the regeneration of sciatic nerves."

Methods Observational studies on the relationship between HBsAg positivity and MetS were obtained from PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library in April 2016. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of MetS and its components (central obesity, increased fasting glucose, increased blood pressure, dyslipidemia) for subjects with or without HBsAg positivity were synthesized. The standardized mean difference of MetS components between HBsAg-positive participants and healthy controls was calculated. Heterogeneity was explored with subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was detected using Egger’s test and Begg’s test. Results Thirty studies were eligible for meta-analysis. The MetS OR for HBsAg-positive participants was significantly decreased compared with the controls [OR = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70–0.90]. The negative effect of HBsAg positivity on elevated triglycerides (OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.59–0.64) was strong, while that for increased fasting blood glucose was weak (OR = 0.94, 95% CI, 0.90–0.98). The pooled ORs of central obesity (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.91–1.04), reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.83–1.14), and elevated blood pressure (OR = 1.00, 95% CI, 0.80–1.25) for HBsAg-positive participants were all not significantly different compared with the controls. No publication bias was detected. Conclusions Serum HBsAg positivity is inversely associated with the prevalence of MetS. Among the five components of MetS, elevated triglycerides had the strongest inverse relationship with HBsAg positivity."
https://openalex.org/W2615994003,"We investigate the effect of mechano-electrical feedback and atrial fibrillation induced electrical remodelling (AFER) of cellular ion channel properties on the dynamics of spiral waves in a discrete 2D model of human atrial tissue. The tissue electro-mechanics are modelled using the discrete element method (DEM). Millions of bonded DEM particles form a network of coupled atrial cells representing 2D cardiac tissue, allowing simulations of the dynamic behaviour of electrical excitation waves and mechanical contraction in the tissue. In the tissue model, each cell is modelled by nine particles, accounting for the features of individual cellular geometry; and discrete inter-cellular spatial arrangement of cells is also considered. The electro-mechanical model of a human atrial single-cell was constructed by strongly coupling the electrophysiological model of Colman et al. to the mechanical myofilament model of Rice et al., with parameters modified based on experimental data. A stretch-activated channel was incorporated into the model to simulate the mechano-electrical feedback. In order to investigate the effect of mechano-electrical feedback on the dynamics of spiral waves, simulations of spiral waves were conducted in both the electromechanical model and the electrical-only model in normal and AFER conditions, to allow direct comparison of the results between the models. Dynamics of spiral waves were characterized by tracing their tip trajectories, stability, excitation frequencies and meandering range of tip trajectories. It was shown that the developed DEM method provides a stable and efficient model of human atrial tissue with considerations of the intrinsically discrete and anisotropic properties of the atrial tissue, which are challenges to handle in traditional continuum mechanics models. This study provides mechanistic insights into the complex behaviours of spiral waves and the genesis of atrial fibrillation by showing an important role of the mechano-electrical feedback in facilitating and promoting atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2616764808,"Although seagrass species in the genus Halophila are generally distributed in tropical or subtropical regions, H. nipponica has been reported to occur in temperate coastal waters of the northwestern Pacific. Because H. nipponica occurs only in the warm temperate areas influenced by the Kuroshio Current and shows a tropical seasonal growth pattern, such as severely restricted growth in low water temperatures, it was hypothesized that this temperate Halophila species diverged from tropical species in the relatively recent evolutionary past. We used a phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions to examine the genetic variability and evolutionary trend of H. nipponica. ITS sequences of H. nipponica from various locations in Korea and Japan were identical or showed very low sequence divergence (less than 3-base pair, bp, difference), confirming that H. nipponica from Japan and Korea are the same species. Halophila species in the section Halophila, which have simple phyllotaxy (a pair of petiolate leaves at the rhizome node), were separated into five well-supported clades by maximum parsimony analysis. H. nipponica grouped with H. okinawensis and H. gaudichaudii from the subtropical regions in the same clade, the latter two species having quite low ITS sequence divergence from H. nipponica (7–15-bp). H. nipponica in Clade I diverged 2.95 ± 1.08 million years ago from species in Clade II, which includes H. ovalis. According to geographical distribution and genetic similarity, H. nipponica appears to have diverged from a tropical species like H. ovalis and adapted to warm temperate environments. The results of divergence time estimates suggest that the temperate H. nipponica is an older species than the subtropical H. okinawensis and H. gaudichaudii and they may have different evolutionary histories."
https://openalex.org/W2614391934,"A small proportion of women who are exposed to infection with human-papillomavirus (HPV) develop cervical cancer (CC). Genetic factors may affect the risk of progression from HPV infection to cervical precancer and cancer. We used samples from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) multicentric case-control study to evaluate the association of selected genetic variants with CC. Overall, 790 CC cases and 717 controls from Algeria, Morocco, India and Thailand were included. Cervical exfoliated cells were obtained from control women and cervical exfoliated cells or biopsy specimens from cases. HPV-positivity was determined using a general primer GP5+/6+ mediated PCR. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of host genotypes with CC risk, using the homozygous wild type genotype as the referent category and adjusting by age and study centre. The association of polymorphisms with the risk of high-risk HPV-positivity among controls was also evaluated. A statistically significant association was observed between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CHR6 rs2844511 and CC risk: the OR for carriers of the GA or GG genotypes was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.43-1.14) and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.38-0.98), respectively, relative to carriers of AA genotype (p-value for trend 0.03). We also observed associations of borderline significance with the TIPARP rs2665390 polymorphism, which was previously found to be associated with ovarian and breast cancer, and with the EXOC1 rs13117307 polymorphism, which has been linked to cervical cancer in a large study in a Chinese population. We confirmed the association between CC and the rs2844511 polymorphism previously identified in a GWAS study in a Swedish population. The major histocompatibility region of chromosome 6, or perhaps other SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, may be involved in CC onset."
https://openalex.org/W2615028889,"According to most models of mycobacterial infection, inhibition of the pro-inflammatory macrophage immune responses contributes to the persistence of bacteria. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a highly successful pathogen in cattle and sheep and is also implicated as the causative agent of Crohn's disease in humans. Pathogenic mycobacteria such as MAP have developed multiple strategies to evade host defence mechanisms including interfering with the macrophages' capacity to respond to IFN-γ, a feature which might be lacking in non-pathogenic mycobacteria such as M. smegmatis. We hypothesized that pre-sensitisation of macrophages with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ would help in overcoming the inhibitory effect of MAP or its antigens on macrophage inflammatory responses. Herein we have compared a series of macrophage activation parameters in response to MAP and M. smegmatis as well as mycobacterial antigens. While IFN-γ did overcome the inhibition in immune suppressive mechanisms in response to MAP antigen as well as M. smegmatis, we could not find a clear role for IFN-γ in overcoming the inhibition of macrophage inflammatory responses to the pathogenic mycobacterium, MAP. We demonstrate that suppression of macrophage defence mechanisms by pathogenic mycobacteria is unlikely to be overcome by prior sensitization with IFN-γ alone. This indicates that IFN-γ signaling pathway-independent mechanisms may exist for overcoming inhibition of macrophage effector functions in response to pathogenic mycobacteria. These findings have important implications in understanding the survival mechanisms of pathogenic mycobacteria directed towards finding better therapeutics and vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2615204866,"Semantic cognition, i.e. processing of meaning is based on semantic representations and their controlled retrieval. Semantic control has been shown to be implemented in a network that consists of left inferior frontal (IFG), and anterior and posterior middle temporal gyri (a/pMTG). We aimed to disrupt semantic control processes with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over left IFG and pMTG and to study whether behavioral effects are moderated by induced alterations in resting-state functional connectivity. To this end, we applied real cTBS over left IFG and left pMTG as well as sham stimulation on 20 healthy participants in a within-subject design. Stimulation was followed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and a semantic priming paradigm. Resting-state functional connectivity of regions of interest in left IFG, pMTG and aMTG revealed highly interconnected left-lateralized fronto-temporal networks representing the semantic system. We did not find any significant direct modulation of either task performance or resting-state functional connectivity by effective cTBS. However, after sham cTBS, functional connectivity between IFG and pMTG correlated with task performance under high semantic control demands in the semantic priming paradigm. These findings provide evidence for the functional relevance of interactions between IFG and pMTG for semantic control processes. This interaction was functionally less relevant after cTBS over aIFG which might be interpretable in terms of an indirect disruptive effect of cTBS."
https://openalex.org/W2614633295,"Background Congenital deafness is one of the most distressing disorders affecting humanity and exhibits a high incidence worldwide. Most cases of congenital deafness in the Chinese population are caused by defects in a limited number of genes. A convenient and reliable method for detecting common deafness-related gene mutations in the Chinese population is required. Methods We developed a PCR-reverse dot blot (RDB) assay for screening 20 hotspot mutations of GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1, which are common non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL)–associated genes in the Chinese population. The PCR-RDB assay consists of multiplex PCR amplifications of 10 fragments in the target sequence of the four above-mentioned genes in wild-type and mutant genomic DNA samples followed by hybridization to a test strip containing allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. We applied our method to a set of 225 neonates with deafness gene mutations and 30 normal neonates. Results The test was validated through direct sequencing in a blinded study with 100% concordance. Conclusions The results demonstrated that our reverse dot blot assay is a reliable and effective genetic screening method for identifying carriers and individuals with NSHL among the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2616413311,"Protein degradation in bacteria is a highly controlled process involving proteolytic adaptors that regulate protein degradation during cell cycle progression or during stress responses. Many adaptors work as scaffolds that selectively bind cargo and tether substrates to their cognate proteases to promote substrate destruction, whereas others primarily activate the target protease. Because adaptors must bind their cognate protease, all adaptors run the risk of being recognized by the protease as substrates themselves, a process that could limit their effectiveness. Here we use purified proteins in a reconstituted system and in vivo studies to show that adaptors of the ClpXP protease are readily degraded but that cargo binding inhibits this degradation. We found that this principle extends across several adaptor systems, including the hierarchical adaptors that drive the Caulobacter bacterial cell cycle and the quality control adaptor SspB. We also found that the ability of a cargo to protect its adaptor is adaptor substrate-specific, as adaptors with artificial degradation tags were not protected even though cargo binding is unaffected. Our work points to an optimization of inherent adaptor degradation and cargo binding that ensures that robust adaptor activity is maintained when high amounts of substrate must be delivered and that adaptors can be eliminated when their tasks have been completed.

https://openalex.org/W2614407192,"Using Multiple Identity Tracking task and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology, the present study aimed to isolate and visualize the functional anatomy of neural systems involved in the semantic category-based grouping process. Three experiment conditions were selected and compared: the category-based targets grouping (TG) condition, the targets-distractors grouping (TDG) condition and the homogenous condition. In the TG condition, observers could utilize the categorical distinction between targets and distractors, to construct a uniform presentation of targets, that is, to form a group of the targets to facilitate tracking. In the TDG condition, half the targets and half the distractors belonged to the same category. Observers had to inhibit the grouping of targets and distractors in one category to complete tracking. In the homogenous condition, where targets and distractors consisted of the same objects, no grouping could be formed. The ""TG-Homogenous"" contrast (p<0.01) revealed the activation of the left fusiform and the pars triangularis of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The ""TG-TDG"" contrast only revealed the activation of the left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC). The fusiform and IFG pars triangularis might participate in the representation of semantic knowledge, IFG pars triangularis might relate intensely with the classification of semantic categories. The ACC might be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of grouping representation."
https://openalex.org/W2615690326,"The hallmark of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is the presence of giant, mostly multinucleated Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Whereas it has recently been shown that giant HRS cells evolve from small Hodgkin cells by incomplete cytokinesis and re-fusion of tethered sister cells, it remains unsolved why this phenomenon particularly takes place in this lymphoma and what the differences between these cell types of variable sizes are. The aim of the present study was to characterize microdissected small and giant HRS cells by gene expression profiling and to assess differences of clonal growth behavior as well as susceptibility toward cytotoxic intervention between these different cell types to provide more insight into their distinct cellular potential. Applying stringent filter criteria, only two differentially expressed genes between small and giant HRS cells, SHFM1 and LDHB, were identified. With looser filter criteria, 13 genes were identified to be differentially overexpressed in small compared to giant HRS cells. These were mainly related to energy metabolism and protein synthesis, further suggesting that small Hodgkin cells resemble the proliferative compartment of cHL. SHFM1, which is known to be involved in the generation of giant cells, was downregulated in giant RS cells at the RNA level. However, reduced mRNA levels of SHFM1, LDHB and HSPA8 did not translate into decreased protein levels in giant HRS cells. In cell culture experiments it was observed that the fraction of small and big HRS cells was adjusted to the basic level several days after enrichment of these populations via cell sorting, indicating that small and big HRS cells can reconstitute the full spectrum of cells usually observed in the culture. However, assessment of clonal growth of HRS cells indicated a significantly reduced potential of big HRS cells to form single cell colonies. Taken together, our findings pinpoint to strong similarities but also some differences between small and big HRS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2614753278,"T and NK-cell lymphoma is a collection of aggressive disorders with unfavorable outcome, in which targeted treatments are still at a preliminary phase. To gain deeper insights into the deregulated mechanisms promoting this disease, we searched a panel of 31 representative T-cell and 2 NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines for predictive markers of response to targeted therapy. To this end, targeted sequencing was performed alongside the expression of specific biomarkers corresponding to potentially activated survival pathways. The study identified TP53, NOTCH1 and DNMT3A as the most frequently mutated genes. We also found common alterations in JAK/STAT and epigenetic pathways. Immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear accumulation of MYC (in 85% of the cases), NFKB (62%), p-STAT (44%) and p-MAPK (30%). This panel of cell lines captures the complexity of T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative processes samples, with the partial exception of AITL cases. Integrated mutational and immunohistochemical analysis shows that mutational changes cannot fully explain the activation of key survival pathways and the resulting phenotypes. The combined integration of mutational/expression changes forms a useful tool with which new compounds may be assayed."
https://openalex.org/W2614935649,"Fetal adversity, evidenced by poor fetal growth for instance, is associated with increased risk for several diseases later in life. Classical cut-offs to characterize small (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) newborns are used to define long term vulnerability. We aimed at exploring the possible dynamism of different birth weight cut-offs in defining vulnerability in developmental outcomes (through the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development), using the example of a gene vs. fetal adversity interaction considering gene choices based on functional relevance to the studied outcome.36-month-old children from an established prospective birth cohort (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment) were classified according to birth weight ratio (BWR) (SGA ≤0.85, LGA >1.15, exploring a wide range of other cut-offs) and genotyped for polymorphisms associated with dopamine signaling (TaqIA-A1 allele, DRD2-141C Ins/Ins, DRD4 7-repeat, DAT1-10- repeat, Met/Met-COMT), composing a score based on the described function, in which hypofunctional variants received lower scores.There were 251 children (123 girls and 128 boys). Using the classic cut-offs (0.85 and 1.15), there were no statistically significant interactions between the neonatal groups and the dopamine genetic score. However, when changing the cut-offs, it is possible to see ranges of BWR that could be associated with vulnerability to poorer development according to the variation in the dopamine function.The classic birth weight cut-offs to define SGA and LGA newborns should be seen with caution, as depending on the outcome in question, the protocols for long-term follow up could be either too inclusive-therefore most costly, or unable to screen true vulnerabilities-and therefore ineffective to establish early interventions and primary prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2616546860,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), which has the same sequence as oncoprotein (OP) in humans, can induce nucleoside triphosphates in DNA replication by maintenance of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP's) and is known to be regulated by viral infection in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. This paper describes the relationship between NDK and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. The recombinant NDK was produced by a prokaryotic expression system. WSSV copy numbers and mRNA levels of IE1 and VP28 were significantly increased in shrimp injected with recombinant NDK at 72 h after WSSV infection. After synthesizing dsRNA-NDK and confirming the efficacy of NDK silencing, we recorded the cumulative mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp injected with NDK and dsRNA-NDK. A comparison between the results demonstrated that silencing NDK delayed the death of shrimps. These findings indicate that NDK has an important role influencing the replication of WSSV replication in shrimp. Furthermore, NDK may have potential target as a new therapeutic strategy against WSSV infection in shrimp."
