https://openalex.org/W2063787806,"Retinal dopamine-containing amacrine neurons are rapidly activated by light, as shown by an increase in the rate of dopamine formation in vivo and a concomitant increase in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, measured in vitro with a subsaturating concentration of pteridine cofactor. Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase also occurs when isolated eyes from rats killed in the dark are exposed to a strobe light. Studies of amacrine neurons should provide basic data about the biochemical processing of visual information, as well as the physiological presynaptic regulatory mechanisms of dopamine-containing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W46142867,"Purification of soluble guanylate cyclase activity from rat liver resulted in loss of enzyme responsiveness to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), nitroprusside, nitrite, and NO. Responses were restored by addition of heat-treated hepatic supernatant fraction, implying a requirement for heat-stable soluble factor(s) in the optimal expression of the actions of the activators. Addition of free hematin, hemoglobin, methemoglobin, active or heat-inactivated catalase partially restores responsiveness of purified guanylate cyclase to MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside. These responses were markedly potentiated by the presence of an appropriate concentration of reducing agent (dithiothreitol, ascorbate, cysteine, or glutathione), which maintains heme iron in the ferro form and favors formation of paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complexes from the activators. High concentrations of heme or reducing agents were inhibitory, and heme was not required for the expression of the stimulatory effects of Mn2+ or Mg2+ on purified guanylate cyclase. Preformed nitrosyl hemoglobin (10 micron) increased activity of the purified enzyme 10- to 20-fold over basal with Mn2+ as the metal cofactor and 90- to 100-fold with Mg2+. Purified guanylate cyclase was more sensitive to preformed NO-hemoglobin (minimally effective concentration, 0.1 micron) than to MNNG (1 micron), nitroprusside (50 micron), or nitrite (1 mM). A reducing agent was not required for optimal stimulation of guanylate cyclase by NO-hemoglobin. Maximal NO-hemoglobin-responsive guanylate cyclase was not further increased by subsequent addition of NO, MNNG, nitrite, or nitroprusside. Activation by each agent resulted in analogous alterations in the Mn2+ and Mg2+ requirements of enzyme activity, and responses were inhibited by the thiol-blocking agents N-ethylmaleimide, arsenite, or iodoacetamide. The results suggest that NO-hemoglobin, MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside activate guanylate cyclase through similar mechanisms. The stimulatory effects of preformed NO-hemoglobin combined with the clear requirements for heme plus a reducing agent in the optimal expression of the actions of MNNG, NO, and related agents are consistent with a role for the paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complex in the activation of guanylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1522944183,Toxin II isolated from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata enhances activation of the action potential sodium ionophore of electrically excitable neuroblastoma cells by veratridine and batrachotoxin. This heterotropic cooperative effect is identical to that observed previously with scorpion toxin but occurs at a 110-fold higher concentration. Depolarization of the neuroblastoma cells inhibits the effect of sea anemone toxin as observed previously for scorpion toxin. Specific scorpion toxin binding is inhibited by sea anemone toxin with KD approximately equal to 90 nM. These results show that the polypeptides scorpion toxin and sea anemone toxin II share a common receptors site associated with action potential sodium ionophores.
https://openalex.org/W1591324345,"Purified prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGG2 and PGH2) and hydroperoxides (15-OOH-PGE2) as well as fatty acid hydroperoxides (12-OOH-20:4, 15-00H-20:4, and 13-OOH-18:2) were examined as effectors of soluble splenic cell guanylate cyclase activity. The procedures described (in the miniprint supplement) for the preparation, purification, and characterization of these components circumvented the use of diethyl ether which obscured effects of lipid effectors because of contaminants presumed to be ether peroxides which were stimulatory to the cyclase. Addition of prostaglandin endoperoxides or fatty acid hydroperoxides to the reaction mixture led to a time-dependent activation of guanylate cyclase activity; 2.5- to 5-fold stimulation was seen during the first 6 min. The degree of stimulation and rate of activation were dependent on the concentration of the fatty acid effector; when initial velocities (6 min) were assessed half-maximal stimulation was achieved in the range of 2 to 3 micrometer. However, by extending the incubation time to 90 min similar maximal increases in specific activity could be achieved with 3 or 10 micrometer PGG2 or PGH2. Activation of guanylate cyclase upon addition of prostaglandin endoperoxides or fatty acid hydroperoxides was prevented or reversed by the thiol reductants dithiothreitol (3 to 5 mM) or glutathione (10 to 15 mM). Na2S2O4, not known as an effective reducing agent of disulfides, prevented but was relatively ineffective in reversing activation after it had been induced by PGG2. Pretreatment of the enzyme preparation with increasing concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide in the range of 0.01 to 1.0 mM prevented activation by PGG2 without affecting basal guanylate cyclase activity. These observations indicate that fatty acid hydroperoxides and prostaglandin endoperoxides promote activation of the cyclase by oxidation of enzyme-related thiol functions. In contrast PGE2, PGF2a, hydroxy fatty acids (13-OH-18:2, 12-OH-20:4) as well as saturated (18:0) monoenoic (18:1), dienoic (18:2), and tetraenoic (20:4) fatty acids were ineffective in promoting cyclase activation in the range of 1 to 10 micrometer. Studies to identify the species of the rapidly metabolized prostaglandin endoperoxides that serve as effectors of the cyclase indicated that PGG2 but not 15-OOH-PGE2 (the major buffer-rearrangement product of PGG2) is most likely an activator. In the case of PGH2, a rapidly generated (30 s) metabolite of PGH2 was found which contained a hydroperoxy or endoperoxy functional group and was equally as effective as PGH2 as an apparent activator of the enzyme. The combined effects of PGG2 and dehydroascorbic acid, another class of activator, exhibited additivity with respect to the rate at which the time-dependent activation was induced. These results suggest that activation of soluble guanylate cyclase from splenic cells can be achieved by the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups that may be associated with specific hydrophobic sites of the enzyme or a related regulatory component."

https://openalex.org/W2084508907,"Environmental lighting regulates numerous circadian rhythms, including the cycle in pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity. Brief exposure of rats to light can shift the phase of this enzyme's circadian rhythm. Light also rapidly reduces nocturnal enzyme activity. Intraventricular injections of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, can mimic both of these effects. Light and carbachol presumably act on the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using a neuropharmacologic approach to the mechanisms underlying mammalian circadian rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2082388241,"Linear simian virus 40 (SV40) chromosomes were prepared by Eco R1 nuclease cleavage of the circular SV40 chromosomes released from virions with dithiothreitol at pH 9,8. Chromatin-DNA hybrids were constructed with segments of 3H-labeled, naked SV40 DNA covalently joined via the Eco R1-generated cohesive ends to segments of linear SV40 chromosome. Upon incubation of chromatin-DNA hybrids at 37 degrees C and moderate ionic strength, histones migrated onto the labeled DNA while retaining the nucleosome structure. This was shown first, by the pattern of micrococcal nuclease digestion of labeled DNA; second by nitrocellulose filter binding of labeled DNA after redigestion of the chromatin-DNA hybrids with Eco R1; and third, by examination of chromatin-DNA hybrids in the electron microscope. Migration was slow, being apparent after several hours. Parallel experiments in which naked DNA and chromosomes were mixed without joining showed no transfer of nucleosomal histones between DNA molecules. The kinetics of Eco R1 cleavage of the DNA in virion-derived SV40 chromosomes are also consistent with the notion that nucleosomal histones, in the absence of other proteins, can move on DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1497834055,"The soluble form of guanylate cyclase from rat lung has been purified approximately 23,000-fold to homogeneity by isoelectric precipitation, GTP-Sepharose chromatography, and preparative gel electrophoresis. A single protein-staining band is observed after analytical gel electrophoresis on either 4 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The final purified enzyme has a specific activity of about 700 nmol of cyclic GMP formed/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees C in the presence of 4.8 mM MnCl2 and 100 micrometer GTP. Bovine serum albumin appears to slightly increase guanylate cyclase activity, but mainly stabilizes the purified enzyme; in its presence, specific activities in excess of 1 mumol of cyclic GMP formed/min/mg of enzyme protein can be obtained. When Mg2+ or Ca2+ are substituted for Mn2+, specific activities decrease to approximately 21 and 40 nmol of cyclic GMP formed/min/mg of protein, respectively. The apparent Michaelis constant for MnGTP in the presence of 4.8 mM MnCl2 is 10.2 micrometer. Kinetic patterns on double reciprocal plots as a function of free Mn2+ are concave downward. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 151,000 as determined on Sephacryl S-200; sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results in two protein-staining bands with approximate molecular weights of 79,400 and 74,000. Thus, it appears that the soluble form of guanylate cyclase from rat lung exists as a dimer."

https://openalex.org/W1546726961,"A hormonally induced change in the covalent phosphorylation state of several enzymes is generally regarded as an important mechanism for hormonal modulation of enzyme activity. We have previously demonstrated that epinephrine stimulates the phosphorylation of a peptide of Mr = 220,000 in adipocytes. Incubation of 32P-labeled cytosolic proteins from adipocytes and hepatocytes with antisera raised against homogeneous chicken and rat liver acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase results in the specific and complete precipitation of the same phosphopeptide. No other major phosphopeptide is specifically precipitated. In hepatocytes, glucagon stimulates the incorporation of 32P into this peptide associated with an inhibition of enzyme activity. These data, coupled with previous studies in adipocytes, suggest that cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation plays a major role in the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and of fatty acid biosynthesis in adipose tissue and liver."

https://openalex.org/W1514927876,"The [14C]methylamine distribution method was utilized to measure the internal pH of isolated serotonin containing granules of pig blood platelets under varying conditions. The granules used were isolated by a new protocol which stressed platelet rupture under controlled conditions and preservation of isotonicity throughout the isolation procedure, In a well buffered external medium, pH 6.85, The deltapH was measured as 1.11 with the internal pH being found acidic (pH 5.74). Increasing the external pH produced a corresponding increase in the deltaH. The pH gradient could be collapsed by the addition of ionophores and uncouplers which are known to transport protons across biological membranes. In addition, the deltapH was constant for granules suspended in various ionic media, thus suggesting that the deltaH did not arise secondarily due to the establishment of a Donnan equilibrium. The existence of the acidic intragranular space is discussed with respect to previous ancillary findings. Also, an explication of the possible physiological significance of the deltaH is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2005278246,"A single injection of methylazoxymethanol in pregnant rats at 15 days of gestation results in severe cortical atrophy in the offspring. In the adult offspring, the neurochemical markers for the cortical γ-aminobutyric acid-containing neurons are severely reduced, whereas the noradrenergic markers are minimally altered. Immunohistofluorescence microscopy demonstrates a marked increase in the density of noradrenergic axons which have an abnormal pattern of distribution in the atrophic cortex. The results suggest that the central noradrenergic neurons determine the number of axons to be formed early in brain development, but local factors in the terminal field regulate the ultimate distribution of the noradrenergic axons."
https://openalex.org/W1577868231,"The O2 binding properties of sulfhemoglobin were studied. The oxygen tension required for half-saturation of sulfhemoglobin is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that for hemoglobin A. The binding of O2 exhibits an alkaline Bohr effect larger than that observed for hemoglobin, yet the Hill number is unity. From the Bohr titration curve, 0.68 proton is released during O2 binding at 0 degrees C. Sulfhemoglobin prepared from carboxypeptidase A-treated hemoglobin has an affinity for O2 which is about the same as that of sulfhemoglobin at the theoretical limit of the Bohr titration curve. Like its carboxypeptidase A-treated hemoglobin precursor, this sulfhemoglobin does not bind O2 cooperatively. Thus, sulfhemoglobin appears to be in a high affinity form at alkaline pH and a low affinity form at acid pH, similar to hemoglobin A. These results demonstrate that the magnitude of the Hill number is not always an indicator of the interaction between oxygen binding and other functions in a hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2010952628,"Hybridization of cells of defined and different histotypes has been carried out to investigate whether the expression (or reexpression) of parental functions is mutually exclusive, as is expected if the generally assumed rule of discreteness of differentiation applies to hybrid cells. A cross of pigmented mouse melanoma cells and albumin-producing rat hepatoma cells gave rise to hybrids containing essentially one set of chromosomes from each parent and producing neither melanin nor albumin. Cells of one hybrid clone are shown to retain the potential to reexpress both parental differentiations. Successive subclonings of this hybrid have shown that cells which reexpress one function may retain the potential to reexpress the other, and that freshly isolated, morphologically homogeneous subclones may produce pigment or albumin, but not both; there successive and exclusive shifts of phenotype are documented, and in these cases, chromosome loss is very slight. The use of immunoadsorbed antisera has revealed that most (if not all) of the albumin produced by the hybrid cells is of the mouse type. We conclude that both parental determinations are retained by the hybrid cells, and that the parental differentiations are reexpressed only in a mutually exclusive fashion."

https://openalex.org/W1528612862,"The effects of citrate and cyclic AMP on the rate and degree of phosphorylation and inactivation of rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase were examined. High citrate concentrations (10 to 20 mM), which are generally used to stabilize and activate the enzyme, inhibit phosphorylation and inactivation of carboxylase. At lower concentrations of citrate, the rate and degree of phosphorylation are increased. Furthermore, phosphorylation and enzyme inactivation are affected by cyclic AMP under these conditions. At high citrate concentrations, cyclic AMP has little or no effect on inactivation and phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Phosphorlation and inactivation of carboxylase is accompanied by depolymerization of the polymeric form of the enzyme into intermediate and protomeric forms. Depolymerization of carboxylase requires the transfer of the gamma-phosphate group from ATP to carboxylase. Inactivation occurs in the absence of CO2, which indicates that phosphorylation of the enzyme is the cause of inactivation and depolymerization, i.e. carboxylation of the enzyme is not responsible for inactivation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1605269345,"Mutants of Bacillus megaterium displaying malate-driven ATP synthesis resistant to uncouplers of oxidative posphorylation are further characterized. Both the pH gradient and electrical potential generated across the membrane by malate respiration are equally sensitive to uncouplers in the wild type and uncoupler-resistant mutants. The mutants possess 0 to 10% of the wild type ATPase activity which is not activated by pretreatment with heat or trypsin. Despite this inability to measure ATPase activity, the mutants demonstrate acid-pulse-driven ATPase synthesis which is sensitive to uncouplers as well as malate-driven ATP synthesis which becomes uncoupler sensitive at pH 5.5. N,N' -Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and valinomycin plus potassium inhibition of ATP synthesis is reversed by uncouplers in the mutants but not in the wild type. The data support the existence of a specific site on the ATPase complex for uncoupler binding which, if altered by mutation, affects uncoupler binding to the complex. The retention of malate-driven ATP synthesis in the absence of a significant pH gradient or electrical potential suggests that an alternative intermediate is involved in coupling oxidation to phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1676928769,"The cytochromes c are a family of hemoproteins that share a number of structural features: a thioether linkage between the protein and the heme, histidine and methionine as the fifth and sixth iron ligands, and a tertiary structure known as the cytochrome fold. These proteins follow a common mechanism of equilibrium unfolding in methanol and acid, differing only in their reactivity to the denaturing conditions. The reduced cytochromes c exhibit an increased conformational stability which is consistent with the presence of a strengthened iron-methionine linkage in the reduced state."

https://openalex.org/W1572803162,"Exposure of rat sympathetic ganglia to 3 microgram/ml of 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF) resulted in a 100% increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity within 48 h. Pulselabeling of proteins with [3H]leucine, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to tyrosine hydorxylase and isolation of the precipitated enzyme by gel electrophoresis, demonstrated that the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity was due to enhanced de novo synthesis. The incorporation of [3H]leucine into tyrosine hydroxylase was increased by 150% compared to a 17% increase in total protein synthesis, which was not statistically significant. The fact that the half-life of pulse-labeled tyrosine hydroxylase was the same for NGF-treated and control organ cultures of superior cervical ganglia excludes the possibility that enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase labeling by NGF is due to decreased degradation. We conclude that, without modulatory factors which play a role in vivo, NGF can enhance the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase in sympathetic ganglia in vitro, provided organ culture conditions which permit optimal survival of adrenergic neurons are selected."

The increase in firing rate occurs in single units of the frog auditory nerve after perilymph obtained from frogs or guinea pigs during sound stimulation is infused into the frog perilymphatic sac. Perilymph collected from animals maintained in silence failed to cause an increase in firing rate of primary auditory fibers of the frog.

The rate and extent of degeneration is correlated with the distribution of the primary auditory fibers. This evidence supports the hypothesis that glutamate is the neurotransmitter for primary auditory fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1553203190,"If acetyl-CoA carboxylase in epididymal fat tissue is subject to control by convalent modification as in the case of the liver enzyme, catalytically different forms of carboxylase should exist, independent of polymerization. By treating epididymal fat tissue in culture with epinephrine, we have demonstrated catalytically less active forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The catalytically less active forms of the enzyme reacted to antibody with the same efficiency as the active form of carboxylase. However, the less active enzyme formed by epinephrine treatment of tissues has a sedimentation constant of 30 to 35 S, whereas that of the enzyme from control tissue is 45 S. Incubation of the less active forms of the carboxylase with 10 mM citrate and up to 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin activated the enzyme without any change in the sedimentation constant. Therefore, the less active forms of the carboxylase formed as a result of epinephrine treatment are not due to the depolymerization of polymeric forms (45 S) to the protomeric forms (17 to 20 S), but to the formation of intermediate species of carboxylase which cannot form polymeric enzyme (45 S) in the presence of high concentrations of citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1532136439,The purified alpha-thiophosphate diastereoisomers of adenosine 5'-(1-thio)-triphosphate were used to study the stereochemical course of the reaction catalyzed by yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase. Asymmetrically labeled adenosine 5'-thiophosphate was formed from the B diastereoisomer of adenosine 5'-(1-thio)-triphosphate and [18O]acetate. The label was found to be in the opposite orientation from the leaving pyrophosphate group showing that the acetate activation step occurred with inversion of configuration at the alpha-phosphorus.
https://openalex.org/W1519018671,"The coelomic cells of the polychaete annelid Glycera dibranchiata contain two hemoglobins. The monomer hemoglobin fraction is composed of one major component and two minor components as determined by starch gel electrophoresis and isoelectrofocusing, but is homogeneous as to subunit size as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The polymer hemoglobin fraction has and initial molecular weight of Mn = 125,000 as determined by osmometry, but exhibits an increased state of aggregation upon storage. The quaternary structure of the polymer is constituted of monomeric subunits in a non-covalent state of aggregation as demonstrated by its subunit dissociation inthe presence of propyl urea. The oxygen affinity of the polymer is lower than the monomer but increases with deaggregation. The Bohr effect is present only in the polymer. Cooperativity is also characteristic of the polymer and is pH-dependent. Interestingly, cooperativity increases with intermediate states of polymer deaggregation. By far, the main organic phosphate component of the coelomic red cells is ATP accompanied by small amounts of ADP and GTP. No modulating effect of ATP on the oxygen equilibrium of either polymer or total hemolysate was found."
https://openalex.org/W1598765495,"The stereospecificity of the chicken heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase as well as the ability of this enzyme to form various abortive complexes has been further investigated. The enzyme was found to be specific for the A-hydrogen of NADH. Complex formation of the enzyme with oxalacetate and oxidized coenzymes is pH-dependent and is promoted at alkaline pH values. The enol form of oxalacetate appears to be the species that participates in the formation of the complexes. The binding of L-malate, D-malate, or hydroxymalonate to the enzyme. NADH complex is also pH-dependent, and involves a group on the enzyme with a pK of 7.5. The binding of L-malate is promoted at alkaline pH values, whereas the binding of D-malate and hydroxymalonate is favored at acidic pH values. These results indicate that L-malate and enol-oxalacetate preferentially or exclusively bind to the nonprotonated form of the enzyme, whereas keto-oxalactate, hydroxymalonate, and D-malate only bind to the protonated form of the enzyme. Based on this conclusion, a detailed chemical mechanism for the malate dehydrogenase reaction has been postulated and a schematic illustration of the transition state of the enzyme is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1680955141,"The effect of pH on the properties of the partial reactions of arginyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli has been investigated. V max of pyrophosphorolysis of arginyl adenylate has a pH optimum at pH 6.1, whereas V max of the transfer of arginine to tRNA has a pH optimum of 8.2. These values correlate with the pH optima of the ATP:PPi exchange and the overall esterification reaction, respectively. Only the pyrophosphorolysis reaction requires a divalent cation; transfer proceeds in the presence of EDTA. Inorganic pyrophosphate inhibits the transfer reaction to an extent independent of the concentration of tRNA; the maximum inhibition is a function of pH, corresponding to the relative rate of pyrophosphorolysis of the common intermediate compared with the rate of transfer. These results show that different groups on the enzyme participate in the rate-limiting steps of the two partial reactions and that these partial reactions have properties consistent with their participation in the overall esterification of arginine with tRNA."

The procedures indicate that the dimeric enzyme has a definite preference for NADH, but binds only 1 mol of this nucleotide per mol of enzyme. The binary complex of enzyme with NADH is only partially stable to exhaustive dialysis and gel electrophoresis, where it shows greater mobility (0.26) than the free enzyme (0.21); however, the complex can be isolated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and characterized with respect to its absorbance spectrum. No ternary complexes are observed when samples of reductase, preincubated with excess NADH, and either the reaction product, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine, or the inhibitor, methotrexate, are subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

A complete loss in Mg2+-supported activity is associated with the incorporation of 3 eq of pyridoxal-P/subunit of the dodecamer. At this extent of modification, however, the pyridoxylated enzyme exhibits substantial Mn2+-supported activity (with increased Km values for ATP and ADP). The sites of pyridoxylation appear to have equal affinities for pyridoxal-P and to be at the enzyme surface, freely accessible to solvent. At least one of the three covalently bound pyridoxamine 5‘-phosphate groups is near the subunit catalytic site and acts as a spectral probe for the interactions of the manganese.enzyme with substrates. A spectral perturbation of covalently attached pyridoxamine-P groups is caused also by specific divalent cations (Mn2+, Mg2+ or Ca2+) binding at the subunit catalytic site (but not while binding to the subunit high affinity, activating Me2+ site). In addition, the feedback inhibitors, AMP, CTP, L-tryptophan, L-alanine, and carbamyl phosphate, perturb protein-bound pyridoxamine-P groups. The spectral perturbations produced by substrate and inhibitor binding are pH-dependent and different in magnitude and maximum wavelength. Adenylylation sites are not major sites of pyridoxylation."

https://openalex.org/W1519987361,"The sensitivity of the oxygen affinity of a hemoglobin to 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid concentration has been defined as the change in log1/2O2 (deltalogp1/2O2) which results from saturating the hemoglobin with 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. The sensitivity varies from one hemoglobin species to another and is linearly rated to the difference in the logarithm of the binding constants of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid to deoxy- and oxyhemoglobin, the characteristic pH (pHch), and inversely proportional to the magnitude of the alkaline Bohr effect measured in a saturating amount of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. Its magnitude is higher in large animals than in small animals and varies linearly with the charged amino acid composition of the hemoglobin. The charged amino acid residues must have been selected for in mammals with high metabolic needs and against in animals with low metabolic needs. Variability in the effect of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid on the oxygen transport in the different animal hemoglobins must therefore be the result of a positive Darwinian Selection of the charged amino acid residues in their hemoglobins. Furthermore, all the charged groups and not those at the binding site alone, affect the 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid binding constant of a hemoglobin."
