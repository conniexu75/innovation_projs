https://openalex.org/W2033616816,"If extraterrestrial intelligent beings exist and have reached a high level of technical development, one by-product of their energy metabolism is likely to be the large-scale conversion of starlight into far-infrared radiation. It is proposed that a search for sources of infrared radiation should accompany the recently initiated search for interstellar radio communications."
https://openalex.org/W2091375543,"Staminate flowers induced on gynoecious plants permitted the establishment and increase of inbred lines bearing only pistillate flowers. This method of altering sex expression has practical applications in developing F1 hybrids, and is useful in studying the physiology and genetics of sex expression."
https://openalex.org/W2086936057,"The existence of a continuous, rifted, mid-oceanic ridge in the southwestern Indian Ocean, previously predicted by us, has been confirmed by soundings taken by the research vessel Vema during the expedition now in progress."

https://openalex.org/W2074464238,"The rapid horizontal dispersal of sodium-24 at an average rate of about 18 m/day has been observed near the bottom of a small thermally and chemically stratified lake. However, no appreciable vertical movement of the radioactivity was observed during a period of 6 days."
https://openalex.org/W2002211664,"By means of reaction with calcium hydride in a generator of simple design, the water samples are converted into H2 and HD. With hydrogen as carrier gas, the greater thermal conductivity of HD produces a peak whose size is linearly related to the deuterium content of the original water."

https://openalex.org/W2004157866,"AT a meeting of the council of the International Association of Chemical Societies in Brussels, last September, a committee on inorganic nomenclature, among other recommendations, endorsed the name and symbol “niobium” and “Nb”, for the element which was originally named columbium. As this recommendation is historically erroneous, a brief statement of the facts appears to be desirable."
https://openalex.org/W1975863576,"The minimum possible density of the lunar atmosphere at the surface is shown to be essentially the value for the interplanetary medium. This value, when combined with the observed maximum, places the particle density between 10(3) and 10(6) per cubic centimeter, while the electron density must be about 10(3) to 10(4) per cubic centimeter. These results are markedly different from those recently obtained by Firsoff."

https://openalex.org/W1975547386,"I have attempted to confine this article to an analytic description of the operations of the commission's personnel security program. This program has been analyzed critically and in detail by a number of individuals. I have not attempted to take issue with criticism, for this is not the purpose of a descriptive analysis. I have mentioned those limitations inherent in our program which do not entirely coincide with the traditional methods of due process. These limitations are significant, but, if they are properly exercised in the context of the commission's program, I feel that they are justified."
