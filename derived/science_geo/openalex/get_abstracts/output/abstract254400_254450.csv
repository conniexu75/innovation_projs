https://openalex.org/W2048456744,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a key link between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Here, we provide evidence that this mechanistic link can be exploited for therapeutic purposes with orally active chemical chaperones. 4-Phenyl butyric acid and taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid alleviated ER stress in cells and whole animals. Treatment of obese and diabetic mice with these compounds resulted in normalization of hyperglycemia, restoration of systemic insulin sensitivity, resolution of fatty liver disease, and enhancement of insulin action in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. Our results demonstrate that chemical chaperones enhance the adaptive capacity of the ER and act as potent antidiabetic modalities with potential application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2095484045,"Years of intensive investigation have yielded a sophisticated understanding of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced in hippocampal area CA1 by high-frequency stimulation (HFS). These efforts have been motivated by the belief that similar synaptic modifications occur during memory formation, but it has never been shown that learning actually induces LTP in CA1. We found that one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning in rats produced the same changes in hippocampal glutamate receptors as induction of LTP with HFS and caused a spatially restricted increase in the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission in CA1 in vivo. Because the learning-induced synaptic potentiation occluded HFS-induced LTP, we conclude that inhibitory avoidance training induces LTP in CA1."
https://openalex.org/W2054580701,"We report on a large electric-field response of quasi–two-dimensional electron gases generated at interfaces in epitaxial heterostructures grown from insulating oxides. These device structures are characterized by doping layers that are spatially separated from high-mobility quasi–two-dimensional electron gases and therefore present an oxide analog to semiconducting high–electron mobility transistors. By applying a gate voltage, the conductivity of the electron gases can be modulated through a quantum phase transition from an insulating to a metallic state."

Microbial colonization of germ-free mice triggers epithelial expression of RegIIIγ, a secreted C-type lectin. RegIIIγ binds intestinal bacteria but lacks the complement recruitment domains present in other microbe-binding mammalian C-type lectins. We show that RegIIIγ and its human counterpart, HIP/PAP, are directly antimicrobial proteins that bind their bacterial targets via interactions with peptidoglycan carbohydrate. We propose that these proteins represent an evolutionarily primitive form of lectin-mediated innate immunity, and that they reveal intestinal strategies for maintaining symbiotic host-microbial relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2079148569,"We report electrical properties of hybrid structures consisting of arrays of nanowire field-effect transistors integrated with the individual axons and dendrites of live mammalian neurons, where each nanoscale junction can be used for spatially resolved, highly sensitive detection, stimulation, and/or inhibition of neuronal signal propagation. Arrays of nanowire-neuron junctions enable simultaneous measurement of the rate, amplitude, and shape of signals propagating along individual axons and dendrites. The configuration of nanowire-axon junctions in arrays, as both inputs and outputs, makes possible controlled studies of partial to complete inhibition of signal propagation by both local electrical and chemical stimuli. In addition, nanowire-axon junction arrays were integrated and tested at a level of at least 50 ""artificial synapses"" per neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2011567013,"Analogous to learning and memory storage, long-term potentiation (LTP) is divided into induction and maintenance phases. Testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of LTP maintenance stores information requires reversing this mechanism in vivo and finding out whether long-term stored information is lost. This was not previously possible. Recently however, persistent phosphorylation by the atypical protein kinase C isoform, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMz), has been found to maintain late LTP in hippocampal slices. Here we show that a cell-permeable PKMz inhibitor, injected in the rat hippocampus, both reverses LTP maintenance in vivo and produces persistent loss of 1-day-old spatial information. Thus, the mechanism maintaining LTP sustains spatial memory."
https://openalex.org/W2009487870,"The coreceptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is pivotal in regulating the threshold of signals during T cell activation, although the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Using in vitro migration assays and in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy, we showed that CTLA-4 increases T cell motility and overrides the T cell receptor (TCR)–induced stop signal required for stable conjugate formation between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. This event led to reduced contact periods between T cells and antigen-presenting cells that in turn decreased cytokine production and proliferation. These results suggest a fundamentally different model of reverse stop signaling, by which CTLA-4 modulates the threshold for T cell activation and protects against autoimmunity."

https://openalex.org/W2003270447,"Manifold changes in the freshwater cycle of high-latitude lands and oceans have been reported in the past few years. A synthesis of these changes in freshwater sources and in ocean freshwater storage illustrates the complementary and synoptic temporal pattern and magnitude of these changes over the past 50 years. Increasing river discharge anomalies and excess net precipitation on the ocean contributed ∼20,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water to the Arctic and high-latitude North Atlantic oceans from lows in the 1960s to highs in the 1990s. Sea ice attrition provided another ∼15,000 cubic kilometers, and glacial melt added ∼2000 cubic kilometers. The sum of anomalous inputs from these freshwater sources matched the amount and rate at which fresh water accumulated in the North Atlantic during much of the period from 1965 through 1995. The changes in freshwater inputs and ocean storage occurred in conjunction with the amplifying North Atlantic Oscillation and rising air temperatures. Fresh water may now be accumulating in the Arctic Ocean and will likely be exported southward if and when the North Atlantic Oscillation enters into a new high phase."
https://openalex.org/W2017414380,"Insulin and contraction are potent stimulators of GLUT4 translocation and increase skeletal muscle glucose uptake. We recently identified the Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) AS160 as a putative point of convergence linking distinct upstream signaling cascades induced by insulin and contraction in mouse skeletal muscle. Here, we studied the functional implications of these AS160 signaling events by using an in vivo electroporation technique to overexpress wild type and three AS160 mutants in mouse tibialis anterior muscles: 1) AS160 mutated to prevent phosphorylation on four regulatory phospho-Akt-substrate sites (4P); 2) AS160 mutated to abolish Rab GTPase activity (R/K); and 3) double mutant AS160 containing both 4P and R/K mutations (2M). One week following gene injection, protein expression for all AS160 isoforms was elevated over 7-fold. To determine the effects of AS160 on insulin- and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in transfected muscles, we measured [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake in vivo following intravenous glucose administration and in situ muscle contraction, respectively. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly inhibited in muscles overexpressing 4P mutant AS160. However, this inhibition was completely prevented by concomitant disruption of AS160 Rab GAP activity. Transfection with 4P mutant AS160 also significantly impaired contraction-stimulated glucose uptake, as did overexpression of wild type AS160. In contrast, overexpressing mutant AS160 lacking Rab GAP activity resulted in increases in both sham and contraction-stimulated muscles. These data suggest that AS160 regulates both insulin- and contraction-stimulated glucose metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle in vivo and that the effects of mutant AS160 on the actions of insulin and contraction are not identical. Our findings directly implicate AS160 as a critical convergence factor for independent stimulators of skeletal muscle glucose uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1971279688,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) guides dimethylation of histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9me2) via the Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complexes, as well as base-pairing with either RNA or DNA. We show that Argonaute requires the conserved aspartate-aspartate-histidine motif for heterochromatic silencing and for ribonuclease H–like cleavage (slicing) of target messages complementary to siRNA. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , heterochromatic repeats are transcribed by polymerase II. We show that H3K9me2 spreads into silent reporter genes when they are embedded within these transcripts and that spreading requires read-through transcription, as well as slicing by Argonaute. Thus, siRNA guides histone modification by basepairing interactions with RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2041468806,"The cellular mechanisms underlying organ formation are largely unknown. We visualized early vertebrate eye morphogenesis at single-cell resolution by in vivo imaging in medaka ( Oryzias latipes ). Before optic vesicle evagination, retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) modulate their convergence in a fate-specific manner. Presumptive forebrain cells converge toward the midline, whereas medial RPCs remain stationary, predetermining the site of evagination. Subsequent optic vesicle evagination is driven by the active migration of individual RPCs. The analysis of mutants demonstrated that the retina-specific transcription factor rx3 determines the convergence and migration behaviors of RPCs. Hence, the migration of individual cells mediates essential steps of organ morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2053366241,"Food web recovery from mass extinction is poorly understood. We analyzed insect-feeding damage on 14,999 angiosperm leaves from 14 latest Cretaceous, Paleocene, and early Eocene sites in the western interior United States. Most Paleocene floras have low richness of plants and of insect damage. However, a low-diversity 64.4-million-year-old flora from southeastern Montana shows extremely high insect damage richness, especially of leaf mining, whereas an anomalously diverse 63.8-million-year-old flora from the Denver Basin shows little damage and virtually no specialized feeding. These findings reveal severely unbalanced food webs 1 to 2 million years after the end-Cretaceous extinction 65.5 million years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2153690671,"Inflammation plays an essential role in vascular injury and repair. Mononuclear phagocytes are important contributors in these processes, in part, via adhesive interactions and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 suppresses such responses via deactivation of monocytes/macrophages and repression of inflammatory cytokine expression. The mechanisms of IL-10's suppressive action are, however, incompletely characterized. Here, we report that systemic IL-10 treatment after carotid artery denudation in mice blunts inflammatory cell infiltration and arterial tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression. At the molecular level, in a human monocytic cell line, U937 IL-10 suppressed LPS-induced mRNA expression of a number of inflammatory cytokines, mainly via posttranscriptional mRNA destabilization. Detailed studies on IL-10 regulation of TNF-alpha mRNA expression identified AU-rich elements (ARE) in the 3' untranslated region as a necessary determinant of IL-10-mediated TNF-alpha mRNA destabilization. IL-10 sensitivity to TNF depends on the ability of IL-10 to inhibit the expression and mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR and via IL-10 mediated repression of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Because IL-10 function and signaling are important components for control of inflammatory responses, these results may provide insights necessary to develop strategies for modulating vascular repair and other accelerated arteriopathies, including transplant vasculopathy and vein graft hyperplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2085714333,"The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase is a critical component of a DNA-damage response network configured to maintain genomic integrity. The abundance of an essential downstream effecter of this pathway, the tumor suppressor protein p53, is tightly regulated by controlled degradation through COP1 and other E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as MDM2 and Pirh2; however, the signal transduction pathway that regulates the COP1-p53 axis following DNA damage remains enigmatic. We observed that in response to DNA damage, ATM phosphorylated COP1 on Ser 387 and stimulated a rapid autodegradation mechanism. Ionizing radiation triggered an ATM-dependent movement of COP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of COP1 on Ser 387 was both necessary and sufficient to disrupt the COP1-p53 complex and subsequently to abrogate the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Furthermore, phosphorylation of COP1 on Ser 387 was required to permit p53 to become stabilized and to exert its tumor suppressor properties in response to DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2011397887,"Mutations in the X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene have been identified in patients with Rett syndrome, West syndrome, and X-linked infantile spasms sharing the common features of generally intractable early seizures and mental retardation. Disease-causing mutations are distributed in both the catalytic domain and in the large COOH terminus. In this report, we examine the functional consequences of some Rett mutations of CDKL5 together with some synthetically designed derivatives useful to underline the functional domains of the protein. The mutated CDKL5 derivatives have been subjected to in vitro kinase assays and analyzed for phosphorylation of the TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) motif within the activation loop, their subcellular localization, and the capacity of CDKL5 to interact with itself. Whereas wild-type CDKL5 autophosphorylates and mediates the phosphorylation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in vitro, Rett-mutated proteins show both impaired and increased catalytic activity suggesting that a tight regulation of CDKL5 is required for correct brain functions. Furthermore, we show that CDKL5 can self-associate and mediate the phosphorylation of its own TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) motif. Eventually, we show that the COOH terminus regulates CDKL5 properties; in particular, it negatively influences the catalytic activity and is required for its proper sub-nuclear localization. We propose a model in which CDKL5 phosphorylation is required for its entrance into the nucleus whereas a portion of the COOH-terminal domain is responsible for a stable residency in this cellular compartment probably through protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2156046858,"Cells without Bak and Bax are largely resistant to apoptosis, despite the presence of other key components of the apoptotic machinery. We screened 7,800 natural compounds and found several that could specifically induce caspase activation and the release of cytochrome c (cyto c) in the bak(-/-)/bax(-/-) cells. One of these was gossypol, a polyphenolic compound naturally found in cottonseed that has been used in antifertility trials. We found that gossypol, but not other Bcl-2-interacting molecules, induced cyto c release and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) independently of mPTP and Bak/Bax activation. Furthermore, we found that gossypol induced an allosteric change in Bcl-2 in both bak(-/-)/bax(-/-) cells and Bcl-2 overexpressing cells. This change in Bcl-2 conformation led to the release of cyto c in the presence of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in reconstituted proteoliposomes. We also observed that gossypol substantially reduced the growth of tumor xenografts from Bcl-2 overexpressing cells in nude mice. We conclude that gossypol converts the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 into a proapoptotic molecule that can mediate the release of cyto c and induce apoptosis."

High-precision oxygen isotope analyses for the two major groups of stony-iron meteorites (main-group pallasites and mesosiderites) demonstrate that each group is from a distinct asteroidal source. Mesosiderites are isotopically identical to the howardite-eucrite-diogenite clan and, like them, are probably derived from the asteroid 4 Vesta. Main-group pallasites represent intermixed core-mantle material from a single disrupted asteroid and have no known equivalents among the basaltic meteorites. The stony-iron meteorites demonstrate that intense asteroidal deformation accompanied planetary accretion in the early Solar System."

https://openalex.org/W2044159019,"We report atmospheric methane carbon isotope ratios (delta13CH4) from the Western Greenland ice margin spanning the Younger Dryas-to-Preboreal (YD-PB) transition. Over the recorded approximately 800 years, delta13CH4 was around -46 per mil (per thousand); that is, approximately 1 per thousand higher than in the modern atmosphere and approximately 5.5 per thousand higher than would be expected from budgets without 13C-rich anthropogenic emissions. This requires higher natural 13C-rich emissions or stronger sink fractionation than conventionally assumed. Constant delta13CH4 during the rise in methane concentration at the YD-PB transition is consistent with additional emissions from tropical wetlands, or aerobic plant CH4 production, or with a multisource scenario. A marine clathrate source is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2014297344,"Sitosterolemia is a disease characterized by very high levels of sitosterol and other plant sterols and premature atherothrombotic vascular disease. One theory holds that plant sterols can directly promote atherosclerosis, but the mechanism is not known. Unesterified, or “free,” cholesterol (FC) is a potent inducer of macrophage death, which causes plaque necrosis, a precursor to atherothrombosis. FC-induced macrophage death, however, requires dysfunction of the sterol esterifying enzyme acyl-coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which likely occurs slowly during lesion progression. In contrast, plant sterols are relatively poorly esterified by ACAT, and so they may cause macrophage death and plaque necrosis in an accelerated manner. In support of this hypothesis, we show here that macrophages incubated with sitosterol-containing lipoproteins accumulate free sterols and undergo death in the absence of an ACAT inhibitor. As with FC loading, sitosterol-induced macrophage death requires sterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum, and sitosterol-enriched endoplasmic reticulum membranes show evidence of membrane protein dysfunction. However, whereas FC induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of the unfolded protein response and JNK, sitosterol-induced death is caspase-independent and involves neither the unfolded protein response nor JNK. Rather, cell death shows signs of necroptosis and autophagy and is suppressed by inhibitors of both processes. These data establish two new concepts. First, a relatively subtle change in sterol structure fundamentally alters the type of death program triggered in macrophages. Understanding the basis of this alteration should provide new insights into the molecular basis of death pathway signaling. Second, sitosterol-induced macrophage death does not require ACAT dysfunction and so may occur in an accelerated fashion.

Although the mechanism of FC accumulation is uncertain, we have in vivo evidence that events centered on the ER are involved (37Feng B. Zhang D. Kuriakose G. Devlin C.M. Kockx M. Tabas I. Proc. Natl.

The most likely explanation is that a combination of defective cholesterol esterification by ACAT and defective cholesterol efflux are involved. However, the actual extent of ACAT dysfunction or FC-induced macrophage apoptosis in lesions is not known. If indeed late lesional macrophages acquire a defect in ACAT-mediated esterification, this process would likely occur gradually over a long period of time. However, plant sterols, including sitosterol, are incompletely esterified by macrophage ACAT (ACAT1), which may be due to a partial deficiency in their ability to activate the enzyme (41Field F.J.

Thus, if sitosterol-containing lipoproteins were internalized by macrophages, the accumulation of potentially cytotoxic free sterol might occur much earlier in the course of atherosclerosis progression. This mechanism could provide at least one explanation for the accelerated atherothrombosis in sitosterolemia. To begin to test this concept, we have conducted a study to determine whether lipoprotein-derived sitosterol is cytotoxic in macrophages in the absence of an ACAT inhibitor (“ACAT-competent” macrophages). Our data show that such lipoproteins are robust inducers of cell death in ACAT-competent macrophages and that the mechanism is fundamentally different from that caused by free cholesterol. Whereas FC triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of a pro-apoptotic branch of the ER stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (37Feng B. Zhang D. Kuriakose G.

These findings not only suggest a possible mechanism of plant sterol-induced atherothrombotic disease but also reveal how a subtle change in sterol structure can have a dramatic effect on cell death pathways.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20% l-cell-conditioned medium for 24-48 h to reach confluence. Synthesis of Sitosteryl Oleate—Sitosterol (100 mg, 0.24 mmol) was dissolved in benzene (10 ml). To this solution, oleic anhydride (158 mg, 0.29 mmol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (5 mg, catalytic amount) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight in the dark at room temperature and then washed twice with 5 ml of 1 n HCl and three times with 5 ml of saturated NaHCO3 solution. The organic phase was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. The solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure to provide crude product. Purification of the crude product by silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether/CH2Cl2, 10:1) gave sitosteryl oleate as a sticky oil in 95% yield. The structure of the product was confirmed by NMR. Reconstitution of Acetyl-LDL—Acetyl-LDL was reconstituted with defined neutral lipids as described (52Krieger M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.9 mg of acetyl-LDL and 25 mg of potato starch were frozen and lyophilized in a 15-ml glass tube. The endogenous core lipids were then extracted three times with 5 ml of heptane, and then 6 mg of the indicated steryl oleate (dissolved in 200 μl of heptane) were added to the tube. This mixture was then dried, and the sample was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tricine (pH 8.4). This suspension was incubated for 10-24 h. The solubilized reconstituted lipoprotein was separated from the bulk of the starch and excess lipid by low-speed centrifugation (2,000 × g). The specimen was further clarified by two additional centrifugations at 10,000 × g for 10 min and stored under argon at 4 °C. Aliquots were assayed for protein concentration by the method of Lowry et al. (53Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid Mass Analysis—Cell monolayers were extracted twice with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v), and the lipid extracts were assayed for free and total sterol mass by gas-liquid chromatography as described (54Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5α-Cholestane served as an internal standard to correct for losses during the extraction procedure. The cell monolayers remaining after lipid extraction were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were assayed for protein concentration by the method of Lowry (53Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L.

Briefly, 100 μg of microsomal membranes isolated from wild type or SERCA2b-overexpressing HEK293 cells were incubated with various amounts of sterols in complex with methyl-β-cyclodextrin at 25 °C for 30 min. The microsomes were recovered by centrifugation, and SERCA ATPase activity was measured using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay in which hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH (55Li Y.

The depletion of NADH was then detected by a decrease in absorption at 340 nm using a Spectra Max 190 fluorospectrometer (Molecular Devices) maintained at 30 °C. The assay buffer contained 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.45 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm MOPS/KOH, 0.32 mm NADH, 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with KOH before addition of the enzymes, and the free Ca2+ concentration in the solution was determined to be ∼3 μm. The reaction was started by adding 10 μg of the membranes to 200 μl of the assay buffer in wells of a 96-well UV-visible transparent bottom plate, followed by rapid mixing. The absorption at 340 nm was recorded at 30-s intervals for 30 min using the SOFTmax PRO 3.0 program. Annexin V-Propidium Iodide Staining—Annexin V staining was performed using the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit 2 (Molecular Probes). At the end of incubation, cells were gently washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in 100 μl of annexin-binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 5 μl of Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V, and 1 μl of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were immediately viewed using an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with filters appropriate for fluorescein and rhodamine. For quantification, three fields of cells for each condition (∼1500 cells) were counted. Hoechst Staining—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 3 times, incubated with 100 ng/ml Hoechst 33258 for 30 min at room temperature, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy using a UV filter. TUNEL Assay—Macrophages were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature, and then post-fixed in pre-cooled ethanol/acetic acid (2:1) for 5 min at -20 °C. The cells were then stained using ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon International). In this assay, the incorporated dNTP is modified by digoxigenin, which in turn is recognized by a fluorescein-labeled antibody. A propidium iodide counterstain, which is taken up by fixed cells, was used to stain all of the cells on the dish. The fluorescence microscopy and quantification procedures were similar to that described above for the annexin assay. Apoptosis is defined as those cells that stain with the fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin-dNTP antibody. Mitotracker Red Staining—Macrophages on coverslips were incubated in media containing 300 nm Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by homogenizing the cells into 1× Sample Loading buffer from Bio-Rad. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuclear Extraction kit from Panomics, Inc. Cell extracts were electrophoresed on 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. For caspase-3 and caspase-9 immunoblots, 15 and 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes were used. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with the primary antibody in TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Pierce). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of triplicate experiments unless stated otherwise. Absent error bars in the bar graphs signify S.E. values smaller than the graphic symbols. Incubation of Macrophages with Sitosteryl Ester-containing Lipoproteins Leads to Free Sitosterol Accumulation in the Absence of an ACAT Inhibitor—When lipoprotein-cholesterol is delivered to macrophages, the cholesterol is efficiently esterified by the ER enzyme ACAT, thus preventing FC accumulation and FC-induced macrophage death (20Tabas I.

https://openalex.org/W2106964778,"Viral and bacterial pathogens cause inflammation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. We have shown that effective responses to LPS may depend on cooperative interactions between TLR-expressing leukocytes and TLR-negative tissue cells. The aim of this work was to determine the roles of such networks in response to agonists of TLRs associated with antiviral and autoimmune responses. The TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) activated epithelial cells, primary endothelial cells, and two types of primary human smooth muscle cells (airway [ASMC] and vascular) directly, while the TLR7/8 agonist R848 required the presence of leukocytes to activate ASMC. In keeping with these data, ASMC expressed TLR3 but not TLR7 or TLR8. Activation of ASMC by poly(I:C) induced a specific cytokine repertoire characterized by induction of CXCL10 generation and the potential to recruit mast cells. We subsequently explored the ability of TLR agonists to cooperate in the induction of inflammation. Dual stimulation with LPS and poly(I:C) caused enhanced cytokine generation from epithelial and smooth muscle cells when in the presence of leukocytes. Thus, inflammatory responses to pathogens are regulated by networks in which patterns of TLR expression and colocalization of tissue cells and leukocytes are critical."
https://openalex.org/W2161809622,"The recent therapeutic approach in which drug candidates are designed to possess diverse pharmacological properties and act on multiple targets has stimulated the development of the bifunctional drug ladostigil (TV3326) [(N-propargyl-(3R) aminoindan-5yl)-ethyl methyl carbamate]. Ladostigil combines the neuroprotective effects of the antiparkinson drug rasagiline, a selective monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, with the cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory activity of rivastigmine in a single molecule, as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy Body disease. Here, we assessed the dual effects of lodostigil in terms of the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection and amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulation/processing by using an apoptotic model of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Ladostigil dose-dependently decreased cell death via inhibition of the cleavage and prevention of caspase-3 activation (IC50=1.05 microM) through a mechanism related to regulation of the Bcl-2 family proteins, which resulted in reduced levels of Bad and Bax and induced levels of Bcl-2 gene and protein expression. We have also followed APP regulation/processing and found that ladostigil markedly decreased apoptotic-induced levels of holo-APP protein without altering APP mRNA levels, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism. In addition, the drug-elevated phosphorylated protein kinase C (pPKC) levels and stimulated the release of the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase proteolytic pathway. Similar to ladostigil, its S-isomer, TV3279, which is a ChE inhibitor but lacks MAO inhibitory activity, exerted neuroprotective properties and regulated APP processing, indicating that these effects are independent of MAO inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2143850427,"Two mutations (K141E, K141N) in the small heat shock protein (sHSP) HSP22 (HSPB8) are associated with the inherited peripheral motor neuron disorders distal hereditary motor neuropathy type II and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2L. HSP22 is known to form homodimers, heterodimers with other sHSPs, and larger oligomers. In an effort to elucidate the cellular basis for these diseases, we have determined the ability of mutant HSP22 to interact with itself, with wild-type HSP22, and with other sHSPs that are abundant in neurons. Using the yeast two-hybrid method, quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer in live cells, and cross-linking, we found aberrantly increased interactions of mutant HSP22 forms with themselves, with wild-type HSP22, and with the other sHSPs, alphaB-crystallin, and HSP27. Interaction with HSP20 was not affected by the mutations. The data suggest that each mutant form of HSP22 has a characteristic pattern of abnormal interaction properties. A mutation (S135F) in HSP27 that is also associated with these disorders showed increased interaction with wild-type HSP22 also, suggesting linkage of these two etiologic factors, HSP22 and HSP27, into one common pathway. Increased interactions involving mutant sHSPs may be the molecular basis for their increased tendency to form cytoplasmic protein aggregates, and for the occurrence of the associated neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W2130696834,"Gram-negative sepsis is a major death cause in intensive care units. Accumulating evidence indicates the protective role of plasma lipoproteins such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in sepsis. It has recently been shown that septic HDL is almost depleted from apolipoprotein CI (apoCI), suggesting that apoCI may be a protective factor in sepsis. Sequence analysis revealed that apoCI possesses a highly conserved consensus KVKEKLK binding motif for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer-membrane component of gram-negative bacteria. Through avid binding to LPS involving this motif, apoCI improved the presentation of LPS to macrophages in vitro and in mice, thereby stimulating the inflammatory response to LPS. Moreover, apoCI dose-dependently increased the early inflammatory response to Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced pneumonia, reduced the number of circulating bacteria, and protected mice against fatal sepsis. Our data support the hypothesis that apoCI is a physiological protector against infection by enhancing the early inflammatory response to LPS and suggest that timely increase of apoCI levels could be used to efficiently prevent and treat early sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W2160505865,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family are latent transcription factors involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways, including cell death cascades. STAT1 has been shown to have a crucial role in regulating cardiac cell apoptosis in the myocardium exposed to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The free radical scavenger, tempol, is known to have cardioprotective properties, although little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) by which it acts. In the present study, we assessed the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 and examined whether tempol was able to affect STAT activation after in vivo cardiac I/R injury. We observed a reperfusion time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 at residues 701 and 705, respectively. Here we show for the first time that tempol dramatically reduced STAT1 and 3 phosphorylation. The reduction in STAT1 and 3 phosphorylation was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in cellular malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. To verify the role of STAT1 in modulating the cardioprotective effect of tempol, rats were injected with the STAT1 activator, IFN-gamma, and tempol during I/R injury. We found that the presence of IFN-gamma abrogated the protective effects of tempol, suggesting that the protective effects of tempol may partly operate by decreasing the phosphorylation of STAT1. This study demonstrates that careful dissection of the molecular mechanisms that underpin I/R injury may reveal cardioprotective targets for future therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2067168686,"A novel 2986-base transcript encoded by the antisense strand of the HRES-1 human endogenous retrovirus was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. This transcript codes for a 218-amino acid protein, termed HRES-1/Rab4, based on homology to the Rab4 family of small GTPases. Antibody 13407 raised against recombinant HRES-1/Rab4 detected a native protein of identical molecular weight in human T cells. HRES-1 nucleotides 2151-1606, located upstream of HRES-1/Rab4 exon 1, have promoter activity when oriented in the direction of HRES-1/Rab4 transcription. The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), tat gene stimulates transcriptional activity of the HRES-1/Rab4 promoter via trans-activation of the HRES-1 long terminal repeat. Transfection of HIV-1 tat into HeLa cells or infection of H9 and Jurkat cells by HIV-1 increased HRES-1/Rab4 protein levels. Overexpression of HRES-1/Rab4 in Jurkat cells abrogated HIV infection, gag p24 production, and apoptosis, whereas dominant-negative HRES-1/Rab4S27N had the opposite effects. HRES-1/Rab4 inhibited surface expression of CD4 and targeted it for lysosomal degradation. HRES-1/Rab4S27N enhanced surface expression, recycling, and total cellular CD4 content. Infection by HIV elicited a coordinate down-regulation of CD4 and up-regulation of HRES-1/Rab4 in PBL. Moreover, overexpression of HRES-1/Rab4 reduced CD4 expression on peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. Stimulation by HIV-1 of HRES-1/Rab4 expression and its regulation of CD4 recycling reveal novel coordinate interactions between an infectious retrovirus and the human genome. A novel 2986-base transcript encoded by the antisense strand of the HRES-1 human endogenous retrovirus was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. This transcript codes for a 218-amino acid protein, termed HRES-1/Rab4, based on homology to the Rab4 family of small GTPases. Antibody 13407 raised against recombinant HRES-1/Rab4 detected a native protein of identical molecular weight in human T cells. HRES-1 nucleotides 2151-1606, located upstream of HRES-1/Rab4 exon 1, have promoter activity when oriented in the direction of HRES-1/Rab4 transcription. The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), tat gene stimulates transcriptional activity of the HRES-1/Rab4 promoter via trans-activation of the HRES-1 long terminal repeat. Transfection of HIV-1 tat into HeLa cells or infection of H9 and Jurkat cells by HIV-1 increased HRES-1/Rab4 protein levels. Overexpression of HRES-1/Rab4 in Jurkat cells abrogated HIV infection, gag p24 production, and apoptosis, whereas dominant-negative HRES-1/Rab4S27N had the opposite effects. HRES-1/Rab4 inhibited surface expression of CD4 and targeted it for lysosomal degradation. HRES-1/Rab4S27N enhanced surface expression, recycling, and total cellular CD4 content. Infection by HIV elicited a coordinate down-regulation of CD4 and up-regulation of HRES-1/Rab4 in PBL. Moreover, overexpression of HRES-1/Rab4 reduced CD4 expression on peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. Stimulation by HIV-1 of HRES-1/Rab4 expression and its regulation of CD4 recycling reveal novel coordinate interactions between an infectious retrovirus and the human genome.

Science. 2000; 289: 1152-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Human ERV (HERV) have the basic structures of the integrated proviral form of infectious retroviruses with long terminal repeats (LTRs) flanking sequences homologous to gag, pol, and env genes (2Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retrotransposons, Endogenous Retroviruses, and the Evolution of Retroelements. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar). Human ERV have generally been found to be defective proviruses having accumulated deletions or stop codons in gag, pol, and/or env open reading frames (3Wilkinson D.A. Mager D.L. Leong J.-A.C. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 465-535Crossref Google Scholar). Human ERV are commonly designated as HERV followed by a single letter amino acid code corresponding to a tRNA. The 3′ terminus of tRNA is predicted to initiate reverse transcription by annealing to an 18-nucleotide-long primer-binding site (PBS) at the 5′-LTR. ERV copy numbers vary from one to several hundred per haploid genome (4Perl A. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 2003; 29: 123-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ERV may represent a key molecular link between the host genome and infectious viral particles. They constitute a large reservoir of viral genes that may be activated by mutations caused by radiation or chemicals or recombination with exogenous retroviruses. Although exogenous retroviruses are infectious, with a replication cycle that requires integration of proviral DNA into host cell DNA, ERV are transmitted genetically in a classical Mendelian fashion through the germ line as proviral DNA. Expression of ERV can influence the outcome of infections in different ways that are both beneficial and detrimental to the host (2Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retrotransposons, Endogenous Retroviruses, and the Evolution of Retroelements. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar). These include provision of genes for recombination with exogenous viruses, interference with virion assembly, modulation of immune responses to exogenous viruses, and blocking cellular receptors for viral entry (5Perl A. J. Rheumatol. 2001; 28: 461-464PubMed Google Scholar). Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), uses two receptors for cellular attachment and viral entry. Initial viral attachment occurs through the binding of the envelope protein gp120 to the CD4 molecule expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and macrophages. Viral binding to CD4 is necessary but insufficient to mediate viral entry. Interaction between CD4 and gp120 increases the affinity of virions for coreceptor molecules CXCR4 and CCR5. Genetic polymorphisms or deletions within CCR5 diminish or abrogate viral binding to the receptor, which leads to a lower susceptibility to infection and slower disease progression in persons carrying these mutations (6Baban S. Freeman J.D. Mager D.L. Genomics. 1996; 33: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CXCR4-using viruses are generally more pathogenic, via depletion of CD4 T cells, than are CCR5-using viruses. CD4 appears to play a role in HIV entry distinct from merely serving as the attachment protein for the virus. CD4 undergoes endocytosis following T cell activation via the activation of protein kinase C and subsequent phosphorylation of CD4 (7Hoxie J.A. Matthews D.M. Callahan K.J. Cassel D.L. Cooper R.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1194-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 8Acres R.B. Conlon P.J. Mochizuki D.Y. Gallis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16210-16214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIV binding was also reported to induce phosphorylation of CD4 via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway; however, internalization of HIV does not require endocytosis of CD4 (9Maddon P.J.

Donovan N.J. Steimer K.S. Littman D.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated potential interactions between a newly identified gene product of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I-related endogenous retroviral sequence, HRES-1, and HIV-1. HRES-1 was previously isolated based on homology to the long terminal repeat and gag regions of human T cell leukemia virus type I (11Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hybridization analysis with genomic DNA samples of selected phylogenetic stages revealed that HRES-1 was confined to the primate lineage (11Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HRES-1 is a single copy sequence in the haploid genome that has been mapped to 1q42 at the long arm of chromosome 1 (12Perl A. Isaacs C.M. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Sait S.N. Shows T.B. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1172-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 684-bp flanking region 5′ to p28 contains a TATA box, a polyadenylation signal, a potential histidyl tRNA primer-binding site (PBS), and characteristic inverted repeat sequences at locations that are typical of a retroviral LTR (2Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retrotransposons, Endogenous Retroviruses, and the Evolution of Retroelements. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar, 11Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HRES-1 is one of the few human ERV that remain transcriptionally active (3Wilkinson D.A. Mager D.L. Leong J.-A.C. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 465-535Crossref Google Scholar, 11Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By utilizing HRES-1-derived probes, a novel 2986-base-long transcript encoded by the antisense strand of the HRES-1 locus was isolated from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The sequence of this cDNA showed considerable homology to the 735-base-long Rab4a gene and is thus termed HRES-1/Rab4. Antibody raised against recombinant HRES-1/Rab4 detected a native protein of identical molecular weight in PBL and Jurkat and H9 T cell lines. The first coding exon of HRES-1/Rab4 is embedded in the HRES-1 endogenous retroviral sequence. HRES-1 nucleotides 2151-1606, located upstream from HRES-1/Rab4 exon 1, showed strong promoter activity when oriented in the direction of HRES-1/Rab4 transcription. The tat gene of HIV-1 stimulates transcriptional activity of the HRES-1/Rab4 promoter via trans-activation of the HRES-1 LTR and increases HRES-1/Rab4 protein levels. In turn, HRES-1/Rab4 regulates recycling and surface expression of CD4 and thus controls susceptibility to infection by HIV-1. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from Jurkat cells, fractionated in 1% glyoxal gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to 32P-labeled human β-actin (13Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) or HRES-1-derived fragments, as described earlier (11Perl A. Rosenblatt J.D. Chen I.S. DiVincenzo J.P. Bever R. Poiesz B.J. Abraham G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6841-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing were done under high stringency conditions. Screening of Expression Library and Cloning and Sequencing of cDNA—A human lymphocyte cDNA library prepared in λgt11 phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with HRES-1 probes under high stringency conditions, as described earlier (14Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were transferred into the EcoRI site of Bluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene) and sequenced in both strands. Nucleotide sequence of the 2986-base-long HRES-1/Rab4 cDNA was submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AY585832). Prokaryotic Expression of Recombinant Protein—Full-length HRES-1/Rab4 protein was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), as described earlier (15Banki K. Perl A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BamHI and XhoI sites were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis immediately 5′ of the first methionine codon and 3′ of the stop codon of HRES1/Rab4 and cloned into BamHI- and XhoI-cleaved pGEX-6P1 plasmid vector (Amersham Biosciences). Optimum stimulation of expression of the recombinant fusion protein was obtained with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-galactoside after 2 h. HRES1/Rab4-GST fusion protein was affinity-purified through binding of GST to glutathione-coated agarose beads (Sigma). HRES-1/Rab4 protein was cleaved from GST by precision protease (Amersham Biosciences) and was separated from the agarose bead-bound GST by centrifugation. Construction and Transfection of Eukaryotic Expression Vectors— HRES-1/Rab4 was overexpressed in Jurkat cells using a doxycycline-inducible GFP-encoding bi-cistronic expression vector system (16Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Jolicoeur P. Massie B. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 150-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 2 mm l-glutamine, transfected by electroporation with pUHD172-1neo plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Hermann Bujard, University of Heidelberg) (17Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), and selected for neomycin resistance in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. Jur-TA cells are neomycin (G418)-resistant Jurkat cells transfected with rtTA-containing pUHD172-1neo and thus produce the reverse trans-acting factor (rtTA) capable of interacting with promoters harboring tetracycline operator sequences only in the presence of tetracycline analogs. Jur-TA cells were electroporated with GFP-producing pTR5-DC/GFP*TK/hygro control (construct 4480), wild-type (construct 6678), and dominant-negative mutant HRES-1/Rab4S27N-containing vector (construct 9035); and doubly transfected cells were selected in 400 μg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Percentage of GFP-positive cells in an aliquot of the transfected cultures was periodically checked by flow cytometry. After 24 h of incubation with 1 μg/ml doxycycline, which did not affect cell viability, the most brightly fluorescent 1% of cells was sorted using a flow cytometer and subsequently maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Bulk-sorted aliquots of 4480, 6678, and 9035 construct-transfected cells were utilized in all experiments. Transfected cells were not cloned to avoid artifacts related to variations in sites of vector integration. Control and HIV-1 tat gene-transfected HeLa and Jurkat cells (18Caputo A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. AIDS. 1990; 3: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Program. Transduction of HRES-1/Rab4 by Adeno-associated Virus Vector (pAAV-IRES-hrGFP)—The HRES-1/Rab4 cDNA was inserted upstream of the internal ribosomal entry site of the pAAV-IRES-hrGFP vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). HRES-1/Rab4-expressing adeno-associated virus was produced by transfection of HEK293 cells with HRES-1/Rab4-containing pAAV-IRES-hrGFP, pAAV-RC, and pHelper plasmids, which supply the necessary exogenous gene products for virus production (Stratagene). At 1:1 multiplicity of infection, >99% of cells infected with pAAV-HRES-1/Rab4-IRES-hrGFP, pAAV-HRES-1/Rab4S27N-IRES-hrGFP, or pAAV-IRES-hrGFP control virus were GFP-positive. Maximal GFP expression was observed 24 h after virus infection. GFP and HRES-1/Rab4 expressions were diminished by 50% after 48 h and became undetectable 5 days post-infection. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Dominant-negative HRES-1/Rab4 was created by replacing serine 27 with asparagine (S27N) using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, California). Briefly, 25 ng of the wild-type HRES-1/Rab4 cDNA plasmid (template) was incubated with 125 ng of sense (5′-GCAGGAACTGGCAAAAATTGCCTTACTTCATCAG-3′) and antisense primers (5′-CTGATGAAGTAAGCAATTTTTGCCAGTTCCTGC-3′ with mutagenic residues underlined) and dNTPs and subjected to 18 PCR cycles with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase with denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 12 min. DpnI was used to digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded methylated DNA for 1 h at 37°C. Transformations were performed in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells using DpnI-treated DNA. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing of the resultant plasmids. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HeLa cells were transfected with 1.6 μg of pBLCAT3-based HRES-1 promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs (19Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) at 80% confluency in 9.5-cm2 wells using 20 μl of PLUS reagent and 4.8 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). To normalize transfection efficiency, each plasmid was cotransfected with 1.6 μg of the pRSVβ-gal plasmid (β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter) (20Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). The HRES-1/Rab4-containing plasmids did not affect promoter activity of pRSVβ-gal, as determined by the amount of transfected cell lysate used for CAT assays. For each experiment, the promoterless pBLCAT3 vector was used as a negative control, and pRSV-CAT was used as positive control. After 4 h of exposure to the DNA/Lipofectamine complex in serum- and antibiotic-free media, the DNA complex was removed, and cells were further cultured for an additional 36 h in complete growth media. Cells were harvested in 150 μlof250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and solubilized by three rounds of freezing and thawing. For the β-galactosidase assay, 30 μl of lysate was incubated with 270 μl of reaction mixture (1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranosidase, and 0.1 m NaPi, pH 7.5, at 37 °C) and terminated with addition of 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 once the reaction turned yellow. Absorbance values were measured at 420 nm and used to calculate the quantity of each transfected cell lysate to be used in the CAT assay. Cell lysates were heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate acetylases, and CAT assays were performed at 37 °C in 50 μl of reaction mixture of 250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, normalized cell lysate, 0.4 mm acetyl-coenzyme A, 0.025 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol. Acetylated chloramphenicol was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in ethyl acetate, spotted on a silica gel (Analtech, Newark, DE), and resolved in an equilibrated chromatography tank containing 19:1 chloroform/methanol. A 445 SI Phospho-rImager with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) was used to determine the ratio of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol. All assays were conducted within the range of linearity of CAT activities with respect to incubation time, based on the β-galactosidase assay (21Grossman C.E. Qian Y. Banki K. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12190-12205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Retroviral Proteins and Antibodies—Retroviral reagents were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Program, National Institutes of Health. Infectious stock of the strain HIV-1IIIB was harvested from 24-h supernatants of freshly infected H9 cells (ATCC CRL-8543), and infectious titer was determined by an in situ infectivity (MAGI) assay (22Nagy K. Young M. Baboonian C. Merson J. Whittle P. Oroszlan S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 757-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants with titers of 2.1 × 105 infectious units (IU)/ml were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and aliquots were stored at -70 °C. Infections were performed with cell-free virus supernatants containing 100 ng of p24 core protein measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following the manufacturer's recommendations (NEK-060, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), corresponding to 2.1 × 105 IU per 5 × 106 cells or a multiplicity of infection of 0.04. Thus, 1 ng of p24 core protein corresponded to 2000 infectious virions, in accordance with earlier findings (23Segal D.J. Goncalves J. Eberhardy S. Swan C.H. Torbett B.E. Li X. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14509-14519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Virus infection was carried out in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Subsequently, cells were washed in serum-free RPMI and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 2 mm l-glutamine. HIV-1 SF2 p25/245 gag contained the gag 24 protein (24Steimer K.S. Puma J.P. Power M.D. Powers M.A. George-Nascimento C. Stephans J.C. Levy J.A. Sanchez-Pescador R. Luciw P.A. Barr P.J. Hallewell R.A. Virology. 1986; 150: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HIV-1/IIIB Gag4 contained the p17 C terminus, beginning at amino acid position 146, all of p24, and the p15 N terminus (Repligen, Cambridge, MA). To monitor production of viral proteins, HIV-1 gag p24-specific polyclonal sheep antibody (25Karacostas V. Nagashima K. Gonda M.A. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8964-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and tatspecific rabbit antibody 705 (AIDS Research and Reference Program, National Institutes of Health) were utilized. Separation of CD4+ T Cells from Human Peripheral Blood— PBMC were separated from peripheral blood (26Banki K. Hutter E. Gonchoroff N. Perl A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1466-1479PubMed Google Scholar), and 107 cells were incubated with 17.5 μl of anti-CD4 beads to isolate CD4+ T cells (catalog number 111.45, Dynal, Lake Success, NY). After stimulation with 5 μg/ml concanavalin A and 200 units/ml interleukin-2 (Sigma) for 3 days, beads were removed by washing in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum over a Dynal magnet, and 107 CD4+ T cells (≥98% pure) were infected with HIV-1, as described above. Monitoring of Cell Survival by Flow Cytometry—HIV-induced apoptosis was assessed by observing cell shrinkage and quantified by flow cytometry after staining with Cy-5-conjugated annexin V (Ann V-Cy5; Bio Vision, Mountain View, CA) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2, as described earlier (26Banki K. Hutter E. Gonchoroff N. Perl A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1466-1479PubMed Google Scholar, 27Banki K. Hutter E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11944-11953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Staining with Ann V-Cy5 (FL-5) was used to monitor cell viability in parallel with assessing expression of GFP (FL-1) and surface antigens with PE-conjugated CD4 (FL-2), PE-conjugated fusin/CXCR4 (FL-2), and PE- or PE-Cy5-conjugated transferrin receptor (TFR/CD71) antibodies (FL-3). Receptor Recycling—Internalization of surface receptors was induced by treatment with 100 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) for 1 h at 37°C (7Hoxie J.A. Matthews D.M. Callahan K.J. Cassel D.L. Cooper R.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1194-1201PubMed Google Scholar,8Acres R.B. Conlon P.J. Mochizuki D.Y. Gallis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16210-16214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were washed twice and kept at 4 °C to assess internalization or returned to 37 °C to allow receptor recycling in the absence or presence of doxycycline. After termination of recycling, cells were kept on ice until analysis of surface expression by flow cytometry. Permeabilization of Cells for Detection of Intracellular Antigen by Flow Cytometry—106 Jurkat cells were centrifuged, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Cellgro) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of HBSS with 0.1% saponin (28Jacob M.C. Favre M. Bensa J.C. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% fetal calf serum and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of HBSS with 0.1% saponin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin, and PE-conjugated IgG1 monoclonal antibody KC57 RD1 for detection of HIV-1 gag p24 (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) or isotype control antibody and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in 900 μl of HBSS with 0.1% saponin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 500 μl of HBSS with 1% paraformaldehyde and kept on ice up to 24 h prior to analysis. For detection of intracellular HRES-1/Rab4, cells were stained with primary rabbit antibodies SC312 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 13407, followed by washing and incubation of secondary PE-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell protein lysates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2 × 105 cells per 10 μl), separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with primary rabbit antibodies directed to HRES-1/Rab4 (SC312 or Ab 13407), sheep antibody to HIV-1 gag p24, rabbit anti-HIV-1 tat antibody 705, rabbit Ab 170 specific for transaldolase, or β-actin-specific mouse Ab 1501R (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), as described previously (14Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Banki K. Maceda J. Hurley E. Ablonczy E. Mattson D.H. Szegedy L. Hung C. Perl A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CD4 was detected with rabbit antibody SC-7219 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal antibody 4B12 (Novocastra NCL-l-CD4-368, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). Lck was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody sc-433 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of rabbit antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was utilized. Sheep and mouse primary antibodies were detected with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-sheep IgG, respectively, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Expression of HRES-1/Rab4, HIV-1 tat, HIV-1 gag p24 was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by detection of transaldolase and β-actin using 4-chloronaphthol. Automated densitometry was used to quantify the relative levels of protein expression using a Kodak Image Station 440CF with Kodak 1D image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Confocal Microscopy—For TFR staining, 106 cells were incubated for 30 min in serum-free RPMI medium at 37 °C, washed once, and incubated in uptake medium (RPMI containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) with 50 μg/ml Alexa 647-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then pipetted onto poly-l-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine; Sigma) coverslips for permeabilization and staining with Rab4 antibody. For CD4, CD5, fusin, and CD3ϵ staining, 106 cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647- or PE/Cy5-conjugated antibodies on ice for 20 min in complete medium, and internalization was induced with 100 nm PDBu for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed and kept on ice or allowed to recycle at 37 °C. After internalization and recycling, cells were adhered to coverslips precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine for 10 min at room temperature and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, 0.01 m HEPES buffer, and 1% fetal bovine serum in HBSS and stained with 4 μg/ml rabbit anti-Rab4a antibody in 0.1% saponin, 0.01 m HEPES buffer, and 1% bovine serum albumin in HBSS for 30 min. After three washes the cells were incubated in 12.5 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min, washed four times, and the coverslips mounted onto glass slides in ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes). Imaging was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 ES confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser capable of delivering excitation at 488, 568, and 647 nm using the Bio-Rad Lasersharp 2000 software. All images were recorded with a60× 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective with appropriate discriminatory filter sets.

https://openalex.org/W2085770973,"The proliferation of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum within the human host is dependent upon invasion of erythrocytes. This process is accomplished by the merozoite, a highly specialized form of the parasite. Secretory organelles including micronemes and rhoptries play a pivotal role in the invasion process by storing and releasing parasite proteins. The mechanism of protein sorting to these compartments is unclear. Using a transgenic approach we show that trafficking of the most abundant micronemal proteins (members of the EBL-family: EBA-175, EBA-140/BAEBL, and EBA-181/JSEBL) is independent of their cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, respectively. To identify the minimal sequence requirements for microneme trafficking, we generated parasites expressing EBA-GFP chimeric proteins and analyzed their distribution within the infected erythrocyte. This revealed that: (i) a conserved cysteine-rich region in the ectodomain is necessary for protein trafficking to the micronemes and (ii) correct sorting is dependent on accurate timing of expression."
https://openalex.org/W1995872112,"Decorin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that modulates the activity of transforming growth factor type β and other growth factors and thereby influences the processes of proliferation and differentiation in a wide array of physiological and pathological reactions. Hence, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of decorin activity has broad implications. Here we report that the extracellular levels of decorin are controlled by receptor-mediated catabolism, involving the low density lipoprotein receptor family member, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). We show that decorin is endocytosed and degraded by C2C12 myoblast cells and that both processes are blocked by suppressing LRP expression using short interfering RNA. The same occurs with CHO cells, but not with CHO cells genetically deficient in LRP. Finally, we show that LRP-null CHO cells, transfected to express mini-LRP polypeptides containing either the second or fourth LRP ligand-binding domains, carry out decorin endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. These findings point to LRP-mediated catabolism as a new control pathway for the biological activities of decorin, specifically for its ability to influence extracellular matrix signaling."

However, the mechanism responsible for the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in outside-in signaling is unclear. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain of β3 is cleaved by the calcium-dependent proteases (calpain) at sites flanking two NXXY motifs, preferentially at the C-terminal side of Tyr759 (15Xi X.

A consequence of calpain cleavage of β3 at Tyr759 is the inhibition of β3-dependent cell spreading, which is an outside-in signaling event (15Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.-T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In studying the relationship between these two seemingly unrelated β3 modifications that regulate the function of the cytoplasmic domain of β3, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation in β3 cytoplasmic domain inhibits cleavage of β3 by calpain. Since calpain cleavage negatively regulates outside-in signaling-mediated cell spreading, our finding provides a mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 promotes integrin outside-in signaling. Peptides—Peptides were synthesized by Protein Chemistry Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago, purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, and correct molecular weights verified by electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry. Double tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 cytoplasmic domain peptides were verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots with anti-β3 cytoplasmic domain antibodies.

The antibody pY759 was generated using the peptide CTpYRGT with a linker cystein and a 5-residue sequence corresponding to tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 C terminus. The anti-serum was absorbed (three times) with Sepharose 4B coupled with a non-phosphorylated CTYRGT peptide to remove phosphorylation-independent reactivity.

Platelet aggregation was induced by 0.1 unit/ml of α-thrombin in a Chronolog aggregometer stirring at 1000 rpm for 3 min.

In phosphatase inhibition experiments, platelets were incubated with 0.5 mm sodium vanadate at 37 °C for 5 min prior to addition of agonists. Platelets were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm E64; analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–15% gradient gels; and immunoblotted with various antibodies. Results were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Localization of Calpain-cleaved or Tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 Molecules in Spreading Platelets—Lab-Tek® chamber slides (Nalgen Nunc, Naperville, IL) were precoated with 10 μg/ml fibrinogen followed by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin. Platelet suspension in Tyrode's buffer (100 μl, 108/ml) was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 90 and 180 min. The plates were rinsed, and adherent platelets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1 m Tris, 10 mm EGTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm E64, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.5). The samples were incubated with a mouse anti-β3 antibody, mAb15, and one of the rabbit anti-β3 cytoplasmic domain antibodies. After washing, platelets were stained with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Data were collected using a Zeiss confocal microscope. The area of β3 colocalized with tyrosine phosphorylation or calpain cleavage was quantitated in randomly chosen fields by using the colocalization tool in Zeiss LSM 5 software and expressed as average number of pixels/platelet. Statistical significance was determined using a t test. To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain regulates calpain cleavage of β3, a 43-residue phosphopeptide (β3C-pY) corresponding to the sequence of the β3 cytoplasmic domain was synthesized with both Y747 and Y759 phosphorylated (Fig. 1A). As a control, we also synthesized a non-phosphorylated peptide with the sequence identical to β3C-pY (β3C). These peptides were treated with purified human μ-calpain and then immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize the β3 cytoplasmic domain only when β3 is cleaved at the previously characterized calpain cleavage sites (cleavage indicator antibodies Ab754 and Ab759) (22Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and with Ab762, an antibody that recognizes the β3 C-terminal TYRGT sequence (15Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.-T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ab762 still reacts with the β3 cytoplasmic domain when Tyr759 is phosphorylated but at a reduced affinity (Fig. 1B). However, the reactivity of this antibody is totally abolished with calpain-cleaved β3 (15Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.-T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Treatment of non-phosphorylated β3C peptide with μ-calpain caused the loss of reactivity with Ab762 and gain of reactivity with cleavage indicator antibodies, indicating that calpain cleaved the peptide at specific sites. In contrast, the tyrosinephosphorylated β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide, β3C-pY, showed no loss of reactivity with Ab762 following calpain treatment and no gain of reactivity with the cleavage indicator antibodies. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation protects β3 cytoplasmic domain from calpain cleavage in the in vitro assays using purified calpain and β3 peptides. To detect β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro and in platelets, we developed an anti-peptide antiserum (Ab pY759) specific for the phosphopeptide, C-TpYRGT, corresponding to the β3 C-terminal sequence. The Ab pY759 reacted with the phosphorylated β3C-pY peptide but not the nonphosphorylated β3C peptide, further verifying the β3C-pY phosphopeptide (Fig. 1B). These results also show that the reactivity of Ab pY759 with β3 is phosphorylation-dependent and thus specifically indicates β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In immunoblot, Ab pY759 had essentially no reactivity with β3 from resting platelets but reacted strongly with β3 from platelets aggregated in response to thrombin, which induces β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Prevention of platelet aggregation by the integrin inhibitor, RGDS, inhibited the reaction of Ab pY759 with β3, confirming that β3 phosphorylation is induced by integrin outside-in signaling (20Jenkins A.L. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Silver D. Sellers J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13878-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To investigate whether tyrosine phosphorylation protects integrin from cleavage by calpain in platelets, platelets were treated with thrombin to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. Platelets were also treated with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate (Fig. 2) to prevent dephosphorylation of β3 cytoplasmic domain by tyrosine phosphatases and thus further enhance β3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Tyr747 and Tyr759 induced by thrombin and their further enhancement by sodium vanadate were indicated by immunoblotting with Ab pY759 and an anti-pY747 antibody (Fig. 2). Platelets were then treated with the calcium ionophore, A23187, to induce cleavage of β3. Consistent with our previous results, A23187 induced cleavages of β3 at the C-terminal side of residues 747, 754, and 759 in platelets. However, A23187-induced β3 cleavage is substantially reduced in thrombin-treated platelets and further reduced in platelets treated with both thrombin and sodium vanadate, in correlation with the increased β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. The effects of thrombin and sodium vanadate are unlikely to be related to changes in expression levels of β3 because immunoblotting with the anti-β3 extracellular domain antibody, 8053, showed similar levels of β3 in platelets treated with or without thrombin or/and sodium vanadate. To exclude the possibility that the effects of thrombin and sodium vanadate in inhibiting calpain cleavage of β3 may be caused by nonspecific effect of thrombin or sodium vanadate on calpain activity, we also examined whether thrombin or/and sodium vanadate may inhibit calpain cleavage of another calpain substrate, fodrin. A23187 induced calpain cleavage of fodrin as indicated by reactivity with a calpain cleavage-specific antibody against fodrin (25Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Since this cleavage was not affected by the treatment of platelets with thrombin and/or sodium vanadate, it is unlikely that thrombin and/or sodium vanadate had a nonspecific effect on calpain activity. Rather, their effect on β3 cleavage is likely to be specifically caused by reducing β3 susceptibility to calpain cleavage. Since we showed that thrombin induced tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr759 and Tyr747 of β3, which is enhanced by sodium vanadate, our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 inhibited A23187-induced calpain cleavage of β3 cytoplasmic domain in platelets. It is known that calpain is activated following platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. However, unlike A23187 that induces cleavage of ∼70% of β3 molecules in 5 min, thrombin only induces calpain cleavage of a small population of β3 during platelet aggregation (15Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.-T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that thrombin, but not A23187, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. To further examine whether thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation protects β3 from calpain cleavage without adding calcium ionophore, platelets were pretreated with or without sodium vanadate and then stimulated with thrombin. Fig. 3 shows that thrombin-induced calpain cleavage of a population of integrin molecules mainly occurs at Tyr759 site, and this cleavage is inhibited by sodium vanadate. To exclude the possible nonspecific effect of sodium vanadate on calpain activity, we show that sodium vanadate failed to affect thrombin-induced calpain cleavage of fodrin. These results suggest that thrombin-induced phosphorylation of β3 inhibited thrombin-induced calpain cleavage of β3 during platelet aggregation. To further support the protective effect of tyrosine phosphorylation against calpain cleavage, we show that mouse β3 (DiYF) with both Tyr747 and Tyr759 mutated to phenylalanine is more susceptible to calpain cleavage than wild type during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 3B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 also occurs in platelets spread on fibrinogen surfaces (Fig. 4) as indicated by staining with antibodies specifically recognizing β3 molecules that are phosphorylated at Tyr759 or Tyr747 (Fig. 4). At an earlier time point (90 min), staining of both pY759 and pY747 is strong and forms punctate focal adhesion-like structures mainly in the leading edge of spreading platelets particularly at the tips of pseudopods (arrows). At a later time point, while pY747 staining becomes even stronger and forms focal adhesion-like structures ringing the platelets, pY759 staining becomes decreased and more diffuse, and its focal adhesion-like structures are almost lost, suggesting pY759 dephosphorylation at focal adhesion sites and leading edge. These data indicate that phosphorylation at Tyr759 and Tyr747 is differentially regulated in spreading platelets, and that pY759 is preferentially dephosphorylated at a later stage of platelet spreading. To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation affected calpain cleavage of β3 in spreading platelets, we also stained spreading platelets with the antibody Ab759 that recognizes the calpain cleavage site at Tyr759 (the major calpain cleavage site in platelets, see Fig. 3A). At 90 min, Ab759 staining was weak in spreading platelets. Interestingly, Ab759 stain was even weaker in the margin of platelets where the punctated ring of tyrosine-phosphorylated b3 was strong. These results are consistent with the above observation that tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits calpain cleavage of β3. At 180 min, more β3 molecules are cleaved at Tyr759, which correlated well with the decrease in pY759 staining. Calpain cleavage at sites near pY747 was barely detectable in spreading platelets (data not shown). These results suggest that calpain cleavage mainly occurs to a population of dephosphorylated integrin molecules. The differential dephosphorylation of pY747 and pY759 also explains why calpain preferentially cleaves β3 at the Tyr759 site in platelets. Furthermore, we previously reported that cells expressing a β3 truncation mutant mimicking calpain cleavage at Tyr759 showed reduced spreading on fibrinogen, suggesting that the calpain-cleaved form of β3 is defective in mediating spreading (15Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.-T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that one mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 facilitates outside-in signaling and platelet spreading is its inhibition of calpain cleavage of β3. It is known that the intact β3 C terminus is required for outside-in signal leading to cell spreading (15Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.-T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This requirement is consistent with the findings that c-Src binds to the β3 C-terminal domain and that inhibition of Src family of protein kinases inhibited cell spreading (27Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 28De Virgilio M. Kiosses W.B.

Calpain cleavage of β3 cytoplasmic domain disrupts the c-Src binding site in the C-terminal domain of β3, which potentially explains why calpain cleavage of integrins plays important roles in detaching the rear end of a cell during migration (30Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19525-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Calpain is abundant in the cell focal adhesion sites (32Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and is activated by integrin-mediated calcium elevation (33Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, cell spreading and firm adhesion would not be possible without protection of β3 cytoplasmic domain from calpain cleavage. Furthermore, calpain also regulates the functions of several other focal adhesion proteins including talin (34Fox J.E. Goll D.E. Reynolds C.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1060-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), focal adhesion kinase (35Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), protein-tyrosine phosphatase IB (36Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation-dependent regulation of integrin cleavage by calpain allows calpain to differentially and dynamically regulate the functions of integrins and other focal adhesion proteins at different locations as well as during different stages of cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. We show that tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 serves as a molecular mechanism that directly protects integrins from calpain cleavage. It is possible that phosphorylation-dependent β3 binding to cytoplasmic proteins also has a protective effect. Thus, our results provide an important mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 promotes integrin outside-in signaling and by which the timing and location of calpain cleavage of integrins are dynamically regulated."

Consistent with its role in supplying acetate for myelin lipid synthesis, ASPA is thought to be cytoplasmic. Here we describe the occurrence of ASPA within nuclei of rat brain and kidney, and in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes. Immunohistochemistry showed cytoplasmic and nuclear ASPA staining, the specificity of which was demonstrated by its absence from tissues of the Tremor rat, an ASPA-null mutant. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed low enzyme activity against NAA in nuclear fractions from normal rats. Whereas two recent reports have indicated that ASPA exists as a dimer, size-exclusion chromatography of subcellular fractions showed ASPA is an active monomer in both subcellular fractions. Western blotting detected ASPA as a single 38 kD band. Because ASPA is small enough to passively diffuse into the nucleus, we constructed, expressed, and detected in COS-7 cells a green fluorescent protein-human ASPA (GFP-hASPA) fusion protein larger than the permissible size for the nuclear pore complex. GFP-hASPA was enzymatically active and showed mixed nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution. We conclude that ASPA is a regulated nuclear-cytoplasmic protein that may have distinct functional roles in the two cellular compartments."

Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are potent angiogenic factors that can affect plaque neovascularization. Our objective was to determine the effect of diabetes on atherosclerosis and on the expression of angiogenesis-related genes in atherosclerotic lesions. Alloxan was used to induce diabetes in male Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits that were sacrificed 2 and 6 months after the induction of diabetes. Nondiabetic WHHL rabbits served as controls. Blood glucose (Glc), serum-free fatty acids (FFA), and serum triglyceride levels were significantly higher in diabetic rabbits. Accelerated atherogenesis was observed in the diabetic WHHL rabbits together with increased intramyocellular lipids (IMCL), as determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Atherosclerotic lesions in the diabetic rabbits had an increased content of macrophages and showed significant increases in immunostainings for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-D, VEGF receptor-1, VEGF receptor-2, RAGE, and NF-kappaB. VEGF-A165 and VEGFR-2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in aortas of the diabetic rabbits, where a trend toward increased plaque vascularization was also observed. These results suggest that diabetes accelerates atherogenesis, up-regulates VEGF-A, VEGF-D, and VEGF receptor-2 expression, and increases NF-kappaB, RAGE, and inflammatory responses in atherosclerotic lesions in WHHL rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W1992460598,"Pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) is an essential component of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) system, catalyzing the regeneration of the essential cofactor 6(R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin [6(R)BH4]. Mutations in PCD or its deactivation by hydrogen peroxide result in the generation of 7(R,S)BH4, which is a potent inhibitor of PAH that has been implicated in primapterinuria, a variant form of phenylketonuria, and in the skin depigmentation disorder vitiligo. We have synthesized and separated the 7(R) and 7(S) diastereomers confirming their structure by NMR. Both 7(R)- and 7(S)BH4 function as poor cofactors for PAH, whereas only 7(S)BH4 acts as a potent competitive inhibitor vs. 6(R)BH4 (Ki=2.3-4.9 microM). Kinetic and binding studies, as well as characterization of the pterin-enzyme complexes by fluorescence spectroscopy, revealed that the inhibitory effects of 7(R,S)BH4 on PAH are in fact specifically based on 7(S)BH4 binding. The molecular dynamics simulated structures of the pterin-PAH complexes indicate that 7(S)BH4 inhibition is due to its interaction with the polar region at the pterin binding site close to Ser-251, whereas its low efficiency as cofactor is related to a suboptimal positioning toward the catalytic iron. 7(S)BH4 is not an inhibitor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the physiological range, presumably due to the replacement of Ser-251 by the corresponding Ala297. Taken together, our results identified structural determinants for the specific regulation of PAH and TH by 7(S)BH4, which in turn aid in the understanding of primapterinuria and acute vitiligo."
https://openalex.org/W2010083101,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells express promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein, which leads to the blocking of APL cell differentiation. Treatment of APL with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces disease remission by in vivo differentiation of APL cells. Differentiation requires cell cycle exit; yet how ATRA couples cell cycle exit to differentiation of APL remains largely unknown. We previously found that ATRA-induced cell differentiation accompanies ubiquitination-proteolysis of ménage à trois 1 (MAT1), an assembly factor and targeting subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) that regulates G1 exit. We report here that CAK binds to and phosphorylates PML/RARalpha in actively proliferating APL cells. In response to ATRA, PML/RARalpha is dissociated from CAK, leading to MAT1 degradation, G1 arrest, and decreased CAK phosphorylation of PML/RARalpha. CAK phosphorylation of PML/RARalpha is inhibited when MAT1 levels are reduced. Both MAT1 degradation and PML/RARalpha hypophosphorylation occur in ATRA-induced G1-arresting cells undergoing differentiation but not in the synchronized G1 cells that do not differentiate. These findings reveal a novel ATRA signaling on APL cell differentiation, in which ATRA coordinates G1 arrest and transition into differentiation by inducing MAT1 degradation and PML/RARalpha hypophosphorylation through disrupting PML/RARalpha binding and phosphorylation by CAK."
https://openalex.org/W1974706567,"Activated protein C inhibits the procoagulant function of activated factor V (FVa) through proteolytic cleavages at Arg-306, Arg-506, and Arg-679. The cleavage at Arg-506 is kinetically favored but protected by factor Xa (FXa). Protein S has been suggested to annihilate the inhibitory effect of FXa, a proposal that has been challenged. To elucidate the effects of FXa and protein S on the individual cleavage sites of FVa, we used recombinant FVa:Q306/Q679 and FVa:Q506/Q679 variants, which can only be cleaved at Arg-506 and Arg-306, respectively. In the presence of active site blocked FXa (FXa-1.5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg), the FVa inactivation was followed over time, and apparent second order rate constants were calculated. Consistent with results on record, we observed that FXa-1.5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg decreased the Arg-506 cleavage by 20-fold, with a half-maximum inhibition of approximately 2 nM. Interestingly and in contrast to the inhibitory effect of FXa on the 506 cleavage, FXa stimulated the Arg-306 cleavage. Protein S counteracted the inhibition by FXa of the Arg-506 cleavage, whereas protein S and FXa yielded additive stimulatory effect of the cleavage at Arg-306. This suggests that FXa and protein S interact with distinct sites on FVa, which is consistent with the observed lack of inhibitory effect on FXa binding to FVa by protein S. We propose that the apparent annihilation of the FXa protection of the Arg-506 cleavage by protein S is due to an enhanced rate of Arg-506 cleavage of FVa not bound to FXa, resulting in depletion of free FVa and dissociation of FXa-FVa complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2087313534,"The reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are a unique family of viral membrane fusion proteins. These nonstructural viral proteins induce efficient cell-cell rather than virus-cell membrane fusion. We analyzed the lipid environment in which the reptilian reovirus p14 FAST protein resides to determine the influence of the cell membrane on the fusion activity of the FAST proteins. Topographical mapping of the surface of fusogenic p14-containing liposomes by atomic force microscopy under aqueous conditions revealed that p14 resides almost exclusively in thickened membrane microdomains. In transfected cells, p14 was found in both Lubrol WX- and Triton X-100-resistant membrane complexes. Cholesterol depletion of donor cell membranes led to preferential disruption of p14 association with Lubrol WX (but not Triton X-100)-resistant membranes and decreased cell-cell fusion activity, both of which were reversed upon subsequent cholesterol repletion. Furthermore, co-patching analysis by fluorescence microscopy indicated that p14 did not co-localize with classical lipidanchored raft markers. These data suggest that the p14 FAST protein associates with heterogeneous membrane microdomains, a distinct subset of which is defined by cholesterol-dependent Lubrol WX resistance and which may be more relevant to the membrane fusion process."
https://openalex.org/W2139800335,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (a.k.a., endotoxin) is an essential component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and is a potent activator of the innate immune system of animals. Lipid A, the glycolipid core of LPS, is the agent responsible for disease and death from gram-negative sepsis, an important cause of human mortality and morbidity. Although it is generally accepted that lipid A is restricted to the prokaryotes, recent efforts to purify molecules from green algae with structural features unique to lipid A have met with success. Furthermore, the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been found to contain genes that encode all of the enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway for lipid A. It is not known whether vascular plants synthesize lipid A or where lipid A might be located in the tissues. For the present study, we used affinity reagents for lipid A to probe green alga and tissues of the garden pea for a light microscopic localization of lipid A in these eukaryote cells. We find staining for lipid A in free-living and endosymbiotic green algae and in the chloroplasts of vascular plants, indicating that this molecule is not restricted to prokaryotes, but is found also in select eukaryotes."
