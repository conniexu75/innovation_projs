https://openalex.org/W2056509223,Cytotoxic activity of activated mouse macrophages against mouse embryo fibroblasts was tested before and after spontaneous transformation of the fibroblasts in vitro. Activated macrophages caused little or no destruction of untransformed fibroblasts but were markedly cytotoxic to the same fibroblasts after spontaneous transformation. The efferent limb of this cytotoxic reaction appears to be nonimmunologic and to be related to abnormal growth properties rather than to the antigenic composition of target cells.
https://openalex.org/W1506766250,"Abstract Rat hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid-coenzyme A reductase (mevalonate:NADP oxidoreductase (acylating CoA) EC 1.1.1.34) exhibits a complex developmental pattern with significant changes occurring prior to birth, after the first postnatal week, and following weaning. The increase in reductase activity that follows weaning cannot be prematurely induced by administration of thyroxine, hydrocortisone, or somatotropin but is invoked by early weaning. Delayed weaning blocks the normal increase, indicating that dietary factors are responsible for the observed changes. The reductase activity in livers from suckling pups exhibits an inverted cyclic rhythm of reduced amplitude, while that of weaned pups has a normal adult type rhythm. The transition from pre- to post-weaned reductase levels appears to involve both the biosynthetic capacity of the diurnal rhythm and relief of inhibition of reductase activity. While suckling rat liver cytosol contains an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid-CoA reductase activity, the livers of suckling rats with severed bile ducts exhibit normal adult reductase levels. Rat milk also contains an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid-CoA reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2075022048,"The semiconductor behavior of melanins is reviewed and compared with quantum mechanical models of conduction in amorphous solids. The available data are consistent with extensions of Mott's basic model for amorphous semiconductors, whereas they are inconsistent with crystalline semiconductor models. An investigation of the specific conduction mechanisms operative in melanins in terms of the amorphous model should reveal important aspects of the band structure."
https://openalex.org/W1985620441,"Isotopic decay in tritiated thymidine in the DNA of frozen (-196 degrees C) Chinese hamster cells causes breaks in DNA strands to accumulate at a rate of 2.1 breaks per decay. After DNA is thawed the tritium-induced breaks repair rapidly with a half-time of 15 minutes at 37 degrees C. In comparison to breakage by x-rays, the efficiency of DNA strand breakage by tritium is equivalent to 0.48 rad per decay. This dose per decay is close to that predicted by simple dosimetric considerations (0.38 rad per decay) for irradiation by the beta particles from tritium."
https://openalex.org/W1580578429,"A group of human amyloid fibril proteins having chemical homology and antigenic similarities to immunoglobulin light polypeptide chains has been previously described. The amino acid sequence of a different type of human amyloid fibril protein is reported. This protein lacks valine, proline, threonine, and half-cystine and its sequence is not homologous with any presently known immunoglobulin sequence. This sequence defines a new class of amyloid fibril proteins of as yet unknown origin."
https://openalex.org/W1564626238,"Abstract Fibroblasts cultured from human skin or bone marrow biopsies contain the glycosphingolipids associated with human visceral organs, namely, glucosylceramide (GL-1a), lactosylceramide (GL-2a), trihexosylceramide (GL-3), globoside (GL-4), Gm3 and Gd3. The presence of large amounts of GL-3 and GL-4 distinguishes normal human fibroblasts from most other normal mammalian cell lines so far investigated. Neither gangliosides (glycosphingolipids containing both sialic acid and hexosamine) nor sulfatides appeared to be present in these cells (concentration less than 0.01 µmole per g dry weight of cells). The glycosphingolipids constitute about 3% of the total lipid of fibroblasts, an amount comparable to that of normal human tissue. Further, the glycosphingolipid composition and concentration are largely independent of the amount of serum supplement. Confluent fibroblast cultures showed maximum incorporation of isotope from uniformly labeled d-[U-14C]glucose into the hexose, sphingosine, and fatty acid moieties of all six glycosphingolipids after 24 to 48 hours, indicating de novo synthesis of all three moieties. The half-life of 2 to 3 days was consistent with values generally accepted for membrane-bound phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1518722706,"Abstract The fluorescent substance 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate (HPT) has been shown to combine with deoxyhemoglobin with a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of HPT per hemoglobin tetramer. It is displaced with the same stoichiometry by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and by inositol hexaphosphate. When added to human hemoglobin solutions of low ionic strength it diminishes oxygen affinity. HPT has been used to study anion release associated with carbon monoxide binding. This occurs late in the reaction with hemoglobin A at pH 6, probably after 3 molecules of CO have been bound, and somewhat earlier at pH 7.5. Release is earlier with des-his(β146) hemoglobin, hemoglobins Hiroshima (β146 asp), Chesapeake (α92 leu), and hemoglobin A treated with p-mercuribenzoate. In static titrations with carbon monoxide there was good proportionality between ligand binding and anion release. With oxygen as ligand there was little or no lag between oxygen binding and anion release in kinetic experiments at low ligand concentrations. Detailed analysis suggests that more than two hemoglobin conformations are required to account for the results. The chief kinetic contribution to cooperativity in the CO binding reaction due to the combination velocity constants occurs after binding of 3 CO molecules."

These soluble fractions and perchloric acid extracts of intestinal cancer cells were fractionated by polacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The Gold carcinoembryonic antigen was found in a region of the gels different from that of the skin reactive antigen.
https://openalex.org/W1532674655,"Abstract The time course of chorionic gonadotropin stimulation of nuclear basic and acidic protein biosynthesis, phosphorylation, and acetylation as well as DNA biosynthesis in ovaries of immature rats has been investigated. After injection of radioactive precursor and chorionic gonadotropin into immature rats, ovarian histone fractions F1, F2a1, F2a2, F2b, and F3 were isolated by selective acid extraction. Acidic protein fractions AP1 and AP2 were extracted with 4 m CsCl at pH 11.6 and 14, and were separated from DNA by equilibrium density centrifugation. Histones, acidic proteins, and DNA were purified by Sephadex chromatography. Chorionic gonadotropin was demonstrated to accelerate the incorporation of [3H]lysine into nuclear acidic protein fraction AP1 and into histones F2a1, F2a2, and F3 within 10 min following a single injection of the hormone. Increased rates of phosphorylation of histones F1 and F2a1 and acidic proteins AP1 and AP2, as well as increased rates of acetylation of histone F2a1 and acidic protein AP2, were also observed within 10 min following gonadotropin injection. Stimulation of DNA, histones F1 and F2b and acidic protein AP2 biosynthesis lagged and was not observed until 30 to 180 min after hormone administration. A similarly delayed response to hormonal stimulation was observed when phosphorylation and acetylation of histones F2a2 and F3 were studied. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide administration abolished gonadotropin-stimulated biosynthesis but not phosphorylation and acetylation of histones and acidic proteins. This indicates that hormonally stimulated modification of nuclear proteins by acetylation and phosphorylation was not entirely dependent on protein synthesis. It is suggested that these results would be compatible with the idea that modification of ovarian nuclear protein metabolism is an early event in the action of chorionic gonadotropin."
https://openalex.org/W2025224939,"On a yearly basis, the major source of atmospheric sulfur compounds in and near Salt Lake City, Utah, is industrial. Isotopic studies suggest that the next most important source is bacteriogenic sulfur released by anaerobes from muds. On a seasonal basis, the bacteriogenic source of sulfur compounds may rival the industrial source in importance."
https://openalex.org/W1496287345,"Abstract Trout testis cells at different stages of spermatogenesis were separated by velocity sedimentation on serum albumin gradients at one gravity and identified according to their sedimentation velocities (3.5, 2.8, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.6 Sv) in units of millimeters per hour. DNA determinations showed that (a) the 0.6, 1.0, and 1.5 Sv cells have a haploid DNA content and hence must be spermatids at varying stages of spermiogenesis; (b) the 2.8 and 3.5 Sv cells have a diploid DNA content and must be A, B, or primary spermatocytes. Both the 2.8 and 3.5 Sv cells synthesize DNA actively; however, the 3.5 Sv cells synthesize DNA 2½ times faster than the 2.8 Sv cells. There is very little DNA synthesis in the spermatids. In vivo incorporation of [14C]arginine followed by cell separation and extraction of acid-soluble nuclear proteins for gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicated that histones are present exclusively in the 2.8 and 3.5 Sv cells, while both histones and protamine are present in the 1.5 and 1.0 Sv cells. During the transition from 1.5 to 1.0 Sv cells, most of the histones are lost. In the mature sperm (0.6 Sv) only protamine is found. Most of the histones are synthesized in the 2.8 and 3.5 Sv cells while the protamines are synthesized in the 1.5 and 1.0 Sv cells. During or shortly after synthesis, the protamines are extensively phosphorylated and much later, dephosphorylated. The dephosphorylation of protamine may be important in the condensation of spermatid chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1519952559,"Abstract Hemerythrins have been isolated from muscle, the vascular system, and the coelom of the sipunculid Dendrostomum pyroides. Muscle hemerythrin (myohemerythrin), vascular hemerythrin, and coelomic hemerythrin have been purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and have been partially characterized. The ultraviolet and visible absorption and circular dichroic spectra of myohemerythrin and vascular hemerythrin closely resemble those of the coelomic protein, indicating that these hemerythrins have similar iron sites. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism measurements reveal that the three hemerythrins also have similar secondary structures. In contrast, amino acid analysis shows that the three proteins differ substantially in primary structure. Vascular hemerythrin and coelomic hemerythrin each occur as oligomeric (probably octameric) molecules while myohemerythrin occurs only as a monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1494092598,"Abstract The carboxylation of pyruvate in the absence of acetyl-CoA by sheep kidney pyruvate carboxylase has been demonstrated and the characteristics of the reaction have been investigated. Under optimal conditions, the maximal specific activity for the reaction was 25% of that obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA. The reaction was markedly stimulated by K+, NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+, particularly in the presence of sulfate ions. The specific activity of the enzyme was shown to be dependent upon the enzyme concentration in the assay solution; this was due to a concentration-dependent inactivation of the enzyme on dilution at pH 8.4 in the absence of acetyl-CoA. The addition of acetyl-CoA protected against inactivation on dilution and increased the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Acetyl-CoA induced a substantial decrease in the apparent Km values for bicarbonate and pyruvate without affecting the apparent Km value for MgATP2-. In the presence of acetyl-CoA the enzyme was less dependent on monovalent cations for activity, the apparent Ka values for activating cations were lower and the cation specificity was altered. After taking these factors into account, it was apparent that the activator also greatly increased Vmax. Pyruvate carboxylases isolated from the livers of rats, chickens, and sheep were also shown to catalyze the fixation of H14CO3- in the absence of acetyl-CoA."

The occurrence of this binding molecule, which appears to be a protein, was dependent upon the presence of in vivo estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1491881211,"Abstract Utilizing galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), specifically labeled with tritium at carbon 6 of galactose, as the substrate, activities of galactosylsphingosine galactosyl hydrolase were demonstrated in young adult rat brain. The radioactive reaction product was characterized as galactose. The pH optimum was 4.2 to 4.5. The reaction was linear for at least 5 hours and was proportional to the amount of the enzyme. The enzyme had a Km of 1.1 x 10-5 m. Oleic acid, sodium taurocholate, deoxycholate, and cholate were stimulatory for the activity of galactosylsphingosine galactosyl hydrolase. Tween 20 and Triton X-100 were inhibitory, while Myrj 59 (polyoxyethylene stearate) had no effect. Galactosylceramide was a competitive inhibitor with an inhibitor constant (Ki) of 2.0 x 10-5 m, a finding suggestive of the identity of galactosylsphingosine and galactosylceramide galactosyl hydrolases. These observations suggest that an alternate degradative pathway of brain galactosyl-ceramide through galactosylsphingosine might exist, in addition to the well established major degradative pathway through ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1544741222,"Fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies obtained from patients with inherited storage diseases exhibited the specific lysosomal hydrolase deficiency found in the patient's tissues. Combined thin layer and gas liquid chromatography of the glycosphingolipids isolated from such fibroblasts showed variations in the concentration of the seven glycosphingolipids found in normal fibroblasts, GL-1a, GL-1b, GL-2a, GL-3, GL-4, Gm3, and Gd3. In three diseases in which visceral accumulation of glycosphingolipid has been demonstrated, namely, Fabry's disease, lactosylceramidosis and Gaucher's disease, two to 4-fold elevations of the glycosphingolipids, GL-3, GL-2a, and GL-1a, respectively, were found in the cultured skin fibroblasts. Tracer studies with d-[U-14C]glucose demonstrated negligible catabolism of GL-3 in Fabry cells and GL-1a in Gaucher cells. The rate of synthesis and degradation of other glycosphingolipids appeared normal with the exception of GL-2a which was virtually absent from Fabry fibroblasts. Although the enzyme deficiencies characteristic of ganglioside storage (neuronal) diseases could be demonstrated in fibroblasts, Gm1 ganglioside could not be detected in two strains of fibroblasts from patients with Gm1-gangliosidosis type I. However, in two strains of fibroblasts from patients with Gm2-gangliosidosis type I (Tay-Sachs disease) there was some evidence for the presence of Gm2 and its asialo derivative. Fibroblasts from patients with inherited lipidoses which primarily affect the myelin sheath, such as globoid cell leukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy did not accumulate cerebroside (GL-1b) or sulfatide (GL-1bS) despite the fact that the specific enzyme deficiency could be readily demonstrated. The addition of large amounts of sulfatide to the medium caused storage of sulfatide in normal skin fibroblasts which was rapidly metabolized when the cells were returned to normal medium. In contrast, fibroblasts from patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (with deficient arylsulfatase A activity) ingest but do not metabolize exogenous sulfatide. A marked abnormality of Gm3 and Gd3 catabolism was demonstrated in fibroblasts from three patients with I-cell disease, an unusual genetic disorder in which there is a generalized lysosomal hydrolase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1574562439,"Abstract Highly purified isolated synaptosomal membranes can incorporate radioactive amino acids into trichloroacetic acidinsoluble material, in vitro. This incorporation exhibits maximum efficiency at pH 7.4, in the presence of externally added Na+ and K+. No exogenous Mg2+, amino acids, or energy source are required, since these seem to be present, in sufficient quantities, in the freshly prepared membranes. Like mitochondrial protein synthesis, amino acid incorporation into synaptosomal membranes is almost completely inhibited by chloramphenicol and is insensitive to cycloheximide. Under the same experimental conditions, amino acid incorporation into highly purified whole synaptosomes is also sensitive to chloramphenicol and unaffected by cycloheximide. These results cannot be explained in terms of bacterial or mitochondrial contamination, or both, of membrane or whole synaptosome preparations. An electrophoretic analysis of the nerve ending membranes, following incubation in the presence of radioactive amino acids, shows that only three protein species (molecular weights 80,000, 62,000, and 17,000) appear to be labeled in vitro. All three proteins are localized in the Triton X-100-insoluble portion of the synaptosomal membrane, the so-called complex. The nonjunctional portion of these synaptosomal membranes, as well as nonterminal axonal plasma membranes, are unable to incorporate radioactive amino acids, under our experimental conditions. We conclude that there are two separate and independent structures, within the synaptosome, capable of autonomous, chloramphenicol-sensitive, protein synthesis: the mitochondria and the junctional portion of the synaptosomal membrane. Together they account for all the synthesizing capacity of the intact synaptosome."
https://openalex.org/W1667236271,"Abstract Phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins is studied in mouse sarcoma 180 tumor cells incubated in a nutrient medium with [32P]orthophosphate. Ribosomal proteins are phosphorylated to form phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The pattern of ribosomal protein phosphorylation in mouse sarcoma 180 cells is strikingly similar to that in rabbit reticulocytes in the following respects: (a) The ribosomal phosphoproteins from both cells comigrate when they are fractionated according to their molecular weights by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. It is concluded that the phosphoproteins in these ribosomes have the same molecular weights and are presumably homologous proteins related by evolution. (b) Common differences between the phosphorylation patterns of polysomal and single ribosomes occur in both cells. (c) A polyphosphorylated protein (molecular weight 70,000) is associated with the native 44 S subribosomal particles in both cells. This polyphosphorylated protein is eluted from the 44 S subunits in conditions commonly employed for extraction of initiation factors. These similarities are considered to prove that the phosphoproteins are true ribosome constituents rather than contaminants. Furthermore, the functions of these phosphoryl groups have apparently been retained during mammalian evolution and are not specifically related to differentiation or to neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W1532581148,"Abstract A quantitative study is made of the number and turnover rate of phosphoryl groups in rabbit reticulocyte ribosomal phosphoproteins. Reticulocytes are incubated with [32P]-orthophosphate at 37° in a nutrient medium, and the labeling of ribosomal proteins is compared with the labeling of the precursor γ-phosphoryl group of ATP. Whereas ATP attains a constant specific activity within 30 min, the specific activities of the five most highly labeled ribosomal phosphoproteins continue to increase for 2 hours in an approximately constant ratio. The data for kinetics of specific activity change suggest that ribosomes contain a steady state average of 7 to 11 protein phosphoryl groups, which are distributed among at least five different polypeptide chains, and which turn over at the rate of approximately 3% per min. Polyribosomes and single ribosomes have a strikingly different pattern of protein phosphorylation. At least three of the phosphoproteins in single ribosomes are phosphorylated to a different steady state level than the same protein in polyribosomes. These data suggest that there is no rapid mixing of these classes of ribosomes or of their phosphoproteins and supports previous studies which have shown that single ribosomes in eukaryotes are not participating in the ribosomal subunit-polyribosome cycle of protein synthesis. Furthermore, it is concluded from the kinetic data that polysomal and single ribosomes differ in their conformations, and that their 32P-labeling differences result from this difference in ribosomal conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1621789215,"Acetylation of histones has been observed in both the spermatocytes and spermatids from developing trout testis. In the former cell type, both histone synthesis and extensive acetylation occur, whereas in the spermatids there is histone acetylation, but very little synthesis. The half-life of the histone acetyl groups is approximately 23 hours in the pre-spermatid cells. It is suggested that the acetylation of histones in spermatids may serve a different function from the corresponding modification observed in the earlier testis cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584600781,"Trout testis cells were labeled with [3H]arginine or lysine and inorganic [32P]phosphate. Cells at different stages of spermatogenesis were separated by their differing velocities of sedimentation in serum albumin gradients at one gravity. The basic proteins from each of these cell types were separated and analyzed for radioactivity in starch gels. Most of the histones were synthesized and phosphorylated in diploid cells of sedimentation velocity 2.8 and 3.5; very little synthesis or phosphorylation of histone occurred in the spermatids. Although different rates of histone synthesis and phosphorylation were found in different cell types, the ratios of synthesis to phosphorylation were close to unity in each case. The positive correlation between these and the rates of DNA synthesis suggest that the phosphorylation of histone may be required for the correct binding of histone to DNA. The half-life of phosphate in histones varied from 8 to 13 hours in cells actively synthesizing histones but was very long in protamine stage spermatids. In addition, labeled arginine did not appear in unmodified histone IV until 21 hours after the start of the incorporation suggesting that newly synthesized histone IV may pass through a series of modifications before reaching its final unmodified state. Protamine synthesis begins in spermatid cells at a middle stage of spermiogenesis and the newly synthesized protamine is extensively phosphorylated. The cellular specificity of histone phosphorylation suggests that this process is not required for the progressive loss of histones during the transition of spermatids sedimenting at 1.5 mm per hour to spermatids sedimenting at 1.0 mm per hour."
https://openalex.org/W1901022078,"Abstract Rabbit reticulocyte lysate ribosomes, exposed briefly to pancreatic RNAse and then treated with 0.5 m KCl and puromycin, are converted to ribosomes that carry fragments of globin α and β messenger RNA. These ribosomes support several initiation reactions in the absence of added mRNA including: (a) binding of the initiator tRNA, Met-tRNAf, to the small ribosomal subunit; (b) synthesis of the naturally occurring initial dipeptide, Metf-valine; (c) synthesis of the initial tripeptides for the α and β chains, Metf-valyl-leucine (a) and Metf-valyl-histidine (β). All of these reactions require protein initiation factors, the initiator tRNA, a low Mg++ concentration and GTP. Complete α and β globin chains can be synthesized only when exogenous globin mRNA is added to the system. Thus, lysate ribosomes treated with low levels of RNAse have almost no intact endogenous globin mRNA, but they still retain a significant number of mRNA fragments which contain the initiation region."
https://openalex.org/W2062939782,"The electrophoretic pattern of RNA molecules that are synthesized in vitro in tracheal epithelium from hamsters deficient in vitamin A differs from that of RNA synthesized in normal, pair-fed control hamsters. There is less RNA of low electrophoretic mobility in the epithelial cells deficient in vitamin A. This alteration is reversed after the deficient animals have been treated with vitamin A."
https://openalex.org/W1530937740,"Abstract The kinetic properties of highly purified hepatic l-tryptophan oxygenase have been studied at different hydrogen ion concentrations in the absence and presence of dl-α-methyltryptophan and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. At pH 8.0 plots of velocity versus l-tryptophan concentrations indicate classical hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten kinetics, whereas at pH 6.2 saturation by tryptophan is nonhyperbolic with a marked increase in the [Trp]0.5. This effect of pH is reversible. The tryptophan metabolite, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, is a negative modulator which at pH 7.9 converts saturation of tryptophan oxygenase by tryptophan from hyperbolic to sigmoidal. This regulatory effect is even more marked upon the protonated enzyme. Progressive saturation by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is itself sigmoidal, which is expressed only at higher substrate levels. α-Methyltryptophan increases the apparent affinity of hepatic tryptophan oxygenase for l-tryptophan at pH 6.2, but not at pH 8.0. α-Methyltryptophan, in concentrations where it is neither a substrate nor a competitive inhibitor, antagonizes the inactivation of the enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate. These findings indicate that hepatic tryptophan oxygenase is subject to allosteric regulation. The allosteric modulation of the enzyme activity can be shown with its substrate, l-tryptophan, as well as with positive, α-methyltryptophan, and negative, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, effectors. These allosteric properties of tryptophan oxygenase are strongly affected by the hydrogen ion concentration in the assay medium."

https://openalex.org/W1575269512,"Abstract The denatured diisopropylphosphoryl derivative of subtilisin Amylosacchariticus was digested with chymotrypsin and the peptides resolved by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 50-X2. The 44 peptides obtained in pure form accounted for 259 of the 275 residues in the protein. Sequence studies were performed on some of these peptides. This information combined with that previously obtained from tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides and, in some cases, from comparisons of the sequence to that in subtilisin BPN' has provided enough evidence for the complete amino acid sequence of subtilisin Amylosacchariticus. There are 35 differences in sequence between subtilisins Amylosacchariticus and BPN' with most of these being conservative in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1505727932,"The difference spectra associated with complex formation at pH 7.0 between bacteriophage T4-specific dihydrofolate reductase and the 4-amino folate analogues, aminopterin, methotrexate, and N10-formyl-aminopterin, have features which are similar to the difference spectra obtained for the free compounds in acid versus neutral solutions. These results suggest that oxidized 4-amino-folate compounds bind to T4 H2-folate reductase in the cationic form. This similarity does not extend to the difference spectra for folic acid, H2-folate, or H2-aminopterin. The difference spectra of complex formation between H2-folate and T4 H2-folate reductase show enhanced absorption with peaks at 305 nm and 243 nm, which are characteristics of the absorption spectra of the pteridine moiety of H2-folate. We observed no evidence for protonation of N5 of H2-folate as a result of complex formation. The difference spectrum of the complex between T4 H2-folate reductase and H2-aminopterin, but not T4 H2-folate reductase and aminopterin, is perturbed by the cofactor NADPH. This suggests that the binding site for H2-aminopterin might not be identical with that for aminopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1520746540,"Abstract Addition of Ni2+ to solutions of thiamine pyrophosphate causes shifting and broadening of the proton magnetic resonance signals of the thiamine moiety. The effect of variations of pH and temperature on these changes has been studied. The results indicate an interaction of the metal ion with both the pyrophosphate group and the N-1' atom of the pyrimidine ring. The shift-to-broadening ratio of the signal of the pyrimidine C-6' hydrogen, the ratio of broadening of the signals of the C-2' methyl group and the C-6' hydrogen, and examination of models all suggests that, as in Ni2+-ATP, the ring nitrogen is not a first sphere ligand of the metal ion, but that the interaction probably occurs by a hydrogen bond involving a molecule of water in the first coordination sphere. Unlike the ATP case, with thiamine pyrophosphate there is a strong temperature dependence of the broadening of the C-6' hydrogen signal; this suggests that there is an equilibrium involving folded and forms, with the unfolded structure predominating."
https://openalex.org/W1549788956,"Abstract Neutron small angle scattering experiments were performed on human hemoglobin in various mixtures of H2O and D2O. It was possible to observe the interparticle effect without corrections for resolution and to verify the first minimum and the secondary maximum in accordance with the theoretical scattering curve. The accuracy in determining the radius of gyration has been improved over that determined in previous neutron small angle scattering studies. With respect to hydrogen deuterium exchange it was possible to observe the kinetics of the slow exchanging protons with an accuracy of 30 protons. Finally a new and much more precise method for the determination of particle volumes was developed. With this method the density of the scattering lengths of the solvent was altered by varying its D2O content, and, using a real zero point method, that mixing ratio was determined at which the small angle scattering of the solution vanishes. From the mixing ratio the volume of the nonhydrated hemoglobin was obtained as 84,000 ± 2,000 A3."
https://openalex.org/W1595292062,"Abstract The kinetics of synthesis, assembly, and localization of periplasmic cytochrome c-550 was examined in the gram-negative bacterium, Spirillum itersonii. For this purpose, a disc electrophoresis technique was developed to isolate and quantitate radioactive pigment produced from isotopic tracers of amino acids and iron. The synthesis of heme which was not covalently bonded to protein (NCBP-Heme) was also measured for comparison. Pulse amino acid-labeled cytochrome c-550 entered the periplasmic space with no significant lag. Periplasmic radioactivity did not increase or decrease upon chase, or in the presence of chloramphenicol. A cytoplasmic precursor pool could not be demonstrated. It is concluded that the periplasmic hemoprotein is not a precursor to, or a product of, a membrane-bound or soluble cytoplasmic pigment. Indeed, stable localization seems to occur upon completion of the pigment's polypeptide chain, or within a few seconds thereafter. The initial rate of iron incorporation into periplasmic cytochrome c-550 followed an upward-shaped profile, while uptake of tracer into NCBP-Heme was linear. Addition of chloramphenicol completely blocked further iron incorporation into the protein, but stimulated NCBP-Heme accumulation 1.6-fold. These results suggest that assembly of the pigment is tightly coupled with protein synthesis, whereas prosthetic group synthesis is not. The possibility that cytochrome c-550 might be assembled from a pool of iron-tetrapyrrole precursor was tested using the inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, levulinate. When levulinate and radioactive iron were added simultaneously to cells, uptake of isotope into both cytochrome c-550 and NCBP-Heme was inhibited by over 85%. In contrast, when levulinate was added to cells previously labeled with radioactive iron, isotope uptake into cytochrome c-550 continued unaffected for 15 min, and at a decreasing rate for an additional 45 min. This increase was accompanied by a 20% decrease in previously formed NCBP-Heme which was dependent on protein synthesis. These and other results suggest that c-type cytochromes in this microorganism are assembled from an iron-tetrapyrrole precursor pool. The intracellular concentration of the putative intermediate was estimated to be 10 µm. Upon depletion of the iron-tetrapyrrole precursor pool by exposure to levulinate, no evidence was gained for the continued synthesis of cytochrome c-550 protein. These results suggest that the availability of prosthetic group precursor may influence the production of the cytochrome c-550 protein counterpart."

https://openalex.org/W1583208558,"Abstract The mode of action of phaseolain, a carboxypeptidase from French bean leaves, has been studied on a range of proteins and peptides of varying molecular weights. Critical experiments show that phaseolain contains no contaminant aminopeptidase or endopeptidase activity. Kinetic data on the release of COOH-terminal amino acids from polypeptide substrates showed that residues are released in a strictly sequential manner and that phaseolain will release proline and virtually the whole range of amino acids, with the possible exception of aspartic acid. Glutamic acid and glycine are released only slowly. The enzyme unexpectedly released glycinamide from the terminal position of oxytocin but did not release amidated residues from the termini of other peptides tested. The rate of release of COOH-terminal residues from N-benzyloxycarbonyl(Cbz)dipeptide substrates by phaseolain depends in part upon the nature of the COOH-terminal residue, a long chain aliphatic residue being preferred, but more particularly on the nature of the penultimate residue, where an aromatic residue greatly enhances enzyme action. Initial rates of release of leucine from N-Cbz-Phe-Leu are some 400-fold greater than from N-Cbz-Ile-Leu; similarly, proline is readily released from N-Cbz-Tyr-Pro, but is not released from N-Cbz-Gly-Pro under the experimental conditions used. Comparison of kinetic data for two substrates, N-Cbz-Phe-Leu and N-Cbz-Gly-Leu, indicate that the 40-fold difference in initial rate of leucine release by phaseolain (at 0.9 mm substrate) is not so much a consequence of large differences in affinity of enzyme for substrate (Km values are 1.22 ± 0.06 mm and 3.75 ± 0.80 mm, respectively) but is related more to the efficiency of catalysis (Vmax values, 0.82 ± 0.02 and 0.11 ± 0.01, respectively). Conversely, with N-acetyl-Gly-Leu as substrate, alteration of the blocking group hardly affects Vmax values (0.090 ± 0.001 for N-acetyl-Gly-Leu compared with 0.11 ± 0.01 for N-Cbz-Gly-Leu), whereas the lack of affinity of enzyme for the acetylated dipeptide is reflected in a very high Km value of 58.1 ± 0.5 mm. 3-Phenylpropionic acid is a competitive inhibitor of phaseolain (Ki = 1.78 mm with N-Cbz-Phe-Leu as substrate). Although there is general agreement between kinetic data obtained for polypeptide and N-blocked dipeptide substrates, there are differences, notably the very marked inhibitory effect of a penultimate threonine residue on release of leucine (a favorable COOH-terminal residue) from N-Cbz-Thr-Leu, whereas proline (relatively unfavorable COOH-terminal residue) is readily released from the COOH-terminal region of insulin B chain (partial sequence Tyr-Thr-Pro-Lys-Ala)."
https://openalex.org/W2075295989,"L cells, a family of continuous cell lines of mouse fibroblastic origin, generate a prolonged active membrane hyperpolarization (the hyperpolarizing activation response) when stimulated mechanically or electrically. lontophoretically applied acetylcholine elicits a similar response; atropine blocks the acetylcholine but not the electrically or mechanically elicited responses. The hyperpolarizing activation response can also be elicited by electrical, mechanical, or acetylcholine stimulation of cells adjacent to the recorded cell. Propagation of the response from one cell to another is not dependent on direct electrical coupling between cells and is not blocked by application of a bath containing atropine or curare. These results show that L cells are capable of generating an active electrical response. that they are sensitive to at least one neurotransmitter (acetylcholine), and that humorally mediated interaction (probably noncholinergic) between L cells occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2096322881,"Abstract Binding for testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, estradiol-17β, and progesterone by the 105,000 x g supernatant fraction of homogenates of rat skin was demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis. The binding ability was pH-dependent (maximum binding for 5α-dihydrotestosterone at pH 7.5) and was destroyed after heating at 60° for 5 min. The content of soluble proteins in rat skin was found to increase and decrease cyclically with the growing (anagen), transition (catagen), and resting (telogen) phases of the hair cycle, and in anagen the content was about twice that in telogen. Binding for testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol-17β also fluctuated cyclically. Maximum binding for testosterone was in catagen, and for 5α-dihydrotestosterone and estradiol-17β in telogen. Minimum binding for both androgens was in mid-anagen, whereas for estradiol-17β was in late telogen or early anagen. Binding for progesterone was demonstrable but did not show remarkable variation. Gel filtration through Sephadex G-200 estimated the molecular weight of the binding protein for 5α-dihydrotestosterone at about 9 x 104, while that for estradiol-17β was about 5 x 104."

https://openalex.org/W1587909619,"Abstract The metabolism of a histidine load after the differential induction of the hepatic histidine catabolic enzymes, histidase, and cytosolic histidine-pyruvate aminotransferase, and the functional significance of these inductions, has been studied in the intact rat and in the isolated perfused rat liver. Histidase was induced by feeding an 80% casein diet, while the aminotransferase (as well as histidase) was induced by injecting a combination of glucagon and cortisol for several days. The rate of 14CO2 production after a loading dose of 750 mg of histidine containing [U-14C]histidine was approximately 6 times greater in rats that had been previously treated with a high protein diet or hormones than in control rats fed a 9% casein diet. Concomitant with this increased oxidation, liver, plasma, and muscle histidine concentrations returned to normal within 6 to 9 hours in the experimental rats, while still remaining elevated at 12 hours in the controls. Urinary excretion of imidazolepyruvate increased 6-fold in rats previously treated with hormones, while the plasma (especially) and liver pools of this metabolite increased significantly within 2 hours after feeding histidine, but returned to normal by 9 hours. Muscle imidazolepyruvate showed a slight, but insignificant increase after 6 hours. A high correlation was observed among histidase activity, the amount of histidine removed from the perfusate and 14CO2 production from [U-14C]histidine, in liver perfusion experiments in which the liver was presented with a large load of histidine (520 mg/100 ml of perfusate). In addition, the accumulation of imidazolepyruvate in the perfusate closely paralleled the aminotransferase activity. In the isolated perfused liver, disappearance of histidine from the perfusate and 14CO2 production from histidine were also dependent on the concentration of histidine. These results indicate that the metabolism of histidine is dependent on the pathway induced. In addition, the enzyme inductions occurring as a result of prior dietary or hormonal treatment are functionally significant, and represent adaptive responses that are important since the capacity of the normal metabolic machinery to respond to a substrate load is limited."
https://openalex.org/W1606618651,"Abstract A discrete proton magnetic resonance signal is observed for the amino protons of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine in water from pH 0 to pH 9; the integrated area of this signal is indicative of only two protons, confirming that the NH2 group is not the site of protonation of the aminopyrimidine moiety. The chemical shift of the (C-4') —NH2 signal is pH dependent, changing approximately 1.6 ppm over the range pH 0 to pH 7. A plot of chemical shift versus pH describes a curve with an inflection point at pH 5, corresponding to the pK1 for protonation of the pyrimidine moiety. The chemical shifts of all the other signals in the spectrum of thiamine are affected much less by pH changes, but all, like the (C-4')—NH2 signal, show a linear dependence on the fraction of thiamine in the protonated form. In addition, the line width of the amino signal is pH dependent, and a detailed study of changes in line width under various conditions suggest three mechanisms of exchange of the NH2 protons: (a) specific acidic catalysis, K30°h+ = 6.8 x 102 m-1 sec-1; (b) general acid-base catalysis, K30°thiamine = 1.8 x 102 m-1 sec-1; K30°acetate = 3.3 x 102 m-1 sec-1; (c) specific basic catalysis, K30°oh- = 1.6 x 108 m-1 sec -1. The energy of activation of the amino proton exchange was found to be similar for specific catalysis by H+ and OH-, and general acid-base catalysis by thiamine and by acetate; Ea = 12.5 to 12.9 Kcal per mole. The changes in width of the water signal were qualitatively similar to those of the thiamine (C-4')—NH2 signal. H-D exchange at the C-2 atom of the thiazolium ring proceeds approximately 10 times faster in the case of thiamine than in the case of oxythiamine, over the range of pH 3 to 6. The pK1 value for thiamine is lowered approximately 0.5 unit by complex formation with tryptophol in 50% methanol-water. Determination of apparent association constant for the 1:1 complex from potentiometric titration data (ΔpK) agreed with the value calculated from proton magnetic resonance data (Δδ), Kassoc = 1.5 m-1."
https://openalex.org/W1547909274,"Abstract The oxygen polarograph was used to follow prostaglandin oxidation by rat liver mitochondria. This system exhibits an absolute requirement for exogenous carnitine and ATP, in contrast to the oxidation of prostanoyl carnitine which is stimulated by ADP in a very similar manner to palmityl carnitine. Prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F1α, prostaglandin F2α, prostaglandin A2, and 15-dehydroprostaglandin E2 exhibited ADP:O ratios in the range of 1.3 to 2.0, which is typical of normal fatty acids. Our data thus indicate that prostaglandins utilize the common carnitine-dependent system for the β oxidation of long chain fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1534561410,"Abstract The importance of allosteric activation of phosphorylase b in comparison to covalent modification of this enzyme was studied in a muscle fraction containing a protein-glycogen complex and elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The 1-N-oxide derivative was substituted for AMP in order to avoid degradation by AMP deaminase which contaminates the complex. The maximum velocity of phosphorylase b, bound to the complex, is approximately 3-fold lower than that of the crystallized enzyme, whereas the Ka is essentially unchanged. The integration of phosphorylase into the complex does not hinder binding of the nucleotide since both the purified and the complexed enzyme react at the same rate with a thioether analog of AMP (6-purine-5'-ribonucleotide 5-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) thioether) which covalently links the AMP moiety to the enzyme. After removal of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles following α-amylase digestion of the glycogen, the AMP 1-N-oxide activation of phosphorylase b was still suppressed since a 20-fold dilution resulted in an approximately 6-fold increase in specific activity. Phosphorylase phosphatase activity was not inhibited by AMP 1-N-oxide in either the protein-glycogen complex or the α-amylase-treated supernatant. However, a high dilution of both fractions causes the phosphatase reaction to become sensitive to nucleotide inhibition. The specific activity of phosphorylase a in the protein-glycogen complex was determined by measuring the production of glycolytic intermediates accumulating as fructose-1,6-diP and triosephosphates. This activity was the same as was found with the purified enzyme under approximately identical assay conditions. It is concluded that some components of the complex suppress nucleotide activation of phosphorylase a and b probably by preventing the conformation change that results from the binding of nucleotides to the purified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1546702065,"Two methods are presented for computing the concentration of a species at sedimentation equilibrium as a function of radial distance, for systems wherein the species is involved in a set of chemical equilibria. The treatments are exemplified with a system involving a polymerizing acceptor and a series of acceptor-ligand complexes. It is shown that analytical expressions are available for the computation of exact distributions even in cases where volume changes accompany the several interactions, provided the activity coefficient of each species is taken as unity. This aspect of the work extends previously reported simulation procedures pertaining to simple interacting systems considered thermodynamically ideal. Secondly, a numerical integration procedure is presented for the solution of cases where both volume changes and non-ideality effects operate. The potential use of computer-simulated sedimentation equilibrium distributions is illustrated in relation to experimental results obtained with interacting mixtures of lysozyme (monomer and dimer) and N-acetylglucosamine at pH 8.0, Γ/2 = 0.15, and 15°. First, it is shown that the apparent weight average molecular weight approaches that of the monomer-inhibitor complex at saturating concentrations of the inhibitor, behavior consistent with the effective loss of binding sites on dimer formation. Further analysis involves the direct comparison of simulated distributions with those obtained experimentally using different inhibitor concentrations. The results indicate that the monomeric and dimeric forms of lysozyme bear one binding site with essentially identical affinity for the inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1519931171,"Abstract The conformation of the native and high temperature forms of two κ and two λ Bence-Jones proteins have been examined by fluorescence and circular dichroism at pH values where the proteins do not precipitate, i.e. pH 6.5 and 4.0 in 0.01 m NaCl. Tryptophanyl fluorescence is completely quenched (Q l 0.002) and strongly quenched (Q ∼ 0.01) in the κ and λ proteins, respectively. For both classes of proteins, tryptophanyl fluorescence is normalized at pH 6.5 between 55 and 65°. At pH 4.0, only the λ proteins showed a significant downward shift of their thermal transition curves. Bence-Jones proteins undergo corresponding thermal transitions when observed by circular dichroism in the region of the peptide chromophore. In the 200- to 215-nm region, the negative ellipticity of both classes of proteins increases, whereas, between 215- to 240-nm only the κ proteins increase. Analysis of the high temperature circular dichroic spectra of the κ proteins suggests that about one-third of the peptide bonds are in β structures, and very few if any are in α helices. The markedly greater precipitability observed for the κ compared with the λ proteins may be related to the enhancement in β structure in the κ proteins at high temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1519392215,"Abstract The pH dependence of the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of l-tryptophan methyl ester in H2O and D2O and of d-tryptophan methyl ester was determined by spectroscopic means (kcat, Km and kcat/Km). No product inhibition or substrate activation was observed. The kinetic parameters of the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of l-tyrosine p-nitrophenyl ester were also determined. Values of kcat for both the tyrosine and tryptophan derivatives depend on the ionization of the amino group. For the tryptophan derivatives which were investigated in most detail, the pH dependence of kcat/Km ( = k2/Ks) yields a bell-shaped curve with a maximum at pH 7.2. The deuterium oxide kinetic solvent isotope effect and the dependency of the reaction on a base of pK ∼ 7 for the l derivative are comparable to that seen with the corresponding acylamino derivative. Thus, the mechanism of hydrolysis of the amino acid esters appear to be the same as that for the acylamino acid esters. However, the ionizability of the α-amino group in the former produces a markedly different pH dependency of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, which can be attributed to the presence of a protonated and unprotonated substrate. The protonated substrate is about 20-fold faster than the unprotonated substrate in both acylation and deacylation of l-tryptophan methyl ester. Full specificity of the enzyme (l over d) is found for l-tryptophan methyl ester in its protonated form. This may be due to a hydrogen bond between the substrate and the enzyme with very strict orientational requirements."

Labeled cholestan-7α,8α-epoxy-3β-ol, cholestane-3β,7β,8α-triol, cholest-8-ene-3β,7ξ-diols, cholestane-3β,7α,8α-triol, cholestane-3β,-8α-diol-7-one, and cholest-8(14)-ene-3β,7α-diol have been synthesized. All these compounds, but cholestane-3β,7α,8α-triol, are efficiently transformed to cholesterol under oxygen atmosphere. However, they cannot be considered as obligatory intermediates in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from cholest-7-en-3β-ol since under anaerobiosis they are transformed to cholest-7-en-3β-ol. The implications of these findings and the mechanisms involved are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1574516058,"Abstract The nucleoside phosphotransferase of carrot, prepared as a homogeneous protein, has a molecular weight of about 44,000. The amino acid analysis of the protein showed it to contain a single residue of histidine and no tyrosine. The amino terminus was identified as aspartic acid; glycine and serine probably represented the carboxyl termini. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was found as pI = 4.1. The treatment of the enzyme with guanidine hydrochloride or sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in preparations with about ½ of the molecular weight of the native protein. Following treatment with urea, the enzyme preparations could be separated by electrofocusing into two subunits. Subunit A had pI = 4.6; Subunit B, pI = 5.1. These subunits showed substantial differences in their amino acid composition. Inactivation studies performed at high pH indicated the formation of several species of inactive aggregates which was prevented by the presence of a strong reducing agent. The results of the treatment of the enzyme with a number of site-specific reagents implicated the single histidine residue as being involved in the phosphotransferase function. The existence of a phosphorylated protein intermediate in the transfer reaction was rendered unlikely."
