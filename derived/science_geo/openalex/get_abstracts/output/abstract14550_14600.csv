https://openalex.org/W1975417880,"In 2 M NaCl, histones H2b, H2a, H3, and H4 form a heterotypic tetrameric complex made up of one chain of each histone. This complex has been analyzed by hydrodynamic techniques. It is indistinguishable from histones in chromatin by its resistance to trypsin, pattern of reactivity with 125I. and ability to form specific crosslinked products after treatment with formaldehyde. It is proposed that this complex is responsible for protecting the small DNA fragments produced by exhausting nuclease digestion of nuclei and that on the average two of these complexes protect the larger 180-200 base pair unit produced by partial treatment of nuclei with nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2079518472,"The dark focus of accommodation for an individual observer correlates highly with the magnitude of night, empty field, and instrument myopia. These anomalous myopias are interpreted as resulting from the passive return of accommodation to an individually determined intermediate dark focus when the stimulus for accommodation is degraded or absent, or when the need for accommodation is eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W2051472355,"Male house mice paired with a normal female for 1 week do not have higher plasma testosterone levels than do males that remain in all-male groups, but paired males have markedly elevated testosterone levels 30 to 60 minutes after the resident female is replaced by another female. Elevation of testosterone levels in these males is similar to that in isolated males paired with a female, does not depend on copulation with the strange female, occurs under housing conditions that permit continuous exposure to the odors of other females and males, and does not occur when the resident female is replaced by another male for 30 to 60 minutes. The elevation thus appears to be a specific endocrine response to an encounter with a strange female. These results, along with previous findings suggesting that strange males affect endocrine function in females, indicate that bisexual encounters are likely to produce endocrine changes in members of both sexes."

https://openalex.org/W2002367813,"In bright daylight, and at best viewing distances, the bottlenosed dolphin resolves visual gratings approximately equally well in air and in water. Aerial resolution improves with increased viewing distance, while underwater resolution improves with decreased viewing distance. The double-slit pipil overcomes the gross myopia in air measured by ophthalmoscope and produces the indicated effects of viewing distance."
https://openalex.org/W1974943857,Rabbits were conditioned to avoid shock signaled by a tone. A second tone was randomly interspersed but did not signal shock. Neuronal activity 5 to 40 milliseconds after tone onset was greater to the shock-signaling tone than to the other tone. This difference reversed when the signal value of the tones was reversed.

This behavior furnishes a social group with sufficient information for simultaneous and successive disrciminations between leaders and between goals."
https://openalex.org/W2012326758,"A substantial portion of the hnRNA of mouse L cells contains internal residues of N6-methyl adenylate and blocked 5' terminal sequences which are apparently of the type m7G5' ppp5' YmpZp..., in which 7-methyl guanosine is joined by a 5'-5' pyrophosphate linkage to a 2'-0-methylated residue, Ym. These sequences are indistinguishable from those comprising one of the two classes of blocked 5' sequences found in mRNA, and are quite distinct from those comprising the other class. The remarkable similarity in 5' terminal methylated sequences of hnRNA and a major fraction of mRNA appears to extend even to the relative occurrence of each of the four 2'-0-methylated species in position Ym."

https://openalex.org/W1985899147,"The origin of a low molecular weight virus-associated RNA (VA-RNA) was mapped by hybridization of VA-RNA to specific fragments of adenovirus type 2 DNA, obtained after cleavage with three different restriction endonucleases. VA-RNA was found to hybridize exclusively to the I-strand [strand with low buoyant density in CsCI when complexed with poly(U, G)] of a segment of the viral DNA which is located between positions 0.27 and 0.32 on the unit map of the adenovirus type 2 genome."

Infants consistently located and stared at the white bar unless it closely matched the screen in intensity. They also stared at all intensities of the red bar, presumptively including the red-white brightness match, and hence must have some form of color vision."
https://openalex.org/W2069002190,"Extracts prepared from HeLa cells contain an enzymatic activity which cleaves m7G(5′)ppp(5′)Gm to m7pG and ppGm. The activity exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity and does not cleave G(5′)ppp(5′)G or the ring opened derivative of m7GpppGm which has lost the positive charge from the N7 position of m7G. m7GpppGm as the 5′ terminal structure of intact reovirus mRNA is resistant to attack by the pyrophosphatase activity, but becomes partially sensitive in the 5′ terminal fragment consisting of 7–10 nucleotides derived from the same mRNA by T1 RNAase digestion. m7G(5′)ppp(5′)GmpCp is completely sensitive to cleavage resulting in the release of m7pG without generation of m7GpppGm as an intermediate. These results establish the existence of a 7-methyl guanosine specific pyrophosphatase activity in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1553897225,"Precise oxygen equilibrium curves of human adult hemoglobin were determined by the automatic recording method at several temperatures in the presence and absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) or inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) with 0.05 M 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2''-nitrolotriethanol (bis-tris) buffers (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M Cl-. The equilibrium data were analyzed according to the Adair scheme, and the heats, deltaHi (i = 1,2,3,4) and the entropy changes, deltaSi (i = 1,2,3,4), for the individual oxygenation steps were obtained. The shape of the equilibrium curve varies on temperature changes whether DPG or IHP is present or absent. In consequence, the deltaHi value depends on i and on the presence of DPG and IHP. Behavior of deltaSi is similar to that of deltaHi. The similar behavior of deltaHi and deltaSi resulted in a compensation phenomenon. The contribution of T cdeltaSi to the free energy change is compensated by the contribution of deltaHi at the first three oxygenation steps but not at the fourth step, and for i = 1,2, and 3 changes of T cdeltaSi value upon the addition of DPG and IHP are compensated by accompanied changes of deltaHi value, where T c (= 260 K) is the compensation temperature. A major part of both the enthalpy-entropy compensation and nonuniformity of deltaHi and deltaSi appears to be attributable to contributions of the oxygen-linked binding of Cl-, DPG and IHP, by hemoglobin. The present results do not necessarily support the earlier idea of Wyman that the cooperative oxygenbinding is essentially an entropy effect."
https://openalex.org/W2053911294,"After hamsters had breathed fresh cigarette smoke in a miniature chamber, airways of the lung showed recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Exposure to particles alone by removal of the vapor phase with charcoal did not change the leukocyte response. However, exposure to cigarette smoke vapor after removal of particles with Cambridge filters did not recruit leukocytes but produced nuclear and cytoplasmic vacuoles, double nuclei, and exfoliation of cells."

https://openalex.org/W2021940030,"An attempt has been made to measure the frequency of mutations throughout the lifespan of human fibroblast strain MRC-5. A novel procedure has been used which involves staining individual cells for high levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Evidence is presented that this phenotype is due to mutation. The frequency of variants was scored from passage 16 until the final phase of senescence (passage 60). There is an exponential increase of stained cells throughout this period. The results are in agreement with the general error theory, which proposes that aging is due to a breakdown in the fidelity of information transfer between macromolecules."

The latter finding is contrary to predictions based on their advanced position in phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W2008751175,"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the odor-causing agent (or agents) present in the urines of humans after they have eaten asparagus. S-Methyl thioacrylate and S-methyl 3-(methylthio)thiopropionate were identified from methylene chloride extracts of such urines and appear to be the odor-causing compounds. Methanethiol, the previously reported odor-causing agent, was not detected in these methylene chloride extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2012592464,"The early 32- to 64-cell stage of the sea urchin embryo consists of three cell types, easily distinguishable by size: micromeres, mesomeres, and macromeres. Only the micromeres are migratory. Treatment of dissociated sea urchin embryo cells with fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A (Con A) revealed a Con A-induced highly clustered or capped distribution of receptor sites on the micromeres. Concanavalin A did not induce significant clustering or capping of receptor sites on the mesomeres or macromeres. The results indicate that Con A receptor sites are more mobile on specific population of malignant-like migratory embryonic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056268570,"Although crustacean tissue cholesterol content is high, Crustacea, like other arthropods; are incapable of cholesterol synthesis, and presumably are dependent for maintaining tissue cholesterol stores on the intestinal absorption of ingested sterol. A detergent, N-(N-dodecanoylsarcosyl)taurine, representative of a set of detergents synthesized by the crustacean hepatopancreas and secreted into the intestine, is capable of efficient cholesterol solubilization, and thus of promoting sterol absorption."

https://openalex.org/W1511631019,"Abstract Rapid sequence measures of changes in the rate of 14CO2 production from [14C]glucose bathing the cells was abruptly reduced from 20 to 4 microunits/ml. Interpretation of the data in terms of glucose transport was based on calibration experiments that described the time course of change in 14CO2 production when [14C]glucose entry into adipocytes was slowed by reducing the specific activity of [14C]glucose in the incubation medium. All experiments were performed at 37 degrees in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4. Termination of the glucose transport action of insulin (which includes insulin-receptor disassociation and all other steps leading to decelerated glucose entry) began within 2 min and was complete within 30 min. The transition from one steady state rate of glucose transport to the other could be approximated by an exponential process occurring with a half-time of 14 min. For comparison, the time course of initiation of the glucose transport action of insulin was measured under the same conditions. The transition curve was virtually identical."

Larval and pupal stages of the parasitoid were susceptible. Off-target effects on natural enemies may seriously limit the use of juvenile hormone analogs, especially in integrated control programs."
https://openalex.org/W2068934694,Behavioral observations have suggested that the function of foreign synapses on goldfish extraocular muscles can be repressed after reinnervation by the original nerve without any ultrastructural alterations. The present experiments demonstrate that even after behavioral repression foreign synapses are physiologically functional and that the original and foreign nerves can simultaneously innervate goldfish extraocular muscles.
https://openalex.org/W2024164456,"The role of the neural tube in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy was tested directly. Neural tubes from chicken embryos with hereditary muscular dystrophy and from genetically normal embryos were transplanted into normal recipient embryos. Dystrophic neural tissue induced in muscles of normal hosts high thymidine kinase activity characteristic of dystrophic muscle; normal neural tubes did not. We propose an early inductive effect of the neural tube on the presumptive myoblasts that sets their subsequent course of development, either normal or dystrophic."

More than 20 times this many would be expected if the population consisted of a single panmictic unit. Despite hybridization, natural selection appears to maintain the essential integrity of each separate gene pool."

https://openalex.org/W1996622340,Freeze-etching of never-dried pellicles or of incubated suspensions of both Acetobacter xylinum and Acetobacter acetigenum show a nascent form of the cellulose microfibril which has a core surrounded by an amorphous sheath. Drying of the pellicle or suspension reduces the diameter of the sheath and changes the form of the microfibril to the one usually seen. This nascent form of the cellulose microfibril is consistent with previous postulations of an intermediate polymer or polymers in the biosynthesis of cellulose.

There was no significant variation in density of these anastomoses between body and flipper skin. These observations suggest that arteriovenous anastomoses are important in thermoregulation in the Weddell seal, particularly as heat dissipating structures when the animal is out of the water, and that the entire body surface is involved rather than specific regions such as the flippers."

https://openalex.org/W2001705300,"During natural movements, the motoneurons innervating a single muscle have different patterns of activity that are correlated with differences in synaptic input. The caudal abducens motoneurons fire phasically in synchronous bursts before rapid posterior eye movements; the rostral abducens motoneurons fire only tonically when the eye is fixed or moving slowly. This physiological difference is not related to motoneuron size. In this respect the abducens motoneurons violate the ""size principle"" that has been advanced for spinal motoneurons. The difference is probably related to the present finding that the caudal but not the rostral cells receive numerous electrical synapses that are known to have a role in synchronizing phasic activity."
