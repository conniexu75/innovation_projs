https://openalex.org/W3203496375,"Current computational workflows for comparative analyses of single-cell datasets typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance among experimental conditions. However, clusters do not always provide the appropriate resolution and cannot capture continuous trajectories. Here we present Milo, a scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighborhoods on a k-nearest neighbor graph. Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell–cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq. Milo is provided as an open-source R software package at https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR . Milo identifies differentially abundant populations of cells in scRNA-seq data without clustering."
https://openalex.org/W3202060848,"Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) long read sequencers offer access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6% and 8% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods."
https://openalex.org/W3202536610,"Abstract Mutation accumulation in somatic cells contributes to cancer development and is proposed as a cause of aging. DNA polymerases Pol ε and Pol δ replicate DNA during cell division. However, in some cancers, defective proofreading due to acquired POLE / POLD1 exonuclease domain mutations causes markedly elevated somatic mutation burdens with distinctive mutational signatures. Germline POLE / POLD1 mutations cause familial cancer predisposition. Here, we sequenced normal tissue and tumor DNA from individuals with germline POLE / POLD1 mutations. Increased mutation burdens with characteristic mutational signatures were found in normal adult somatic cell types, during early embryogenesis and in sperm. Thus human physiology can tolerate ubiquitously elevated mutation burdens. Except for increased cancer risk, individuals with germline POLE / POLD1 mutations do not exhibit overt features of premature aging. These results do not support a model in which all features of aging are attributable to widespread cell malfunction directly resulting from somatic mutation burdens accrued during life."
https://openalex.org/W3204844755,"Given the rapid increased in confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related mortality, it is important to identify vulnerable patients. Immunocompromised status is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality.The groups' baseline characteristics were balanced using a propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the risks of in-hospital mortality and other outcomes according to immunocompromised status using a multivariable logistic regression model. We identified immunocompromised status based on a diagnosis of malignancy or HIV/AIDS, having undergone organ transplantation within 3 years, prescriptions for corticosteroids or oral immunosuppressants for ≥30 days, and at least one prescription for non-oral immunosuppressants during the last year.The 6,435 COVID-19 patients (≥18 years) included 871 immunocompromised (13.5%) and 5,564 non-immunocompromised (86.5%). Immunocompromised COVID-19 patients were older (60.1±16.4 years vs. 47.1±18.7 years, absolute standardized mean difference: 0.738). The immunocompromised group had more comorbidities, a higher Charlson comorbidity index, and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (9.6% vs. 2.3%; p < .001). The immunocompromised group still had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate after inverse probability of treatment weighting (6.4% vs. 2.0%, p < .001). Multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline imbalances revealed that immunocompromised status was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.62-2.68, p < .001).Immunocompromised status among COVID-19 patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3203460720,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world radically since 2020. Spain was one of the European countries with the highest incidence during the first wave. As a part of a consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, we sequenced 2,170 samples, diagnosed mostly before lockdown measures. Here, we identified at least 500 introductions from multiple international sources and documented the early rise of two dominant Spanish epidemic clades (SECs), probably amplified by superspreading events. Both SECs were related closely to the initial Asian variants of SARS-CoV-2 and spread widely across Spain. We inferred a substantial reduction in the effective reproductive number of both SECs due to public-health interventions (Re < 1), also reflected in the replacement of SECs by a new variant over the summer of 2020. In summary, we reveal a notable difference in the initial genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain compared with other European countries and show evidence to support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread, even for the most successful genetic variants."
https://openalex.org/W3204291373,"Online education, including college English education, has been developing rapidly in the recent decade in China. Such aspects as e-readiness, benefits and challenges of online education were well-researched under normal situations, but fully online language teaching on a large-scale in emergencies may tell a different story. A survey of 2310 non-English-major college students and 149 English teachers from three types of twelve higher education institutions in Wuhan was conducted to evaluate their readiness for online English education during the COVID-19 pandemic, to figure out challenges encountered by them and to draw implications for future online college English education. Quantitative statistics gathered using two readiness scales adapted from previous studies showed that both cohorts were slightly below the ready level for the unexpected online transition of college English education. The overall level of readiness for students was 3.68 out of a score of 5, and that for teachers was 3.70. Individual differences were explored and reported. An analysis of qualitative results summarized six categories of challenges encountered by the students, i.e. technical challenges, challenges concerning learning process, learning environment, self-control, efficiency and effectiveness, and health concern. Though the students reported the highest level of readiness in technology access, they were most troubled by technical problems during online study. For teachers, among three types of challenges, they were most frustrated by pedagogical ones, especially students' disengagement in online class. The survey brought insights for online college English education development. Institutions should take the initiative and continue promoting the development of online college English education, because a majority of the respondents reported their willingness and intention to continue learning/teaching English in online or blended courses in the post-pandemic period. They are supposed to remove technical barriers for teachers and students, and assess the readiness levels of both cohorts before launching English courses online. Institutions should also arrange proper training for instructors involved, especially about pedagogical issues. Language teachers are suggested to pay special attention to students' engagement and communication in online courses."
https://openalex.org/W3202000592,"The COVID-19 global incidence rate among young adults (age 19–40) drastically increased since summer 2020, and young adults were often portrayed by popular media as the ""main spreader"" of the pandemic. However, young adults faced unique challenges during the pandemic due to working in high-risk, low-paying essential service occupations, as well as having higher levels of financial insecurity and mental burden. This qualitative study aims to examine the attitudes and perceptions of health orders of young adults to better inform public health messaging to reach this demographic and increase compliance to public health orders. A total of 50 young adults residing in British Columbia, Canada, were recruited to participate in focus group in groups of four to six. Focus group discussions were conducted via teleconferencing. Thematic analysis revealed four major themes: 1) risks of contracting the disease, 2) the perceived impact of COVID-19, 3) responsibility of institutions, 4) and effective public health messaging. Contrary to existing literature, our findings suggest young adults feel highly responsible for protecting themselves and others. They face a higher risk of depression and anxiety compared to other age groups, especially when they take on multiple social roles such as caregivers and parents. Our findings suggest young adults face confusion due to inconsistent messaging and are not reached due to the ineffectiveness of existing strategies. We recommend using evidence-based strategies proven to promote behaviour change to address the barriers identified by young adults through tailoring public health messages, specifically by using positive messaging, messaging that considers the context of the intended audiences, and utilizing digital platforms to facilitate two-way communication."
https://openalex.org/W3202097346,"Background Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria present an ever-growing burden in the hospital and community settings. Data on the prevalence of ESBL fecal carriage remain scarce in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae fecal carriage among children under five years in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2017. A total of 269 fecal/rectal swab samples were cultured on MacConkey agar. All positive cultures were characterized by colony morphology, Gram stain, and standard biochemical tests. Further, bacteria identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and phenotypic detection of ESBL production were performed using VITEK 2 Compact as per the instruction of the manufacturer. Socio-demographic and risk factors data were collected using questionnaires. Data were entered by EPI INFO version 7.2.1.0 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Results The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing E . coli and K . pneumoniae was 17.1% (46/269; 95% CI: 12.9%–22.7%). A total of 47 isolates were ESBL-positive, of which, 83.0% were E . coli and 17.0% were K . pneumoniae . ESBL producing E . coli and K . pneumoniae isolates were also showed high levels of MDR (93.6%) and high rates of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, all isolates were carbapenem susceptible. In the risk factors analysis, Children’s mothers who had lower educational level (primary school) (OR: 2.472, 95% CI: 1.323–4.618, P = 0.0062) and children who used tap water for drinking (OR: 1.714, 95% CI: 1.001–3.659, P = 0.048) were found to be significantly associated with higher ESBL fecal carriage. Conclusions In this study, the high prevalence rate of ESBL producing E . coli and K . pneumoniae fecal carriage and high level of multidrug resistance among ESBL producing E . coli and K . pneumoniae were demonstrated. This suggested that the necessity of routine screening of ESBL is crucial for the early detection and appropriate antibiotics selection for infection caused by ESBL producing pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3202507598,"Purpose This study aims to prepare folic acid coated tin oxide nanoparticles (FA-SnO 2 NPs) for specifically targeting human ovarian cancer cells with minimum side effects against normal cells. Methods The prepared FA-SnO 2 NPs were characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis spectroscopy, XRD, SEM and TEM. The inhibition effects of FA-SnO 2 NPs against SKOV3 cancer cell were tested by MTT and LDH assay. Apoptosis induction in FA-SnO 2 NPs treated SKOV3 cells were investigated using Annexin V/PI, AO/EB and Comet assays and the possible mechanisms of the cytotoxic action were studied by Flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, Immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting analyses. The effects of FA-SnO 2 NPs on reactive oxygen species generation in SKOV3 cells were also examined. Additionally, the safety of utilization FA-SnO 2 NPs were studied in vivo using Wister rats. Results The obtained FA-SnO 2 NPs displayed amorphous spherical morphology with an average diameter of 157 nm and a zeta potential value of -24 mV. Comparing to uncoated SnO 2 NPs, FA-SnO 2 NPs had a superior inhibition effect towards SKOV3 cell growth that was suggested to be mediated through higher reactive oxygen species generation. It was showed that FA-SnO 2 NPs increased significantly the % of apoptotic cells in the sub- G1 and G2/M phases with a higher intensity comet nucleus in SKOV3 treated cells. Furthermore, FA-SnO 2 NPs was significantly increased the expression levels of P53, Bax, and cleaved Caspase-3 and accompanied with a significant decrease of Bcl-2 in the treated SKOV3 cells. Conclusion Overall, the results suggested that an increase in cellular FA-SnO 2 NPs internalization resulted in a significant induced cytotoxicity in SKOV3 cancer cells in dose-dependent mode through ROS-mediated cell apoptosis that may have occurred through mitochondrial pathway. Additionally, the results confirmed the safety of utilization FA-SnO 2 NPs against living systems. So, FA-SnO 2 NPs with a specific targeting moiety may be a promising therapeutic candidate for human ovarian cancer."

High-intensity exercise training modalities still controversial in this population. The study aims to preliminary assess the consequences of high-intensity exercise training modalities, aerobic interval training (HIIT) and progressive high circuit-resistance training (CRT), on primarily endothelial function and cardiorespiratory fitness, and secondly on muscle strength and physical performance in heart failure patients. Methods This preliminary multicentric randomized controlled trial comprised 23 heart failure patients, aged 56 ± 10 years old, mainly New York Heart Association classification I and II (%), hemodynamically stable, who compromise at least 36 exercise sessions of a randomly assigned intervention (HIIT, CRT or control group). Endothelial function, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, muscle strength and physical performance were completed at baseline and post-intervention.

https://openalex.org/W3201751398,"Background Low level lasers have been used as an alternative pain relief therapy for muscle and joint pain, since it induces analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and biomodulation effects of the physiological cell functions. The effectiveness of low-level laser therapy in temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) treatment, however, is not well established. Although Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been suggested as a complementary means in TMD diagnosis, the effect of conservative treatments on muscle activity has not yet been thoroughly correlated with (sEMG) findings. Purpose To assess the efficacy of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) as compared to occlusive splint therapy (OST) on the TMJ opening index (TOI) and sEMG of masticatory muscles. Materials and methods 112 female subjects suffering from unilateral myogenous TMD, aged 21–30 years-old, were recruited and divided into three groups: LLLT; soft occlusive splint therapy OST and a waitlist group as controls. Outcome measures TMJ opening index (TOI), Visual analogue scale (VAS), surface electromyography (sEMG). Results A significant reduction was reported in TOI, VAS and the sEMG within the LLLT and OST groups as well as significant decrease in all outcomes between groups in favor of the LLLT group (P&lt; 0.0001). Meanwhile, there was a weak significant difference within the control group probably attributed to the analgesic. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between groups [control vs occlusive splints, control vs low-level laser and low-level laser vs occlusive splints] revealed significant differences in the VAS and TOI [P = 0.0001; 95% CI: 0.9–2.2, 1.61–4.01, 0.65–1.96]. Conclusions Findings support an evident short term therapeutic effect of the LLLT on improving VAS, TOI and sEMG in females suffering from myogenous TMD."
https://openalex.org/W3202728915,"Purpose To investigate the prevalence of dry eye disease (DED) and its associated risk factors among Thai university students. Methods A cross-sectional study using an electronic survey was conducted in two Rajabhat universities in Bangkok, Thailand. The woman’s health study questionnaire was used to determine students with DED. The prevalence of DED along with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Logistic regression model was used to identify the associated risk factors. Results A total of 4,111 university students joined and completed the survey questionnaires. Mean age was 18.8 ± 1.1 years with female predominance (2874 students, 69.91%). Clinically diagnosed DED was reported in 136 students (3.31%), while severe symptoms of eye dryness and irritation were reported in 227 students (5.52%). The prevalence of DED among Thai university students was 8.15% (95% CI 7.33% to 9.02%). History of contact lens use and high screen time (&gt; 8 hours per day) were reported in 868 students (21.11%) and 2101 students (51.11%), respectively. Male gender, contact lens use and high screen time were significantly associated with higher risk of DED with the adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 1.39 (1.09, 1.77), 2.49 (1.96, 3.17), and 1.43 (1.14, 1.80), respectively. Conclusions DED is not rare among Thai university students. Contact lens use and high screen time are two significant modifiable risk factors of DED in our students. These findings can raise awareness of DED in youth population and provide valuable information for public health promotion in university students."
https://openalex.org/W3202050350,"The root system architectures (RSAs) largely decide the phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) of plants by influencing the phosphorus uptake. Very limited information is available on wheat’s RSAs and their deciding factors affecting phosphorus uptake efficiency (PupE) due to difficulties in adopting scoring values used for evaluating root traits. Based on our earlier research experience on nitrogen uptake efficiency screening under, hydroponics and soil-filled pot conditions, a comprehensive study on 182 Indian bread wheat genotypes was carried out under hydroponics with limited P (LP) and non-limiting P (NLP) conditions. The findings revealed a significant genetic variation, root traits correlation, and moderate to high heritability for RSAs traits namely primary root length (PRL), total root length (TRL), total root surface area (TSA), root average diameter (RAD), total root volume (TRV), total root tips (TRT) and total root forks (TRF). In LP, the expressions of TRL, TRV, TSA, TRT and TRF were enhanced while PRL and RAD were diminished. An almost similar pattern of correlations among the RSAs was also observed in both conditions except for RAD. RAD exhibited significant negative correlations with PRL, TRL, TSA, TRT and TRF under LP (r = -0.45, r = -0.35, r = -0.16, r = -0.30, and r = -0.28 respectively). The subclass of TRL, TSA, TRV and TRT representing the 0–0.5 mm diameter had a higher root distribution percentage in LP than NLP. Comparatively wide range of H’ value i.e. 0.43 to 0.97 in LP than NLP indicates that expression pattern of these traits are highly influenced by the level of P. In which, RAD (0.43) expression was reduced in LP, and expressions of TRF (0.91) and TSA (0.97) were significantly enhanced. The principal component analysis for grouping of traits and genotypes over LP and NLP revealed a high PC1 score indicating the presence of non-crossover interactions. Based on the comprehensive P response index value (CPRI value), the top five highly P efficient wheat genotypes namely BW 181, BW 103, BW 104, BW 143 and BW 66, were identified. Considering the future need for developing resource-efficient wheat varieties, these genotypes would serve as valuable genetic sources for improving P efficiency in wheat cultivars. This set of genotypes would also help in understanding the genetic architecture of a complex trait like P use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3202416490,"Molecular variants including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs) and fusions can be detected in the clinical setting using deep targeted sequencing. These assays support low limits of detection using little genomic input material. They are gaining in popularity in clinical laboratories, where sample volumes are limited, and low variant allele fractions may be present. However, data on reproducibility between laboratories is limited. Using a ring study, we evaluated the performance of 7 Ontario laboratories using targeted sequencing panels. All laboratories analysed a series of control and clinical samples for SNVs/CNVs and gene fusions. High concordance was observed across laboratories for measured CNVs and SNVs. Over 97% of SNV calls in clinical samples were detected by all laboratories. Whilst only a single CNV was detected in the clinical samples tested, all laboratories were able to reproducibly report both the variant and copy number. Concordance for information derived from RNA was lower than observed for DNA, due largely to decreased quality metrics associated with the RNA components of the assay, suggesting that the RNA portions of comprehensive NGS assays may be more vulnerable to variations in approach and workflow. Overall the results of this study support the use of the OFA for targeted sequencing for testing of clinical samples and suggest specific internal quality metrics that can be reliable indicators of assay failure. While we believe this evidence can be interpreted to support deep targeted sequencing in general, additional studies should be performed to confirm this."
https://openalex.org/W3203116766,"Background The goal of this study was to determine if IL-22:Fc would Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Summary background data No therapies exist for ARDS and treatment is purely supportive. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays an integral component in recovery of the lung from infection. IL-22:Fc is a recombinant protein with a human FC immunoglobulin that increases the half-life of IL-22. Study design ARDS was induced in C57BL/6 mice with intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 33.3 or 100 ug. In the low-dose LPS group (LDG), IL-22:FC was administered via tail vein injection at 30 minutes (n = 9) and compared to sham (n = 9). In the high-dose LPS group (HDG), IL-22:FC was administered (n = 11) then compared to sham (n = 8). Euthanasia occurred after bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) on post-injury day 4. Results In the LDG, IL-22:FC resulted in decreased protein leak (0.15 vs. 0.25 ug/uL, p = 0.02). BAL protein in animals receiving IL-22:Fc in the HDG was not different. For the HDG, animals receiving IL-22:Fc had lower BAL cell counts (539,636 vs 3,147,556 cells/uL, p = 0.02). For the HDG, IL-6 (110.6 vs. 527.1 pg/mL, p = 0.04), TNF-α (5.87 vs. 25.41 pg/mL, p = 0.04), and G-CSF (95.14 vs. 659.6, p = 0.01) levels were lower in the BAL fluid of IL-22:Fc treated animals compared to sham. Conclusions IL-22:Fc decreases lung inflammation and lung capillary leak in ARDS. IL-22:Fc may be a novel therapy for ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W3204246435,"Background All healthcare workers (HCWs) in Yongin Severance Hospital were allocated to receive the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine according to national policy. A report of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 led to hesitancy about receiving the second dose among HCWs who had received the first dose. Methods From 7 to 14 May, 2021, we performed a survey to identify the factors associated with hesitancy about receiving the second vaccine dose among HCWs at the hospital who had received the first dose of the vaccine. Based on survey results, a hospital-wide campaign was implemented on 18 May 2021 to improve vaccine coverage. HCWs who completed the second dose completed a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the effect of the campaign. Findings Of 1,171 HCWs who had received the first dose of the vaccine, 71.5% completed the online survey, of whom 3.7% refused to take the second dose and 22.3% showed hesitancy. Hesitancy to receive a second dose was significantly associated with age under 30 years and concerns about TTS, and was less common among those who trusted effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Among HCWs who received the first dose, 96.2% completed vaccination with the second dose between 27 May and 4 June, 2021. Of those who answered the questionnaire asked about the timing of their decision to receive the second dose, 57.1% reported that they were motivated by the hospital-wide campaign. Conclusion A tailored intervention strategy based on a survey can improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCWs."
https://openalex.org/W3204481344,"Liver cancer morbidity and mortality rates differ among ethnic groups. In the United States, the burden of liver cancer in Asian Americans (AS) is higher compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). Research on liver cancer health disparities has mainly focused on environmental and socioeconomic factors yet has ignored the genotypic differences among various racial/ethnic groups. This lack of molecular level understanding has hindered the development of personalized medical approaches for liver cancer treatment. To understand the genetic heterogeneity of liver cancer between AS and CA, we performed a systematic analysis of RNA-seq data of AS and CA patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used four differential gene expression analysis packages; DESeq2, limma, edgeR, and Superdelta2, to identify the differentially expressed genes. Our analysis identified cytochrome P450-2D6 enzyme (CYP2D6) as the gene with the greatest differential expression with higher levels in AS compared to CA. To scrutinize the underlying mechanism of CYP2D6, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Cytoscape were conducted and found hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4A) and interleukin-6 (IL6) in direct association with CYP2D6. IL6 is downregulated in AS compared to CA, while HNF4A is not significantly different. Herein, we report that CYP2D6 may serve as a putative biomarker in liver cancer health disparities. Its negative association with IL6 proclaims an intricate relationship between CYP2D6 and inflammation in the ethnic differences seen in AS and CA liver cancer patients. The goal of the present study was to understand how genetic factors may contribute to the interethnic variability of liver cancer prevalence and outcomes in AS and CA patients. Identifying ethnic-specific genes may help ameliorate detection, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatments of liver cancer, as well as reduce disease-related incidence and mortality rates in the vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3201879363,"An experiment on maize (Zea mays)-common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercropping was conducted for two years (2014 and 2016) at two locations in North western Ethiopia with the objective of determining the spatial arrangement and planting date of common bean. Common bean intercropped with maize at three planting dates (simultaneously with maize, at emergence and knee height of maize) in two spatial arrangements (alternate and paired arrangements).The experimental design was factotrial randomized complete block design with three replications. Sole maize and common bean were included as a check. Results revealed that the spatial and temporal differentiation significantly affect only the agronomic attributes of common bean in common bean-maize intercropping. At Adet the grain yield of common bean (1.9 t ha -1 ), LER (1.99) and MAI (357) in maize-common bean intercropping was higher when common bean was planted at the same time with maize in paired planting pattern. On the other hand, maximum LER (1.61) and MAI (2.83) at Finoteselam were observed when common bean was intercropped with maize at maize emergence in paired planting pattern. Simultaneous intercropping of common bean with maize gave more stable total land output yield as compared to other intercropping systems but showed high variability as compared to the sole cropping. Thus, it can be concluded that planting common bean simultaneously with maize in paired planting pattern at Adet and planting common bean at maize emergence at Finoteselam in maize-common bean intercropping gave maximum land use efficiency and profitability of the cropping system without reducing the main crop yield (maize).This research also suggested further research on the compatibility of various maize and common bean varieties in different spatial and temporal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3202169260,"Lengthy hospitalization can impact adolescents’ mental wellbeing in a number of negative ways. Scholarship has indicated that a young patient’s relationships play an important role in reducing the amount of stress felt and in improving emotional state. In this article we turn to the experiences of adolescents with tuberculosis [TB] in Russia to explore how exactly hospitalization together with the TB diagnosis itself impact their mental wellbeing and how relationships with others mediate these impacts. We conducted a qualitative, interview-based study in Tomsk pediatric TB clinic. Interviews were conducted with three groups relevant for reaching the aim of this research: adolescent patients, their adult caregivers, and their treating physicians [17 informants in total]. Interview data were complemented with prolonged observations in the same clinic. The results of our study highlight that threats to mental wellbeing of adolescents with TB are multiple. Adolescents who are about to enter the in-patient treatment feel apprehensive and anxious about their future. They tend to have a hard time accepting their diagnosis, which they often feel is something shameful, and, consequently, may develop a negative attitude towards themselves. Most importantly, many undergo painful loss of personal relationships and expect or actually experience rejection by peers because of having tuberculosis. However, relationships with physicians, caregivers, and other patients in the clinic mediate negative impacts of TB diagnosis and hospitalization on adolescents’ mental wellbeing and can open ways for providing support. Supportive practices include physicians leaving it up to adolescents to decide what they want to discuss and when, caregivers remaining available for contact and keeping regular communication, and other adolescents with TB proactively seeking contact with the newcomers and behaving in a non-judgmental way. These results can inform design of adolescent-friendly TB services."
https://openalex.org/W3202272824,"Understanding how in eukaryotic cells thousands of proteins are sorted from each other through the secretory pathway and delivered to their correct destinations is a central issue of cell biology. We have further investigated in yeast how two distinct types of cargo proteins are sorted into different endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERES) for their differential ER export to the Golgi apparatus. We used an optimized protocol that combines a live cell dual-cargo ER export system with a 3D simultaneous multi-color high-resolution live cell microscopy called Super-resolution Confocal Live Imaging Microscopy (SCLIM). Here, we describe this protocol, which is based on the reversible ER retention of two de novo co-expressed cargos by blocking COPII function upon incubation of the thermo-sensitive COPII allele sec31-1 at restrictive temperature (37°C). ER export is restored by shifting down to permissive temperature (24°C) and progressive incorporation of the two different types of cargos into the fluorescently labelled ERES can be then simultaneously captured at 3D high spatial resolution by SCLIM microscopy. By using this protocol, we have shown that newly synthesized glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins having a very long chain ceramide lipid moiety are clustered and sorted into specialized ERES that are distinct from those used by transmembrane secretory proteins. Furthermore, we showed that the chain length of the ceramide present in the ER membrane is critical for this sorting selectivity. Therefore, thanks to the presented method we could obtain the first direct in vivo evidence for lipid chain length-based protein cargo sorting into selective ERES."
https://openalex.org/W3203809846,"Wood-inhabiting fungi are crucial to wood decay and decomposition in S . psammophila sand barriers, which in turn consumingly influence nutrient dynamics in desert soils. In the case of an extremely arid desert, as opposed to forests, little of known about the fungal community composition of decaying wood and the effects of decomposing wood on soil physical and chemical properties. Combined with high-throughput gene sequencing technology, we investigated the relationships between microenvironment factors with fungal community composition and diversity during the decomposition of Salix psammophila sand barriers. The results showed that the destruction of lignocellulose components during the decay process of S . psammophila sand barrier alters the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil. Compared with one-year sand barrier, lignin and cellulose of seven-year S . psammophila sand barrier decreased by 40.48% and 38.33%, respectively. Soil available potassium and available nitrogen increased by 39.80% and 99.46%, respectively. We confirmed that soil available nitrogen, soil pH and soil moisture content significantly affected the fungal community distribution of S . psammophila sand barriers. Sordariomycetes are mainly affected by the positive correlation of soil pH, while Eurotiomycetes are most affected by the positive correlation of soil moisture content and soil porosity. Although our results highlighted the importance of bidirectional interactions between fungi in decayed sand barriers and soil properties, their contribution to the desert ecosystem still needs further confirmation from future studies. However, overall our findings improved the current understanding of the sand barrier-soil interactions on the process of ecological restoration."
https://openalex.org/W3204600167,"In this paper, we assume that the supply chain for new energy vehicles (NEVs) consists of a manufacturer and N parts suppliers, considering that the R&amp;D investment of both manufacturer and suppliers will affect the market demand of NEVs and NEVs credit, we construct decentralized and centralized decision-making models under the dual-credit policy to study the R&amp;D investment strategy of supply chain enterprises. Furthermore, considering that suppliers can form alliances, we establish bargaining game models under the conditions of the non-alliance and alliance of suppliers, and discuss the coordination strategy for the NEVs supply chain. It is found that, under the dual-credit policy, the higher the credit coefficient of technology improvement, the higher the transaction price of credits, and the higher the R&amp;D investment of supply chain. Dual-credit policy can effectively encourage NEVs supply chain to increase R&amp;D investment, improve NEV technology level, and improve the profit of supply chain. Under the dual-credit policy, the increment profit distribution strategy based on a bargaining game model can coordinate the NEVs supply chain. When suppliers separately negotiate with the manufacturer, bringing the negotiation sequence forward, the supplier can get more profits. However, as the manufacturer has the right to determine the negotiation sequence, the supplier can only get the profit of the last round of negotiation, and the manufacturer can get excess profit. Forming a suppliers alliance can solve this problem effectively, and increase the profit of all suppliers when the alliance`s negotiating power is improved to a certain threshold."
https://openalex.org/W3202044313,"Quantification of pressure drop across stenotic arteries is a major element in the functional assessment of occlusive arterial disease. Accurate estimation of the pressure drop with a numerical model allows the calculation of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), which is a haemodynamic index employed for guiding coronary revascularisation. Its non-invasive evaluation would contribute to safer and cost-effective diseases management. In this work, we propose a new formulation of a reduced-order model of trans-stenotic pressure drop, based on a consistent theoretical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation. The new formulation features a novel term that characterises the contribution of turbulence effect to pressure loss. Results from three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) showed that the proposed model produces predictions that are significantly more accurate than the existing reduced-order models, for large and small symmetric and eccentric stenoses, covering mild to severe area reductions. FFR calculations based on the proposed model produced zero classification error for three classes comprising positive (≤ 0.75), negative (≥ 0.8) and intermediate (0.75 − 0.8) classes."
https://openalex.org/W3202195181,"Nitrogen (N) is the prime nutrient for crop production and carbon-based functions associated with soil quality. The objective of our study (2012 to 2019) was to evaluate the impact of variable rates of N fertilization on soil organic carbon (C) pools and their stocks, stratification, and lability in subtropical wheat ( Triticum aestivum )—mungbean ( Vigna radiata )—rice ( Oryza sativa L) agroecosystems. The field experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design (RCB) with N fertilization at 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140% of the recommended rates of wheat (100 kg/ha), mungbean (20 kg/ha), and rice (80 kg/ha), respectively. Composite soils were collected at 0–15 and 15–30 cm depths from each replicated plot and analyzed for microbial biomass (MBC), basal respiration (BR), total organic C (TOC), particulate organic C (POC), permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), carbon lability indices, and stratification. N fertilization (120 and 140%) significantly increased the POC at both depths; however, the effect was more pronounced in the surface layer. Moreover, N fertilization (at 120% and 140%) significantly increased the TOC and labile C pools when compared to the control (100%) and the lower rates (60 and 80%). N fertilization significantly increased MBC, C pool (CPI), lability (CL I ), and management indices (CMI), indicating improved and efficient soil biological activities in such systems. The MBC and POC stocks were significantly higher with higher rates of N fertilization (120% and 140%) than the control. Likewise, higher rates of N fertilization significantly increased the stocks of labile C pools. Equally, the stratification values for POC, MBC, and POXC show evidence of improved soil quality because of optimum N fertilization (120–140%) to maintain and/or improve soil quality under rice-based systems in subtropical climates."
https://openalex.org/W3202622760,"Introduction PDL1 and its interaction with PD1 is implicated in immune dysfunction in TB and HIV. The expression of PDL1 on multiple subsets of monocytes as well as their associations with cytokines and microbial products have not been well studied. Method HIV (TB-HIV+), TB (TB+HIV-) and TB/HIV co-infected (TB+HIV+) patients as well as apparently healthy controls (TB-HIV-) were recruited. TB and HIV patients were treatment naïve while TB/HIV patients were both ART naïve and experienced but not yet started TB therapy. Monocyte subsets were evaluated for PDL1 expression by flow cytometry; plasma TNFα, IL6, IP10, IFNγ and IL10 were measured by Luminex; and cytokine mRNA from purified monocytes quantitated by qPCR. The association of PDL1 with cytokines, clinical and microbial indices, including HIV viral load, TB smear microscopy and TB urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) were assessed. Results Monocyte expression of PDL1 was significantly higher in TB, HIV and TB/HIV co-infected patients compared with healthy controls (p = 0.0001), with the highest levels in TB/HIV co-infected patients. The highest expression of PDL1 was on intermediate (CD14+CD16+) monocytes in all participant groups. PDL1 strongly correlated with HIV viral load in TB/HIV while weakly correlated in HIV. PDL1 levels moderately correlated with plasma TNFα, IL6, IP10, IFNγ and IL10 level in TB subjects whereas weakly correlated with TNFα and IP10 in HIV patients. However, cytokine mRNA from purified monocytes showed no association with either plasma cytokines or monocyte PDL1 expression, implying that if cytokines modulate PDL1, they are likely not originating from circulating monocytes themselves. These results underscore the importance of further characterization of multiple monocyte subsets and their phenotypic and functional differences in different disease states."
https://openalex.org/W3203702121,"Age-related hearing loss in humans (presbycusis) typically involves impairment of high frequency sensitivity before becoming progressively more severe at lower frequencies. Pathologies initially affecting lower frequency regions of hearing are less common. Here we describe a progressive, predominantly low-frequency recessive hearing impairment in two mutant mouse lines carrying different mutant alleles of the Klhl18 gene: a spontaneous missense mutation ( Klhl18 lowf ) and a targeted mutation ( Klhl18 tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi ). Both males and females were studied, and the two mutant lines showed similar phenotypes. Threshold for auditory brainstem responses (ABR; a measure of auditory nerve and brainstem neural activity) were normal at 3 weeks old but showed progressive increases from 4 weeks onwards. In contrast, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) sensitivity and amplitudes (a reflection of cochlear outer hair cell function) remained normal in mutants. Electrophysiological recordings from the round window of Klhl18 lowf mutants at 6 weeks old revealed 1) raised compound action potential thresholds that were similar to ABR thresholds, 2) cochlear microphonic potentials that were normal compared with wildtype and heterozygous control mice and 3) summating potentials that were reduced in amplitude compared to control mice. Scanning electron microscopy showed that Klhl18 lowf mutant mice had abnormally tapering of the tips of inner hair cell stereocilia in the apical half of the cochlea while their synapses appeared normal. These results suggest that Klhl18 is necessary to maintain inner hair cell stereocilia and normal inner hair cell function at low frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W3203908079,"This confirmatory research investigates the influence of risk framing of COVID-19 on support for restrictive government policy based on two web survey experiments in Russia. Using 2x2 factorial design, we estimated two main effects-factors of risk severity (low vs. high) and object at risk (individual losses vs. losses to others). First, focusing on higher risks had a positive effect on support for the government's restrictive policy. Second, focusing on the losses for others did not produce stronger support for the restrictive policy compared to focusing on personal losses. However, we found a positive moderation effect of such prosocial values as universalism and benevolence. We found that those with prosocial values had a stronger positive effect in the ""losses for others"" condition and were more willing to support government restrictive policy when others were included. The effects found in our experimental study reveal both positive and negative aspects in risk communication during the pandemic, which may have a great and long-term impact on trust, attitudes, and behavior."

This study sought to determine the prevalence of RLS, associated clinical correlates, and characterize sleep-related differences in men with and without HIV.Sleep-related data were collected in men who have sex with men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Demographic, health behaviors, HIV status, comorbidities, and serological data were obtained from the MACS visit coinciding with sleep assessments. Participants completed questionnaires, home polysomnography, and wrist actigraphy. RLS status was determined with the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS questionnaire. RLS prevalence was compared in men with and without HIV. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of RLS among all participants and men with HIV alone. Sleep-related differences were examined in men with and without HIV by RLS status.The sample consisted of 942 men (56% HIV+; mean age 57 years; 69% white). The prevalence of definite RLS was comparable in men with and without HIV (9.1% vs 8.7%). In multinomial regression, HIV status was not associated with RLS prevalence. However, white race, anemia, depression, and antidepressant use were each independently associated with RLS. HIV disease duration was also associated with RLS. Men with HIV and RLS reported poorer sleep quality, greater sleepiness, and had worse objective sleep efficiency/fragmentation than men without HIV/RLS.The prevalence of RLS in men with and without HIV was similar. Screening for RLS may be considered among people with HIV with insomnia and with long-standing disease."

High-throughput and low-cost approaches to identify etiologic agents are needed to guide public health mitigation. Nanoliter-qPCR (nl-qPCR) is an attractive alternative to more expensive methods yet is nascent in application and without a proof-of-concept among hospitalized patients. Methods A census-based study was conducted among diarrheal patients admitted at two government hospitals in rural Bangladesh during a diarrheal outbreak period. DNA was extracted from stool samples and assayed by nl-qPCR for common bacterial, protozoan, and helminth enteropathogens as the primary outcome. Results A total of 961 patients were enrolled; stool samples were collected from 827 patients. Enteropathogens were detected in 69% of patient samples; More than one enteropathogen was detected in 32%. Enteropathogens most commonly detected were enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (26.0%), Shiga toxin-producing E . coli (18.3%), enterotoxigenic E . coli (15.5% heat stable toxin positive, 2.2% heat labile toxin positive), Shigella spp. (14.8%), and Vibrio cholerae (9.0%). Geospatial analysis revealed that the median number of pathogens per patient and the proportion of cases presenting with severe dehydration were greatest amongst patients residing closest to the study hospitals.” Conclusions This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for nl-qPCR as a high-throughput low-cost method for enteropathogen detection among hospitalized patients."
https://openalex.org/W3203964497,"In earlier research, both higher levels of noise and odour annoyance have been associated with decreased mental health. Presumably, these perceptions can trigger feelings of threat and stress reactions and in turn evoke psychological distress. There are two important lacunas in the research on this topic: most studies only consider either noise or odour annoyance and not their relative effect on psychological distress and there is scarce evidence about whether different sociodemographic groups experience more psychological distress due to noise and odour annoyance. Starting from the diversity in the available coping resources and in their daily life patterns, we distinguish gender, age and educational level as relevant sociodemographic variables. Using data from the Health Monitor (n = 25236) in Noord-Brabant, we found using Ordinary Least Squares Regression that individuals that reported higher levels of noise and odour annoyance reported higher levels of psychological distress. Furthermore, the effect of noise annoyance was relatively stronger compared to that of odour annoyance. Regarding the interaction effects, we found that younger adults’ psychological distress was more strongly affected by noise annoyance compared to older adults, but not by odour annoyance. The psychological distress of individuals with no or primary education was more strongly affected by both noise and odour annoyance compared those with tertiary education, but not when compared to those who completed lower or higher secondary education. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find different effects between men and women. Though the evidence for the interactions was mixed, classic health inequalities along age and education lines are reinforced when considering the relationship between noise and odour annoyance and psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W3204271852,"Measurements of the physical outputs of speech—vocal tract geometry and acoustic energy—are high-dimensional, but linguistic theories posit a low-dimensional set of categories such as phonemes and phrase types. How can it be determined when and where in high-dimensional articulatory and acoustic signals there is information related to theoretical categories? For a variety of reasons, it is problematic to directly quantify mutual information between hypothesized categories and signals. To address this issue, a multi-scale analysis method is proposed for localizing category-related information in an ensemble of speech signals using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing how classification accuracy on unseen data varies as the temporal extent of training input is systematically restricted, inferences can be drawn regarding the temporal distribution of category-related information. The method can also be used to investigate redundancy between subsets of signal dimensions. Two types of theoretical categories are examined in this paper: phonemic/gestural categories and syntactic relative clause categories. Moreover, two different machine learning algorithms were examined: linear discriminant analysis and neural networks with long short-term memory units. Both algorithms detected category-related information earlier and later in signals than would be expected given standard theoretical assumptions about when linguistic categories should influence speech. The neural network algorithm was able to identify category-related information to a greater extent than the discriminant analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3204711158,"Eimeria parasites cause enteric disease in livestock and the closely related Cyclospora cayetanensis causes human disease. Oocysts of these coccidian parasites undergo maturation (sporulation) before becoming infectious. Here, we assessed transcription in maturing oocysts of Eimeria acervulina , a widespread chicken parasite, predicted gene functions, and determined which of these genes also occur in C . cayetanensis . RNA-Sequencing yielded ~2 billion paired-end reads, 92% of which mapped to the E . acervulina genome. The ~6,900 annotated genes underwent temporally-coordinated patterns of gene expression. Fifty-three genes each contributed &gt;1,000 transcripts per million (TPM) throughout the study interval, including cation-transporting ATPases, an oocyst wall protein, a palmitoyltransferase, membrane proteins, and hypothetical proteins. These genes were enriched for 285 gene ontology (GO) terms and 13 genes were ascribed to 17 KEGG pathways, defining housekeeping processes and functions important throughout sporulation. Expression differed in mature and immature oocysts for 40% (2,928) of all genes; of these, nearly two-thirds (1,843) increased their expression over time. Eight genes expressed most in immature oocysts, encoding proteins promoting oocyst maturation and development, were assigned to 37 GO terms and 5 KEGG pathways. Fifty-six genes underwent significant upregulation in mature oocysts, each contributing at least 1,000 TPM. Of these, 40 were annotated by 215 GO assignments and 9 were associated with 18 KEGG pathways, encoding products involved in respiration, carbon fixation, energy utilization, invasion, motility, and stress and detoxification responses. Sporulation orchestrates coordinated changes in the expression of many genes, most especially those governing metabolic activity. Establishing the long-term fate of these transcripts in sporulated oocysts and in senescent and deceased oocysts will further elucidate the biology of coccidian development, and may provide tools to assay infectiousness of parasite cohorts. Moreover, because many of these genes have homologues in C . cayetanensis , they may prove useful as biomarkers for risk."

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) was performed in 66 eyes of 33 patients in a retrospective case-control study: superficial and deep retinal vessel density (VD) of the whole image, fovea, parafovea, non-flow area, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were measured. Data of eyes with RRD were compared to the healthy fellow eyes in 3 groups according to the elapsed time after surgery: RD1: 6–12 months (n = 10), RD2: 1–2 years (n = 10), and RD3: 2–10 years (n = 13). In RD1 VD was significantly lower in the superficial parafoveal, deep parafoveal, and deep whole area compared to the fellow eyes. In RD3 VD was significantly lower in the superficial fovea, parafovea, whole image, and deep fovea, the non-flow area was significantly enlarged. OCT-A demonstrated a significant reduction in the superficial and deep regions of the macular vasculature after the repair of RRD. The deep area is more affected in the early postoperative period and the superficial region and the extent of the non-flow area are more involved after a longer postoperative time."

Using Latent Growth Mixture Models, Using Latent Growth Mixture Models, we aimed at identifying multiple profiles of competence development. Specifically, we expected to find at least one generalized (i.e., reading and mathematical competence develop similarly) and two specialized profiles (i.e., one of the domains develops faster) of competence development and that these profiles are explained by the specialization of interest and of vocational education of students. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find multiple latent profiles of competence development. The model describing our data best was a single-group latent growth model confirming a competence development profile, which can be described as specializing in mathematical competences, indicating a higher increase in mathematical competences as compared to reading competences in upper secondary school. Since only one latent profile was identified, potential predictors (specialization of vocational education and interest) for different profiles of competence development were not examined."

Thioridazine, a compound belonging to the phenothiazine group, has previous shown antimicrobial activity against C . difficile . The purpose of this present study was to investigate the potential of a novel phenothiazine derivative, JBC 1847, as an oral antimicrobial for treatment of intestinal pathogens and CDIs. The minimal inhibition concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of JBC 1847 against C . difficile ATCC 43255 were determined 4 μg/mL and high tolerance after oral administration in mice was observed (up to 100 mg/kg bodyweight). Pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted in silico using GastroPlus TM , predicting low (&lt; 10%) systemic uptake after oral exposure and corresponding low C max in plasma. Impact on the intestinal bacterial composition after four days of treatment was determined by 16s rRNA MiSeq sequencing and revealed only minor impact on the microbiota in non-clinically affected mice, and there was no difference between colony-forming unit (CFU)/gram fecal material between JBC 1847 and placebo treated mice. The cytotoxicity of the compound was assessed in Caco-2 cell-line assays, in which indication of toxicity was not observed in concentrations up to seven times the minimal bactericidal concentration. In conclusion, the novel phenothiazine derivative demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against C . difficile , had low predicted gastrointestinal absorption, low intestinal ( in vitro ) cytotoxicity, and only induced minor changes of the healthy microbiota, altogether supporting that JBC 1847 could represent a novel antimicrobial candidate. The clinical importance hereof calls for future experimental studies in CDI models."
https://openalex.org/W3204398102,"Plants have been used in Amazonian forests for millennia and some of these plants are disproportionally abundant (hyperdominant). At local scales, people generally use the most abundant plants, which may be abundant as the result of management of indigenous peoples and local communities. However, it is unknown whether plant use is also associated with abundance at larger scales. We used the population sizes of 4,454 arboreal species (trees and palms) estimated from 1946 forest plots and compiled information about uses from 29 Amazonian ethnobotany books and articles published between 1926 and 2013 to investigate the relationship between species usefulness and their population sizes, and how this relationship is influenced by the degree of domestication of arboreal species across Amazonia. We found that half of the arboreal species (2,253) are useful to humans, which represents 84% of the estimated individuals in Amazonian forests. Useful species have mean populations sizes six times larger than non-useful species, and their abundance is related with the probability of usefulness. Incipiently domesticated species are the most abundant. Population size was weakly related to specific uses, but strongly related with the multiplicity of uses. This study highlights the enormous usefulness of Amazonian arboreal species for local peoples. Our findings support the hypothesis that the most abundant plant species have a greater chance to be useful at both local and larger scales, and suggest that although people use the most abundant plants, indigenous people and local communities have contributed to plant abundance through long-term management."
https://openalex.org/W3204876958,"Brain aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and AQP4 are involved in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis and might participate in the origin of hydrocephalus. Studies have shown alterations of perivascular AQP4 expression in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Due to the overlapping of clinical signs between iNPH and certain neurological conditions, mainly AD, specific biomarkers might improve the diagnostic accuracy for iNPH. The goal of the present study was to analyze and quantify the presence of AQP1 and AQP4 in the CSF of patients with iNPH and AD to determine whether these proteins can be used as biomarkers of iNPH. We examined AQP1 and AQP4 protein levels in the CSF of 179 participants (88 women) classified into 5 groups: possible iNPH (81 participants), hydrocephalus associated with other neurological disorders (13 participants), AD (41 participants), non-AD dementia (32 participants) and healthy controls (12 participants). We recorded each participant’s demographic and clinical variables and indicated, when available in the clinical history, the record of cardiovascular and respiratory complications. An ELISA showed virtually no AQP content in the CSF. Information on the vascular risk factors (available for 61 patients) confirmed some type of vascular risk factor in 86% of the patients with possible iNPH and 58% of the patients with AD. In conclusion, the ELISA analysis showed insufficient sensitivity to detect the presence of AQP1 and AQP4 in CSF, ruling out the possible use of these proteins as biomarkers for diagnosing iNPH."

In this context, it is important to assess whether the clinical management of non-Covid patients has not been compromised. Among non-Covid cases, patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and stroke need non-deferrable emergency care and are the natural candidates to be studied. Preliminary evidence suggests that the time from onset of symptoms to emergency department (ED) presentation has significantly increased in Covid-19 times as well as the 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality.We check, in a causal inference framework, the causal effect of the hospital's stress generated by Covid-19 pandemic on in-hospital mortality rates (primary end-point of the study) of AMI and stroke over several time-windows of 15-days around the implementation date of the State of Emergency restrictions for COVID-19 (March, 9th 2020) using two quasi-experimental approaches, regression-discontinuity design (RDD) and difference-in-regression-discontinuity (DRD) designs. Data are drawn from Spedali Civili of Brescia, one of the most hit provinces in Italy by Covid-19 during March and May 2020.Despite the potential adverse effects on expected mortality due to a longer time to hospitalization and staff extra-burden generated by the first wave of Covid-19, the AMI and stroke mortality rates are overall not statistically different during the first wave of Covid-19 than before the first peak. The obtained results provided by RDD models are robust also when we account for seasonality and unobserved factors with DRD models.The non-statistically significant impact on mortality rates for AMI and stroke patients provides evidence of the hospital ability to manage -with the implementation of a dual track organization- the simultaneous delivery of high-quality cares to both Covid and non-Covid patients."
https://openalex.org/W3203836762,"Infrasonic signals measured before an earthquake carry information about the size and development speed of the source fracture, the stress at the fracture site and the elastic properties of the geologic medium. The infrasonic signal has a stable time scale, and compared with other precursors, infrasound has a unique sensitivity to earthquake disasters. However, to date, there has been no relevant theoretical research on the mechanism of infrasonic anomalies, and information on the development of fracture sources cannot be obtained from these characteristics, which makes the application of this anomaly in earthquake prediction challenging. In this study, we obtained the characteristics of short-term and impending infrasonic anomalies based on the infrasound data of more than 100 strong earthquakes. With a range of elastic medium models with a large number of fractures, we completed the theoretical simulation of the formation process of infrasonic precursors during the formation of the main fractures, analyzed the physical evolution of acoustic signals when cracks are generated, and quantitatively described the stages of large fracture formation caused by the initiation and propagation of seismic cracks. Specifically, this study revealed the causes of various and complex forms of infrasonic precursors near the critical point and the causes of the time- and space-dependent characteristics of these precursors, such as a noticeable attenuation of the pulse number, a low frequency and a large amplitude, which verified the effectiveness of infrasonic anomalies as strong earthquake precursors."

Few data are available for children, current data mainly rely on antibody prevalence. We sought to determine the Ts-antigen seroprevalence–determining active cysticercosis—amongst school children from various cities in Madagascar (excluding the capital) and evaluated associated risk factors. Methods In seven cities in Madagascar, the presence of cysticercosis in school children (n = 1751) was investigated in 2007 using the B158/B60 antigen (Ag)-ELISA. Results The overall prevalence based on Ag detection was 27.7% [95%CI: 10–37%]. Risk factors associated with Ag positivity were age, biotope, altitude and annual average rainfall. Conclusion These results highlight the high prevalence of active cysticercosis in Madagascar among school children in an urban setting. This high prevalence as well as the risk factors unraveled point to the emergency to implement appropriate Public Health measure son a national scale."
https://openalex.org/W3202589899,"Chemical-genetics (C-G) experiments can be used to identify interactions between inhibitory compounds and bacterial genes, potentially revealing the targets of drugs, or other functionally interacting genes and pathways. C-G experiments involve constructing a library of hypomorphic strains with essential genes that can be knocked-down, treating it with an inhibitory compound, and using high-throughput sequencing to quantify changes in relative abundance of individual mutants. The hypothesis is that, if the target of a drug or other genes in the same pathway are present in the library, such genes will display an excessive fitness defect due to the synergy between the dual stresses of protein depletion and antibiotic exposure. While assays at a single drug concentration are susceptible to noise and can yield false-positive interactions, improved detection can be achieved by requiring that the synergy between gene and drug be concentration-dependent. We present a novel statistical method based on Linear Mixed Models, called CGA-LMM, for analyzing C-G data. The approach is designed to capture the dependence of the abundance of each gene in the hypomorph library on increasing concentrations of drug through slope coefficients. To determine which genes represent candidate interactions, CGA-LMM uses a conservative population-based approach in which genes with negative slopes are considered significant only if they are outliers with respect to the rest of the population (assuming that most genes in the library do not interact with a given inhibitor). We applied the method to analyze 3 independent hypomorph libraries of M . tuberculosis for interactions with antibiotics with anti-tubercular activity, and we identify known target genes or expected interactions for 7 out of 9 drugs where relevant interacting genes are known."

Results Of the 3350 intrapartum cesareans, 2637 were performed at term for singleton fetuses in cephalic presentation: 747 (28.3%) during the second stage of labor, 83 (11.1%) of which were complicated by a hysterotomy extension. The median duration of the passive phase of the second stage did not differ between women with and without an extension (164 min versus 160 min, P = 0.85). No other second-stage obstetric characteristics, i.e., duration of the active phase, fetal head station, or fetal malposition, were associated with the risk of extension. Factors significantly associated with extension were the surgeon’s experience and forceps use during the cesarean. Women with an extension, compared to women without one, had a longer median operative time (49 min versus 32 min, P &lt;0.001) and higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage and blood transfusion (respectively, 30.1% versus 15.1%, p = 0.002 and 7.2% versus 2.4%, P = 0.03). Conclusion The risk of a hysterotomy extension does not appear to be associated with second-stage obstetric characteristics, including the duration of the passive phase of this stage. In our center, which practices delayed pushing, prolonging this passive phase beyond 2 hours does not increase the risk of hysterotomy extension in second-stage cesareans."
https://openalex.org/W3202992096,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. Pediatric patients in Japan are diagnosed with IgAN at an early stage of the disease through annual urinary examinations. Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) have various roles, including proinflammatory effects, and modulation of several kidney diseases; however, no reports have described their roles in pediatric IgAN. In this study, we performed pathological and immunohistochemical analyses of samples from 14 pediatric IgAN patients. Additionally, gene expression arrays of glomeruli by laser-captured microdissection were performed in hemi-nephrectomized high serum IgA (HIGA) mice, a model of IgA nephropathy, to determine the role of Fn14. Glomeruli with intense Fn14 deposition were observed in 80% of mild IgAN cases; however, most severe cases showed glomeruli with little or no Fn14 deposition. Fn14 deposition was not observed in obvious mesangial proliferation or the crescent region of glomeruli, but was detected strongly in the glomerular tuft, with an intact appearance. In HIGA mice, Fn14 deposition was observed mildly beginning at 11 weeks of age, and stronger Fn14 deposition was detected at 14 weeks of age. Expression array analysis indicated that Fn14 expression was higher in HIGA mice at 6 weeks of age, increased slightly at 11 weeks, and then decreased at 26 weeks when compared with controls at equivalent ages. These findings suggest that Fn14 signaling affects early lesions but not advanced lesions in patients with IgAN. Further study of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway will contribute to our understanding of the progression of IgAN."
https://openalex.org/W3203572133,"Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening parasitic disease next to malaria, which is responsible for the death of 50,000 patients annually. It has three major clinical stages, including visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Ethiopia is one of the east African countries commonly affected with leishmanisis disease. There are many drugs for leishmaniasis, including sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin combined therapy. However, the adverse effect of those combined drugs is not well-defined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess serum amylase, lipase, and associated factors among patients with VL treatment with those combined drugs. Methods Hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital Leishmaniasis Research and Treatment Center from February to September 2020 G.C. Simple random sampling technique was utilized to select study participants. The study participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria were included in the study with written informed consent. 5 ml of blood was withdrawn by an experienced health professional to analyze serum amylase and lipase level. Descriptive data was presented by tables, charts and graphs. Data was cleared, entered by Epi-data version 3.1 then transfer to STATA 14.1 SE version and for analysis paired t-test was used, for factors correlation and regression was used. Those factor variable who have p-value &lt;0.25 was filtered and goes to multivariate regression and p-value &lt;0.05 was considered as significant variables. Results The result of this study showed that there was a significant mean difference between serum pancreatic amylase and lipase before and after treatment. The mean ± SD level of serum amylase after treatment showed a statistically significant elevation (P&lt;0.001) as compared to its level before treatment. Similarly, the mean ± SD level of serum lipase after treatment showed a statistically significant elevation (P&lt;0.001) as compared to its level before treatment. There was also significant association between age and baseline serum amylase as compared to serum amylase after treatment. Similarly, there was also significant relation of age and serum lipase with serum lipase after treatment. Conclusion In this study, the level of serum amylase and lipase at treatment of cure was higher and there was an increase in mean serum amylase and lipase after a patient taking sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin combined drugs. Consequently, the elevated result of these biochemical profiles mainly associated with drug induced adverse effect and associated risk factors in VL patients."
https://openalex.org/W3199488250,"To identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their potential roles in hepatic fibrosis in rat liver issues induced by CCl4, lncRNAs and genes were analyzed in fibrotic rat liver tissues by RNA sequencing and verified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and genes were subjected to bioinformatics analysis and used to construct a co-expression network. We identified 10 novel DE-lncRNAs that were downregulated during the hepatic fibrosis process. The cis target gene of DE-lncRNA, XLOC118358, was Met , and the cis target gene of the other nine DE-lncRNAs, XLOC004600, XLOC004605, XLOC004610, XLOC004611, XLOC004568, XLOC004580 XLOC004598, XLOC004601, and XLOC004602 was Nox4 . The results of construction of a pathway-DEG co-expression network show that lncRNA-Met and lncRNAs-Nox4 were involved in oxidation-reduction processes and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Our results identified 10 DE-lncRNAs related to hepatic fibrosis, and the potential roles of DE-lncRNAs and target genes in hepatic fibrosis might provide new therapeutic strategies for hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3201821558,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during anaesthesia induction improves oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) outcomes in adults subjected to airway manipulation, and could similarly support oxygenation in children. We evaluated whether CPAP ventilation and passive CPAP oxygenation in children would defer a SpO 2 decrease to 95% after apnoea onset compared to the regular technique in which no positive airway pressure is applied. In this double-blind, parallel, randomised controlled clinical trial, 68 children aged 2–6 years with ASA I–II who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia were divided into CPAP and control groups (n = 34 in each group). The intervention was CPAP ventilation and passive CPAP oxygenation using an anaesthesia workstation. The primary outcome was the elapsed time until SpO 2 decreased to 95% during a follow-up period of 300 s from apnoea onset (T1). We also recorded the time required to regain baseline levels from an SpO 2 of 95% aided by positive pressure ventilation (T2). The median T1 was 278 s (95% confidence interval [CI]: 188–368) in the CPAP group and 124 s (95% CI: 92–157) in the control group (median difference: 154 s; 95% CI: 58–249; p = 0.002). There were 17 (50%) and 32 (94.1%) primary events in the CPAP and control groups, respectively. The hazard ratio was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.14–0.48; p&lt;0.001). The median for T2 was 21 s (95% CI: 13–29) and 29 s (95% CI: 22–36) in the CPAP and control groups, respectively (median difference: 8 s; 95% CI: -3 to 19; p = 0.142). SpO 2 was significantly higher in the CPAP group than in the control group throughout the consecutive measures between 60 and 210 s (with p ranging from 0.047 to &lt;0.001). Thus, in the age groups examined, CPAP ventilation and passive CPAP oxygenation deferred SpO 2 decrease after apnoea onset compared to the regular technique with no positive airway pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3203573133,"Stable isotope mixing models (SIMMs) provide a powerful methodology for quantifying relative contributions of several sources to a mixture. They are widely used in the fields of ecology, geology, and archaeology. Although SIMMs have been rapidly evolved in the Bayesian framework, the underdetermination of mixing space remains problematic, i.e., the estimated relative contributions are incompletely identifiable. Here we propose a statistical method to quantitatively diagnose underdetermination in Bayesian SIMMs, and demonstrate the applications of our method (named β -dependent SIMM) using two motivated examples. Using a simulation example, we showed that the proposed method can rigorously quantify the expected underdetermination (i.e., intervals of β -dependent posterior) of relative contributions. Moreover, the application to the published field data highlighted two problematic aspects of the underdetermination: 1) ordinary SIMMs was difficult to quantify underdetermination of each source, and 2) the marginal posterior median was not necessarily consistent with the joint posterior peak in the case of underdetermination. Our study theoretically and numerically confirmed that β -dependent SIMMs provide a useful diagnostic tool for the underdetermined mixing problem. In addition to ordinary SIMMs, we recommend reporting the results of β -dependent SIMMs to obtain a biologically feasible and sound interpretation from stable isotope data."
https://openalex.org/W3203578116,"Self-control enables people to override momentary thoughts, emotions, or impulses in order to pursue long-term goals. Good self-control is a predictor for health, success, and subjective well-being, as bad self-control is for the opposite. Therefore, the question arises why evolution has not endowed us with perfect self-control. In this article, we draw some attention to the hidden benefits of self-control failure and present a new experimental paradigm that captures both costs and benefits of self-control failure. In an experiment, participants worked on three consecutive tasks: 1) In a transcription task, we manipulated how much effortful self-control two groups of participants had to exert. 2) In a number-comparison task, participants of both groups were asked to compare numbers and ignore distracting neutral versus reward-related pictures. 3) After a pause for recreation, participants were confronted with an unannounced recognition task measuring whether they had incidentally encoded the distracting pictures during the previous number-comparison task. The results showed that participants who exerted a high amount of effortful self-control during the first task shifted their priorities and attention toward the distractors during the second self-control demanding task: The cost of self-control failure was reflected in worse performance in the number-comparison task. Moreover, the group which had exerted a high amount of self-control during the first task and showed self-control failure during the second task was better in the unannounced third task. The benefit of self-control failure during number comparison was reflected in better performance during the recognition task. However, costs and benefits were not specific for reward-related distractors but also occurred with neutral pictures. We propose that the hidden benefit of self-control failure lies in the exploration of distractors present during goal pursuit, i.e. the collection of information about the environment and the potential discovery of new sources of reward. Detours increase local knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3203974942,"Functional support—the availability of material aid, emotional support, or companionship—promotes general well-being. For men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV, having a person who supports you associates with viral suppression. This study examines the association between supportive partnerships and HIV viral suppression among middle-aged and aging MSM living with HIV. A total of 423 middle-aged and aging MSM (mean age, 58.2 years) from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study provided self-reported data about their partnerships. Separate Poisson regression models assessed how partnership type, support, strain, and duration from April 2017 were associated with repeated viral load measurements up to April 2019. Of the follow-up visits (N = 1289), 90.0% of participants were virally suppressed. Most participants reported being non-Hispanic White (61.0%) and college-educated (83.4%). Participants were asked about their primary partnerships (i.e., “someone they are committed to above anyone else”) and secondary partnerships (i.e., those who can also be intimate or supportive but not necessarily romantic or sexual). The participants reported: no partnerships (45.2%), only primary partnerships (31.0%), only secondary partnerships (11.1%), or both primary and secondary partnerships (12.8%). Primary and secondary partnerships had mean (SD) durations of 15.9 (11.3) and 25.2 (16.5) years, respectively. Participants reporting both primary and secondary partnerships (compared with no partnership) showed significantly higher odds of being virally suppressed (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00–1.08; p = 0.043). Albeit not statistically significant, primary-only (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97–1.06; p = 0.547) or secondary-only (aPR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.98–1.08; p = 0.224) partnership types were positively associated with viral suppression. Partner support and strain were not associated with viral suppression in any partnership group. Being older and non-Hispanic Black were positively and negatively associated with viral suppression, respectively. Encouraging partnerships should be considered one of clinicians’ many tools to help middle-aged and aging MSM achieve long-term viral suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3204349170,"Adolescents with a history of child maltreatment experience increased risk for psychopathology that sets them on a trajectory towards a range of difficulties in adulthood. Various factors influence caregivers' decisions to seek mental health services (MHS) that could improve developmental outcomes. The present study applied a machine learning algorithm, elastic net, to a sample of 878 adolescent-caregiver dyads from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect. Analyses simultaneously examined a large number of factors to determine their ability to discriminate between caregivers who perceived a need for MHS and those who did not, as well as caregivers who utilized MHS and those who did not. Results highlight family demographics, chronic parental stressors, youth psychopathology, and exposure to recent adversities as good classifiers of caregiver perceived need for (77.6%; sensitivity = .77; specificity = .78) and utilization of (71%; sensitivity = .71; specificity = .71) adolescent MHS. Elastic net identified adolescent clinical externalizing and internalizing problems, and parental stress related to child(ren)'s behavior as high value classifiers of both outcomes. Youth living with non-kin caregivers were also significantly more likely to utilize MHS. Findings highlight the importance of assessing clinical need, stress related to child(ren)'s behavior, and caregiver kinship in understanding the likelihood that at-risk families will seek adolescent MHS."
