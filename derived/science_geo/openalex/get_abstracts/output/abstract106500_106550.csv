https://openalex.org/W2059555945,"Microbial elicitors or attempted infection with an avirulent pathogen strain causes the rapid production of reactive oxygen intermediates. We report here that H2O2 from this oxidative burst not only drives the cross-linking of cell wall structural proteins, but also functions as a local trigger of programmed death in challenged cells and as a diffusible signal for the induction in adjacent cells of genes encoding cellular protectants such as glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. Thus, H2O2 from the oxidative burst plays a key role in the orchestration of a localized hypersensitive response during the expression of plant disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2030508161,"Dissection of the subependyma from the lateral ventricle of the adult mouse forebrain is necessary and sufficient for the in vitro formation of clonally derived spheres of cells that exhibit stem cell properties such as self-maintenance and the generation of a large number of progeny comprising the major cell types found in the central nervous system. Killing the constitutively proliferating cells of the subependyma in vivo has no effect on the number of stem cells isolated in vitro and induces a complete repopulation of the subependyma in vivo by relatively quiescent stem cells found within the subependyma. Depleting the relatively quiescent cell population within the subependyma in vivo results in a corresponding decrease in spheres formed in vitro and in the final number of constitutively proliferating cells in vivo, suggesting that a relatively quiescent subependymal cell is the in vivo source of neural stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140853270,Liddle's syndrome (pseudoaldosteronism) is an autosomal dominant form of human hypertension characterized by a constellation of findings suggesting constitutive activation of the amiloride-sensitive distal renal epithelial sodium channel. We demonstrate complete linkage of the gene encoding the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel to Liddle's syndrome in Liddle's original kindred. Analysis of this gene reveals a premature stop codon that truncates the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the encoded protein in affected subjects. Analysis of subjects with Liddle's syndrome from four additional kindreds demonstrates either premature termination or frameshift mutations in this same carboxy-terminal domain in all four. These findings demonstrate that Liddle's syndrome is caused by mutations in the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel and have implications for the regulation of this epithelial ion channel as well as blood pressure homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2074126694,"When yeast cells reach a critical size, they initiate bud formation, spindle pole body duplication, and DNA replication almost simultaneously. All three events depend on activation of Cdc28 protein kinase by the G1 cyclins Cln1, -2, and -3. We show that DNA replication also requires activation of Cdc28 by B-type (Clb) cyclins. A sextuple clb1-6 mutant arrests as multibudded G1 cells that resemble cells lacking the Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. cdc34 mutants cannot enter S phase because they fail to destroy p40SIC1, which is a potent inhibitor of Clb but not Cln forms of the Cdc28 kinase. In wild-type cells, p40SIC1 protein appears at the end of mitosis and disappears shortly before S phase. Proteolysis of a cyclin-specific inhibitor of Cdc28 is therefore an essential aspect of the G1 to S phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W2101347364,"mGluR1 mutant mice are viable but show characteristic cerebellar symptoms such as ataxic gait and intention tremor. The anatomy of the cerebellum is not overtly disturbed. Excitatory synaptic transmission from parallel fibers (PFs) to Purkinje cells and that from climbing fibers (CFs) to Purkinje cells appear to be functional, and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels of Purkinje cells are normal. Both PF and CF synapses display normal short-term synaptic plasticity to paired stimuli. By marked contrast, long-term depression (LTD) is clearly deficient and conditioned eyeblink response is impaired. We conclude that mGluR1 is required for the induction of LTD and that the ataxic behavior and impaired eyeblink conditioning of the mGluR1 mutant mice are primarily due to deficient LTD."

https://openalex.org/W2128511563,"Integrin-mediated adhesion is known to stimulate production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4,5-PIP2) and increase 4,5-PIP2 hydrolysis in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We now show that treatment of cells with lovastatin, which inhibits modification of small GTP-binding proteins, reduced PIP2 levels and decreased calcium mobilization in response to PDGF and thrombin. In cell lysates, GTP gamma S stimulated PIP 5-kinase activity, and this effect was blocked by botulinum C3 exoenzyme, suggesting that Rho was responsible. GTP-bound recombinant Rho stimulated PIP 5-kinase activity, whereas GDP-Rho was much less potent and GTP-bound Rac was ineffective. Microinjected botulinum C3 exoenzyme caused diminished calcium mobilization in response to PDGF or thrombin. Conversely, microinjection of activated Rho reversed the decrease in calcium mobilization normally seen in nonadherent cells. These data demonstrate that Rho regulates 4,5-PIP2 synthesis and, indirectly, 4,5-PIP2 hydrolysis. They also raise the possibility that PIP2 synthesis could mediate the effects of Rho on the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2032361307,"The roles of p53 as an inducer and Bcl-2 as an inhibitor of apoptotic death were explored in lymphoid cells. Lymphocytes from p53-/- mice were radioresistant, but unexpectedly, cycling T lymphoma cells and mitogenically activated T lymphocytes from these animals underwent apoptosis after irradiation or genotoxic drug treatment. Hence, p53 is not the only mediator of apoptosis provoked by DNA damage. Irradiated p53-/- lymphoblasts expressing Bcl-2 were subject to growth arrest but resisted apoptosis. Their accumulation in G1 as well as G2 is suggestive of a p53-independent DNA-damage G1 checkpoint. Since Bcl-2 increased the clonogenic survival of the irradiated cells, expression of survival genes may pose a greater impediment to genotoxic cancer therapy than loss of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2116112998,"To investigate the role of MÃ¼llerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) in mammalian sexual development, we generated MIS-deficient mice. Although MIS-deficient males had testes that were fully descended and produced functional sperm, they also developed female reproductive organs, which interfered with sperm transfer into females, rendering most of these males infertile. Their testes had Leydig cell hyperplasia and, in one instance, neoplasia. The actions of the two primary hormones of male sexual differentiation were genetically eliminated using the testicular feminization (Tfm) mutation in combination with the MIS mutant allele. XY Tfm/MIS double mutants developed as females, with a uterus, coiled oviducts, and no male reproductive organs except undescended dysfunctional testes. These results suggest that eliminating the presumptive female reproductive tract in male fetuses facilitates fertility and that in testes MIS is a negative regulator of Leydig cell proliferation. Eliminating the presumptive male reproductive tract is necessary for proper oviductal morphogenesis during female mouse development."
https://openalex.org/W1983956991,"We generated a novel strain of mutant mouse with a deletion in the gene encoding metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1). Gross anatomy of the hippocampus, excitatory synaptic transmission, long-term depression, and short-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region are all apparently normal in the mutant mice. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) is substantially reduced, and a moderate level of impairment is observed in context-specific associative learning. We propose that mGluR1 is not ""in line"" in LTP production, but rather modulates the plasticity process, and hence affects context-specific associative learning."
https://openalex.org/W1994803892,"Apoptotic cell death involves a ritual series of morphological changes, presumably reflecting a conserved molecular pathway. We now report that the nuclear events typical of apoptosis can be reproduced in ""apoptotic"" Xenopus egg extracts. In this cell-free system, nuclear assembly and protein import are initially normal; after 2-4 hr, however, a process of nuclear destruction ensues involving chromatin condensation and the shrinkage and fragmentation of the nuclei. This apoptotic process, which also occurs in nuclei added exogenously, is blocked by the addition of baculovirus-expressed Bcl-2 protein. To block the disintegration of nuclei that are added later, Bcl-2 must be present during this latent period. ""Apoptosis"" in these extracts requires a dense organelle fraction enriched in mitochondria. The cell-free system described here provides a novel tool for understanding intracellular events in apoptosis and the inhibitory function of Bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W2091513322,"In a genetic screen for mutations that attenuate Notch signaling in the developing Drosophila eye, we isolated rare, gain-of-function alleles of Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), the fly homolog of the mammalian C promoter-binding factor 1 (CBF1) gene. Su(H) exhibits numerous allele-specific genetic interactions with Notch as well as with Delta, deltex, and mastermind. In cultured Drosophila cells, the Su(H) protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm when coexpressed with Notch protein and is translocated to the nucleus when Notch binds to its ligand Delta. Cytoplasmic retention of Su(H) requires the intracellular cdc 10/ankyrin repeats of Notch, which associate with Su(H) protein in the yeast interaction trap assay. These results indicate that Notch activity may regulate nuclear events by controlling the activity of a DNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2111431369,"Following chronic cocaine treatment, we have found a long-lasting increase in AP-1 binding in the rat nucleus accumbens and striatum, two important targets of the behavioral effects of cocaine. This increase develops gradually over several days and remains at 50% of maximal levels 7 days after the last cocaine exposure. Supershift experiments, along with one- and two-dimensional Western blots, indicate that this chronic AP-1 complex contains at least four Fos-related antigens (FRAs), some of which display delta FosB-like immunoreactivity, that are induced selectively by chronic, but not acute, cocaine treatment. The same chronic FRAs were also induced by several different types of chronic treatments in a region-specific manner in the brain. Thus, the chronic FRAs and associated chronic AP-1 complex could mediate some of the long-term changes in gene expression unique to the chronic-treated state as opposed to the acute-treated and normal states."
https://openalex.org/W2138304761,"LIM domains are zinc-binding protein sequences that are found in a growing number of proteins, including certain transcriptional regulators, proto-oncogene products, and adhesion plaque constituents. Here we define the biological activity of the LIM domain through studies of an adhesion plaque protein called zyxin that displays three C-terminal LIM domains. We have used our ability to reconstitute complexes between zyxin and its two known binding partners, alpha-actinin and the cysteine-rich protein (CRP), to examine the involvement of LIM domains in protein-protein interactions. We have determined that one of the three LIM domains of zyxin is necessary and sufficient to support the association of zyxin with CRP. Our findings demonstrate that the LIM domain functions as a specific protein-binding interface."
https://openalex.org/W2027766408,"Like early Xenopus embryos, extracts made from Xenopus eggs lack the cell cycle checkpoint that keeps anaphase from occurring before spindle assembly is complete. At very high densities of sperm nuclei, however, microtubule depolymerization arrests the extracts in mitosis. The arrested extracts have high levels of maturation-promoting factor activity, fail to degrade cyclin B, and contain activated ERK2/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The addition of the purified MAP kinase-specific phosphatase MKP-1 demonstrates that MAP kinase activity is required for both the establishment and maintenance of the mitotic arrest induced by spindle depolymerization. Increased calcium concentrations, which release unfertilized frog eggs from their natural arrest in metaphase of meiosis II, have no effect on the mitotic arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2040169742,"To identify potential Sec4 effectors, we isolated high copy suppressors of a Sec4 effector domain mutant. The most potent of these was found to be SEC9, a gene required for post-Golgi transport. The sole essential domain of Sec9 has significant sequence similarity to the neuronal protein SNAP-25, a component of the SNARE complex, that is implicated in vesicle targeting and fusion. Analogous to SNAP-25, Sec9 is bound to the yeast plasma membrane and is absent from post-Golgi vesicles. Furthermore, Sec9 is physically associated with two proteins that are homologous to components of the neuronal SNARE complex. Our results identify Sec9 as the yeast cognate of SNAP-25 and suggest that SNARE complexes acting at specific stages of vesicular transport serve as the ultimate targets of regulation by members of the Sec4/Ypt1/Rab family of GTPases."

https://openalex.org/W1977634657,"We have studied the effects of blockers of glutamate transporters on excitatory synaptic transmission to determine whether transporters increase the clearance rate of transmitter from the synaptic cleft on the millisecond time scale. The transporter blockers Li+ and THA increased the amplitude, but not the decay time, of spontaneous miniature AMPA receptor EPSCs recorded at 34Â°C but not 24Â°C. Evoked AMPA receptor EPSCs were similarly affected by THA. The rapidly dissociating AMPA receptor competitive antagonist PDA inhibited evoked AMPA receptor EPSCs less in the presence of THA at both temperatures, implying that transporter blockade slows clearance. We suggest that transporters speed glutamate clearance mainly by binding glutamate and that AMPA receptors are not saturated by synaptically released glutamate at 34Â°C."

https://openalex.org/W1975561755,"Wing formation in Drosophila requires interactions between dorsal and ventral cells. We describe a new gene, fringe, which is expressed in dorsal cells and encodes for a novel protein that is predicted to be secreted. Wing margin formation and distal wing outgrowth can be induced by the juxtaposition of cells with and without fringe expression, whether at the normal wing margin, at the boundaries of fringe mutant clones in the dorsal wing, or at sites of fringe misexpression in the ventral wing. By contrast, both loss of fringe expression and uniform fringe expression cause wing loss. These observations suggest that fringe encodes a boundary-specific cell-signaling molecule that is responsible for dorsal-ventral cell interactions during wing development."
https://openalex.org/W1985698109,"The Drosophila neural cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (Fas II) is expressed dynamically on a subset of embryonic CNS axons, many of which selectively fasciculate in the vMP2, MP1, and FN3 pathways. Here we show complementary fasII loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes. Loss-of-function fasII mutations lead to the complete or partial defasciculation of all three pathways. Gain-of-function conditions, using a specific control element to direct increased levels of Fas II on the axons in these three pathways, rescue the loss-of-function phenotype. Moreover, the gain-of-function can alter fasciculation by abnormally fusing pathways together, in one case apparently by preventing normal defasciculation. These results define an in vivo function for Fas II as a neuronal recognition molecule that controls one mechanism of growth cone guidance-selective axon fasciculation--and genetically separates this function from other aspects of outgrowth and directional guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2063647354,"Shigella species cause bacillary dysentery in humans by invading colonic epithelial cells. IpaB and IpaC, two major invasins of these pathogens, are secreted into the extracellular milieu. We show here that IpaB and IpaC form a complex in the extracellular medium and that each binds independently to a 17 kDa polypeptide, IpgC, in the bacterial cytoplasm. The IpgC polypeptide was found to be necessary for bacterial entry into epithelial cells, to stabilize the otherwise unstable IpaB protein, and to prevent the proteolytic degradation of IpaC that occurs through its association with unprotected IpaB. We propose that IpgC, which is not secreted and thus acts as a molecular chaperone, serves as a receptor that prevents premature oligomerization of IpaB and IpaC within the cytoplasm of Shigella cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000412914,"In the zip1 mutant, meiotic chromosomes fail to synapse, owing to the absence of a structural component of the synaptonemal complex (SC). This mutant has been analyzed for the ability to carry out several functions that have been proposed for the SC. The data presented show that the zip1 mutation does not affect chiasma function and confers only modest defects in meiotic recombination and sister chromatid cohesion. In contrast, crossover interference is completely abolished in the absence of Zip1. These data are the first to establish a molecular link between cytological observations of the SC and the genetic phenomenon of interference."
https://openalex.org/W2016401484,"The vertebrate ventral midbrain contains 3-4 x 10(4) dopaminergic neurons that influence motor activity, emotional behavior, and cognition. Recently, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was shown to be a potent survival factor for these dopaminergic neurons in culture. However, many midbrain dopaminergic neurons project to targets that do not express GDNF. We report here that transforming growth factors (TGFs) TGF beta 2 and TGF beta 3, which are distantly related to GDNF, also prevent the death of cultured rat embryonic midbrain dopaminergic neurons at picomolar concentrations. Furthermore, we find that TGF beta 2, TGF beta 3, and GDNF are expressed sequentially as local and target-derived trophic factors and that subpopulations of dopaminergic neurons projecting to distinct targets have access to only one of these factors. These findings are consistent with the idea that GDNF, TGF beta 2, and TGF beta 3 are physiological survival factors for developing midbrain dopaminergic neurons and may have applications as therapeutics for Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder of dopaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1994140164,"Using high resolution capacitance (Cm) measurement techniques, we mapped the kinetics of exocytosis evoked by brief (5-100 ms) depolarizations that activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in rat adrenal chromaffin cells. After correcting the Cm signal for contributions from Na+ channel-gating charge movements, the initial kinetics of exocytosis were consistent with depolarization-triggered release occurring initially from an immediately releasable pool of only approximately 17 secretory vesicles. In contrast, repetitive application of longer depolarizations evoked release from a distinct, larger readily releasable pool of approximately 170 vesicles. Our results suggest that the secretory response of a chromaffin cell to an action potential is limited by the size of the immediately releasable pool rather than by a fusion mechanism that is slower than that at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2050287345,"To study in vivo functions of the ubiquitous actin-binding protein profilin, we generated by antisense and gene disruption techniques Dictyostelium mutants that lack one or both of the profilin isoforms. Whereas the single mutants showed an essentially unchanged phenotype, the behavior of the double mutant was drastically altered. Motility was significantly reduced, single cells were up to 10 times larger than wild-type cells and showed a broad rim of filamentous actin below the plasma membrane, the filamentous actin concentration was increased by about 60%â70%, and development was blocked prior to fruiting body formation. Furthermore, double mutants could not be grown in shaking culture under normal conditions, reflecting an impaired cytokinesis. The aberrant phenotype could be rescued by reintroducing a functional profilin I or profilin II gene. The data in this study suggest that profilin functions in Dictyostelium amoebae primarily as an actin-sequestering protein."
https://openalex.org/W2015368612,"The retina of the mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig is divided into a superior area dominated by green-sensitive (M) cones and an inferior area in which cones possess practically only short wavelength-sensitive (S) photopigments. The present study shows that the transitional zone between these retinal areas is populated by cones labeled by both the M and S cone photopigment-specific antibodies COS-1 and OS-2. It is concluded that the overwhelming majority of the transitional cones express both visual pigments. A small population of the transitional cones was strongly labeled exclusively by OS-2 (genuine S cones). The results indicate that, in contrast to the generally accepted idea of one visual pigment per one cone cell, cones of certain mammalian species can express different opsins simultaneously under natural conditions. We speculate that the coexpression may be due to the overlapping of regulatory factors determining the M and S fields."
https://openalex.org/W2001251162,"Two successive pulses of ecdysone signal the ends of larval and prepupal development in Drosophila, inducing early and late puffs in the salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Early puff induction in prepupae is dependent on a preceding period of protein synthesis and low ecdysone concentration. We demonstrate here that the competence acquired during this interval can be provided by beta FTZ-F1, a nuclear hormone receptor superfamily member derived from the 75CD mid-prepupal puff. We show that beta FTZ-F1 represses its own transcription and is repressed by ecdysone, explaining its brief expression in mid-prepupae. We further show that ectopic beta FTZ-F1 expression leads to enhanced levels of ecdysone-induced BR-C, E74, and E75 early gene transcription and premature induction of the stage-specific 93F early puff and E93 transcription. These findings indicate that beta FTZ-F1 plays a central role in the prepupal genetic response to ecdysone and provide a molecular mechanism for stage-specific responses to steroid hormones."

https://openalex.org/W2049648491,"The X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is associated with mutations in the gene encoding connexin32, a member of the family of proteins forming intercellular channels. We have compared the functional properties of three mutant connexin32 genes with those of the wild-type gene by testing their ability to form intercellular channels in the paired oocyte expression system. Whereas wild-type connexin32 induced the development of large junctional conductance between paired oocytes, no functional channels were detected between pairs expressing CMTX mutants. Furthermore, CMTX mutants selectively acted as dominant inhibitors of intercellular communication by interfering with the channel-forming ability of connexin26 but not with that of connexin40. These results demonstrate a functional loss in the product of a candidate gene for a demyelinating form of CMT."
https://openalex.org/W2039119477,"Olfactory receptor neurons are produced continuously in mammalian olfactory epithelium in vivo, but in explant cultures neurogenesis ceases abruptly. We show that in vitro neurogenesis is prolonged by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which act in two ways. FGFs increase the likelihood that immediate neuronal precursors (INPs) divide twice, rather than once, before generating neurons; this action requires exposure of INPs to FGFs by early G1. FGFs also cause a distinct subpopulation of explants to generate large numbers of neurons continually for at least several days. The data suggest that FGFs delay differentiation of a committed neuronal transit amplifying cell (the INP) and support proliferation or survival of a rare cell, possibly a stem cell, that acts as a progenitor to INPs."
https://openalex.org/W2067826134,"The Tc3 transposon of C. elegans belongs to a family of inverted repeat DNA transposons, found in many different phyla. We studied the mechanism of Tc3 transposition by expression of Tc3 transposase from a heat-shock promoter in transgenic nematodes. Transposition is accompanied by the appearance of linear extrachromosomal Tc3 DNA. Analysis of the ends of this presumed transposition intermediate shows that the transposon is excised incompletely: the 5â² ends of the transposon lack two nucleotides. The 3â² ends coincide with the last nucleotide of the integrated element and carry 3â² hydroxyls. The nucleotides that are not coexcised with the transposon remain at the donor site and result in a characteristic footprint. A model is derived for the mechanism of Tc3 jumping that probably applies to the entire family of Tc1/mariner transposable elements."

https://openalex.org/W2067271873,"Mutations in the Notch (N) gene affect many processes during the development of Drosophila. Some alleles of Notch affect only particular processes, suggesting that the Notch protein (N) has more than one functional domain. We have found a series of N mutant phenotypes that are similar to those produced by the loss of function of the segment polarity gene wingless (wg) in the embryo and the adult. In addition, we observe that mutations in N behave as dominant enhancers of wg and that there exist allele-specific interactions between the two loci. Our results suggest that the product of wg is a ligand for N."
https://openalex.org/W2079472796,"The mammalian homolog of the yeast Sec1p, n-Sec1/Munc-18 has been demonstrated to bind the presynaptic membrane protein syntaxin, a putative synaptic vesicle docking protein. To determine the role of n-Sec1/Munc-18 in neurotransmitter release in vivo, we have overexpressed the Drosophila homolog, rop, in third instar larvae and measured the electrophysiological consequences at the neuromuscular junction. A 3- to 5-fold induction of the rop protein causes a dramatic decrease in neurotransmitter release, suggesting rop may restrict the ability of vesicles to dock or of docked vesicles to fuse. Consistent with this hypothesis, rop overexpression also reduces the number of spontaneous vesicle fusions by more than 50%, and repetitive stimulation results in significant decreases in evoked responses similar to those observed in rab3a mutant mice. However, rop overexpression does not alter significantly the Ca2+ dependence of neurotransmitter release. We propose that the Drosophila n-Sec1/Munc-18 homolog plays a negative role in neurotransmitter release in vivo, in addition to its previously identified positive function, possibly by modulation of docking of synaptic vesicles or activation of a pre-fusion complex at the active zone."

https://openalex.org/W2069191054,"The presynaptic function of myosin II was studied at cholinergic synapses formed between rat superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture. Immunofluorescent staining showed that myosin II was colocalized with synaptophysin at the presynaptic nerve terminals. Antimyosin II antibody introduced into presynaptic neurons inhibited synaptic transmission. Transmission was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by two inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase: a peptide, SM-1, and an organic inhibitor, wortmannin. The inhibition produced by these agents was dependent on presynaptic activity. Extracellularly applied wortmannin also blocked synaptic transmission, but its effects were slower in onset. Wortmannin also decreased postsynaptic potentials and post-tetanic potentiation in intact superior cervical ganglia. These results suggest a model in which myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates myosin, and the resultant change in actin-myosin interactions is involved in neurotransmitter release."

https://openalex.org/W2039360085,"We examined the roles of the Drosophila Gq alpha proteins (DGq) in the phototransduction pathway. The DGq proteins immunolocalized to the ocelli and all eight retinular photoreceptor cell rhabdomeres. An affinity-purified anti-DGq alpha immunoglobulin blocked the light-dependent GTP hydrolysis activity associated with Drosophila head membranes in vitro, suggesting that rhodopsin stimulated DGq. Dominantly active DGq1 mutants exhibited a light-independent GTPase activity and abnormal electrophysiological light responses, such as reduced retinal sensitivity and slow response kinetics compared with wild-type flies. Dominant DGq2 mutants exhibited a light-independent GTPase activity with normal electrophysiological light responses. Retinas of double mutants of DGq1, but not DGq2, with the light-dependent retinal degeneration mutant rdgB degenerated even in the dark. DGq1 stimulation of rdgB retinal degeneration in the dark was norpA-dependent. These results indicate that DGq1 mediates the stimulation by light-activated rhodopsin of the norpA-encoded phospholipase C in the visual transduction cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2063561524,"Self-propagating infectious particles were produced in animal cells transfected with an RNA replicon encoding a single viral structural protein, the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). The replicon is derived from an alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and encodes the SFV RNA replicase, but none of the SFV structural proteins. After transfection of the replicon into tissue culture cells, expression of G protein spread from small foci throughout the culture. Supernatants from the cells contained infectious, virus-like particles that could be passaged and were neutralized by anti-VSV serum. The majority of the infectious particles were smaller and less dense than either VSV or SFV. Characterization by electron microscopy showed membrane-enveloped vesicles that contained the VSV-G protein. Infectious particles were apparently generated by budding of vesicles containing VSV-G protein and the RNA replicon. These experiments reveal that an enveloped infectious agent can be much simpler than previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W2072017376,"The transcription termination site for yeast RNA polymerase I requires not only an 11 bp binding site for Reb1p, but also about 46 bp of 5â² flanking sequence. We propose that Reb1p bound to its site is part of a pause element, while the 5â² flanking sequence contains a release element. Pausing requires little other than the DNA-binding domain of Reb1p and is not specific for polymerase I. The release element, however, can be polymerase specific. We propose a general model for eukaryotic transcription terminators in which termination occurs when a relatively nonspecific signal induces polymerase to pause in the context of a release element."

https://openalex.org/W2069825772,"Structurally similar voltage-dependent ion channels may behave differently in different locations along the surface of a neuron. A possible reason could be that channels experience nonuniform electrical potentials along the plasmalemma. Here, we map the electrical potentials along the membrane of differentiated N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells with a potential-sensitive dye. We find that the intramembrane potential gradient is indeed more positive in the membranes of neurites than in the membranes of somata. This is not attributable to differences in ion conductances or surface charge densities between the membranes of neurites and somata; instead, it can be explained by differences in lipid composition. The spatial variation in intramembrane electrical potential may help account for electrophysiological and functional differences between neurites and somata."
https://openalex.org/W1969115154,"From the nervous system of Aplysia, we have cloned a new class of noninactivating K+ channels (aKv5.1) that are activated at low voltage and are capable of contributing to the resting potential and firing patterns of neurons. Expression of aKv5.1 in Aplysia neuron R 15 revealed that aKv5.1 exerts an unusual control over cell excitability; it increased the resting potential by more than 20 mV and abolished the spontaneous bursting activity of the cell. In its ability to suppress the endogenous rhythm of R15, aKv5.1 differs in its actions from transient, inactivating K+ channels such as aKv1.1a, an Aplysia homolog of Shaker. aKv1.1a shortens the duration of the spike and increases the afterpotential, but does not suppress bursting. Thus, by expressing different classes of K+ channels, it is possible to redesign, in specific ways, the signaling capabilities of specific, identified neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2067187070,"Structures in situ of individual ribosomes in E. coli have been determined by computer-aided electron microscope tomography using a tilt series of positively stained embedded cellular sections. Amino acid starvation of a bacterial culture, causing a deficiency for aminoacyl-tRNA, induces a spatial separation between the ribosomal subunits compared with ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Eight ribosomes from each growth condition were aligned to each other, and the two average structures were determined. Comparison of these suggests that the distance between the two subunits increases by approximately 3 nm upon starvation for aminoacyl-tRNA during protein synthesis. Ribosomes in most other states of the translational elongation cycle in exponentially growing cells show a more compact structure than previously realized."
https://openalex.org/W2035562046,"In neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cells, bradykinin has dual modulatory effects on ion channels: it activates a K+ current as well as inhibits the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current (ICa,V). Both of these actions are mediated by pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins. Antibodies raised against the homologous Gq and G11 proteins suppress only the activation of the K+ current; this suggested that at least two distinct G protein pathways transduce diverse effects of this transmitter. Here, we show that the inhibition of ICa,V by bradykinin is suppressed selectively by intracellular application of antibodies specific for G13. This novel G protein may play a general role in the inhibition of ICa,V by pathways resistant to pertussis toxin."
