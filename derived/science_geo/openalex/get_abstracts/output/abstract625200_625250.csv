https://openalex.org/W2905667684,"Clonal expansion in aged normal tissues has been implicated in the development of cancer. However, the chronology and risk dependence of the expansion are poorly understood. Here we intensively sequence 682 micro-scale oesophageal samples and show, in physiologically normal oesophageal epithelia, the progressive age-related expansion of clones that carry mutations in driver genes (predominantly NOTCH1), which is substantially accelerated by alcohol consumption and by smoking. Driver-mutated clones emerge multifocally from early childhood and increase their number and size with ageing, and ultimately replace almost the entire oesophageal epithelium in the extremely elderly. Compared with mutations in oesophageal cancer, there is a marked overrepresentation of NOTCH1 and PPM1D mutations in physiologically normal oesophageal epithelia; these mutations can be acquired before late adolescence (as early as early infancy) and significantly increase in number with heavy smoking and drinking. The remodelling of the oesophageal epithelium by driver-mutated clones is an inevitable consequence of normal ageing, which-depending on lifestyle risks-may affect cancer development."

https://openalex.org/W2906180136,"Mammalian gene expression is inherently stochastic1,2, and results in discrete bursts of RNA molecules that are synthesized from each allele3–7. Although transcription is known to be regulated by promoters and enhancers, it is unclear how cis-regulatory sequences encode transcriptional burst kinetics. Characterization of transcriptional bursting, including the burst size and frequency, has mainly relied on live-cell4,6,8 or single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization3,5,8,9 recordings of selected loci. Here we determine transcriptome-wide burst frequencies and sizes for endogenous mouse and human genes using allele-sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that core promoter elements affect burst size and uncover synergistic effects between TATA and initiator elements, which were masked at mean expression levels. Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics. Allele-specific single-cell RNA sequencing provides insights into transcription kinetics, with data indicating that core promoter sequences affect burst size, whereas enhancers mainly affect burst frequency."
https://openalex.org/W4238945726,"Type-A γ-aminobutyric (GABAA) receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels with a very rich pharmacology. Some of their modulators, including benzodiazepines and general anaesthetics, are among the most successful drugs in clinical use and are common substances of abuse. Without reliable structural data, the mechanistic basis for the pharmacological modulation of GABAA receptors remains largely unknown. Here we report several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures in which the full-length human α1β3γ2L GABAA receptor in lipid nanodiscs is bound to the channel-blocker picrotoxin, the competitive antagonist bicuculline, the agonist GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), and the classical benzodiazepines alprazolam and diazepam. We describe the binding modes and mechanistic effects of these ligands, the closed and desensitized states of the GABAA receptor gating cycle, and the basis for allosteric coupling between the extracellular, agonist-binding region and the transmembrane, pore-forming region. This work provides a structural framework in which to integrate previous physiology and pharmacology research and a rational basis for the development of GABAA receptor modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2906572232,"The fast-growing field of bioelectronic medicine aims to develop engineered systems that can relieve clinical conditions by stimulating the peripheral nervous system1-5. This type of technology relies largely on electrical stimulation to provide neuromodulation of organ function or pain. One example is sacral nerve stimulation to treat overactive bladder, urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis (also known as bladder pain syndrome)4,6,7. Conventional, continuous stimulation protocols, however, can cause discomfort and pain, particularly when treating symptoms that can be intermittent (for example, sudden urinary urgency)8. Direct physical coupling of electrodes to the nerve can lead to injury and inflammation9-11. Furthermore, typical therapeutic stimulators target large nerve bundles that innervate multiple structures, resulting in a lack of organ specificity. Here we introduce a miniaturized bio-optoelectronic implant that avoids these limitations by using (1) an optical stimulation interface that exploits microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes to activate opsins; (2) a soft, high-precision biophysical sensor system that allows continuous measurements of organ function; and (3) a control module and data analytics approach that enables coordinated, closed-loop operation of the system to eliminate pathological behaviours as they occur in real-time. In the example reported here, a soft strain gauge yields real-time information on bladder function in a rat model. Data algorithms identify pathological behaviour, and automated, closed-loop optogenetic neuromodulation of bladder sensory afferents normalizes bladder function. This all-optical scheme for neuromodulation offers chronic stability and the potential to stimulate specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2906077462,"Topological quantum materials exhibit fascinating properties1-3, with important applications for dissipationless electronics and fault-tolerant quantum computers4,5. Manipulating the topological invariants in these materials would allow the development of topological switching applications analogous to switching of transistors6. Lattice strain provides the most natural means of tuning these topological invariants because it directly modifies the electron-ion interactions and potentially alters the underlying crystalline symmetry on which the topological properties depend7-9. However, conventional means of applying strain through heteroepitaxial lattice mismatch10 and dislocations11 are not extendable to controllable time-varying protocols, which are required in transistors. Integration into a functional device requires the ability to go beyond the robust, topologically protected properties of materials and to manipulate the topology at high speeds. Here we use crystallographic measurements by relativistic electron diffraction to demonstrate that terahertz light pulses can be used to induce terahertz-frequency interlayer shear strain with large strain amplitude in the Weyl semimetal WTe2, leading to a topologically distinct metastable phase. Separate nonlinear optical measurements indicate that this transition is associated with a symmetry change to a centrosymmetric, topologically trivial phase. We further show that such shear strain provides an ultrafast, energy-efficient way of inducing robust, well separated Weyl points or of annihilating all Weyl points of opposite chirality. This work demonstrates possibilities for ultrafast manipulation of the topological properties of solids and for the development of a topological switch operating at terahertz frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2906072858,"Type A γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and the main drivers of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the vertebrate nervous system1,2. Their dysfunction is implicated in a range of neurological disorders, including depression, epilepsy and schizophrenia3,4. Among the numerous assemblies that are theoretically possible, the most prevalent in the brain are the α1β2/3γ2 GABAA receptors5. The β3 subunit has an important role in maintaining inhibitory tone, and the expression of this subunit alone is sufficient to rescue inhibitory synaptic transmission in β1-β3 triple knockout neurons6. So far, efforts to generate accurate structural models for heteromeric GABAA receptors have been hampered by the use of engineered receptors and the presence of detergents7-9. Notably, some recent cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions have reported 'collapsed' conformations8,9; however, these disagree with the structure of the prototypical pentameric ligand-gated ion channel the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor10,11, the large body of structural work on homologous homopentameric receptor variants12 and the logic of an ion-channel architecture. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the full-length human α1β3γ2L-a major synaptic GABAA receptor isoform-that is functionally reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. The receptor is bound to a positive allosteric modulator 'megabody' and is in a desensitized conformation. Each GABAA receptor pentamer contains two phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate molecules, the head groups of which occupy positively charged pockets in the intracellular juxtamembrane regions of α1 subunits. Beyond this level, the intracellular M3-M4 loops are largely disordered, possibly because interacting post-synaptic proteins are not present. This structure illustrates the molecular principles of heteromeric GABAA receptor organization and provides a reference framework for future mechanistic investigations of GABAergic signalling and pharmacology."

https://openalex.org/W2905948186,"Yemen is currently experiencing, to our knowledge, the largest cholera epidemic in recent history. The first cases were declared in September 2016, and over 1.1 million cases and 2,300 deaths have since been reported1. Here we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, pathogenesis and determinants of antimicrobial resistance by sequencing the genomes of Vibrio cholerae isolates from the epidemic in Yemen and recent isolates from neighbouring regions. These 116 genomic sequences were placed within the phylogenetic context of a global collection of 1,087 isolates of the seventh pandemic V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 biotype El Tor2–4. We show that the isolates from Yemen that were collected during the two epidemiological waves of the epidemic1—the first between 28 September 2016 and 23 April 2017 (25,839 suspected cases) and the second beginning on 24 April 2017 (more than 1 million suspected cases)—are V. cholerae serotype Ogawa isolates from a single sublineage of the seventh pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor (7PET) lineage. Using genomic approaches, we link the epidemic in Yemen to global radiations of pandemic V. cholerae and show that this sublineage originated from South Asia and that it caused outbreaks in East Africa before appearing in Yemen. Furthermore, we show that the isolates from Yemen are susceptible to several antibiotics that are commonly used to treat cholera and to polymyxin B, resistance to which is used as a marker of the El Tor biotype. Isolates of the Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype Ogawa from Yemen are from a single sublineage of the seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) lineage and are susceptible to several commonly used antibiotics as well as to polymyxins."

Plasma concentrations of NDEs, assessed by counts and levels of extracted exosome marker CD81, were significantly depressed by a mean of 45% in acute mTBI (P < 0.0001), but not chronic mTBI, compared with controls. Mean CD81-normalized NDE levels of a range of functional brain proteins were significantly abnormal relative to those of controls in acute but not chronic mTBI, including ras-related small GTPase 10, 73% decrease; annexin VII, 8.8-fold increase; ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, 2.5-fold increase; AII spectrin fragments, 1.9-fold increase; claudin-5, 2.7-fold increase; sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter-1, 2.8-fold increase; aquaporin 4, 8.9-fold increase (3.6-fold increase in chronic mTBI); and synaptogyrin-3, 3.1-fold increase (1.3-fold increase in chronic mTBI) (all acute mTBI proteins P < 0.0001). In chronic mTBI, there were elevated CD81-normalized NDE levels of usually pathologic β-amyloid peptide 1-42 (1.6-fold, P < 0.0001), P-T181-tau (2.2-fold, P < 0.0001), P-S396-tau (1.6-fold, P < 0.01), IL-6 (16-fold, P < 0.0001), and prion cellular protein (PRPc) (5.1-fold, P < 0.0001) with lesser or greater (IL-6, PRPc) increases in acute mTBI. Increases in NDE levels of most neurofunctional proteins in acute, but not chronic, mTBI, and elevations of most NDE neuropathological proteins in chronic and acute mTBI delineated phase-specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2905643058,"Ice sheets are currently ignored in global methane budgets1,2. Although ice sheets have been proposed to contain large reserves of methane that may contribute to a rise in atmospheric methane concentration if released during periods of rapid ice retreat3,4, no data exist on the current methane footprint of ice sheets. Here we find that subglacially produced methane is rapidly driven to the ice margin by the efficient drainage system of a subglacial catchment of the Greenland ice sheet. We report the continuous export of methane-supersaturated waters (CH4(aq)) from the ice-sheet bed during the melt season. Pulses of high CH4(aq) concentration coincide with supraglacially forced subglacial flushing events, confirming a subglacial source and highlighting the influence of melt on methane export. Sustained methane fluxes over the melt season are indicative of subglacial methane reserves that exceed methane export, with an estimated 6.3 tonnes (discharge-weighted mean; range from 2.4 to 11 tonnes) of CH4(aq) transported laterally from the ice-sheet bed. Stable-isotope analyses reveal a microbial origin for methane, probably from a mixture of inorganic and ancient organic carbon buried beneath the ice. We show that subglacial hydrology is crucial for controlling methane fluxes from the ice sheet, with efficient drainage limiting the extent of methane oxidation5 to about 17 per cent of methane exported. Atmospheric evasion is the main methane sink once runoff reaches the ice margin, with estimated diffusive fluxes (4.4 to 28 millimoles of CH4 per square metre per day) rivalling that of major world rivers6. Overall, our results indicate that ice sheets overlie extensive, biologically active methanogenic wetlands and that high rates of methane export to the atmosphere can occur via efficient subglacial drainage pathways. Our findings suggest that such environments have been previously underappreciated and should be considered in Earth’s methane budget. Subglacially produced methane of microbial origin is flushed to the ice margin of the Greenland ice sheet by meltwater, contributing to a previously unaccounted for methane flux to the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2907124362,"When we successfully achieve willed actions, the feeling that our moving body parts belong to the self (i.e., body ownership) is barely required. However, how and to what extent the awareness of our own body contributes to the neurocognitive processes subserving actions is still debated. Here we capitalized on immersive virtual reality in order to examine whether and how body ownership influences motor performance (and, secondly, if it modulates the feeling of voluntariness). Healthy participants saw a virtual body either from a first or a third person perspective. In both conditions, they had to draw continuously straight vertical lines while seeing the virtual arm doing the same action (i.e., drawing lines) or deviating from them (i.e., drawing ellipses). Results showed that when there was a mismatch between the intended and the seen movements (i.e., participants had to draw lines but the avatar drew ellipses), motor performance was strongly ""attracted"" towards the seen (rather than the performed) movement when the avatar's body part was perceived as own (i.e., first person perspective). In support of previous studies, here we provide direct behavioral evidence that the feeling of body ownership modulates the interference of seen movements to the performed movements."

Although several of the molecular players involved in mediating mitochondrial dynamics have been identified, the precise cellular cues that initiate mitochondrial fission or fusion remain largely unknown. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), mitochondria are organized along microtubule bundles. Here, we employed deletions of kinesin-like proteins to perturb microtubule dynamics and used high-resolution and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, revealing that mitochondrial lengths mimic microtubule lengths. Furthermore, we determined that compared with WT cells, mutant cells with long microtubules exhibit fewer mitochondria, and mutant cells with short microtubules have an increased number of mitochondria because of reduced mitochondrial fission in the former and elevated fission in the latter. Correspondingly, upon onset of closed mitosis in fission yeast, wherein interphase microtubules assemble to form the spindle within the nucleus, we observed increased mitochondrial fission. We found that the consequent rise in the mitochondrial copy number is necessary to reduce partitioning errors during independent segregation of mitochondria between daughter cells. We also discovered that the association of mitochondria with microtubules physically impedes the assembly of the fission protein Dnm1 around mitochondria, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Taken together, we demonstrate a mechanism for the regulation of mitochondrial fission that is dictated by the interaction between mitochondria and the microtubule cytoskeleton.

Cells utilize several strategies to reduce partitioning error of organelles during mitosis, such as ordered segregation mediated by spindle poles or increasing copy numbers of organelles prior to cell division (27Huh D. Paulsson J. Random partitioning of molecules at cell division.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21873252): 15004-1500910.1073/pnas.1013171108Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the latter, homogeneous distribution of the multiple organelle copies serves to decrease partitioning error. Mitochondrial inheritance has been observed to be microtubule-dependent in mammalian cells (28Lawrence E. Mandato C.

However, only a portion of the observed mitochondria associated with the spindle poles (22Yaffe M.P. Stuurman N. Vale R.D.

Additionally, increased mitochondrial fragmentation upon the onset of mitosis has also been observed (3Jourdain I. Gachet Y. Hyams J.S. The dynamin related protein Dnm1 fragments mitochondria in a microtubule-dependent manner during the fission yeast cell cycle.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2009; 66 (19373772): 509-52310.1002/cm.20351Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), perhaps indicating a binomial partitioning or independent segregation mechanism for mitochondrial distribution wherein each mitochondrion in the mother has a 50% likelihood of being partitioned into either of the daughter cells by virtue of symmetric division and without the involvement of active processes. Although the molecular players that effect fission and fusion have been identified in several systems, the cellular signals that regulate these events are largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondria piggyback on dynamic microtubules to selectively undergo fission when microtubules depolymerize. Reorganization of interphase microtubules into the nucleus when cells prepare for division also provide the cue for increased mitochondrial fission. We quantified the number of mitochondria in mother cells immediately after formation of mitotic spindle within the nucleus and the number of mitochondria in the resulting daughter cells and confirmed that the partitioning was indeed a good fit to a binomial distribution, indicating that an independent segregation mechanism serves to distribute mitochondria into the two daughter cells. We determined that the presence of long and stabilized microtubules was inhibitory to unopposed fission even when Dnm1 was overexpressed. Finally, we discovered that microtubule-bound mitochondria were unlikely to undergo fission due to the unavailability of space between microtubules and mitochondria for the formation of the Dnm1 ring. We observed that mitochondria underwent increased fission upon microtubule depolymerization but did not observe their subsequent aggregation as reported previously (Fig. S1, A–C). Instead, the fragmented mitochondria were mobile and frequently in close contact with each other (Fig. S1, B and C, and Movie S1). Because the depolymerization of microtubules had a direct effect on mitochondrial fission, we set out to study the consequence of modification of microtubule dynamics on mitochondrial dynamics. To this end, we visualized the mitochondria and microtubules of fission yeast strains carrying deletions of antagonistic kinesin-like proteins, Klp5/Klp6 and Klp4, in high-resolution deconvolved images (Fig. 1A and Movies S2–S4). The heteromeric Klp5/Klp6 motor is required for maintenance of interphase microtubule length by promoting catastrophe at microtubule plus ends (33Tischer C. Brunner D. Dogterom M. Force- and kinesin-8-dependent effects in the spatial regulation of fission yeast microtubule dynamics.Mol. Syst.

Cell. 2001; 12 (11739790): 3919-393210.1091/mbc.12.12.3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Klp5 and Klp6 exhibited long microtubule bundles (“MTlong”; Fig. 1B) as reported previously due to a decreased catastrophe rate (33Tischer C. Brunner D. Dogterom M. Force- and kinesin-8-dependent effects in the spatial regulation of fission yeast microtubule dynamics.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (19293830): 25010.1038/msb.2009.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, Klp4 is required for polarized growth in fission yeast and has been suggested to promote microtubule growth (35Browning H. Hayles J. Mata J. Aveline L. Nurse P. McIntosh J.R. Tea2p is a kinesin-like protein required to generate polarized growth in fission yeast.J.

As a result, in the absence of Klp4, microtubule bundles were only about half the length of WT bundles (“MTshort”; Fig. 1B). As in WT cells, mitochondria in Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ were in close contact with the microtubule, whereas we observed reduced association between the short microtubules and mitochondria in Klp4Δ cells (Fig. 1A and Movies S3 and S4). Although WT cells had 4.9 ± 0.4 (mean ± S.E.) mitochondria per cell, we observed that Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ contained only 2.3 ± 0.4 (mean ± S.E.). In contrast, Klp4Δ cells had 10 ± 0.9 mitochondria per cell (mean ± S.E.; Fig. 1C). This indicated that the number of mitochondria per cell was inversely related to the length of microtubule bundle. However, the decrease in the number of mitochondria in Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells and increase in Klp4Δ cells were not at the expense of mitochondrial volume because the net mitochondrial volume in both cases was comparable with WT mitochondrial volume (Fig. 1D), with individual mitochondrial volumes changing to compensate for the difference in mitochondrial numbers among WT, Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ, and Klp4Δ cells (Fig. S1D). To understand the difference in mitochondrial numbers in WT, Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ, and Klp4Δ cells, we acquired and analyzed time-lapse videos at the single-mitochondrion level in all three cases (Fig. 2A and Movies S5–S7). Similar to our observations from high-resolution images, we measured 3.6 ± 0.2, 2.7 ± 0.2, and 6.9 ± 0.8 mitochondria (mean ± S.E.) in WT, Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ, and Klp4Δ cells, respectively (Figs. 1C and 2B). Analysis of evolution of these mitochondrial numbers revealed no significant changes over time (Fig. 2B). Additionally, WT cell exhibited ~1 fission and ~1 fusion event every minute on average, whereas Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells exhibited a fission frequency that was half that of WT, and Klp4Δ mitochondria had a fission frequency that was almost double that of WT (Fig. 2C). The fusion frequency of mitochondria in Klp4Δ cells was slightly higher than in WT and Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells (Fig. 2D), likely due to the increased number of mitochondria in Klp4Δ cells that could participate in fusion. As observed in the high-resolution deconvolved images, we also measured significant differences in the size and morphology of the mitochondria in WT, Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ, and Klp4Δ cells (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2). Mitochondrial sizes reflected microtubule bundle lengths, with the largest mitochondria in Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells and the smallest in Klp4Δ cells. WT cells predictably had mitochondrial sizes between that of Klp4Δ and Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2). Although the Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells containing long microtubules had the same total volume of mitochondria as WT cells (Fig. 1D), their mitochondria appeared less fragmented. So, to specifically test the role of microtubules in dictating mitochondrial fission, we depolymerized microtubules in WT and Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells and measured mitochondrial dynamics in time-lapse movies (Fig. 3A and Movies S8 and S9). In both WT and Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells, upon microtubule depolymerization, we observed a progressive increase in the number of mitochondria (Fig. 3B). We next quantified the fission and fusion events in WT and Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ cells treated with MBC. We measured that the fission frequency of mitochondria in MBC-treated cells was doubled when compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 3C). At the same time, the mitochondrial fusion frequency remained unchanged (Fig. 3D), indicating that the immediate consequence of the loss of microtubules was increased fission, without concomitant changes in mitochondrial fusion. Additionally, upon MBC treatment, we measured mitochondrial sizes and morphologies that were reminiscent of Klp4Δ cells (Fig. 3E and Fig. S3, A–C). An increase in oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species levels has also been described to induce mitochondrial fission (37Pletjushkina O.Y. Lyamzaev K.G. Popova E.N. Nepryakhina O.K. Ivanova O.Y. Domnina L.V. Chernyak B.V. Skulachev V.P. Effect of oxidative stress on dynamics of mitochondrial reticulum.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757 (16829229): 518-52410.1016/j.bbabio.2006.03.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, we measured no difference in reactive oxygen species levels among WT, Klp5Δ/Klp6Δ, and Klp4Δ cells (Fig. S3D). We next sought to understand the biological role for increased mitochondrial fission upon microtubule depolymerization. Fission yeast undergoes closed mitosis, wherein the nuclear envelope does not undergo breakdown during cell division (38Ding R. West R.R. Morphew D.M. Oakley B.R. McIntosh J.R. The spindle pole body of Schizosaccharomyces pombe enters and leaves the nuclear envelope as the cell cycle proceeds.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8 (9285819): 1461-147910.1091/mbc.8.8.1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Upon onset of mitosis in fission yeast, the interphase microtubules that were previously in the cytoplasm are reorganized to form the spindle inside the closed nucleus. This natural situation mimics the depolymerization of microtubules via the chemical inhibitor MBC. Therefore, we set out to study the changes in the mitochondrial network upon cell entry into mitosis. We first obtained high-resolution deconvolved images of the microtubule and mitochondria in fission yeast cells undergoing cell division (Fig. 4A, Fig. S4A, and Movie S10). We observed that dividing WT cells had ~4× the number of mitochondria in interphase cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, similar to what was seen in cells lacking microtubules or Klp4 (Fig. 1A), mitochondria in dividing cells were shorter and more rounded (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4A). There was no relationship between length of the mitotic spindle and the number of mitochondria (Fig. 4B and Fig. S4A), indicating that the increased fission likely occurred fairly early upon entry into mitosis. Analysis of time-lapse videos of WT cells before and 10 min after entry into mitosis revealed a doubling of mitochondrial numbers in this time (Fig. 4, C and D, and Movie S11). The fragmented mitochondria appeared more mobile and were able to traverse distances of ~1 μm in the cell (Fig. 4C). In this same period of time, nondividing interphase cells did not show any change in mitochondrial numbers (Fig. S4, B and C). An increase in mitochondrial numbers prior to cell division could aid in increasing the likelihood of equal partitioning of mitochondria between daughter cells, given a binomial partitioning or independent segregation mechanism. To test whether mitochondria in our system underwent independent segregation (27Huh D. Paulsson J. Random partitioning of molecules at cell division.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21873252): 15004-1500910.1073/pnas.1013171108Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), with each mitochondrion in the mother cell having a 50% chance of segregating to either of the future daughter cells during mitosis, we tested the fit of our data to a binomial distribution (39Birky C.W. The partitioning of cytoplasmic organelles at cell division.Int. Rev. Cytol. Suppl. 1983; 15 (6343284): 49-89PubMed Google Scholar) using a χ2 test as described previously (40Hennis A.S. Birky C.W. Stochastic partitioning of chloroplasts at cell division in the alga Olisthodiscus, and compensating control of chloroplast replication.J. Cell Sci. 1984; 70 (6389575): 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Our data (Table S2) did not differ significantly from a binomial distribution with a χ2 statistic of 7.1846 with 3 degrees of freedom and p = 0.0662, indicating that mitochondrial partitioning in fission yeast is achieved by independent segregation during cell division. The increase in mitochondrial numbers upon onset of mitosis also served to reduce the partitioning error of mitochondria between the daughter cells as predicted by independent segregation (Fig. S4D). The mitochondrial fission protein in yeast is a dynamin-related GTPase, Dnm1 (3Jourdain I. Gachet Y. Hyams J.S. The dynamin related protein Dnm1 fragments mitochondria in a microtubule-dependent manner during the fission yeast cell cycle.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2009; 66 (19373772): 509-52310.1002/cm.20351Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Dnm1 brings about the fission of mitochondria by self-assembling into rings or spirals around the mitochondrial outer membrane and utilizing its GTPase activity to effect the scission (4Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. Dnm1 forms spirals that are structurally tailored to fit mitochondria.J.

Standard fitness measurements of the handgrip, vertical jump, standing broad jump, static balance, upper muscle strength and the core muscle strength were conducted. Multiple linear regression was utilised to ascertain the significant variables that affect the shooting score. It was demonstrated from the analysis that core muscle strength and vertical jump were statistically significant. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) was used to cluster the archers based on the significant variables identified. k-NN model variations, i.e., fine, medium, coarse, cosine, cubic and weighted functions as well as logistic regression, were trained based on the significant performance variables. The HACA clustered the archers into high potential archers (HPA) and low potential archers (LPA). The weighted k-NN outperformed all the tested models at itdemonstrated reasonably good classification on the evaluated indicators with an accuracy of 82.5 ± 4.75% for the prediction of the HPA and the LPA. Moreover, the performance of the classifiers was further investigated against fresh data, which also indicates the efficacy of the weighted k-NN model. These findings could be valuable to coaches and sports managers to recognise high potential archers from a combination of the selected few physical fitness performance indicators identified which would subsequently save cost, time and energy for a talent identification programme."

Increased levels of transcripts from the W and H families of HERV have been observed in association with human diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. Although HERV transcripts have been detected in many tissues and cell-types based on microarray and PCR studies, the extent of HERV expression in different cell-types and diseases state has been less comprehensively studied. Results We examined overall transcription of HERV, and particularly of HERV-W and HERV-H elements in human postmortem brain samples obtained from individuals with psychiatric diagnoses (n = 111) and healthy controls (n = 51) by analyzing publicly available RNA sequencing datasets. Sequence reads were aligned to prototypical sequences representing HERV, downloaded from Repbase. We reported a consistent expression (0.1~0.2% of mappable reads) of different HERV families across three regions of human brains. Spearman correlations revealed highly correlated expression levels between three brain regionsacross 475 consensus sequences. By mapping sequences that aligned to the consensus sequences of HERV-W and HERV-H families to individual loci on chromosome 7, more than 60 loci from each family were identified, part of which are being transcribed. The ERVWE1, locus located at chr7q21.2, exhibited high levels of transcription across the three datasets. Notably, we demonstrated a trend of increased expression of overall HERV, as well as HERV-W family in samples from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. Conclusions The current analyses indicate that RNA sequencing is a useful approach for investigating global expression of repetitive elements, such as HERV, in the human genome. HERV-W/H with the tendency of transcription up-regulation in patients suggests potential implication of HERV-W/H in psychiatric diseases."

Here, we studied acute and chronic pH regulation in Kcnj 16 mutant Dahl salt-sensitive (SSKcnj16−/−) rats; Kcnj16 encodes the pH-sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ 5.1 (Kir5.1) channel. SSKcnj16−/− rats hyperventilated at rest, likely compensating for a chronic metabolic acidosis.

Debriefing fully informed participants regarding the purpose of the study and showed them the two videos.The combination of medication led to significant analgesia, without a between-group difference. Positive information about side effects increased the attribution of AE to the treatment compared to the control information. The total GASE score was correlated with analgesia, i.e., the more AEs reported, the stronger the analgesia. Interestingly, there was a significant between-groups difference on this correlation: the GASE score and analgesia correlated only in the positive information group. This provides evidence for a selective link between AEs and pain relief in the group who received the suggestion that AEs could be taken as a sign ""that help was on the way"". During debriefing, 65% of participants said they would prefer to receive the positive message in a clinical context. Although the present results cannot be translated immediately to clinical pain conditions, they do indicate the importance of testing this type of modulation in a clinical context."
https://openalex.org/W2905486130,"The correlations between growth and wool traits in response to canola and flaxseed oil supplementation were evaluated in Australian prime lambs. Sixty dual-purpose prime lambs including purebred Merino and crossbred lambs were allocated to one of five treatments of lucerne hay basal diet supplemented with isocaloric and isonitrogenous wheat-based pellets. Treatments were: no oil inclusion (Control); 2.5% canola oil; 5% canola oil; 2.5% flaxseed oil and 5% flaxseed oil, with lamb groups balanced by breed and gender. Each lamb was daily supplemented with 1kg of pellets and had free access to lucerne hay and water throughout the 7-week feeding trial, after a 3-week adaptation. Individual animal basal and supplementary pellet feed intakes were recorded daily, while body conformation traits, body condition scores and liveweights were measured on days 0, 21, 35 and 49. The lambs were dye-banded on the mid-side and shorn before commencing the feeding trial and mid-side wool samples were collected from the same dye-banded area of each lamb at the end of the experiment. Correlations between wool quality traits and lamb performance were non-significant (P>0.05). Oil supplementation had no detrimental effect on lamb growth and wool quality traits (P > 0.05). Gender significantly affected wither height gain and fibre diameter. There were significant interactions between oil supplementation and lamb breed on chest girth. The correlations between clean fleece yield (CFY) and other wool quality traits were moderate ranging from 0.29 to 0.55. Moderate to high correlations between fibre diameter (FD) and other wool quality traits were detected (0.46–0.99) with the strongest relationship between FD and wool spinning fineness (SF). The relationship between CFY and wool comfort factor (CF) were positive, while negative relationships between CFY and the others were observed. A combination of 5% oil supplementation and genetics is an effective and strategic management tool for enhancing feed efficiency and growth performance without negative effects on wool quality in dual-purpose lamb production. This is a good outcome for dual-purpose sheep farmers. It essentially means the absorbed nutrients in supplemented lambs yielded good growth performance without any detrimental impact on wool quality; a win-win case of nutrient partitioning into the synthesis of muscle and wool without compromising either traits."

This study investigated the tonsillar detection patterns of M. hyorhinis and M. hyosynoviae in a swine population with a history of lameness. The plausibility of dual PCR detection of these agents in dams at one and three weeks post-farrowing and their offspring at the same time was determined. The association between M. hyorhinis and M. hyosynoviae detection in piglets and potential development of lameness in wean-to-finish stages was evaluated by correlating individual piglet lameness scores and PCR detection in tonsils. Approximately 40% of dams were detected positive for M. hyorhinis and M. hyosynoviae at both one and three weeks post-farrowing. In first parity dams, M. hyorhinis was detected in higher proportions (57.1% and 73.7%) at both weeks of sampling compared to multi-parity dams. A lower proportion of first parity dams (37.5%) were detected positive at week one with M. hyosynoviae and an increase in this proportion to 50% was identified in week three. Only 8.3% of piglets were detected positive for M. hyorhinis in week one compared to week three (50%; p<0.05). The detection of M. hyosynoviae was minimal in piglets at both weeks of sampling (0% and 0.9%). Lameness was scored in pigs 5-22 weeks of age, with the highest score observed at week 5. The correlation between PCR detection and lameness scores revealed that the relative risk of developing lameness post-weaning was significantly associated with detection of M. hyorhinis in piglets at three weeks of age (r = 0.44; p<0.05).The detection pattern of M. hyorhinis and M. hyosynoviae in dams did not reflect the detection pattern in piglets. Results of this study suggest that positive detection of M. hyorhinis in piglets pre-weaning could act as a predictor for lameness development at later production stages."
https://openalex.org/W2907276568,"Background Cardiovascular diseases, including sudden cardiac death (SCD), are the leading cause of death in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a risk factor for SCD in HD patients. This study investigated whether the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval becomes prolonged along with dialysis vintage. Methods A total of 102 HD patients were retrospectively studied. Their ECG data were analyzed at 1, 4, and 7 years after HD initiation. The control group comprised 68 age-matched individuals who had normal renal function and two available ECG reports at an interval of more than 4 years. QTc was measured according to the Bazett formula. The association between QTc interval and dialysis vintage was studied. Additionally, clinically relevant variables related to QTc duration at 1 year after HD initiation were assessed. Results Average QTc interval at 4 and 7 years after HD initiation was significantly longer than that at 1 year after HD initiation (443, 445, and 437 ms) (p<0.05). On the other hand, QTc interval in the control group was 425 ms in the first year and 426 ms after an average of 6 years. They had no significant differences, although they were much shorter than that in HD patients. Multivariate regression analysis of baseline variables revealed that the corrected calcium levels (p = 0.041) and diabetes (p = 0.043) were independently associated with longer QTc interval. Conclusions The QTc interval at 1 year after HD initiation was longer than in the control subjects and was prolonged over several years of HD treatment. Providing clinical management with a focus on QTc interval may be helpful for reducing the incidence of SCD in HD patients."

https://openalex.org/W2907305237,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for synovial chondromatosis (SC) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). In this study, 1415 patients (2109 joints) with temporomandibular joint disorders were collected between January 2012 and January 2017. All patients had a preoperative MRI examination and were treated by either arthroscopy or open surgery. On reviewing all MRI images, the number of ""positive"", ""suspicious"", and ""negative"" cases was collected afterwards, then the number of reported SC cases in operative data was recorded. The SPSS software was used to process all collected data. The kappa coefficient and ROC curve (AUC-index) with sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the consistency between MRI and arthroscopy/open surgery. Compared to 156 joints with SC detected by arthroscopy and open surgery, the results of MRI examination showed ""positive"" in 117 joints, and ""negative"" in 1938 joints. The number of ""true positive"", and ""true negative"" cases was 95, and 1897 respectively. The AUC-index was 0.86 (0.82-0.90) with a kappa coefficient of 0.74 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the incidence of synovial chondromatosis diagnosed on MRI was in accordance with the arthroscopic and open surgery. Therefore, being a relatively non-invasive tool, MRI could be recommended as an effective diagnostic modality for SC."

They were treated with either conservative treatments or intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT). The baseline features and temporal changes of visual field examination results and the association with clinical parameters including visual acuity, optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings, and the CRAO stages.All of the 119 patients showed visual field defect and suffered unilateral acute CRAO. We observed five characteristic VFDs: peripheral constriction only (8%), paracentral scotoma (3%), central and cecocentral scotoma (19%), temporal island (59%), and no visual field (10%). Severe VFDs were associated with severe CRAO stages, poor baseline BCVA, delayed retinal arterial perfusion, and severe retinal morphologic changes on OCT. We found improvements in the visual field in 39% of all cases during the follow-up periods. Mild CRAO stages, good baseline BCVA, mild retinal morphologic changes, and mild initial VFDs were significantly associated with visual field improvement.The five characteristic types of VFDs and their improvement in eyes with CRAO are associated with baseline features related to the severity of retinal ischemia. We suggest that the underlying mechanisms of VFDs involve the balance between the retinal arterial perfusion and the ischemic vulnerability of each retinal area."
https://openalex.org/W2908316132,"To study the association between mode of delivery and offspring BMI in late adolescence in a large cohort that predated the obesity epidemic, and assess the role of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (ppBMI) in this association.We conducted a historical prospective study in the setting of the Jerusalem Perinatal Study (JPS), a population-based cohort that includes all 17,003 births to residents of West Jerusalem, between 1974 and 1976. Offspring's BMI at age 17 was obtained upon army recruitment and was available for 11,001 of cohort participants. The associations were examined using logistic regressions, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and for proxies for indication for C-Section birth. Analyses were then stratified by quartiles of ppBMI.C-Section was associated with offspring overweight/obesity, with adjusted OR of 1.44 (95%CI:1.14-1.82). Significant interaction of ppBMI with mode of delivery was observed, such that the associations of C-Section with overweight/obesity were limited to the upper quartile of ppBMI (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95%CI:1.18-2.43). Restricting the analyses to singleton first births and excluding pregnancies complicated with toxemia and gestational diabetes yielded similar findings.C-Section was positively associated with being overweight/obese at age 17. Importantly, ppBMI modified this association, with a significant association between C-Section and overweight/obesity evident only among offspring born to mothers in the highest ppBMI quartile. In light of the growing rates of obesity in women of reproductive age, these results should be considered in patient-doctor shared decisions related to selection of mode of delivery, in the absence of a clear medical indication."
https://openalex.org/W2906705510,"The aim of this project was to compare the phenotypic responses of global populations of Lythrum salicaria in cold/dry and hot/humid environments to determine if phenotypic plasticity varied between the native and invasive ranges, and secondarily if this variation was linked to genetic diversity. Common garden studies were conducted in Třeboň, Czech Republic, and Lafayette, Louisiana, USA (cold/dry vs. hot/humid garden, respectively), using populations from latitudinal gradients in Eurasia and North America. Lythrum salicaria seeds collected from the same maternal plants across these latitudinal gradients were germinated and grown in Třeboň and Lafayette. Tissue masses (above-, below-ground, inflorescence and total) of these individuals were assessed at the end of each growing season (2006–2008). Worldwide field measurements of L. salicaria height were made by volunteers from 2004–2016. Biomass and height data were analyzed using the General Linear Model framework and multivariate techniques. Molecular markers (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) of individuals used in the common garden study were analyzed using traditional genetic diversity metrics and Bayesian clustering algorithms in STRUCTURE. Reaction norms were developed from differences in maternal plant responses in Třeboň versus Lafayette. In the common garden studies, stem/leaf, root and total biomass generally were highest for individuals grown from seeds collected in the southern part of the range in the cold garden, particularly by the third year of the study. In contrast, inflorescence biomass in the cold garden was higher by the third year in individuals from mid-latitude populations. As measured by volunteers, plants were taller in Eurasia than in North America moving from north to south with the pattern switching southward of 40°N latitude. Genetic diversity was similar between native and non-native invasive populations regardless of geographical origin of the seed and was not significantly different in the GLM Select model (p > 0.05). Reaction norm slopes showed that Eurasia had larger values than North America for reaction norms for above-ground and total biomass. Plants from the seeds of mother plants from Turkey had wide variation in total biomass when grown in Třeboň versus Lafayette; this variation in response within certain populations may have contributed to the lack of population-level differences in plasticity. These results indicate no loss of genetic diversity for L. salicaria during its North American invasion, nor reduction in plastic tissue allocation responses to a varying environment, which may help explain some of its invasive qualities and which could be of adaptive value under changing future environments."
https://openalex.org/W2907897145,"Background Severe anaemia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in sub-Saharan Africa. There is limited research on the beliefs and knowledge for paediatric severe anaemia in the region. The effect of these local beliefs and knowledge on the healthcare seeking of paediatric severe anaemia remains unknown. Objective To describe community perceptions of paediatric severe anaemia in Uganda. Methods Sixteen in-depth interviews of caregivers of children treated for severe anaemia and six focus group discussions of community members were conducted in three regions of Uganda between October and November 2017. Results There was no common local name used to describe paediatric severe anaemia, but the disease was understood in context as ‘having no blood’. Severe anaemia was identified to be a serious disease and the majority felt blood transfusion was the ideal treatment, but concomitant use of traditional and home remedies was also widespread. Participants articulated signs of severe pediatric anemia, such as palmar, conjunctival, and tongue pallor. Other signs described included jaundice, splenomegaly, difficulty in breathing and poor appetite. Poor feeding, malaria, splenomegaly and evil spirits were perceived to be the common causes of severe anaemia. Other causes included: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), haemoglobinuria, fever, witchcraft, mosquito bites, and sickle cell. Splenomegaly and jaundice were perceived to be both signs and causes of severe anaemia. Severe anaemia was interpreted to be caused by evil spirits if it was either recurrent, led to sudden death, or manifested with cold extremities. Conclusion The community in Uganda perceived paediatric severe anaemia as a serious disease. Their understanding of the signs and perceived causes of severe anaemia to a large extent aligned with known clinical signs and biological causes. Belief in evil spirits persists and may be one obstacle to seeking timely medical care for paediatric severe anaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2908156014,"Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) requires a descriptor that is robust to changes in viewing conditions in real time application. Many different descriptors had been proposed in the literature for example floating-point descriptors (SIFT and SURF) and binary descriptors (BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK). According to literature, floating-point descriptors are not suitable for real-time application because its operating speed does not satisfy real-time constraints. Binary descriptors have been developed with compact sizes and lower computation requirements. However, it is unclear which binary descriptors are more appropriate for MAR. Hence, a distinctive and efficient accuracy measurement of four state-of-the-art binary descriptors, namely, BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK were performed using the Mikolajczyk dataset and ALOI dataset to identify the most appropriate descriptor for MAR in terms of computation time and robustness to brightness, scale and rotation changes. The obtained results showed that FREAK is the most appropriate descriptor for MAR application as it able to produce an application that are efficient (shortest computation time) and robust towards scale, rotation and brightness changes."

https://openalex.org/W2907448641,"Purpose In dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, separation of signal contributions from perfusion and leakage requires robust estimation of parameters in a pharmacokinetic model. We present and quantify the performance of a method to compute tissue hemodynamic parameters from DCE data using established pharmacokinetic models. Methods We propose a Bayesian scheme to obtain perfusion metrics from DCE MRI data. Initial performance is assessed through digital phantoms of the extended Tofts model (ETM) and the two-compartment exchange model (2CXM), comparing the Bayesian scheme to the standard Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Digital phantoms are also invoked to identify limitations in the pharmacokinetic models related to measurement conditions. Using computed maps of the extra vascular volume (ve) from 19 glioma patients, we analyze differences in the number of un-physiological high-intensity ve values for both ETM and 2CXM, using a one-tailed paired t-test assuming un-equal variance. Results The Bayesian parameter estimation scheme demonstrated superior performance over the LM technique in the digital phantom simulations. In addition, we identified limitations in parameter reliability in relation to scan duration for the 2CXM. DCE data for glioma and cervical cancer patients was analyzed with both algorithms and demonstrated improvement in image readability for the Bayesian method. The Bayesian method demonstrated significantly fewer non-physiological high-intensity ve values for the ETM (p<0.0001) and the 2CXM (p<0.0001). Conclusion We have demonstrated substantial improvement of the perceptive quality of pharmacokinetic parameters from advanced compartment models using the Bayesian parameter estimation scheme as compared to the LM technique."
https://openalex.org/W2906825353,"Intonation has many perceptually significant functions in language that contribute to speech recognition. This study aims to investigate whether intonation cues affect the unmasking of Mandarin Chinese speech in the presence of interfering sounds. Specifically, intelligibility of multi-tone Mandarin Chinese sentences with maskers consisting of either two-talker speech or steady-state noise was measured in three (flattened, typical, and exaggerated) intonation conditions. Different from most of the previous studies, the present study only manipulate and modify the intonation information but preserve tone information. The results showed that recognition of the final keywords in multi-tone Mandarin Chinese sentences was much better under the original F0 contour condition than the decreased F0 contour or exaggerated F0 contour conditions whenever there was a noise or speech masker, and an exaggerated F0 contour reduced the intelligibility of Mandarin Chinese more under the speech masker condition than that under the noise masker condition. These results suggested that speech in a tone language (Mandarin Chinese) is harder to understand when the intonation is unnatural, even if the tone information is preserved, and an unnatural intonation contour decreases releasing Mandarin Chinese speech from masking, especially in a multi-person talking environment."

https://openalex.org/W2907454635,"We assumed that perimenopausal women's sense of quality of health (SQH) is a subjective evaluation of their psycho-physical health, and comprises three dimensions: sense of quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and the level of positive and negative affect.The aim of the study was to: 1) test a model about SQH, and 2) explore the role of personality traits, self-esteem, body self, and self-stereotype as predictors of SQH.The sample included 201 women aged between 45 and 55 (50.11±3.07). Participants filled out the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Personality Inventory based on the Big Five Factor Model, the Body Self Questionnaire, and a survey querying perimenopausal women's self-stereotype. To determine the individual SQH dimensions we used the Sense of Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Menopause Symptom List, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. To verify the assumptions of the SQH model and look for SQH predictors we conducted a neural networks analysis with structure optimization via genetic algorithms (a multivariate analysis).The SQH model was verified in the course of several neural networks analyses with structure optimization via genetic algorithms (R = 0.849, R2 = 0.723, F = 133,232, p < 0.01). Moreover, we confirmed that SQH comprised three dimensions: quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and affect. SQH and menopausal symptoms were correlated. Similarly, positive and negative affect modified the women's global sense of quality of life. SQH predictors included: personality traits, self-esteem, the body-self, and menopausal woman's self-stereotype.In practical terms, our findings may help raise awareness among women and medical practitioners, calling for a holistic approach to the health of menopausal women. Our findings may also facilitate the creation of both prevention and therapeutic programs for women transitioning through menopause, for example, cognitive-behavioral therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2906874903,"The use of variable-length genomes in evolutionary computation has applications in optimisation when the size of the search space is unknown, and provides a unique environment to study the evolutionary dynamics of genome structure. Here, we revisit crossover for linear genomes of variable length, identifying two crucial attributes of successful recombination algorithms: the ability to retain homologous structure, and to reshuffle variant information. We introduce direct measures of these properties-homology score and linkage score-and use them to review existing crossover algorithms, as well as two novel ones. In addition, we measure the performance of these crossover methods on three different benchmark problems, and find that variable-length genomes out-perform fixed-length variants in all three cases. Our homology and linkage scores successfully explain the difference in performance between different crossover methods, providing a simple and insightful framework for crossover in a variable-length setting."

To that end, 1,000 birds were evaluated by the GS test and 74 were selected for walking speed analyses. Weight at slaughter and breast yield values were obtained for comparisons. Walking speed analyses, both with and without analgesic and with and without stimulus were performed. Non-parametric statistics was applied to the GS data that did not meet the assumptions of the statistical model (normality and homogenicity) using Fisher’s exact test according to the data behavior (P<0.05). The analyses of data on speed, weight at slaughter, and breast yield were evaluated by ANOVA and compared by Tukey’s test (P<0.05). Walking speed differed after acoustic stimulus with or without administration of metamizole sodium. Body weight was also different in each GS. It is thus concluded that the birds may feel discomfort when their GS is higher than 0, but that such discomfort may be suppressed when they are stimulated to walk."
