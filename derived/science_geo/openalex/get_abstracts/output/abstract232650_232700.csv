https://openalex.org/W2030224529,"Large, living biological specimens present challenges to existing optical imaging techniques because of their absorptive and scattering properties. We developed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to generate multidimensional images of samples up to a few millimeters in size. The system combines two-dimensional illumination with orthogonal camera-based detection to achieve high-resolution, optically sectioned imaging throughout the sample, with minimal photodamage and at speeds capable of capturing transient biological phenomena. We used SPIM to visualize all muscles in vivo in the transgenic Medaka line Arnie, which expresses green fluorescent protein in muscle tissue. We also demonstrate that SPIM can be applied to visualize the embryogenesis of the relatively opaque Drosophila melanogaster in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2073988218,"Axonal degeneration is an active program of self-destruction that is observed in many physiological and pathological settings. In Wallerian degeneration slow (wlds) mice, Wallerian degeneration in response to axonal injury is delayed because of a mutation that results in overexpression of a chimeric protein (Wlds) composed of the ubiquitin assembly protein Ufd2a and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthetic enzyme Nmnat1. We demonstrate that increased Nmnat activity is responsible for the axon-sparing activity of the Wlds protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1, a mammalian ortholog of Sir2, is the downstream effector of increased Nmnat activity that leads to axonal protection. These findings suggest that novel therapeutic strategies directed at increasing the supply of NAD and/or Sir2 activation may be effective for treatment of diseases characterized by axonopathy and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1978547782,"RNA transport is an important and fundamental event for local protein synthesis, especially in neurons. RNA is transported as large granules, but little is known about them. Here, we isolated a large RNase-sensitive granule (size: 1000S approximately) as a binding partner of conventional kinesin (KIF5). We identified a total of 42 proteins with mRNAs for CaMKIIalpha and Arc in the granule. Seventeen of the proteins (hnRNP-U, Pur alpha and beta, PSF, DDX1, DDX3, SYNCRIP, TLS, NonO, HSPC117, ALY, CGI-99, staufen, three FMRPs, and EF-1alpha) were extensively investigated, including their classification, binding combinations, and necessity for the ""transport"" of RNA. These proteins and the mRNAs were colocalized to the kinesin-associated granules in dendrites. The granules moved bidirectionally, and the distally directed movement was enhanced by the overexpression of KIF5 and reduced by its functional blockage. Thus, kinesin transports RNA via this granule in dendrites coordinately with opposite motors, such as dynein."
https://openalex.org/W2112323466,"Although the voluntary intake of drugs of abuse is a behavior largely preserved throughout phylogeny, it is currently unclear whether pathological drug use (“addiction”) can be observed in species other than humans. Here, we report that behaviors that resemble three of the essential diagnostic criteria for addiction appear over time in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. As in humans, this addiction-like behavior is present only in a small proportion of subjects using cocaine and is highly predictive of relapse after withdrawal. These findings provide a new basis for developing a true understanding and treatment of addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2161282017,"The zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) in the posterior limb bud produces Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein, which plays a critical role in establishing distinct fates along the anterior-posterior axis. This activity has been modeled as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible morphogen. Using recombinase base mapping in the mouse, we determine the ultimate fate of the Shh-producing cells. Strikingly, the descendants of the Shh-producing cells encompass all cells in the two most posterior digits and also contribute to the middle digit. Our analysis suggests that, while specification of the anterior digits depends upon differential concentrations of Shh, the length of time of exposure to Shh is critical in the specification of the differences between the most posterior digits. Genetic studies of the effects of limiting accessibility of Shh within the limb support this model, in which the effect of the Shh morphogen is dictated by a temporal as well as a spatial gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2155609574,"Cdk4 and Cdk6 are thought to be essential for initiation of the cell cycle in response to mitogenic stimuli. Previous studies have shown that Cdk4 is dispensable for proliferation in most cell types, an observation attributed to a putative compensatory role by Cdk6. Cdk6-null mice are viable and develop normally although hematopoiesis is slightly impaired. Embryos defective for Cdk4 and Cdk6 die during the late stages of embryonic development due to severe anemia. However, these embryos display normal organogenesis and most cell types proliferate normally. In vitro, embryonic fibroblasts lacking Cdk4 and Cdk6 proliferate and become immortal upon serial passage. Moreover, quiescent Cdk4/Cdk6-null cells respond to serum stimulation and enter S phase with normal kinetics although with lower efficiency. These results indicate that D-type cyclin-dependent kinases are not essential for cell cycle entry and suggest the existence of alternative mechanisms to initiate cell proliferation upon mitogenic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2038064315,"Compulsive drug use in the face of adverse consequences is a hallmark feature of addiction, yet there is little preclinical evidence demonstrating the actual progression from casual to compulsive drug use. Presentation of an aversive conditioned stimulus suppressed drug seeking in rats with limited cocaine self-administration experience, but no longer did so after an extended cocaine-taking history. In contrast, after equivalent extended sucrose experience, sucrose seeking was still suppressed by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Persistent cocaine seeking in the presence of signals of environmental adversity after a prolonged cocaine-taking history was not due to impaired fear conditioning, nor to an increase in the incentive value of cocaine, and may reflect the establishment of compulsive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2020330574,"D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) are regarded as essential links between cell environment and the core cell cycle machinery. We tested the requirement for D-cyclins in mouse development and in proliferation by generating mice lacking all D-cyclins. We found that these cyclin D1−/−D2−/−D3−/− mice develop until mid/late gestation and die due to heart abnormalities combined with a severe anemia. Our analyses revealed that the D-cyclins are critically required for the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells. In contrast, cyclin D-deficient fibroblasts proliferate nearly normally but show increased requirement for mitogenic stimulation in cell cycle re-entry. We found that the proliferation of cyclin D1−/−D2−/−D3−/− cells is resistant to the inhibition by p16INK4a, but it critically depends on CDK2. Lastly, we found that cells lacking D-cyclins display reduced susceptibility to the oncogenic transformation. Our results reveal the presence of alternative mechanisms that allow cell cycle progression in a cyclin D-independent fashion."

https://openalex.org/W2037905760,"Hematopoietic stem cell homing and engraftment are crucial to transplantation efficiency, and clinical engraftment is severely compromised when donor-cell numbers are limiting. The peptidase CD26 (DPPIV/dipeptidylpeptidase IV) removes dipeptides from the amino terminus of proteins. We present evidence that endogenous CD26 expression on donor cells negatively regulates homing and engraftment. By inhibition or deletion of CD26, it was possible to increase greatly the efficiency of transplantation. These results suggest that hematopoietic stem cell engraftment is not absolute, as previously suggested, and indicate that improvement of bone marrow transplant efficiency may be possible in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W1786092055,"Arousal and anxiety are behavioral responses that involve complex neurocircuitries and multiple neurochemical components. Here, we report that a neuropeptide, neuropeptide S (NPS), potently modulates wakefulness and could also regulate anxiety. NPS acts by activating its cognate receptor (NPSR) and inducing mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The NPSR mRNA is widely distributed in the brain, including the amygdala and the midline thalamic nuclei. Central administration of NPS increases locomotor activity in mice and decreases paradoxical (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep in rats. NPS was further shown to produce anxiolytic-like effects in mice exposed to four different stressful paradigms. Interestingly, NPS is expressed in a previously undefined cluster of cells located between the locus coeruleus (LC) and Barrington's nucleus. These results indicate that NPS could be a new modulator of arousal and anxiety. They also show that the LC region encompasses distinct nuclei expressing different arousal-promoting neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2056123267,"In the vertebrate limb, the posteriorly located zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulates digit identity through the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). By genetically marking Shh-responding cells in mice, we have addressed whether the cumulative influence of positive Shh signaling over time and space reflects a linear gradient of Shh responsiveness and whether Shh could play additional roles in limb patterning. Our results show that all posterior limb mesenchyme cells, as well as the ectoderm, respond to Shh from the ZPA and become the bone, muscle, and skin of the posterior limb. Further, the readout of Shh activator function integrated over time and space does not display a stable and linear gradient along the A-P axis, as in a classical morphogen view. Finally, by fate mapping Shh-responding cells in Gli2 and Gli3 mutant limbs, we demonstrate that a specific level of positive Hh signaling is not required to specify digit identities."
https://openalex.org/W1988821953,"Chromosome translocations between c-myc and immunoglobulin (Ig) are associated with Burkitt's lymphoma in humans and with pristane- and IL6-induced plasmacytomas in mice. These translocations frequently involve Ig switch regions, suggesting that they might be the result of aberrant Ig class switch recombination (CSR). However, a direct link between CSR and chromosome translocations has not been established. We have examined c-myc/IgH translocations in IL6 transgenic mice that are mutant for activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme that initiates CSR. Here we report that AID is essential for the c-myc/IgH chromosome translocations induced by IL6."
https://openalex.org/W2062308315,"Colonies of the Caribbean coral Montastraea cavernosa exhibit a solar-stimulated orange-red fluorescence that is spectrally similar to a variety of fluorescent proteins expressed by corals. The source of this fluorescence is phycoerythrin in unicellular, nonheterocystis, symbiotic cyanobacteria within the host cells of the coral. The cyanobacteria coexist with the symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) of the coral and express the nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase. The presence of this prokaryotic symbiont in a nitrogen-limited zooxanthellate coral suggests that nitrogen fixation may be an important source of this limiting element for the symbiotic association."
https://openalex.org/W2017780187,"The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates a wide variety of genes involved in multiple processes. Although the apparent consensus sequence of DNA binding sites for NF-kappaB (kappaB sites) is very broad, the sites active in any one gene show remarkable evolutionary stability. Using a lentivirus-based methodology for implantation of gene regulatory sequences we show that for genes with two kappaB sites, both are required for activity. Swapping sites between kappaB-dependent genes altered NF-kappaB dimer specificity of the promoters and revealed that two kappaB sites can function together as a module to regulate gene activation. Further, although the sequence of the kappaB site is important for determining kappaB family member specificity, rather than determining the ability of a particular dimer to bind effectively, the sequence affects which coactivators will form productive interactions with the bound NF-kappaB dimer. This suggests that binding sites may impart a specific configuration to bound transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2166760304,"Mechanistic analysis of transcriptional initiation and termination by RNA polymerase II (PolII) indicates that some factors are common to both processes. Here we show that two long genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FMP27 and SEN1, exist in a looped conformation, effectively bringing together their promoter and terminator regions. We also show that PolII is located at both ends of FMP27 when this gene is transcribed from a GAL1 promoter under induced and noninduced conditions. Under these conditions, the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of PolII is phosphorylated at Ser5. Notably, inactivation of Kin28p causes a loss of both Ser5 phosphorylation and the loop conformation. These data suggest that gene loops are involved in the early stages of transcriptional activation. They also predict a previously unknown structural dimension to gene regulation, in which both ends of the transcription unit are defined before and during the transcription cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2019866708,"RAB, ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and ARF-like (ARL) proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and are essential for various membrane-associated intracellular trafficking processes. None of the approximately 50 known members of this family are linked to human disease. Using a bioinformatic screen for ciliary genes in combination with mutational analyses, we identified ARL6 as the gene underlying Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3, a multisystemic disorder characterized by obesity, blindness, polydactyly, renal abnormalities and cognitive impairment. We uncovered four different homozygous substitutions in ARL6 in four unrelated families affected with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, two of which disrupt a threonine residue important for GTP binding and function of several related small GTP-binding proteins. Analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans ARL6 homolog indicates that it is specifically expressed in ciliated cells, and that, in addition to the postulated cytoplasmic functions of ARL proteins, it undergoes intraflagellar transport. These findings implicate a small GTP-binding protein in ciliary transport and the pathogenesis of a pleiotropic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2116282320,"Human telomeres contain two related telomeric DNA-binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2. The TRF1 complex contains the TRF1 interacting partner, TIN2, as well as PIP1 and POT1 and regulates telomere-length homeostasis. The TRF2 complex is primarily involved in telomere protection and contains the TRF2 interacting partner human (h)Rap1 as well as several factors involved in the DNA damage response. A prior report showed that conditional deletion of murine TRF1 reduced the presence of TRF2 on telomeres. Here we showed that TRF2 is also lost from human telomeres upon TRF1 depletion with small interfering RNA prompting a search for the connection between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes. Using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that TRF1, TIN2, PIP1, and POT1 are associated with the TRF2-hRap1 complex. Gel filtration identified a TRF2 complex containing TIN2 and POT1 but not TRF1 indicating that TRF1 is not required for this interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation, Far-Western assays, and two-hybrid assays showed that TIN2, but not POT1 or PIP1, interacts directly with TRF2. Furthermore, TIN2 was found to bind TRF1 and TRF2 simultaneously, showing that TIN2 can link these telomeric proteins. This connection appeared to stabilize TRF2 on the telomeres as the treatment of cells with TIN2 small interfering RNA resulted in a decreased presence of TRF2 and hRap1 at chromosome ends.

The TTAGGG repeat arrays of mammalian telomeres associate with two related telomeric DNA-binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2 (1Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hanish J.

These factors have closely related C-terminal Myb-type DNA binding domains and bind TTAGGG sequences as dimers or higher order oligomers. Dimerization is mediated by the TRF-homology domain, the signature motif of this family of telomeric proteins (4Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T.

ADP-ribosylation of TRF1 impedes its DNA binding activity in vitro, and tankyrase overexpression removes TRF1 from the telomeres and promotes its degradation.

The cell-lethal phenotype of Trf1 loss would not be expected if Trf1 solely acted to regulate telomere length and suggests that Trf1 may be contributing to telomere protection.

These findings suggest that the lethal phenotype of TRF1 deficiency is because of a defect in telomere protection by TRF2. siRNA Experiments—Double-stranded siRNA was generated to target human TRF1 mRNA at nucleotides 102–120 (CGACGAGGAGCAGTTCGAA). TIN2 and green fluorescent protein siRNAs have been described previously (12Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Sequences for the control siRNA to luciferase and the TRF2 siRNA are available upon request. HeLa cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) using a protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Specifically, 5 × 105 cells were inoculated to a 6-cm culture dish and after 16–24 h were subjected to two sequential transfections separated by a 24-h interval. Shortly after the second transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated to glass coverslips placed in a 10-cm culture dish. Cells were either fixed at 48 h after the initial transfection for IF, or protein for immunoblots was isolated after 72 h (12Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the hRap1 Complex—For isolation of hRap1 complexes from HeLaS3 cells, two retroviral vectors based on pLPC were generated by introducing a FLAG-HA-HA tag (FH2) in a N- or C-terminal position (details available on request). Human Rap1 cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned separately into either the N or C terminally tagged constructs and sequenced. These constructs were transfected into amphotrophic Phoenix cells using calcium phosphate and the retroviral stocks were prepared for infection of semi-adherent HeLaS3 cells. Clones expressing tagged hRap1 were selected using puromycin (2 μg/ml) and isolated with cloning cylinders. The efficiency of N and C terminally tagged hRap1 in forming a complex with endogenous TRF2 and TRF1, were tested by co-immunoprecipitations (IP). HeLa S3 clones that expressed tagged hRap1 at a level 5–10-fold above that of endogenous hRap1 protein were selected for purification. Cells were grown in suspension culture (20 liters) at 37 °C to a density between 0.9 and 1.2 × 106/ml. Cell harvest, extraction of nuclear proteins, sequential binding to affinity matrix, and peptide elutions were performed according to published procedures (37Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) except that commercial affinity resins were used (anti-FLAG M2 resin from Sigma and anti-HA 3F10 resin from Roche). Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient, Invitrogen). The entire gel lane was sliced into 29 2-mm pieces, and the proteins in each gel piece were subjected to trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were extracted and the proteins identified using a combination of two different mass spectrometers. First, tryptic mass maps of proteins from each gel piece were obtained using an in-house-constructed MALDIQqTOF mass spectrometer, and second, fragmentation spectra of all the discernable tryptic peptides were obtained using an in-house-constructed MALDI-ion trap mass spectrometer (38Krutchinsky A.N. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5066-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 39Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Accurate masses of the tryptic peptides and the masses of their fragments were used to identify proteins in each gel piece with the computer search engine XProteo. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—The nuclear extract was prepared from HeLaS3 cells expressing N-FH2-TIN2 and C-FH2-TRF1 (15Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and precleared by Sepharose CL-4B for 30 min at 4 °C. A typical IP contained 200 μl of precleared nuclear extract (5–6 mg/ml) and various antibodies (anti-FLAG (M2), 4–6 μg; anti-HA (3F10),1.0–1.2 μg; antimyc (9E10, Oncogene), 0.6–1.0 μg; polyclonal anti-TRF1 (number 371), 0.6–1.0 μg; polyclonal anti-TIN2 (number 865), 0.6–1.0 μg)). After rotating for 2–3 h at 4 °C, 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (settled volume) were added to each IP (beads were preblocked o/n with 10% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline), and the tubes were rotated for another hour. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted with Laemmli loading buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (15Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Where indicated, ethidium bromide or RNase A was added to 100 μg/ml during the IP. For peptide blocking controls, FLAG or HA peptide was added to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml or 500 μg/ml, respectively, together with M2 or 3F10 antibody. Co-IPs of proteins from 293T cells were performed as described previously (12Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For co-IPs of TRF1 and TRF2 from BJ/hTERT cells, cells were retrovirally infected with FLAG-tagged TRF1 or vector alone and were expanded on 15-cm plates. At confluency, cells were trypsinized, collected, washed in 10× pellet volume phosphate-buffered saline, washed in 10× pellet volume resuspension buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA), and resuspended in 10× pellet volume lysis buffer (resuspension buffer with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche)). The cell lysate was kept on ice for 10 min with occasional mixing, and the nuclei were collected by centrifugation, washed in resuspension buffer, and then resuspended in 3× pellet volume nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet). The nuclear extract was kept on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing, the lysate (derived from ∼3 × 108 cells) was centrifuged, and the supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of water. The diluted supernatant was incubated with 100 μl (settled volume) of bovine serum albumin-blocked Sepharose 6B beads for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged, removed from the beads, incubated with 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 20 min on ice (yielding the IP input), and then incubated with 100 μl (settled volume) of bovine serum albumin-blocked FLAG beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then incubated with 120 μl of elution buffer (wash buffer with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide). Gel Filtration—Nuclear extract from HeLaS3 cells (10 ml, 8 mg protein/ml) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against BC150/40% glycerol (20 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and cleared by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 30 min. The dialyzed sample (∼5 ml) was loaded to a Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) column (2.5 cm × 70 cm, ∼350 ml of packed volume) that was equilibrated with BC150/20% glycerol. Proteins were fractionated with BC150/20% glycerol at a linear flow rate of 25 ml/h, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Blue dextran (2 MDa) appears at the end of the void volume (approximately one-third of column volume), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) appears at approximately two-thirds of the column volume). Two-hybrid Interactions—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (15Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Far-Western Analysis—Two micrograms of purified protein derived from Sf21 insect cells or Escherichia coli were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated in blocking buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5% milk) for 3 h at 4 °C. Following the blocking step, the blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with 35S-labeled in vitro translated (IVT) protein prepared using the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) (a 50-μl reaction mixture in 5 ml of blocking buffer). The next morning, the blots were washed five times every 30 min in wash buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% milk) and then incubated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. The blots were exposed on a PhosphorImager screen overnight. For the modified Far-Western experiment, the blots were incubated with 4 μg of baculovirus-derived TIN2 in 5 ml of blocking buffer after the blocking step, washed three times every 5 min in wash buffer, and processed as described above. TRF1 RNAi Results in Reduced TRF2 and hRap1 Signals at Telomeres—In mouse ES cells, a conditional deletion of the Trf1 gene results in partial loss of Trf2 from chromosome ends. To verify that this effect also takes place in human cells, we used RNAi to TRF1. HeLa cells were transfected with TRF1 or control siRNAs and processed for immunofluorescence after 48 h. At this time point, TRF1 protein levels and the TRF1 IF signals are severely reduced (Fig. 1). Concomitant with the loss of TRF1 from telomeres, we observed a reduction in the IF signals of TRF2 and hRap1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Approximately 80% of the nuclei showed diminished TRF1 signals (n = 200), and of these 95% also showed a loss of the typical punctate pattern of TRF2 and hRap1 at telomeres. TRF1 RNAi did not affect the levels of TRF2 and hRap1 proteins as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C), suggesting that TRF2/hRap1 are still present but have a diminished ability to accumulate at chromosome ends. When IF was performed without treatment with Triton X-100, which removes nucleoplasmic proteins, TRF2 and hRap1 were detected throughout the nucleus in cells treated with TRF1 siRNA, whereas control cells showed a punctate telomeric pattern under these conditions (data not shown). These data showed that TRF1 inhibition affects the accumulation of the TRF2 complex on telomeres in the human cells as it does in mouse ES cells. Detection of TIN2, PIP1, and POT1 in Association with TRF1 and TRF2—A possible explanation for the effect of TRF1 siRNA on TRF2 is the presence of a proteinaceous link between these two complexes that stabilizes TRF2 on telomeres. To find TRF1- and TRF2-interacting factors that might represent such a linking factor, we performed mass spectrometry on isolated TRF1 and TRF2 complexes. To identify components of the TRF2-hRap1 complex, HeLa cells with moderate overexpression of hRap1 tagged with a dual N-terminal FLAG-HA-HA cassette (FH2-hRap1) were used for the affinity purification of the hRap1 complex following a protocol established for telomeric complexes (15Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). As expected from previous work (23Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 24Zhu X.D. Niedernhofer L. Kuster B. Mann M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), mass spectrometry identified TRF2 and Rad50 in association with hRap1. In addition, peptides derived from TRF1, PIP1, and POT1 were detected in two independent isolates of the hRap1 complex but not when vector control cells were subjected to the same procedure. Similarly, we identified peptides derived from TRF2 and hRap1 in a TRF1-TIN2 complex that was isolated from HeLa cells using the same dual affinity purification scheme (15Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the report of Songyang and co-workers (14Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; Google Scholar), who identified TRF2 and hRap1 in association with TIN2 by mass spectrometry. The presence of TRF1 in the purified FH2-hRap1 complex was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B), which showed that ∼5–10% of the endogenous TRF1 could be recovered in association with the hRap1 complex. Extracts from vector control cells did not yield TRF1, and as an additional control, an irrelevant nuclear protein (the RNA-binding protein p54(nrb); (40Kameoka S. Duque P. Konarska M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) was not present in the hRap1 complex. Immunoblotting also verified the specific association of TRF2 and hRap1 with affinity purified TRF1-TIN2 complexes from cells expressing FH2-TRF1 and FH2-TIN2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The association between TRF1 and the TRF2 complex was not a specific feature of the HeLa cells used for these experiments, because it was also noted in a different cell line, BJ/hTERT cells, expressing FLAG-tagged TRF1 (Fig. 3C). We next tested whether the association between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes was because of tethering by nucleic acid. The addition of ethidium bromide to cell extracts at a concentration that releases TRF2 from DNA in vitro did not affect the interaction of TRF2/hRap1 with the TRF1 complex (Fig. 3, C and D). Similarly, RNase A treatment did not affect the recovery of TRF2 and hRap1 in the TRF1/TIN2 IPs (Fig. 3D), arguing against tethering by RNA. However, when the TRF1-TIN2 complex was treated with high salt (450 mm KCl), the association with TRF2 and hRap1 was severely diminished (Fig. 3E). The salt sensitivity of the interaction between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes can explain why TRF1 and its associated factors were not recovered in a previously analyzed TRF2 complex that isolated from a high salt heparin chromatography fraction (23Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 24Zhu X.D. Niedernhofer L. Kuster B. Mann M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Telomeric Complexes Analyzed by Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was used to gain further insight into the interaction between the TRF2 complex and the TRF1 complex. Endogenous telomeric protein complexes of HeLa cells were size-fractionated and constituent proteins were identified by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). We detected a TRF2-hRap1 complex (complex III) in the lower molecular mass range that appeared to lack the other telomeric proteins. This is consistent with the direct interaction between these two factors (22Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The fractions in the 2 MDa range (the exclusion limit of the column) contained tankyrase 1, TRF1, TIN2, POT1, TRF2, and hRap1. Although the co-elution of these proteins could be because of the presence of a single large complex, it is also possible that these high molecular mass fractions contain multiple complexes that each have a molecular mass in the ∼2-MDa range or that they are held together by DNA. The most informative complex was recovered in fractions 24–26 (complex II), which contained TRF2, hRap1, TIN2, and POT1 but lacked TRF1 and tankyrase 1. The reduced presence of TRF1 in these fractions suggested that the association of TIN2 and POT1 with TRF2/hRap1 is not mediated by TRF1. The lack of requirement for TRF1 in this association further confirms that DNA tethering is an unlikely source of the connection between the telomeric complexes and points to an association of either TIN2 or POT1 or one of their interacting partners with the TRF2-hRap1 complex. Direct Binding of TIN2 to TRF2 and TRF1—Because TIN2 and POT1 appeared to be shared between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes, we tested these factors and their common binding partner PIP1 for interactions with TRF2"

Because H. pylori is rarely found in deeper portions of the gastric mucosa, where O -glycans are expressed that have terminal α1,4-linked N -acetylglucosamine, we tested whether these O -glycans might affect H. pylori growth. Here, we report that these O -glycans have antimicrobial activity against H. pylori , inhibiting its biosynthesis of cholesteryl-α-D-glucopyranoside, a major cell wall component. Thus, the unique O -glycans in gastric mucin appeared to function as a natural antibiotic, protecting the host from H. pylori infection."

Here we show that inherited microdeletions in the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR) that abolish two CTCF target sites cause this disease. Maternal transmission of the deletions results in hypermethylation of the H19 DMR, biallelic IGF2 expression, H19 silencing and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, indicative of loss of function of the IGF2-H19 imprinting control element."
https://openalex.org/W1995383156,"Internal initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is accomplished by recruitment of ribosomes to structured internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which are located in certain viral and cellular messenger RNAs. An IRES element in cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) can directly assemble 80S ribosomes in the absence of canonical initiation factors and initiator tRNA. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the CrPV IRES bound to the human ribosomal 40S subunit and to the 80S ribosome. The CrPV IRES adopts a defined, elongate structure within the ribosomal intersubunit space and forms specific contacts with components of the ribosomal A, P, and E sites. Conformational changes in the ribosome as well as within the IRES itself show that CrPV IRES actively manipulates the ribosome. CrPV-like IRES elements seem to act as RNA-based translation factors."
https://openalex.org/W2067626761,"The contractile tail of bacteriophage T4 undergoes major structural transitions when the virus attaches to the host cell surface. The baseplate at the distal end of the tail changes from a hexagonal to a star shape. This causes the sheath around the tail tube to contract and the tail tube to protrude from the baseplate and pierce the outer cell membrane and the cell wall before reaching the inner cell membrane for subsequent viral DNA injection. Analogously, the T4 tail can be contracted by treatment with 3 M urea. The structure of the T4 contracted tail, including the head-tail joining region, has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy to 17 Å resolution. This 1200 Å-long, 20 MDa structure has been interpreted in terms of multiple copies of its approximately 20 component proteins. A comparison with the metastable hexagonal baseplate of the mature virus shows that the baseplate proteins move as rigid bodies relative to each other during the structural change."
https://openalex.org/W2131624747,"Ca2+ has been proposed to regulate Na+ channels through the action of calmodulin (CaM) bound to an IQ motif or through direct binding to a paired EF hand motif in the Nav1 C terminus. Mutations within these sites cause cardiac arrhythmias or autism, but details about how Ca2+ confers sensitivity are poorly understood. Studies on the homologous Cav1.2 channel revealed non-canonical CaM interactions, providing a framework for exploring Na+ channels. In contrast to previous reports, we found that Ca2+ does not bind directly to Na+ channel C termini. Rather, Ca2+ sensitivity appears to be mediated by CaM bound to the C termini in a manner that differs significantly from CaM regulation of Cav1.2. In Nav1.2 or Nav1.5, CaM bound to a localized region containing the IQ motif and did not support the large Ca2+-dependent conformational change seen in the Cav1.2·CaM complex. Furthermore, CaM binding to Nav1 C termini lowered Ca2+ binding affinity and cooperativity among the CaM-binding sites compared with CaM alone. Nonetheless, we found suggestive evidence for Ca2+/CaM-dependent effects upon Nav1 channels. The R1902C autism mutation conferred a Ca2+-dependent conformational change in Nav1.2 C terminus·CaM complex that was absent in the wild-type complex. In Nav1.5, CaM modulates the Cterminal interaction with the III–IV linker, which has been suggested as necessary to stabilize the inactivation gate, to minimize sustained channel activity during depolarization, and to prevent cardiac arrhythmias that lead to sudden death.

For both cases, the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) is an obligate channel subunit that serves as the Ca2+ sensor (3Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T.

Previously, the model for CaM action had been enzymatic activation through disinhibition; binding of Ca2+/CaM to an autoinhibitory peptide, usually an amphipathic α-helix, exposes the active site of an enzyme (6Hoeflich K.P.

In contrast, biochemical, functional, and structural analyses of CaM regulation of SK and Cav1.2 channels revealed that these channels contain large CaM-binding pockets in their cytoplasmic C termini composed of multiple noncontiguous sequences (3Xia X.M.

Furthermore, although the details of CaM binding and Ca2+/CaM action differ between the SK and Cav1.2 channels, both constitutively bind apoCaM, which sits poised as a resident Ca2+ sensor.

Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), IQ motifs were subsequently found in apoCaM-binding proteins such as neuromodulin (14Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7544-7549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many proteins containing CaM-binding IQ motifs have now been identified (15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), providing a loose consensus sequence of IQXXXRXXXXR for identifying additional CaM-binding proteins. The voltage-gated Na+ channels form one family of ion channels in which an IQ motif has been identified. After identifying CaM as binding partner for the Nav1.2 C terminus in a yeast two-hybrid screen, Mori et al. (16Mori M. Konno T. Ozawa T. Murata M. Imoto K. Nagayama K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) recognized an IQ motif in their bait construct at a position homologous to the IQ motif in Cav1.2. This led to a series of studies looking for Ca2+/CaM regulation of Na+ channel function (17Tan H.L. Kupershmidt S. Zhang R. Stepanovic S. Roden D.M. Wilde A.A. Anderson M.E. Balser J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Deschenes I. Neyroud N. DiSilvestre D. Marban E. Yue D.T. Tomaselli G.F. Circ.

Because Na+ channels initiate the rapid upstroke of the cardiac and neuronal action potentials, Ca2+/CaM regulation of Na+ channel activity offers an intriguing way for the fine-tuning of membrane excitability. The clinical implications of such regulation are underscored by findings that mutations within or near the IQ motif are pathogenic. Mutations in the major cardiac sodium channel (Nav1.5) are arrhythmogenic, placing patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (20Makita N. Horie M. Nakamura T. Ai T. Sasaki K. Yokoi H. Sakurai M. Sakuma I. Otani H. Sawa H. Kitabatake A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Rook M.B. Bezzina Alshinawi C. Groenewegen W.A. van Gelder I.C. van Ginneken A.C. Jongsma H.J. Mannens M.M. Wilde A.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and a mutation in a neuronal sodium channel (Nav1.2) is associated with a familial form of autism (22Weiss L.A. Escayg A. Kearney J.A. Trudeau M. MacDonald B.T. Mori M. Reichert J. Buxbaum J.D. Meisler M.H. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Because of the homology between Na+ and Ca2+ channels with respect to their IQ motifs and the location of these motifs within the channels, the search for a defined role for Ca2+/CaM in Na+ channel function followed the model originally developed for Cav1.2, in which interactions of Ca2+/CaM with the IQ motif in Cav1.2 accelerate channel inactivation (2Budde T. Meuth S. Pape H.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Studies with similar approaches on three different Na+ channels yielded inconsistent results, however (17Tan H.L. Kupershmidt S. Zhang R. Stepanovic S. Roden D.M. Wilde A.A. Anderson M.E. Balser J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Deschenes I. Neyroud N. DiSilvestre D. Marban E. Yue D.T. Tomaselli G.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: E49-E57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Herzog R.I. Liu C. Waxman S.G. Cummins T.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8261-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that Ca2+/CaM may regulate Na+ channels in an isoform-specific manner (19Herzog R.I. Liu C. Waxman S.G. Cummins T.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8261-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this cannot explain the conflicting results with common isoforms among these studies. Direct binding of Ca2+ to a paired EF hand motif in Nav1.5 channels has recently been proposed as an alternative mode of Ca2+ regulation (23Wingo T.L. Shah V.N. Anderson M.E. Lybrand T.P. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Structural modeling of the proximal portion of the Nav1.5 C terminus had predicted overall homology to the N-terminal lobe of CaM, but unlikely binding capacity for Ca2+, since many key acidic residues used for specific Ca2+ binding in CaM are not conserved in the Nav1.5 C terminus (24Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.-S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the new model presented by Wingo et al. (23Wingo T.L. Shah V.N. Anderson M.E. Lybrand T.P. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and their functional analysis of a pro-arrhythmic mutation within this region, if correct, could offer an explanation for the differences reported among the studies focused on CaM. New information on CaM interaction with and regulation of Ca2+ channels (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) has offered a mirror with which to reexamine CaM interaction with Na+ channels. The specific rationale for this approach derives from the appreciation that CaM interaction domains cannot be predicted from the primary amino acid sequence, as demonstrated by the crystal structures of CaM in complex with SK channels and B. anthracis edema factor (9Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 10Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and highlighted by the recent work on CaM regulation of Cav1.2 (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If sequences outside the IQ motif are essential for CaM binding and regulation of Nav1 channels, as they are with Cav1.2, then a more systematic approach than the original focus on the IQ motifs might yield more definitive results. Another motivation for this approach came from the specific biochemical tools developed for understanding Ca2+/CaM regulation of Cav1.2 (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which offered new opportunities for exploring Ca2+/CaM interaction with Nav1 channels. With this framework, we explored the biochemistry of CaM interaction with the C termini of both Nav1.2 and Nav1.5. These are two potentially informative isoforms because both have pathogenic mutations in or near the IQ motif that offer the possibility to further define a role for CaM regulation of channel function. Computational Analysis—Sequence alignment of the C terminus of Cav1.2 (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number X15539), Nav1.2 (accession number M94055), and Nav1.5 (accession number M77235) was performed using Proteinsolve (Stratagene) based on a modified version of the Boyko weight matrix (26Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure prediction of the Cav1.2 C terminus was determined using Proteinsolve based on the consensus prediction from multiple methods (homology, hydrophobic moment, GOR (40Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar), Chou-Fasman (41Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 42Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar), and motifbased), and prediction of Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 C termini was based on previous work by Cormier et al. (24Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.-S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Construction of cDNA Plasmids—A cDNA encoding the C terminus of Nav1.2 was purchased from Open Biosystems after identifying an appropriate expressed sequence tag. DNA sequences corresponding to amino acids 1777–1937 of Nav1.2 and amino acids 1773–1940 of Nav1.5 were amplified by PCR with primers containing endonuclease restriction sites. Products were digested with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into pET28a+ (Novagen) to produce cDNAs encoding His6-tagged proteins. The CaM expression plasmid has been described (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene). Protein Expression and Purification—BL21 cells were transformed by electroporation with the appropriate plasmid(s). A 10-ml starter culture was grown with the appropriate antibiotic(s) for 2 h at 37 °Cand then transferred to 1-liter flasks, where the culture was grown until A600 = 0.3. The culture flasks were cooled in an ice-water bath, and protein expression was induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 72 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 5 mm imidazole, and 25% glycerol (pH 7.5) supplemented with EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and bacterial cell lysates were prepared by passage through a French pressure cell. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and the supernatants were then applied to Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). The proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C in 25% glycerol for further use. Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration was performed over a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column on an AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) supplemented with CaCl2 (10 μm) or EGTA (5 mm). The following protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used to calibrate the elutions: aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (26 kDa). Protein Concentration Determination—The concentration of CaM was determined by UV absorbance at 277 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 3300 m-1 cm-1. The concentration of CaM in complex with fusion proteins of Nav1 C termini was determined based on a standard of known CaM concentrations, as described above, on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Before obtaining fluorescence spectra, all solutions and proteins were treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad) to remove any Ca2+ present. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Photon Technology International QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer in a 2-ml quartz cuvette (Hellma) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl. Intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence spectra were obtained at λex = 280 nm and monitored for fluorescent emission between 290 and 390 nm. Spectra for 5 μm CaM alone and in complex with the fusion proteins of Nav1 C termini were obtained upon sequential addition of 100 μm EGTA, 140 μm CaCl2, and 400 μm EGTA. Ca2+ titration experiments were carried out with Ca2+ buffers containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and various concentrations of CaCl2 and EGTA. Free Ca2+ concentrations were precalibrated in buffers obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. or calculated using WEBMAXC STANDARD (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html) to obtain buffers with a range of free Ca2+ concentrations not well represented by the available buffer set. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—The GST-Nav1.5 III–IV linker fusion protein and the GST control were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The Nav1 C terminus·CaM fusion protein complex was incubated with bound GST or GST-Nav1.5 III–IV linker for 60 min at 25 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EGTA. The bound complexes were then washed extensively with the appropriate buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Expression of Recombinant Na+ Channels and Electrophysiology—Na+ channels were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells at 22 °C as described previously (27Abriel H. Cabo C. Wehrens X.H. Rivolta I. Motoike H.K. Memmi M. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CD8-positive cells were identified using Dynabeads (M-450, Dynal, Inc.) and were patch-clamped 48 h after transfection. Membrane currents were measured using whole cell patch-clamp procedures with Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Protocols and solutions for measurement of Na+ channel current tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel currents and sustained caret (Isus) are described in detail in a previous publication (28Clancy C.E. Tateyama M. Liu H. Wehrens X.H. Kass R.S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2233-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As a first step in using insights from the recent work on Cav1.2·CaM (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) to analyze CaM binding to Nav1 channels, we aligned the primary sequences of Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 C termini with the Cav1.2 C terminus and looked for similarities within the regions found important for CaM interaction with the Cav1.2 C terminus (Fig. 1A). We especially focused on homology outside the IQ motif, as identification of additional regions that contribute to CaM interaction in the Nav1 channels could provide important insight into CaM interaction and function. The Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 sequences are very similar to each other (76% identical) in this proximal portion of the C terminus. Compared with the Cav1.2 sequence, they show significant similarity (18 and 19% identical, respectively) that extends throughout the entire region. Secondary structure predictions of the Na+ and Ca2+ channel C termini also showed remarkable correlations (Fig. 1A). These results led us to hypothesize that CaM interaction with Na+ channels may also involve multiple noncontiguous sequences in addition to the IQ motifs. We next tested whether we could isolate a stable complex between CaM and the C terminus of Nav1.2 or Nav1.5. Generation of a complex between CaM and the C terminus of Cav1.2 was a particularly helpful tool in identifying the Cav1.2 CaM-binding pocket. We first tested whether coexpression of CaM is necessary to maintain solubility of the Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 C termini in a bacterial expression system since this requirement formed a linchpin in our model of CaM interaction with Cav1.2 (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When we expressed amino acids 1777–1937 of Nav1.2 or amino acids 1773–1940 of Nav1.5 (referred to as Nav1.2 CT or Nav1.5 CT, respectively, to designate the His6-tagged fusion proteins), corresponding to the Cav1.2 construct previously tested (amino acids 1507–1669), little of the material in the cell extract was soluble in either case (Fig. 1B), similar to when the construct of the Cav1.2 C terminus was expressed alone. With CaM coexpression, however, the Nav1 C termini (CTs) remained soluble. CaM co-purified with the His6-tagged Nav1.2 or Nav1.5 CT on a metal affinity column with an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 1B). Each complex migrated on a gel filtration column as a single species, heterodimers with an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 1C). The ability of CaM to bind Ca2+ was not necessary for generation of these soluble complexes since we also obtained abundant soluble material when either of the Nav1 CTs was coexpressed with CaM1234, a mutant in which Ca2+ binding to all four EF hands is lost (data not shown); this complex migrated on the gel filtration column identically to one with wild-type (WT) CaM in either Ca2+ or EGTA. These results show that the Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 CTs are able to form stable complexes with Ca2+/CaM and apoCaM, suggesting that CaM interaction with these Na+ channels, as with Cav1.2, is constitutive and Ca2+-independent. We next tested whether the Nav1.2 CT·CaM or Nav1.5 CT·CaM complex displayed an altered mobility on a gel filtration column. Since the Ca2+-induced mobility shift of the Cav1.2·CaM complex was interpreted as the conformational change that underlies Ca2+-dependent gating and provided an important part of the model for CaM regulation of Cav1.2 (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a similar Ca2+-dependent conformational change in Nav1 CT·CaM complexes would be informative. For the Nav1 CT·CaM complexes, we did not detect any difference in mobility in either EGTA- or 10 μm Ca2+-containing buffer (Fig. 1C). This result raised the possibility that the Nav1 CT·CaM complexes are Ca2+-insensitive. Alternatively, Ca2+ interaction with the Nav1 CT·CaM complexes might induce a change not detectable by gel filtration chromatography. We therefore looked for Ca2+ enhancement of intrinsic Tyr fluorescence as a more sensitive test of Ca2+ binding to CaM. This well characterized property reports changes in the hydrophobicity of the environment near Tyr99 and Tyr138 in the CaM C-terminal lobe that occur as a result of a local conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding (29Wallace R.W. Tallant E.A. Dockter M.E. Cheung W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as demonstrated in Fig. 2C. For the Ca2+-insensitive CaM1234 mutant, there was no Ca2+ enhancement of Tyr fluorescence (Fig. 2F). By this measure, Ca2+ clearly bound to the C-terminal lobe of CaM when in complex with either the Nav1.2 or Nav1.5 CT (Fig. 2, A and B). Ca2+ enhanced the intrinsic Tyr fluorescence (black circles; λem = 308 nm) of both the Nav1.2 CT·CaM and Nav1.5 CT·CaM complexes, which was completely reversed by the addition of EGTA. Sequential addition of Ca2+ and EGTA to the same sample ensured that the increase in intensity was a property of the protein and not a result of changes in protein concentration due to pipetting errors. To rule out that the Tyr fluorescence enhancement was confounded by Ca2+-induced changes in the fluorescent properties of the five additional Tyr residues in Nav1.2 or the three in Nav1.5, we repeated these studies with Nav1 CT·CaM1234 complexes and found no Ca2+-enhanced Tyr fluorescence (Fig. 2, D–F). For CaM in complex with either the Nav1.2 or Nav1.5 CT, the apparent K0.5 for Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal lobes showed an ∼6-fold increase (K0.5 = 12.6 ± 2.8 μm for Nav1.2 CT·CaM, 12.6 ± 3.9 μm for Nav1.5 CT·CaM, and 1.9 ± 0.2 μm for CaM alone; n = 3) and a loss of the cooperativity between the Ca2+-binding sites (Fig. 2I). We also tested for Ca2+ binding to a putative EF hand motif within the Nav1 proteins (23Wingo T.L. Shah V.N. Anderson M.E. Lybrand T.P. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of a single conserved Trp residue (Trp1802 in Nav1.2 and Trp1798 in Nav1.5) located in the Nav1 EF hand motifs. Since CaM does not contain Trp, changes in the fluorescence could be attributed to Ca2+ binding to the Nav1 EF hand motifs. With selective Trp excitation at λex = 295 nm, we observed peak emission at 325 nm that was insensitive to Ca2+ (Fig. 2, G and H). Results with the Nav1.2 construct similarly showed no Ca2+-sensitive changes. In addition, we did not detect any Ca2+-dependent increase in intrinsic Trp fluorescence for either the Nav1.2 or Nav1.5 CT in complex with CaM1234 with excitation at λex = 280 nm (Fig. 2, D–F). Together with the Tyr fluorescence studies, these data demonstrate that Ca2+ binds to CaM in complex with the Nav1 CTs, but not to the Nav1 CTs themselves. The subsequent conformational change is markedly restricted compared with Cav1.2 (8Kim J. Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), however, as indicated by the lack of an apparent shift in migration on the gel filtration column. These dissimilarities led us to examine more closely the contributions of sequences outside the IQ motifs to CaM interaction with the Nav1 CTs. Although the ability of CaM to promote solubilization of the Nav1 CTs (Fig. 1) supported our hypothesis that these proteins, like Cav1.2, contain a CaM-binding pocket consisting of multiple noncontiguous sequences, the lack of a conformational change on the gel filtration column suggested that the details of CaM interaction with the Nav1 CTs likely differed from those of CaM interaction with Cav1.2. Our specific approach was to examine whether mutations outside the Nav1 IQ motifs would disrupt CaM interaction, similar to what we observed for Cav1.2. Long QT syndrome subtype 3 (LQTS3) and Brugada syndrome (BrS) mutations in the C terminus were chosen as candidates for Nav1.5 because these mutations, which place patients at risk for arrhythmogenic sudden cardiac death (30Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), are within the Nav1.5 CT that we tested and alter channel gating behavior; if the mutations also alter CaM interaction, this would provide an important correlation between CaM interaction and channel function and would therefore parallel the changes in channel gating resulting from disrup"
https://openalex.org/W1982448290,"CAPS-1 is required for Ca2+-triggered fusion of dense-core vesicles with the plasma membrane, but its site of action and mechanism are unknown. We analyzed the kinetics of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis reconstituted in permeable PC12 cells. CAPS-1 increased the initial rate of Ca2+-triggered vesicle exocytosis by acting at a rate-limiting, Ca2+-dependent prefusion step. CAPS-1 activity depended upon prior ATP-dependent priming during which PIP2 synthesis occurs. CAPS-1 activity and binding to the plasma membrane depended upon PIP2. Ca2+ was ineffective in triggering vesicle fusion in the absence of CAPS-1 but instead promoted desensitization to CAPS-1 resulting from decreased plasma membrane PIP2. We conclude that CAPS-1 functions following ATP-dependent priming as a PIP2 binding protein to enhance Ca2+-dependent DCV exocytosis. Essential prefusion steps in dense-core vesicle exocytosis involve sequential ATP-dependent synthesis of PIP2 and the subsequent PIP2-dependent action of CAPS-1. Regulation of PIP2 levels and CAPS-1 activity would control the secretion of neuropeptides and monoaminergic transmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2088062021,"Leptin regulates energy homeostasis primarily by binding and activating its long form receptor (LRb). Deficiency of either leptin or LRb causes morbid obesity. Leptin stimulates LRb-associated JAK2, thus initiating multiple pathways including the Stat3 and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathways that mediate leptin biological actions. Here we report that SH2-B, a JAK2-interacting protein, promotes activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by recruiting insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2 in response to leptin. SH2-B directly bound, via its PH and SH2 domain, to both IRS1 and IRS2 both in vitro and in intact cells and mediated formation of a JAK2/SH2-B/IRS1 or IRS2 tertiary complex. Consequently, SH2-B dramatically enhanced leptin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS2 in HEK293 cells stably expressing LRb, thus promoting association of IRS1 and IRS2 with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and phosphorylation and activation of Akt. SH2-B mutants with lower affinity for IRS1 and IRS2 exhibited reduced ability to promote association of JAK2 with IRS1, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, and association of IRS1 with p85 in response to leptin. Moreover, deletion of the SH2-B gene impaired leptin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous IRS1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), which was reversed by reintroduction of SH2-B. Similarly, SH2-B promoted growth hormone-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 in both HEK293 and MEF cells. Our data suggest that SH2-B is a novel mediator of the PI 3-kinase pathway in response to leptin or other hormones and cytokines that activate JAK2."

https://openalex.org/W1995989198,"Initiation of meiotic recombination by double-strand breaks (DSBs) must occur in a controlled fashion to avoid jeopardizing genome integrity. Here, we identify chromatin-associated protein HIM-17 as a link between chromatin state and DSB formation during C. elegans meiosis. Dependencies of several meiotic prophase events on HIM-17 parallel those seen for DSB-generating enzyme SPO-11: HIM-17 is essential for DSB formation but dispensable for homolog synapsis. Crossovers and chiasmata are eliminated in him-17 null mutants but are restored by artificially induced DSBs, indicating that all components required to convert DSBs into chiasmata are present. Unlike SPO-11, HIM-17 is also required for proper accumulation of histone H3 methylation at lysine 9 on meiotic prophase chromosomes. HIM-17 shares structural features with three proteins that interact genetically with LIN-35/Rb, a known component of chromatin-modifying complexes. Furthermore, DSB levels and incidence of chiasmata can be modulated by loss of LIN-35/Rb. These and other data suggest that chromatin state governs the timing of DSB competence."

The human Aurora paralogues Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C have a highly conserved catalytic domain. Extensive studies on the role of Aurora-A and Aurora-B have revealed distinct localizations and functions in regulating mitotic processes, whereas little is known about Aurora-C. The present study shows that human Aurora-C is a chromosomal passenger protein that forms complexes with Aurora-B and inner centromere protein (INCENP), which are known passenger proteins. We show that INCENP binds and activates Aurora-C in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Aurora-C co-expressed with INCENP elicits the phosphorylation of endogenous histone H3 in mammalian cells, even though this phosphorylation is not sufficient to establish chromosome condensation in interphase cells. We therefore suggest that Aurora-C is a novel chromosomal passenger protein that cooperates with Aurora-B to regulate mitotic chromosome dynamics in mammalian cells.

The regulation of mitotic processes is complex and precisely controlled. Post-translational ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and a substantial wave of protein phosphorylation play important roles in signaling events that coordinate mitotic processes and ensure accurate chromosome segregation (reviewed in Refs. 1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and 2Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Maturation promoting factor, a complex of the serine/threonine kinase Cdc2 and its partner cyclin B, is the most studied of the kinase complexes that are essential for mitotic progression. In addition to Cdc2, the polo-like kinases, NimA-related (Nek), Bub1, LATS, and the Aurora families are implicated in many mitotic processes (2Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). The characterization of mutations in the prototype of the Aurora family, Drosophila melanogaster aurora, revealed that Aurora is important for centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation (3Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A screen for temperature-sensitive conditional mutants for chromosomal missegregation identified increase-in-ploidy 1 (Ipl1), the sole essential Aurora of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian Aurora family constitutes a closely related subgroup of three serine/threonine protein kinases referred to as Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C (2Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 5Andrews P.D. Knatko E. Moore W.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin.

Although not identical, the structure of the Aurora-A catalytic domain has many conformational similarities with that of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Cdk2 (7Cheetham G.M. Knegtel R.M. Coll J.T.

Aurora-A and Aurora-B have very distinct localizations and functions even though they share a high degree of sequence similarity within the catalytic domain (74% identity and 85% similarity). Aurora-A is up-regulated during mitosis (10Tanaka M. Ueda A. Kanamori H. Ideguchi H. Yang J. Kitajima S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Biol.

Immunostaining of endogenous Aurora-A by using a monoclonal antibody and time-lapse analysis of the ectopic expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; INCENP, inner centromere protein; KN, catalytically inactive mutant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CSK buffer, cytoskeleton buffer; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced GFP.-tagged Aurora-A have demonstrated that Aurora-A localizes to centrosomes and regions of microtubules that are proximal to centrosomes during mitosis (11Honda K.

Tachibana M. Dotsu M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Aurora-A is involved in the regulation of microtubule nucleation at centrosomes, a process that includes phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and association with TPX2 or Ajuba (16Kufer T.A. Nigg E.A. Sillje H.H. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aurora-B is essential for cytokinesis, chromosome condensation, kinetochore function, chromosome segregation, spindle-assembly checkpoint, and microtubule dynamics (17Shannon K.B. Salmon E.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R458-R460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Aurora-B is also regulated by phosphorylation (18Yasui Y. Urano T. Kawajiri A. Nagata K.I. Tatsuka M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and by association with the chromosomal passenger proteins INCENP and survivin, which are important for both targeting and activation of the kinase (6Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The dynamic distribution of a class of chromosomal passenger proteins that includes Aurora-B, INCENP, survivin, TD-60, and Orc6 is similar during mitosis (20Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Among them, at least Aurora B, INCENP, and survivin interact as a complex. These passenger proteins localize on centromeres early during mitosis, transfer to the central spindle midzone in anaphase, and finally remain associated with the midbody during cytokinesis. The dramatic movements of these proteins during mitosis have generated the notion that they play important roles in mitotic spindle dynamics during the coordination of chromosomal and cytoskeletal events associated with mitosis (21Earnshaw W.C. Bernat R.L. Chromosoma. 1991; 100: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Histone modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and combinations of these processes, have been characterized (22Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D.

Mitotic chromosome condensation and segregation in a variety of organisms are closely linked with mitotic phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine residues 10 and 28 (24Hendzel M.J. Wei Y.

Aurora-B is responsible for mitotic phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine residues 10 and 28 (19Sugiyama K. Sugiura K. Hara T. Sugimoto K. Shima H. Honda K. Furukawa K. Yamashita S. Urano T.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In response to extracellular signals, more localized histone H3 phosphorylation is mediated by RSK2, MSK1, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and IKKα (29Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B.

Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), thereby inducing immediate-early gene expression. Aurora-C is little understood. It has been found only in mammals, is specifically expressed at high levels in the testis, and localizes to centrosomes from anaphase to telophase, and its expression levels are elevated in several cancer cell lines (32Kimura M. Matsuda Y. Yoshioka T. Okano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7334-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 33Bernard M. Sanseau P. Henry C. Couturier A. Prigent C.

Here we show that human Aurora-C forms complexes with Aurora-B and INCENP, known passenger proteins. We expressed a human GFP-tagged Aurora-C plasmid to determine its localization, and we found instead that it acts as a passenger protein. We also demonstrated that human Aurora-C phosphorylates histone H3 in vitro, whereas the catalytically inactive form of this kinase had no effect. Furthermore, we showed that INCENP binds and activates Aurora-C in vivo and in vitro and that Aurora-C co-expressed with INCENP elicits histone H3 phosphorylation of interphase cells. These observations suggest that Aurora-C is a novel chromosomal passenger protein and that human Aurora-C has important functions in regulating mitotic chromosome dynamics in coordination with Aurora-B in human cells. Materials—Polyclonal antibodies specific to phosphorylated serine residues 10 or 28 in histone H3 and MPM-2 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibody to MAPK was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of each human condensin subunit, as described (35Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The anti-pan Aurora monoclonal antibody (K3-7) recognizes all of the human Aurora family (12Taguchi S. Honda K. Sugiura K. Yamaguchi A. Furukawa K. Urano T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Anti-Glu and anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibodies were gifts from Dr. Larry A. Feig (Tufts University, Boston). Plasmids—Human Aurora-C (GenBank™ accession number AY714054, see supplement Fig. 1) and INCENP (GenBank™ accession number AY714053) were cloned from a human testis cDNA library (Clontech) by using partial cDNAs obtained by the reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA from DLD-1 colon cancer cells. IN-box is a C-terminal domain (amino acids 783–918) of INCENP. We created a mammalian expression vector by inserting cDNA into an altered version of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that contained a FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK) 5′ to the cloning site, into myc/pcDNA3, into glu/pMT3 (36Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), or into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to encode a protein tagged with GFP at the N terminus. Point mutations within Aurora-C were engineered by standard double PCR mutagenesis. All PCR-amplified cDNA products were fully sequenced to confirm mutations and to verify the absence of secondary point mutations. The plasmids glu-Aurora-A/pMT3 and glu-Aurora-B/pMT3 have been described (11Honda K. Mihara H. Kato Y. Yamaguchi A. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Furukawa K. Urano T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2812-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Sugiyama K. Sugiura K. Hara T. Sugimoto K. Shima H. Honda K. Furukawa K. Yamashita S. Urano T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection—COS-7 and human MDA-435 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. COS-7 (3 × 105 cells in 60-mm culture dishes) and MDA-435 cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors using DEAE-dextran (36Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Monoclonal Antibody Generation—We immunized mice with recombinant GST-tagged Aurora-B or IN-box, and serum titers were monitored by immunoblotting using lysates of COS cells transfected with glu-Aurora-B/pMT3 or myc-INCENP/pcDNA3, respectively. After several injections, splenic lymphocytes were isolated and fused to the myeloma cell line NS-1. Clonal populations of fusion cells were screened for antibody production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and productive cells were cloned to monoclonal lines by serial dilution screening (37Urano T. Furukawa K. Shiku H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar). Two monoclonal antibodies for Aurora-B and three for INCENP were prepared that also detected protein in immunoblots. Highly concentrated H7-4 monoclonal antibodies for Aurora-B and 7.2.2 for INCENP were obtained from murine ascites after an intraperitoneal injection of hybridoma cells. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—MDA-AF8-A2 cells (38Sugimoto K. Fukuda R. Himeno M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells were seeded on poly(d-lysine)-coated coverslips at ∼25% confluence. The following day the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 10 s. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The permeabilized cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then covered with a solution of 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Diluted monoclonal antibody was placed as a drop on the coverslips and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The coverslips were then washed six times with PBS and covered with a solution containing goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The coverslips were washed six times with PBS, mounted (mounting medium; Vector Laboratories) with DAPI, and attached to slides with clear nail polish. Establishment of Stable Cell Lines and Confocal Time-lapse Microscopy—Stable cell lines, MDA-GFP-Aurora-B, MDA-GFP-Aurora-C, and MDA-GFP-INCENP, were generated by transfecting MDA-435 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with expression vectors Aurora-B/pEGFP-C1, Aurora-C/pEGFP-C1, and INCENP/pEGFP-C1, respectively. The transfected cells were selected in 750 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) and collected 7–10 days later. Single colonies of stably transfected cells were selected after 2 weeks. Three independent cell lines for each construct were analyzed. Confocal time-lapse fluorescence images were acquired using an FV500 laser-scanning confocal unit coupled to an inverted microscope (model IX81; Olympus) equipped with an oil-immersion objective (PLAPO60x; Olympus) and Fluoview software (Olympus). Cells were maintained at 37 °C and analyzed on 35-mm glass-based dishes (IWAKI) in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) to avoid medium acidification in the CO2-free atmosphere. Time-lapse recording was established by monitoring green fluorescence, and the images were captured every 1.5 or 3 min. Cell Cycle Synchronization—Tissue culture dishes (10 cm) were seeded at a density of 3×106 with exponentially growing HeLa cells. For S phase synchronization, HeLa cells were synchronized as follows. On the following day, thymidine (Sigma) was added to the media to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and the plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed three times with PBS, and normal growth medium was added. After 8 h at 37 °C, the cells were exposed to thymidine for an additional 16 h. For M phase synchronization, cells were incubated with medium containing 400 ng/ml nocodazole for 8 h. The cells were released from nocodazole by three PBS washes, and normal growth medium was added. To monitor the cell cycle distribution, the cellular DNA content was assayed by standard techniques using propidium iodide staining. Events were analyzed by a FACScan (BD Biosciences). In Vitro Translation—The cell-free expression of cDNAs was analyzed in the T7 TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Briefly, cDNAs in myc/pcDNA3 or in FLAG/pcDNA3 (1.5 μg of circular plasmid each) were transcribed/translated alone or co-translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The coupled transcription/translation reactions (total volume, 50 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h, and translated proteins were immunoprecipitated as described below. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa or transfected COS cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed by rocking in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (PBS with 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 μm okadaic acid) for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 5 min and then immunoprecipitated with primary monoclonal antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 75 min. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer and finally resuspended in 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted. Prior to immunocomplex kinase assays, glu-Aurora-C immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer without dithiothreitol. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing substrates, enzymes, 50 μm ATP, and 3μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase activity buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction products separated by 12% SDS-PAGE were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The gels were dried, and 32P was detected using a MacBAS-1500 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). Subcellular Fractionation—HeLa cells (1 × 106) were lysed with 200 μl of CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 × g. The supernatants were recovered as the chromatin-unbound fraction (Fig. 3A, fr. 1). The insoluble fraction was suspended in 200 μl of CSK buffer containing 200 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,500 × g. The supernatants were recovered as the DNase-extractable fraction (Fig. 3A, fr. 2). The pellets were suspended in 200 μl of CSK buffer containing 2 m NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 10 min at 17,500 × g. The supernatants were saved as the high salt extractable fraction (Fig. 3A, fr. 3), and the pellets were saved as the high salt-resistant fraction (Fig. 3A, fr. 4). We considered that the DNase-extractable (Fig. 3A, fr.2) and high salt-extractable (Fig. 3A, fr.3) fractions contained chromatin-bound fractions (39Takemoto A. Kimura K. Yokoyama S. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4551-4559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In Vivo Histone H3 Phosphorylation Assay—COS cells were seeded on poly(d-lysine)-coated coverslips at ∼25% confluence. The following day COS-7 cells were transfected with myc-Aurora-C/pcDNA3 (3 μg) either alone or together with INCENP/pEGFP-C1 (0.6 μg) using DEAE-Dextran. Thirty six hours later, the cells were fixed for indirect immunofluorescence described above with anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser(P)-10) antibody. We also stained cells with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody to detect exogenous Aurora-C. We simultaneously detected INCENP expression by monitoring a green fluorescence tag. We counted more than 200 cells by using a fluorescence microscope. Human Aurora-B Is a Chromosomal Passenger Protein— Immunostaining with polyclonal antibodies sometimes produces variable results. We therefore generated monoclonal antibodies against human Aurora-B to study its distribution and function. We tested the specificity of the H7-4 antibody using immunoblots of transfected COS cell lysates. The antibody recognized a single protein of the predicted molecular weight in whole cell lysates from COS cells transfected with Glu-tagged Aurora-B (Fig. 1A). The H7-4 antibody did not recognize either human Aurora-A or Aurora-C. Exponentially growing MDA-AF8-A2 cells (38Sugimoto K. Fukuda R. Himeno M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) stably expressed GFP-CENP-A, with which we examined Aurora-B localization during the cell cycle by using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. GFP-CENP-A localized to the centromere throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, Aurora-B localization was entirely punctate between the two GFP-CENP-A dots until metaphase (Fig. 1, B–D). Entry into anaphase led to Aurora-B redistribution to the central spindle midzone (Fig. 1, E and F) and then final accumulation at the midbody during telophase and cytokinesis (data not shown). Aurora-B immunostaining was consistent with that detected using polyclonal antibodies (40Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 41Adams R.R. Eckley D.M. Vagnarelli P. Wheatley S.P. Gerloff D.L. Mackay A.M. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C.

Biol. 2002; 22: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and with the live-cell imaging of MDA-GFP-Aurora-B cells stably expressing GFP-Aurora-B (data not shown). Therefore, human Aurora-B behaves as a passenger protein whose localization changes dynamically with the progression of mitosis. Aurora-C Binds Aurora-B in Vivo—While characterizing Aurora-B function, the monoclonal antibody against Aurora-B showed that this protein co-immunoprecipitates with Aurora-C but not with Aurora-A from HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2A). To confirm this finding, we transfected glu-Aurora-B either alone or together with Aurora-C (Myc-tagged) into COS cells and immunoprecipitated it with the anti-Glu monoclonal antibody. We then immunoblotted the immunoprecipitates by using the anti-Myc antibody to determine whether stable complexes had formed. glu-Aurora-B immunoprecipitates contained not only the wild type but also a catalytically inactive mutant (KN) of Aurora-C (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). On the other hand, anti-Glu immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with Myc-tagged Aurora-C alone did not contain Aurora-C (Fig. 2B, lane 6), demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. However, these experiments with in vitro translated proteins did not detect interactions between Aurora-B and Aurora-C (Fig. 2C, lane 6), suggesting that the association between Aurora-B and Aurora-C observed in vivo may require other protein(s) or post-translational modification of these proteins. Aurora-C Is a Chromosomal Passenger Protein—To determine the subcellular distribution of Aurora family proteins, mitotic HeLa cells were successively treated with CSK buffer containing each of the following: 0.3% Triton X-100, DNase I, and 2 m NaCl (Fig. 3A, left panel). Aurora-A was found in both chromatin-unbound (Fig. 3A, Fr. 1) and DNase I-treated (Fr. 2) fractions, whereas both Aurora-B and Aurora-C were located in high salt-soluble (Fr. 3) and -insoluble (Fr. 4) fractions, demonstrating that the subcellular distribution of Aurora-C coincides with that of Aurora-B and not of Aurora-A and that Aurora-C was tightly bound to mitotic chromosomes at prometaphase. To locate intracellular Aurora-C, we transiently expressed Aurora-C attached with GFP to the N terminus in human MDA cells. GFP-Aurora-C was found on chromosomes and not at centrosomes during metaphase (Fig. 3B, meta). When cell division entered anaphase, GFP-Aurora-C translocated into the central spindle midzone (Fig. 3B, ana and telo). To validate these observations, we generated stable cell clones expressing GFP-Aurora-C in MDA cells and further analyzed the dynamics of its distribution during the cell cycle. During mitosis, time-lapse imaging of GFP-tagged Aurora-C showed that it translocated from metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 3C, 15 min and QuickTime movie 1 in Supplemental Data) to the central spindle midzone (45 min) and then remained in the midbody (57 min). These data demonstrated that Aurora-C is a chromosomal passenger protein like Aurora-B. INCENP as a Passenger Protein—Several lines of evidence indicate that the association of INCENP with Aurora-B correlates with enhanced Aurora-B kinase activity (43Kang J. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol.

We generated monoclonal antibodies against human INCENP that recognized a single protein of the predicted molecular weight in whole lysates from exponentially growing HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). The electrophoretic mobility of accumulating INCENP protein became retarded during the G2/M phase and declined during G1. INCENP proteins are expressed throughout the cell cycle. The level of control MAPK protein did not significantly change during cell cycle progression. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of fixed HeLa cells with monoclonal antibodies against INCENP showed that it is confined to centromeres during prometaphase, to the central spindle midzone in anaphase, and to midbodies during late telophase. These findings confirmed that the distribution of INCENP precisely corresponds with that of Aurora-B and Aurora-C throughout all phases of mitosis (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the nuclear distribution of INCENP at interphase was punctate, which did not coincide with DAPI staining (Fig. 4B). To confirm these findings by using monoclonal antibodies, we cloned cells that stably expressed GFP-INCENP in MDA cells and further analyzed the dynamics of its distribution during the cell cycle. The profile of GFP-INCENP ex"

Here we demonstrate that two inducible ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (Aus1p and Pdr11p) mediate nonvesicular movement of PM sterol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This transport facilitates exogenous sterol uptake, which we find requires steryl ester synthesis in the ER. Surprisingly, while expression of Aus1p and Pdr11p significantly increases sterol movement from PM to ER, it does not alter intracellular sterol distribution. Thus, ER sterol is likely rapidly returned to the PM when it is not esterified in the ER. We show that the propensity of PM sterols to be moved to the ER is largely determined by their affinity for sterol sphingolipid-enriched microdomains (rafts). Our findings suggest that raft association is a primary determinant of sterol accumulation in the PM and that Aus1p and Pdr11p facilitate sterol uptake by increasing the cycling of sterol between the PM and ER.

Maintaining the heterogeneous distribution of cholesterol among organelles is critical for a number of cellular processes including protein trafficking, signaling, and modulating membrane fluidity and permeability. Cells sustain a cholesterol gradient across the membranes of the secretory system. The lowest cholesterol concentrations are in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; ABC, ATP-binding cassette. and cis-Golgi complex; higher levels are in the trans-Golgi and trans-Golgi network; and the highest amounts are in the plasma membrane (PM) (1Liscum L. Munn N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Maxfield F.R. Wustner D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3Prinz W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although estimates vary, about 65–80% of the free cholesterol in cells is in the PM (1Liscum L. Munn N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A similar gradient, one of sphingoplipids, also spans the secretory system (4Holthuis J.C. Pomorski T. Raggers R.J. Sprong H. Van Meer G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1689-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). How these gradients are maintained despite continuous vesicular trafficking is not well understood, although it is likely that cholesterol and sphingolipids are actively sorted into or excluded from transport vesicles (5Brugger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The enrichment of cholesterol and sphingolipids in the PM is also likely affected by the affinity of these two classes of lipid for one another because depleting cells of PM-sphingomyelin causes cholesterol in the PM to redistribute to internal compartments (6Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7Slotte J.P. Hedstrom G. Rannstrom S. Ekman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These two classes of lipid can form sterolsphingolipid-enriched microdomains (rafts), and it has been proposed that raft association is one of the primary determinants of the intracellular distribution of sphingolipids and sterols (4Holthuis J.C. Pomorski T. Raggers R.J. Sprong H. Van Meer G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1689-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These domains, which are highly enriched in the PM but largely absent from the ER, play import roles in cell signaling and protein trafficking. Sterols are moved between intracellular compartments by a combination of vesicular and nonvesicular mechanisms (1Liscum L. Munn N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Maxfield F.R. Wustner D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3Prinz W. Semin.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Little is known about how nonvesicular sterol transport occurs or how it contributes to maintaining the proper intracellular distribution of sterol. Here we examine sterol transport between the PM and ER in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The intracellular distribution of the primary sterol in this yeast, ergosterol, is similar to that of cholesterol in mammalian cells (9Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Studies with mammalian cells have suggested that a novel transport pathway moves sterol from the ER, where it is synthesized, to the PM. ER to PM cholesterol transport does not require an intact Golgi apparatus (11Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Urbani L.

Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J.

Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), only slightly slows the delivery of newly synthesized cholesterol to the PM. While it is possible that a novel vesicular transport pathway moves nascent cholesterol to the PM, it is more likely that ER to PM cholesterol transport is nonvesicular. In addition to the accumulation of free sterol in the PM, many cells also have substantial amounts of fatty acyl sterol esters. Steryl esters are synthesized in the ER, but localized almost exclusively in lipid droplets. In this study, we examine the movement of exogenous sterol from the PM to the ER in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Since this yeast does not take up sterol when grown aerobically, we use strains with an altered allele of a transcription factor (upc2-1) that allows cells to take up sterol during aerobic growth. Microarray analysis has revealed that upc2-1 increases the expression of a large number of genes including AUS1 and PDR11, which encode ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (17Wilcox L.J. Balderes D.A. Wharton B. Tinkelenberg A.H. Rao G. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32466-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Deleting these two genes substantially reduced the ability of a upc2-1 strain to take up exogenous sterol. Here we examine the mechanism of these transporters and how they affect intracellular sterol distribution. We find they facilitate sterol cycling between the PM and ER. This cycling likely promotes exogenous sterol uptake, since we also find that steryl ester synthesis in the ER is required for efficient exogenous sterol uptake. Thus, Aus1p and Pdr11p increase the availability of PM sterol for esterification in the ER, which in turn contributes to the net uptake of exogenous sterol by cells. In addition, we also find that the propensity of a sterol to be moved between the PM and ER is largely determined by its raft affinity, suggesting that raft association is a primary determinant of sterol accumulation in the PM. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The following strains were used in this study: WPY361 (MATa upc2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,-15 leu2-3,-112 trp1-1), YFY411 (WPY361 sec18-1:URA3), WPY352 (WPY361 sec16-2), WPY354 (WPY361 sec21-1), YFY413 (WPY361 pdr11::kanMX4), YFY423 (WPY361 aus1::kanMX4), YFY480 (WPY361 pdr11::kanMX4 aus1::kanMX4), YFY478 (WPY361 are1::nat are2:: kanMX4) WPY778 (MATα upc2-1:URA3 ura3-1 his3-11,-15 leu2-3,-112 trp1-1) and CP3 (MATα upc2-1 erg1Δ::URA3 ade2 his3 ura3-5) (18Bard M.

The presence of the upc2-1 allele in strains was confirmed as described (19Tinkelenberg A.H. Liu Y. Alcantara F. Khan S. Guo Z. Bard M. Sturley S.L. J. Biol.

The plasmid pAUS1-MEL1 (YEP68) was constructed as follows. Two PCR reactions were performed: one with primers AUS1-p12 and AUS1-p13 using genomic DNA as a template and the second with primers MEL1–1 and MEL1–2 using plasmid YIpMEL1α2 (Euroscarf) as a template. The products of these reactions were cut with SphI and KpnI and KpnI and EcoRI, respectively, and ligated into YCplac111 (20Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) cut with SphI and EcoRI. The plasmid encoding full length Aus1p with GFP fused to the C terminus under the AUS1 promoter (pWP1220) was constructed by performing PCR with primers AUS1-1 and AUS1-2 using genomic DNA as a template, cutting the resulting product with NotI and XhoI, and ligating into pJK59 (21Prinz W.A.

The plasmid encoding full-length Pdr11p with GFP fused to the C terminus under the PDR11 promoter (pWP1251) was constructed by performing PCR with primers PDR11-1 and PDR11-2 using genomic DNA as a template, cutting the resulting product with NotI and XhoI, and ligating into pJK59 cut with the same enzymes.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimerSequenceAUS1-p12AGATACATAGCATGCATTTCAGGAAGCGATCAAAAGAUS1-p13GATATACAAGGTACCATTAATTCCAGAAAAAGCAGACMEL1-1GATACAATAGGTACCATGTTTGCTTTCTACTTTCTCACMEL1-2GATACATACAGAATTCTCAAGAAGAGGGTCTCAACCAUS1-1AAGATACAACTGCGGCCGCTTTCAAAGAGAGTGCCTGAAGATCAUS1-2TGCTAGCCATAGCTCGAGCGTTCTGTACAGGCTTCTTCCCTCTGPDR11-1AGAATACATACGCGGCCGCAATTCACCGCAGAGAAGCGCCPDR11-2GATACCATACACTCGAGCTACGCTTTGTTCGTTTGGATTATG Open table in a new tab Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) unless otherwise indicated. When the medium was supplemented with sterols, they were added to from stocks in Tween 80:ethanol (1:1) such that the final Tween 80 concentration in the medium was 0.5%. Sterol Extraction, Analysis, and Purification—Sterols were extracted as described (22Parks L.W. Bottema C.D. Rodriguez R.J. Lewis T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Free and esterified sterols were separated by spotting onto Silica Gel 60 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) and developing the plates with hexanes: diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1). Sterols separated by TLC were quantitated by either of two methods. Radiolabeled sterols were quantitated with a BAS-1500 phosphorimager (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). The amount of sterol was determined by spotting radiolabeled sterols at a range of known concentrations onto the TLC plates. The amount of sterol in the samples was determined by comparison to the standards. Sterols that were not radiolabeled were visualized with 254-nm light, scraped from the TLC plate, and saponified by suspending the silica in 6% KOH, 80% methanol, 0.2% pyrogallol, and heating at 80 °C for 2 h. The sterols were then extracted three times with hexanes, dried under N2, resuspended in 95% methanol, filtered with a Millex-HV 0.45-μm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and separated with reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) as described below. Ergosterol and 7-DHC separated by RP-HPLC were detected at 280 nm and quantitated with the ChemStation Plus software package (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Sterols separated by RP-HPLC were quantitated by comparison to known standards at a range of concentrations. RP-HPLC analysis of sterols was conducted on a Zorbax SB-C18, 5-μm particle size, 4.6 × 250-mm column using an Agilent 1100 series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Sterols were eluted at 30 °C with 95% methanol at 1 ml/min and detected at either 206 or 280 nm (23Xu S.H. Norton R.A. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 452: 377-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sterols were identified by comparison to known standards (Sigma-Aldrich, and Steraloids, Newport, RI) and published elution times (23Xu S.H. Norton R.A. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 452: 377-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). [14C]Ergosterol was prepared by growing a wild-type yeast strain in medium containing [1,2-14C]acetate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Cells were saponified, and radiolabeled ergosterol was purified by RP-HPLC as described above. The peak containing ergosterol was collected with an Agilent 1100 series fraction collector. Renocal-76 Density Gradients—Total cellular membranes were fractionated as described (24Chang A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼20 OD600 units of cells were pelleted, washed with H2O, resuspended in TE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA), and lysed as described above. The lysate (0.5 ml) was mixed with an equal volume of RenoCal-76 (Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ), overlaid with 1 ml each of 34, 30, 26, and 22% RenoCal-76 in TE, and centrifuged for at least 16 h in a SW55.1 rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 40,000 rpm, 4 °C. Fourteen 0.35-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradients. Sterols in the fractions were analyzed as described above. The PM-enriched fractions (usually fractions 9–11) were identified by immunoblotting with anti-Pma1p antibody (a gift from R. Serrano). ER-enriched fractions were identified by immunoblotting with anti-Sec61p antibody (a gift from T. Rapoport). Anti-Pep12p and anti-Vps10p antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. To measure endogenous sterols in each fraction, cells were grown in YPD containing 1 mm [14C]acetate for about 20 h. The distribution of exogenous sterols at steady state was determined by growing cells for about 20 h in YPD containing 20 μg/ml [14C]cholesterol or [14C]ergosterol. Uptake and Esterification of Sterols—Radiolabeled sterols, [4-14C]cholesterol and [22,23-3H]β-sitosterol, were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals or isolated as described. Unlabeled sterols were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Steraloids. Sterols in Tween 80:ethanol (1:1) were added so that the final Tween 80 concentration was 0.5%. Samples were removed at the indicated times after sterol addition and added to an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mm NaN3. The cells were washed two times with 10 mm NaN3 containing 0.5% Tween 80 at 4 °C, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described. Experiments with strain CP3 were done in the same way except that the strain was first grow in medium supplemented with unlabeled 20 μg/ml cholesterol or ergosterol. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in medium without sterol immediately before [14C]cholesterol uptake, and esterification was assessed. Myriocin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml from a 1 mg/ml stock in methanol. Sterol Uptake after ATP Depletion—Cells growing at 30 °C were depleted of ATP by the addition of 30 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 30 mm NaN3 to the medium for 5 min. [14C]cholesterol was added to 10 μm, and the cells were grown for an additional 15 min. The cells were then washed twice with YPD containing 0.5% Tween 80 at room temperature, resuspended in fresh medium either with or without 50 μm cholesterol, and were grown again at 30 °C. Samples were taken at the indicated times, and lipids were extracted and quantitated as described above Steryl Ester Synthase and α-Galactosidase Assays—α-Galactosidase assays were performed exactly as described (25Ryan M.P. Jones R. Morse R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 18: 1774-1782Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Steryl ester synthase assays were performed as described (26Yang H. Cromley D. Wang H. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3980-3985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Each reaction contained 200 μg of microsomes, 20 nmol of oleoyl-CoA, 100 nmol of sterol, and 1 mg of defatted bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 800 μl in of reaction buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm reduced glutathione). Sterols were suspended in reaction buffer with Tyloxapol at 30:1 (Tyloxapol:sterol, w/w). The reactions were warmed to 37 °C for 15 min, and then started by the addition of oleoyl-CoA. They were stopped after 1 min by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2) and sterols extracted and analyzed as described. For comparison of the esterification rate of various sterols, [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA (American Radiolabled Chemicals) was used. Comparisons between strains were performed with unlabeled oleoyl-CoA and [14C]cholesterol. All assays were done in duplicate. Cell Imaging—Cells were grown in synthetic complete media missing uracil (27Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) at 30 °C and imaged live in the same medium at room temperature using an Olympus BX61 microscope, UPlanApo 100×/1.35 lens, Qimaging Retiga EX camera, and IPabs version 3.6.3 software. Triton X-100 Extraction—PM-enriched fractions from Renocal-76 density gradients were pooled, diluted with 11.5 ml of H2O, and pelleted by centrifugation in a SW40.1 rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of TNE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and TX100 extraction was performed essentially as described (28Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.25 ml of membranes were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C either with or without 1% Triton X-100 and then mixed with 0.5 ml of Optiprep (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY). Samples without Triton X-100 were overlaid with 1.2 ml of 30% Optiprep in TNE and 0.2 ml TNE, whereas samples with Triton X-100 were overlaid with the same except TXNE (TNE/0.1% Triton X-100) was used. The samples were then centrifuged in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 55,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were collected from the top of the gradients, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above. Exogenous Sterols Are Transported from the PM to the ER at Different Rates—To study how sterol is moved between the PM and ER, we exploited the ER localization of the enzymes that convert free sterol to fatty acyl sterol esters (29Zweytick D. Leitner E. Kohlwein S.D. Yu C. Rothblatt J. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The esterification of exogenous radiolabeled sterol indicates that it has been transported to the ER. Steryl esters are then stored in lipid droplets. When [14C]cholesterol is given to a upc2-1 S. cerevisiae strain, it is rapidly taken up, transported to the ER, and esterifed (Fig. 1, A–D). The fraction of exogenous [14C]cholesterol taken up that becomes esterifed was independent of its concentration in the medium; 30 min after [14C]cholesterol was added to the medium at a range of concentrations, ∼78% of the [14C]cholesterol taken up had been esterified. Thus, the propensity of exogenous [14C]cholesterol to be moved to the ER and esterified was not significantly affected by the amount of sterol taken up by the cells. We were not able to saturate [14C]cholesterol uptake because of the limited solubility of cholesterol in the medium. In contrast to the rapid esterification of exogenous [14C]cholesterol, only a small fraction of the sterol taken up by the cells became esterified when cells were given [14C]ergosterol. Over a range of concentrations of exogenous [14C]ergosterol, only 14% of the sterol taken up became esterifed 30 min after addition to the medium (Fig. 1, G–I). We also determined the rate of esterification of exogenous [3H]sitosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and found that they were esterified at rates intermediate between those of [14C]cholesterol and [14C]ergosterol (Fig. 1, E and F). Yeast is able to grow with all of the four sterols used in this study (ergosterol, cholesterol, sitosterol, and 7-DHC). A strain that cannot synthesize sterol, and therefore requires exogenous sterol supplementation, grows at about the same rate when any of these four sterols is added to the medium (not shown). Exogenous sterol that has been taken up but has not become esterified remains primarily in the PM-enriched fractions of density gradients. We determined the intracellular distribution of exogenous ergosterol and 7-DHC, two sterols that are slowly esterified, by fractionating total cellular membranes on Reno-Cal-76 density gradients. Almost all of the exogenous ergosterol and 7-DHC that had not been esterified remained in the PM-enriched fractions (Fig. 2, A and C). Thus, after uptake, sterol that has not become esterified remains largely in the PM. The different esterification rates of exogenous sterols likely reflect disparities in their transport rate to the ER, and not differences in the affinity of yeast sterol ester synthases (Are1p and Are2p) for the sterols. We found that microsomes derived from the upc2-1 strain used in this study (WPY361) were able to esterify various sterols at similar rates (Table II). In agreement with previous findings (26Yang H. Cromley D. Wang H. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3980-3985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), there was a 2-fold difference in the rate of cholesteryl and ergosteryl ester synthesis by microsomes. Since there is about a 6-fold difference between the rates at which exogenous cholesterol and ergosterol are esterified, differences in the rates of exogenous sterol esterification are probably primarily the result of disparities in their transport rates to the ER. Thus, after uptake, exogenous free sterols remain largely in the PM and are likely transported to the ER at different rates.Table IISterol ester synthase activity of microsomes from WPY361SterolSteryl ester synthase activityapmol/mg/minCholesterol220 ± 5.4Ergosterol110 ± 6.8Sitosterol120 ± 5.07-DHC190 ± 5.4a pmol/mg/min Open table in a new tab Nonvesicular Sterol Transport between the PM and ER—To determine if PM to ER sterol transport requires vesicular transport, we looked at the rate of sterol transport in a number of mutants with conditional defects in proteins required for vesicular trafficking.

The transport rate of exogenous cholesterol to the ER was not substantially affected in cells with a temperature-sensitive defect in this protein after the cells were grown for 60 min at nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 3), a treatment which results in a severe defect in vesicular transport (31Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Vesicular trafficking to and from the ER also requires the coat-forming protein complexes COPI and COPII (32Wieland F. Harter C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, sterol transport from the PM to the ER was not affected in mutants with conditional defects in proteins required for the formation of these complexes after 1 h at nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 3, bottom two panels). Similar results were obtained with a number of other mutants with conditional defects in proteins needed for vesicular trafficking at other steps of the secretory and endocytic pathways including: Sec4p, Sec6p, Sec8p, Sec15p, and Act1p (not shown). Thus, PM sterol can be transported to the ER by a pathway that does not require any one of a number of proteins required for vesicular trafficking to the ER or other cell compartments. Although it is possible that such transport occurs in some as yet undiscovered vesicles that use a novel transport machinery, it is more likely that the transport is nonvesicular. This transport could be mediated by soluble carrier proteins, membrane proteins at points of ER-PM membrane apposition, or diffusion through the aqueous phase. Aus1p and Pdr11p Are Localized to the PM—The ABC transporters Aus1p and Pdr11p have been implicated in sterol uptake (17Wilcox L.J. Balderes D.A. Wharton B. Tinkelenberg A.H. Rao G. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32466-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These transporters are expressed at very low levels in cells grown aerobically. However, their expression is induced in cells with an altered allele of a transcription factor (upc2-1). Cells with the upc2-1 allele that also have deletions of AUS1 and PDR11 (upc2-1 Δaus1 Δpdr11) take up significantly less exogenous cholesterol than upc2-1 cells (17Wilcox L.J. Balderes D.A. Wharton B. Tinkelenberg A.H. Rao G. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32466-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In order to learn more about the potential function of these transporters in sterol uptake and trafficking, we constructed plasmids that encode C-terminal fusions of these proteins to GFP. These fusion proteins are functional since they allow a upc2-1 Δaus1 Δpdr11 strain to take up exogenous sterol (not shown). We found that both Aus1p and Pdr11p localize to the PM (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a significant fraction of Aus1-GFP is also in unidentified internal compartments. Rapid PM to ER Sterol Transport Requires Aus1p or Pdr11p—We wanted to investigate the role of Aus1p and Pdr11p in sterol uptake and trafficking. Since the upc2-1 allele, that allows sterol uptake during aerobic growth, increases the expression of a large number of genes including AUS1 and PDR11 (17Wilcox L.J. Balderes D.A. Wharton B. Tinkelenberg A.H. Rao G. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32466-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we wanted to rule out that knock-out AUS1 and PDR11 in upc2-1 cells indirectly affects sterol uptake by turning down the expression of other genes induced by upc2–1. A plasmid (pAUS1-MEL1) was constructed in which the promoter of AUS1 drives the expression of the reporter gene MEL1, which encodes α-galactosidase. UPC2 cells (i.e. wildtype) containing this plasmid express very little α-galactosidase, whereas the upc2-1 strain (WPY361) increases the expression by more than 350 times (Fig. 5A, left panel). When we deleted AUS1 and PDR11 in WPY361, α-galactosidase expression from pAUS1-MEL1 decreased only slightly. Thus, upc2-1 Δaus1 Δpdr11cells probably do not fail to take up exogenous sterol because they down regulate other genes that would otherwise be induced by the upc2-1 allele. We determined the rate of [14C]cholesterol esterification in strains missing either or both of these transporters, in order to assess the role of Aus1p and Pdr11p in intracellular sterol trafficking. As expected, cells missing both transporters (upc2-1 Δaus1 Δpdr11) took up much less [14C]cholesterol from the medium than an isogenic upc2-1 strain (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, only a small fraction of the sterol taken up by the upc2-1 Δaus1 Δpdr11 was esterified. This difference could not be explained by the differences in the amount of sterol taken up by the upc2-1 and the upc2-1 Δaus1 Δpdr11 strains. As mentioned, the percent of the total cholesterol taken up that becomes esterified is"

However, our understanding of the signal transduction pathways determining these responses is incomplete. In this study we tested the hypothesis that p38 is required for EGF-stimulated intestinal epithelial monolayer restitution. EGF-stimulated migration in a wound closure model required continuous presence of ligand for several hours for maximal response, suggesting a requirement for sustained signal transduction pathway activation. In this regard, prolonged exposure of cells to EGF activated p38 for up to 5 h. Furthermore genetic or pharmacological blockade of p38 signaling inhibited the ability of EGF to accelerate wound closure. Interestingly p38 inhibition was associated with increased EGF-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation, suggesting that p38 regulates the balance of proliferation/migration signaling in response to EGF receptor activity. Activation of p38 in intestinal epithelial cells through EGF receptor was abolished by blockade of Src family tyrosine kinase signaling but not inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or protein kinase C. Taken together, these data suggest that Src family kinase-dependent p38 activation is a key component of a signaling switch routing EGF-stimulated responses to epithelial cell migration/restitution rather than proliferation during wound closure.

Appropriate regulation of cell migration is critical for maintenance of a healthy intestinal epithelial lining in at least two ways. The continuously renewing monolayer of cells covering the gastrointestinal tract undergoes complete turnover every few days in a process that involves the movement of newly generated cells from the proliferative compartment in the lower crypts to the small intestinal villi or colonic surface epithelia (1Karam S.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D286-D298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar); thus, orderly cell migration contributes to proper morphology and function of the gastrointestinal tract in the disease-free state. Furthermore the ability of epithelial cells to migrate and close a wound in the mucosal lining allows for restitution of the epithelium much more rapidly than by enhanced proliferation and is thus an early response for maintenance of barrier and absorptive functions in the face of environmental or inflammatory damage. Increased cell migration has been observed in experimentally injured epithelia (3Ciacci C. Lind S.E. Podolsky D.K.

While the importance of cell motility in the dynamic maintenance of the gastrointestinal tract is clear, the molecular mechanisms regulating intestinal cell migration are not yet fully understood. One regulatory mechanism influencing intestinal epithelial cell migration is signaling initiated by soluble growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF). 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; YAMC, young adult mouse colon; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. EGF is the canonical member of a family of peptide growth factors (also including betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-α, and epiregulin) that act as ligands for the EGF receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB-1) (12Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). EGFR is a 170-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing a ligand-binding ectodomain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail that includes a tyrosine kinase domain and docking sites for a variety of signaling effectors (13Arteaga C.L.

In addition, reports from this and other laboratories clearly implicate EGFR signaling as a potent inducer of intestinal cell migration and wound healing (10Wilson A.J. Gibson P.R. Clin.

EGF application to cultured mouse intestinal epithelial cells dramatically increases migration into a wounded area (31Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1998; 117: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and similar results have been reported with rabbit duodenal organ cultures (32Riegler M. Sedivy R.

Furthermore a recent clinical study indicates that topical EGF application is effective in treatment of ulcerative colitis (36Sinha A. Nightingale J. West K.P. Berlanga-Acosta J. Playford R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), suggesting that the promotion of wound healing by this factor in vitro effectively models in vivo responses. EGFR ligand binding stimulates receptor homodimerization as well as heterodimerization with other ErbB family receptors (37Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of a number of target proteins regulating cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular migration (38Bedrin M.S. Abolafia C.M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 776-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several parallel pathways downstream of the EGFR, including phospholipase C-γ and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt, appear to be required for EGF stimulation of cell migration in intestinal epithelial cells (31Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1998; 117: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another downstream signaling module responsive to EGF in some cell systems is the p38 kinase (19Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12988-12996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Kanda Y. Mizuno K. Kuroki Y. Watanabe Y. Br. J.

A member of the MAPK signaling family, p38 is largely associated with cellular stress responses and apoptosis (42Daly J.M. Olayioye M.A. Wong A.M. Neve R. Lane H.A. Maurer F.G. Hynes N.E.

Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12988-12996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly p38 activation has been noted in an in vitro intestinal epithelial restitution model (47Dieckgraefe B.K. Weems D.M. Santoro S.A. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and in wounded corneal epithelial tissue (48Saika S. Okada Y. Miyamoto T. Yamanaka O. Ohnishi Y. Ooshima A. Liu C.Y. Weng D. Kao W.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that under some circumstances p38 may be involved in regulating cell motility. However, a formal requirement for p38 MAPK in intestinal epithelial cell migration has not been established, and the role of this kinase in growth factor-stimulated migration is also unknown. The purpose of this study was to further characterize the mechanisms of EGF-stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration. Using our laboratory's in vitro cell restitution model system, we determined that EGF-stimulated migration requires prolonged presence of ligand concomitant with activation of p38 MAPK. Use of pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative constructs showed that Src family kinase-dependent activation of p38 is a key component of EGF-induced intestinal epithelial cell migration/wound closure but is not required for basal migration. Furthermore our data demonstrated that p38 is a molecular proliferation/migration “switch” capable of determining the outcome of EGFR signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Cell Culture—The conditionally immortalized young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cell line has been previously described and was established from the colonic epithelium of H-2Kb-tsA58 (Immorto) mice (49Whitehead R.H.

These cells express a heat-labile SV40 large T antigen expressed under the control of an interferon-γ-inducible promoter. EGFR-null (EGFR–/–) mouse colonic epithelial cells were established in a similar fashion from EGFR-null heterozygous mice crossed with the Immortomouse (49Whitehead R.H. VanEeden P.E.

Cells were maintained on rat tail collagen (Mediatech, Herndon, VA)-coated plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml mouse interferon-γ (Intergen, Norcross, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenous acid (BD Biosciences) at 33 °C (permissive conditions). In preparation for experiments, cells were transferred to RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin without interferon-γ, insulin, transferrin, or selenous acid at 37 °C (nonpermissive conditions). Antibodies, Growth Factors, and Inhibitors—Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against p38 MAPK, phospho-p38, SAPK/JNK, phospho-SAPK/JNK, Akt, phospho-Akt, phosphotyrosine 416-Src, ERK MAPK, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-active ERK polyclonal antibody was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against protein kinase C α (PKCα) and PKCϵ and mouse monoclonal antibodies against Yes, Fyn, Lyn, and Lck were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR and mouse monoclonal anti-Src were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. EGF was a gift from Stanley Cohen (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was obtained from Collaborative Medical Products (Bedford, MA). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was purchased from Sigma. PD98059, U0126, LY294002, wortmannin, Raf kinase inhibitor I, JNK inhibitor II, bisindolylmaleimide 1 (Bis1), SU6656, SB202190, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. PP1 and PP2 were obtained from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). CGP77675 was provided by Pharma Research (Basel, Switzerland). In all experiments using pharmacological inhibitors, control cells were treated with an equivalent concentration of vehicle. Cell Lysates, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Cellular lysates were prepared by washing cells twice in PBS and lysing with boiling SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm orthovanadate, 5 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; buffer was heated to 95 °C prior to use). DNA was sheared by passing lysates through a 27-gauge needle, and samples were cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and the remaining lysate was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (51Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). 50-μg aliquots of lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% gel for EGFR and Src family members, 10% gel for Akt and PKCs, and 15% gel for other proteins) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, pH 8.0) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBSt) and 5% nonfat dry Carnation milk and then exposed to the primary antibodies listed above overnight at 4 °C in TBSt using the manufacturers' suggested dilutions. Blots were then washed (6 × 5 min) in TBSt, exposed to secondary antibody where appropriate for 1 h at a 1:5000 dilution in TBSt, and washed (5 × 5 min) in TBSt. Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected with the Western Lightning enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation—To immunoprecipitate Src family members, YAMC cells were washed twice in cold PBS and scraped on ice in a buffer containing 1% Triton, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 500 μg of each lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-Src, -Fyn, or -Yes antibody and then for 1 h with Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Migration Assays and Cell Wounding—YAMC cells were plated at confluent density on 35-mm dishes coated with fibronectin and maintained overnight under nonpermissive conditions. Eight circular wounds of equal size (∼1.5 mm2) were made in each monolayer as described previously (52Corredor J. Yan F. Shen C.S. Tong W. John S.K. Whitehead R.H. Polk D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), debris were removed by washing twice with PBS, and culture medium was replaced. Wounds were photographed over time and measured using NIH ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Percent closure for each wound was determined at 8 and 24 h; values presented are averages of all eight wounds. Cell wounding for biochemical analysis was performed by making concentric rings of wound by gently rotating a minigel electrophoresis comb on the cell monolayer. Cells were then rinsed twice in PBS and supplied with fresh medium until lysates were prepared as detailed above. Proliferation Assays—YAMC cells were plated in 96-well dishes (5 × 103 cells/well) and maintained under nonpermissive conditions for 16 h before the beginning of treatments. Some cultures were exposed to growth factors and/or signaling inhibitors for 24 h. Cells were counted at 0 and 24 h using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-based colorimetric proliferation assay kit (Promega Corp.). Reported values reflect averages of at least 12 replicate wells. DNA Constructs and Transfections—A dominant-negative p38 construct (53Zhang Z. Sheng H. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was the gift of Dr. Melanie Cobb (Southwestern University, Dallas, TX). A dominant-negative Src construct (Y527F/K295R) was the gift of Dr. Steve Hanks (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). For transfections, cells were seeded at low density (∼25% confluence) in 35-mm dishes. After 24 h of culture, the medium was replaced under permissive conditions but with no antibiotics, and cells were grown to 90% confluence. Transfections were then performed using the LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent using 1 μg of DNA/culture and following the manufacturer's recommendations. 24 h after transfection, cells were shifted to nonpermissive conditions for 16 h before use in an experiment. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences between mean values was assessed with paired Student's t test analysis. The minimum level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Unless otherwise stated, all data are representative of at least three independent experiments. EGF-stimulated Intestinal Epithelial Cell Migration Requires Sustained Presence of Ligand—Previous reports from this laboratory have demonstrated that EGF exposure stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration in an in vitro wound closure model (31Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1998; 117: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This response is dependent upon activity of the phospholipase C-γ/PKC and PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascades. Recent evidence also implicates Src inhibitor-sensitive signaling in extracellular signal-induced migration of these cells (52Corredor J. Yan F. Shen C.S. Tong W. John S.K. Whitehead R.H. Polk D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One question that has not been addressed, however, is whether EGF-stimulated migration is regulated at the receptor level by a transient signal that is rapidly translated to intracellular second messengers, thus dispensing with the requirement for further ligand presence, or whether sustained EGFR occupancy and activation are required. Other cell physiological programs, such as the MAPK-dependent switch between growth and differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, are determined by a combination of signal strength and signal duration (54Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). Similarly many EGF-stimulated signaling cascades are activated in a transient fashion by receptor ligation, but it is possible that sustained signaling is also required. For example, EGF-stimulated proliferation requires continuous ligand presence in some systems (16Carpenter G. Cohen S. EGF: Receptor Interactions and the Stimulation of Cell Growth. 13. Chapman and Hall, London1981: 43-66Google Scholar, 55Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 88: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To further investigate the dynamics of signaling cascades involved in EGF-stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration, we asked whether transient EGFR ligation is sufficient to enhance cellular migration or whether this process requires sustained presence of the EGF ligand. YAMC cell wounds were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and some were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) either continuously or for various periods of time followed by removal of EGF and replacement with EGF-free medium. Continuous EGF exposure stimulated wounds to close at ∼150% of control rates in an 8-h migration experiment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, brief EGF exposure did not stimulate cell migration beyond basal levels. Interestingly pulse treatment with EGF for various times to determine the minimum duration of receptor occupancy required for maximal restitution (Fig. 1B) showed that after 4 h the presence of ligand is dispensable for full migration. Taken together with our previous finding that intestinal epithelial cell migration is sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (31Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1998; 117: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar), these data indicate that sustained receptor-induced signal transduction is required for EGF-accelerated restitution. One alternate, albeit unlikely, possibility that must be formally ruled out is that the promigratory effects of sustained EGF exposure are actually a result of ligand-induced EGFR down-regulation. To determine whether loss of EGFR enhances intestinal cell migration, YAMC cell cultures were incubated with EGF for 16 h to deplete their EGFR pool, washed, given medium without EGF, and then compared with control cells in a migration assay (Fig. 1C). Basal migration of cells depleted of EGFR was not faster than that in cells expressing normal levels of receptor; in fact, down-regulation of the EGFR impaired basal migration somewhat, suggesting that at least part of the basal migration response is due to EGFR activity. p38 MAPK, ERK1/ERK2, and JNK/SAPK Are Activated in a Sustained Fashion by EGF in YAMC Cells—EGF-stimulated cell migration requires the sustained presence of ligand; therefore, we sought to identify downstream signaling pathways with similar kinetics. To determine the duration of the signal transduction pathway activation by sustained EGFR signaling in YAMC cells, cultures were treated with 10 ng/ml EGF for various periods of time, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against the active phosphoforms of p38 MAPK, ERK1/ERK2 MAPK, Akt, and JNK/SAPK. All four of these molecules were rapidly activated by EGF (Fig. 2). While reduced levels of phospho-p38, -ERK, and -JNK/SAPK were detected after 5 h of EGF exposure, their activity was still substantially elevated compared with controls at this time. In contrast, Akt activation was detected only acutely following EGF treatment of YAMC cells. p38 Inhibition Blocks EGF-stimulated Migration but Potentiates EGF-stimulated Proliferation in YAMC Cells—p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK/SAPK are all activated by EGF in a sustained fashion in YAMC cells. Furthermore previous studies have shown that p38 and ERK are active in intestinal epithelial cells migrating to close a wound (47Dieckgraefe B.K. Weems D.M. Santoro S.A. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, MEK and JNK inhibitors do not block EGF-stimulated YAMC cell motility (Ref. 56Polk D.B. Tong W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1149-C1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and results below). Therefore, we tested whether p38 activity is necessary for EGF-induced cell migration. YAMC cell cultures were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (10 μm) for 1 h and tested in our wound healing assay with or without EGF. To determine whether the observed effects were specific for EGF-stimulated pathways as opposed to generalized modulation of any signal for cell motility, SB202190 was also tested against HGF/scatter factor, which stimulates cell motility through different mechanisms than EGF (57Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). SB202190 pretreatment had little effect on basal or HGF-stimulated YAMC cell migration but efficiently abrogated EGF-accelerated migration (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the MEK inhibitor U0126 had little effect on migration in this assay. Fig. 3B shows inhibition of EGF-stimulated p38 and ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation by SB202190 and U0126, respectively. Blockade of EGF-induced migration was also observed in another intestinal epithelial cell line, the IEC-18 rat ileal crypt line (Fig. 3C). Similar results were seen with another p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (data not shown), and with YAMC cells transiently transfected with a dominant-negative p38 (Fig. 3D). Thus, p38 activity is required for EGF-stimulated cell migration but not basal migration or"

Nav are composed of a pore-forming α subunit and often one to several modulating β subunits. Previous work showed that terminal sialic acid residues attached to α subunits affect channel gating. Here we show that the fully sialylated β1 subunit induces a uniform, hyperpolarizing shift in steady state and kinetic gating of the cardiac and two neuronal α subunit isoforms. Under conditions of reduced sialylation, the β1-induced gating effect was eliminated. Consistent with this, mutation of β1 N-glycosylation sites abolished all effects of β1 on channel gating. Data also suggest an interaction between the cis effect of α sialic acids and the trans effect of β1 sialic acids on channel gating. Thus, β1 sialic acids had no effect gating on the of the heavily glycosylated skeletal muscle α subunit. However, when glycosylation of the skeletal muscle α subunit was reduced through chimeragenesis such that α sialic acids did not impact gating, β1 sialic acids caused a significant hyperpolarizing shift in channel gating. Together, the data indicate that β1 N-linked sialic acids can modulate Nav gating through an apparent saturating electrostatic mechanism. A model is proposed in which a spectrum of differentially sialylated Nav can directly modulate channel gating, thereby impacting cardiac, skeletal muscle, and neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2165068760,"Upon Ca2+ influx synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitter cargo into the synaptic cleft. Key players during this process are the Q-SNAREs syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25 and the R-SNARE synaptobrevin 2. It is thought that these membrane proteins gradually assemble into a tight trans-SNARE complex between vesicular and plasma membrane, ultimately leading to membrane fusion. Tomosyn is a soluble protein of 130 kDa that contains a COOH-terminal R-SNARE motif but lacks a transmembrane anchor. Its R-SNARE motif forms a stable core SNARE complex with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25. Here we present the crystal structure of this core tomosyn SNARE complex at 2.0-A resolution. It consists of a four-helical bundle very similar to that of the SNARE complex containing synaptobrevin. Most differences are found on the surface, where they prevented tight binding of complexin. Both complexes form with similar rates as assessed by CD spectroscopy. In addition, synaptobrevin cannot displace the tomosyn helix from the tight complex and vice versa, indicating that both SNARE complexes represent end products. Moreover, data bank searches revealed that the R-SNARE motif of tomosyn is highly conserved throughout all eukaryotic kingdoms. This suggests that the formation of a tight SNARE complex is important for the function of tomosyn."

We have studied how cAMP affects Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in pancreatic β-cells from mice and rats and the role of CICR in secretion. CICR was observed as pronounced Ca2+ spikes on top of glucose- or depolarization-dependent rise of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). cAMP-elevating agents strongly promoted CICR. This effect involved sensitization of the receptors underlying CICR, because many cells exhibited the characteristic Ca2+ spiking at low or even in the absence of depolarization-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i. The cAMP effect was mimicked by a specific activator of protein kinase A in cells unresponsive to activators of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Ryanodine pretreatment, which abolishes CICR mediated by ryanodine receptors, did not prevent CICR. Moreover, a high concentration of caffeine, known to activate ryanodine receptors independently of Ca2+, failed to mobilize intracellular Ca2+. On the contrary, a high caffeine concentration abolished CICR by interfering with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Therefore, the cell-permeable IP3R antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate blocked the cAMP-promoted CICR. Individual CICR events in pancreatic β-cells were followed by [Ca2+]i spikes in neighboring human erythroleukemia cells, used to report secretory events in the β-cells.

Glucose is the most important physiological stimulator of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells.

Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) is a mechanism by which any local rise of [Ca2+]i becomes further amplified by Ca2+ release from stores. The heart is a classic example of CICR, where it provides a link between depolarization-dependent influx of “triggering” Ca2+ and release of contraction-inducing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (15Fabiato A. Fabiato F. Nature. 1979; 281: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In heart cells, CICR is caused by activation of RyRs. However, in many other types of cells, IP3Rs are equally competent in mediating CICR because they display a similar autocatalytic Ca2+ release mechanism (16Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of IP3 thus sensitizes the IP3Rs to the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ (17Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 18Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). As in the heart, CICR in the β-cell may provide a link between influx of Ca2+ and release from intracellular stores, resulting in amplification of the Ca2+ signal triggering insulin secretion (19Lemmens R.

Tufveson G. Gylfe E. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, our study also showed that CICR in primary β-cells from mice, rats, and human subjects is caused by activation of IP3Rs rather than RyRs. Agents raising cAMP have been found to promote intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in insulin-releasing cell lines and pancreatic β-cells, and this action was proposed to be mediated by sensitization of either IP3Rs (24Liu Y.J.

Because important evidence for this concept was obtained with clonal β-cells, we have now studied the mechanisms by which cAMP promotes CICR in primary mouse and rat β-cells.

The selection of β-cells for analysis was based on their large size and low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio compared with the cells secreting glucagon, somatostatin (31Hellman B. Acta Endocrinol.

Image Analysis of Cytoplasmic Ca2+—In most experiments, loading of cells with the indicator fura-2 was performed during 30-min incubation at 37 °C in a HEPES-buffered medium (25 mm; pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 138 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, 250 μm diazoxide, 50 μm methoxyverapamil, and 0.25 μm fura-2/AM. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, diazoxide and methoxyverapamil were omitted, and the glucose concentration was 3 mm. Methoxyverapamil was also omitted in the experiments shown in Figs. 1, B–D, and 6A. Testing the effect of ryanodine, 100 μm of this compound was present during loading and throughout the experiment. The cover slips with attached cells were used as exchangeable bottoms of a modified open Sykes-More chamber (35Sykes J.A. Moore E.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1959; 100: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The chamber profile was defined by a 4-mm wide, 7-mm long oval hole in a 1-mm thick silicon rubber gasket with a 25-mm outer diameter. A thin 25-mm diameter stainless steel plate with an identical central opening pressed the rubber gasket to the coverslip by the threaded Sykes-More chamber mount. Inlet and outlet cannulas fixed to the stainless steel plate allowed laminar flow superfusion. The chamber was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE2000U; Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan). The chamber holder and the CFI S Fluor 40 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Nikon) were maintained at 37 °C by custombuilt thermostats. The chamber was superfused at a rate of 0.3 ml/min with the loading medium lacking indicator.Fig. 6CICR is resistant to ryanodine. Mouse pancreatic β-cells were loaded for 30 min with 0.25 μm fura-2/AM in medium containing 20 mm glucose, 250 μm diazoxide, 100 μm ryanodine (A–C), and 50 μm methoxyverapamil (B and C). The cells were then rinsed and superfused with the same medium lacking indicator. As indicated by bars, the cells were exposed to 90 mm KCl, 50 μm methoxyverapamil, 100 μm ryanodine, 10 nm glucagon, 250 μm Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS (Sp-BIMPS), and 20 mm caffeine. KCl depolarization induced CICR spiking in 15 of 27 cells (A; p < 0.001), glucagon in 46 of 48 cells (B; p < 0.001), and Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS in 35 of 50 cells (C; p < 0.001). The presence of caffeine abolished CICR spiking in all 35 Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS-responsive cells (C; p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The microscope was equipped with an epifluorescence illuminator (Cairn Research Ltd, Faversham, UK) connected through a 5-mm diameter liquid light guide to an Optoscan monochromator (Cairn Research Ltd) with rapid grating and slit width adjustment and a 150-watt xenon arc lamp. The monochromator provided excitation light at 340 nm (1.7 nm half-bandwidth) and 380 nm (1.4 nm half-bandwidth). Emission was measured at 510 nm (40 nm half-bandwidth) using a 400-nm dichroic beam splitter and a cooled OrcaER-1394 Firewire digital charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) equipped with a C8600–2 image intensifier (Hamamatsu Photonics). The Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp. Downingtown, PA) controlled the monochromator and the charge-coupled device camera, acquiring pairs of images at 340 and 380 nm every 2 s with integration for 60–80 ms at each wavelength and <1ms for changing wavelength and slits. To minimize bleaching and photo damage, the monochromator slits were closed until the start of the next acquisition cycle. Ratio (R) images were calculated after subtraction of background images. [Ca2+]i values were obtained according to Grynkiewicz et al. (36Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the equation [Ca2+]i=KDCa2+×(Fo/FS)×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R), where KDCa2+ is 224 nm. F0 and Rmin are the fura-2 fluorescence at 380 nm and the 340/380 nm fluorescence excitation ratio, respectively, in an “intracellular” K+-rich medium lacking Ca2+. FS and Rmax are the corresponding data obtained with a saturating concentration of Ca2+. Detection of β-cell Secretion—To record secretory events from the mouse β-cells, we used HEL cells as reporter cells. The suspension-cultured HEL cells were spun down and loaded with 0.5 μm fura-2 as described previously (34Shariatmadari R. Lund P.E. Krijukova E. Sperber G.O. Kukkonen J.P. Åkerman K.E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). β-Cells attached to cover slips were loaded with the single wavelength Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 by incubation in medium (similar to that used for β-cells above) containing 11 mm glucose, 250 μm diazoxide, and 1 μm fluo-4/AM but lacking methoxyverapamil. After loading for 30 min, the HEL-cells and β-cell were rinsed in indicator-free medium. The coverslip with β-cells was used as bottom of the chamber described above. In this case, a 0.25-mm thick, 25-mm diameter polyester spacer with a central 4-mm wide and 7-mm oval hole (like that in the silicon rubber gasket; see above) was placed on top of the coverslip. Fura-2-loaded HEL cells were pipetted into the central cavity defined by the hole in the spacer, which was then covered by a 25-mm polycarbonate membrane filter before aligning the hole in the silicon rubber gasket and the stainless steel plate (see above) with the hole in the polyester spacer. β-Cells attached to the coverslip and free-floating HEL cells under the permeable polycarbonate filter could then be superfused with minimal cell movements. The principal arrangement has been described previously (34Shariatmadari R. Lund P.E. Krijukova E. Sperber G.O. Kukkonen J.P. Åkerman K.E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but our chamber had a different geometry. Fluorescence was measured essentially as described above with emission at >510 nm (long-pass filter) using a 495 nm dichroic beam splitter. Fura-2 fluorescence from the HEL cells was excited at 340 and 380 nm and fluo-4 fluorescence from the β-cells at 470 nm. Images were obtained every 2 s with integration for 100 ms at each wavelength and <1 ms for changing wavelength and slits. Because of the stronger fluorescence from fluo-4, the image intensifier gain was reduced during excitation at 470 nm to balance the signals. [Ca2+]i in the HEL cells was calculated as described above. The fluo-4 fluorescence intensity indicating [Ca2+]i variations in the β-cells was expressed as the ratio between deviation from the basal fluorescence and the basal fluorescence (ΔF/F0). Statistical Analysis—Only recordings from isolated individual β-cells were included in the analyses. Statistical evaluations of the proportion of cells with a certain response were made with Fishers exact test or χ2 test with Yates' correction using SigmaStat software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the frequency of Ca2+ spikes. Statistical significance was set at a p value of < 0.05. CICR Is Promoted by Glucagon, GLP-1, and other cAMP Agonists—In accordance with earlier data (37Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 38Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), increase of the glucose concentration from 3 to 20 mm induced initial lowering of [Ca2+]i in β-cells followed by slow, large amplitude oscillations of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A). The use of low indicator concentrations facilitated the detection of rapid [Ca2+]i spikes, which were superimposed on top of the large amplitude oscillations. Addition of diazoxide, which hyperpolarizes the β-cells by opening KATP channels, immediately abolished the slow [Ca2+]i oscillations as well as the spikes. In the presence of diazoxide, the membrane potential is near the equilibrium potential for K+. Under these conditions, depolarization with 90 mm KCl induced a rapid rise of [Ca2+]i with superimposed [Ca2+]i spikes, indicating that the depolarization-dependent influx of Ca2+ triggers CICR. Most subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 20 mm glucose to stimulate Ca2+ sequestration in the ER (2Gylfe E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 419: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Tengholm A. Hellman B. Gylfe E. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 2001; 530: 533-540Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and diazoxide to keep the membrane potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Fig. 1B illustrates that the modest elevation of [Ca2+]i obtained with 17 mm KCl only triggered occasional CICR spikes. After return to the physiological K+ concentration addition of a low concentration of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin evoked occasional CICR spikes (not shown). However, combining 17 mm KCl with forskolin increased the frequency of CICR spiking 4-fold. The ability of cAMP to uncover CICR in response to depolarization-dependent rise of [Ca2+]i was not restricted to mouse β-cells. Fig. 1, C and D, illustrates [Ca2+]i spiking in rat β-cells depolarized with 30 mm KCl in the presence of the adenylyl cyclase-activating hormones GLP-1 and glucagon, respectively. However, the mouse β-cells were more sensitive, and the same concentrations of glucagon and GLP-1 caused repetitive CICR spiking even in the absence of depolarization-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, which like most subsequent experiments was performed in the presence of methoxyverapamil to block depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry and keep [Ca2+]i at basal levels. Apart from the physiological activation of adenylyl cyclase with glucagon (Fig. 2A) and GLP-1 (Fig. 2B) CICR spiking from the baseline was also obtained after direct activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (Fig. 2C), by inhibition of cAMP degradation with the phosphodiesterase inhibitors IBMX (Fig. 2D) or caffeine (Fig. 2E), and by cell membrane-permeable 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 2F). However, 8-bromo-cGMP or the more selective protein kinase G activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP failed to trigger CICR in β-cells subsequently responding to cAMP agonists (not shown). PKA Rather Than Epac Mediates the cAMP Effect on CICR— Occasional Ca2+ spikes were observed in 2 of 64 individual islet cells exposed to the Epac-specific activator 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP and in 1 of 57 cells exposed to the even more potent 8-pMeOPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (data not shown). Epac activator-induced Ca2+ spikes were sometimes seen also in islet cell clusters. These data indicate that the response represents a different cell type than the dominating β-cells. However, 111 of 174 cells (64%; p < 0.001) reacted to the PKA-specific activator Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS with generation of repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes. Fig. 3, A and B, illustrate lack of response to the Epac activators 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP and 8-pMeOPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP in cells subsequently reacting to the PKA activator. Further evidence for a PKA mechanism was obtained from the observation that the frequencies of the Ca2+ spiking induced by glucagon and forskolin were reduced by about 70% by the competitive PKA antagonists Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (Fig. 3C) and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (Fig. 3D). cAMP-promoted CICR Is Independent of RyRs and Prevented by IP3R Inhibition—Low concentrations of caffeine have been used extensively as phosphodiesterase inhibitor raising cAMP. We now found that 2 mm caffeine mimics other cAMP agonists in inducing CICR (Figs. 2E and 4D). However, high caffeine concentrations interfere with both IP3 production (39Toescu E.C. O'Neill S.C. Petersen O.H. Eisner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23467-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IP3Rs (40Ehrlich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), which explains why 20 mm immediately inhibited CICR promoted by glucagon (Fig. 4A), GLP-1 (Fig. 4B), IBMX (Fig. 4C), and 2 mm caffeine (Fig. 4D). In addition, high concentrations of caffeine activate RyRs (41Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 425-439Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 42Solovyova N. Veselovsky N. Toescu E.C. Verkhratsky A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but 20 mm caffeine never induced an acute mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ typically observed in cells with functional RyRs (12Beauvois M.C.

Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because the caffeine data indicate that cAMP-promoted CICR involves the IP3 signaling pathway, we tested the effect of the membrane-permeable IP3R inhibitor 2-APB (43Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of 2-APB is incomplete (44Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L.

As receptors become activated, they autophosphorylate on several residues outside the kinase domain, thus allowing recruitment of cytosolic substrates and initiation of multiple downstream signaling pathways in parallel. The FGFR has been shown to initiate signaling through direct binding of substrates such as phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) (1Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M.

The end point of FGFR activation is defined in a cell-specific manner by the integration of these signaling pathways. A thorough understanding of cellular signaling processes requires the identification of the components of the entire signaling network followed by studies of the functional role of individual proteins. Large scale analysis of post-translationally modified (e.g. phosphorylated) proteins by mass spectrometry (MS) has gained momentum with the development of high resolution and high sensitivity hybrid mass spectrometers (e.g. quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF) instruments) and now constitutes a powerful functional proteomics platform for the analysis of protein networks of signaling processes (6Mann M. Jensen O.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Since signaling proteins are not all “turned off” in the quiescent cell, and the stoichiometry of activation may vary according to the stimulus applied, a major challenge in MS-based cell signaling analysis has been to develop techniques that allow comparison of the level of post-translational modifications between proteins from stimulated and unstimulated cell samples. Stable isotope labeling of proteins or peptides in combination with MS analysis allows direct comparison of protein levels between differentially labeled samples without the use of two-dimensional gels. Stable isotope tags have been introduced into proteins in vivo through metabolic labeling (7Oda Y. Huang K. Cross F.R. Cowburn D. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our laboratory devised a whole cell [13C]Arg metabolic labeling strategy (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)) that renders proteins from two cell populations (cultured in medium with “heavy” [13C]Arg or “normal” [12C]Arg, respectively) distinguishable from each other by an offset in mass (9Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). MS analysis discriminates between peptides from the two cell populations by the +6.0-Da mass shift of the “heavy” Arg-containing peptides, and the isotopic ratio of [13C]Arg/[12C]Arg peptides measures the relative protein level in the two samples. SILAC has recently been used in combination with affinity purification of proteins that associates with the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the signaling adaptor protein Grb2 to identify components of the signaling complex induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of HeLa cells (14Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Ong S.E. Nielsen M. Foster L.J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling events depend on tyrosine phosphorylation to modulate enzyme activity of target proteins and promote signal-dependent protein-protein interaction. Tyr(P) in particular sequence contexts binds phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) or SH2 domains and hereby recruits specific proteins to a signaling complex (15Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, tight regulation by tyrosine phosphatases causes a very low level of tyrosine phosphorylation in inactive cells (16Hunter T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and provides the foundation for the central role of this particular post-translational modification in cell signaling events. Thus, maps of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins provide an extensive view of the components of signaling networks. We have previously applied qTOF MS to investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation in signaling by the EGF receptor (17Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and the FGFR (18Hinsby A.M. Olsen J.V. Bennett K.L. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In these studies, Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates from “activated” and control cells were resolved side-by-side by SDS-PAGE and stained for visualization of proteins, to allow detection of bands specific to the “activated” sample. These bands were excised from the gel and proteins were identified by qTOF MS/MS. However, this approach is impeded when several proteins are identified in one band, because it is not clear which one is phosphorylated. Moreover, the low level and substoichiometric phosphorylation of many signaling proteins require a large quantity of starting material to obtain sufficient protein for visualization on a gel. These limitations are becoming particularly apparent as the sensitivity of MS analysis equals or even exceeds conventional gel staining techniques. To circumvent these issues, we combined SILAC with immunoprecipitation (IP) of Tyr(P) proteins from pooled lysates of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2)-stimulated and untreated cells to identify components of the FGFR-1 signaling cascade. Furthermore, MS analysis was performed on the newly released linear ion trap Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) mass spectrometer (19Olsen J.V. Ong S.E. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 608-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 20Syka J.E.P. Marto J.A. Bai D.L. Horning S. Senko M.W. Schwartz J.C. Ueberheide B. Garcia B.

Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which identified twice as many proteins as analysis performed on the qTOF instrument. 28 proteins were enriched in the phosphotyrosine IP as a consequence of FGF2 stimulation, and we propose these as signaling components of the FGFR-1 signaling pathway. We identified several proteins novel to FGFR signaling such as the insulin receptor substrate-4 (IRS-4). We used SILAC in combination with phosphopeptide affinity purification (21Schulze W.X. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10756-10764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) to identify Grb2 as a FGF2 signal-dependent binding partner of IRS-4. Furthermore, IRS-4 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with the docking protein ShcA, which was also identified in our phosphoproteomic analysis of FGF2-induced signaling, after FGF2 stimulation. Thus, we provide evidence for an IRS-4·ShcA·Grb2 signaling complex involved in FGFR-1-mediated signal transduction. Establishment of a TREX Cell Line Stably Transfected with FGFR-1—Flp-In TREX293 cells were co-transfected with PcDNA5/FRT encoding human FGFR-1 (isoform 3c) and pOG44 (Flp recombinase) vectors to generate a stable cell transfectant expressing FGFR-1 (TREX/FGFR-1). FGFR-1-expressing cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose concentration (4500 mg/liter), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutaMAX (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. For SILAC experiments, the cell culture medium was custommade (Invitrogen) deficient in l-Arg, l-Leu, and l-Lys. l-Arg U-13C6 ([13C]Arg), where the six carbons have been substituted with 13C isotopes, was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, whereas all other l-amino acids were obtained from Sigma. The medium was divided into two equal portions and supplemented with l-Leu, l-Lys, l-Arg or l-Leu, l-Lys, [13C]Arg (“normal” and “heavy” medium, respectively). Cell Culture, IP, and Transient Transfections—Cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h before treatment with 100 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2 (Invitrogen) for 5 min. Lysates were prepared using 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For SILAC analysis of phosphorylated proteins, ∼5 × 107 cells were harvested in 6 ml of lysis buffer. Tyr(P) IP, SDS-PAGE, and protein band visualization were performed as previously described (18Hinsby A.M. Olsen J.V. Bennett K.L. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lanes of Tyr(P) IP proteins were excised in 10 fractions (∼30–200 kDa) for analysis by MS. For IRS-4 IP, ∼500 μg of cleared cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of IRS-4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for a minimum of 2 h at 4 °C. 40 μl (50:50 slurry) of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C before washing (3× lysis buffer, 1× PBS) and elution by resuspension in 35 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Control IP was performed with control immunoglobulins (DAKO a/s). Western blotting was performed using antibodies against Grb2 (Cell Signaling Technology), Tyr(P) (PY100, Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Cell Signaling Technology), ShcA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), phospho-Shc (Tyr239/240) (Cell Signaling Technology), and IRS-4 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transient transfections with 3 μg of plasmid encoding wild type FRS2 (pcDNA3.1-FRS2/c-myc) (22Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Susan O. Meakin, were performed on 6-cm cultures using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nanoflow Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (Nano-LC-MS/MS)—Reverse-phase nano-LC-MS/MS was performed using an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system (Agilent Technologies Inc.) comprising a solvent degasser, a nanoflow pump, and a thermostated μ-autosampler. The LC system was coupled to a QSTAR Pulsar hybrid qTOF mass spectrometer (AB-MDS Sciex) or a 7-tesla LTQ-FT instrument (Thermo Electron), using a modified nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems) interface. Binding and chromatographic separation of peptides was achieved in a 20-cm fused silica emitter (75-μm inner diameter; Proxeon Biosystems) packed in-house with a methanol slurry of reverse-phase ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3-μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH) and mounted in the nanoelectrospray ion source. Briefly, the tryptic peptide mixtures were autosampled at a flow rate of 500 nl/min onto the packed column and then eluted at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The peptides were separated using a linear gradient of 1.6–24% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid over 40 min and ionized by an applied voltage of 2.4 kV to the emitter. Both mass spectrometers were operated in data-dependent acquisition mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS. For QSTAR analysis, survey MS spectra were acquired for 1 s, and the three most intense ions (doubly, triply, or quadruply charged) were isolated and sequentially fragmented for 1.5 s by low energy collision-induced dissociation. All MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired with the Q2-pulsing function switched on and optimized for enhanced transmission of ions in the MS (m/z 300–1300) and MS/MS (m/z 85–1300) mass ranges. LTQ-FT acquisition was designed to utilize the sequencing power of the ion trap with regard to sensitivity and speed, while taking advantage of the ultra-high mass accuracy and dynamic range of the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT) detector. The FT-MS was used for acquisition of MS survey scans with a resolution of 100,000 at m/z 400 (945-ms detection time), whereas the linear ion trap simultaneously produced MS/MS spectra of the five most intense ions in each survey scan. Automatic gain control was used to accumulate ions for FT-MS survey scans (target value 10,000,000) and MS/MS acquisition (target value 2,000). Database Searches: Peptide Identification—All MS/MS spectra files from each LC run were centroided and merged to a single file, which was searched using the Mascot Search Engine (Matrix Science) against the mammalian NCBI nonredundant database with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine, phosphorylated tyrosine, and [13C]Arg as variable modifications. Tryptic constraints were applied allowing up to two missed cleavages. Peptide searches were performed with an initial tolerance on mass measurement of 0.2 Da in MS mode and 0.2 Da in MS/MS mode for QSTAR data and 10 ppm in MS mode and 0.8 Da in MS/MS mode for LTQ-FT data. Determination of Protein Ratios—[13C]Arg/[12C]Arg peptide ratios were measured for all identified Arg-containing peptides essentially as described (14Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Ong S.E. Nielsen M. Foster L.J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), applying MSQuant (CEBI), which is open source software we have made available on the World Wide Web at msquant.sourceforge.net/. The software handles both QSTAR and LTQ-FT raw files. Briefly, the “heavy” ([13C]Arg) to “normal” ([12C]Arg) peptide ratios are determined from centroided MS peaks and averaged over consecutive MS cycles for the duration of the respective LC-MS peaks in the total ion chromatogram. A protein's ratio is calculated as the mean of the ratios of Arg-containing peptides used to identify it. To avoid false positives, all protein ratios and S.D. values hereof were normalized by a factor that was equal to the average protein ratio of all proteins with ratios below 1.3. Peptide Affinity Purification—Biotin-linked peptides were synthesized on a solid-phase peptide synthesizer (Intavis AG) using Rink amide resin (Merck). The synthesis and procedure for pull-downs were essentially as recently described (21Schulze W.X. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10756-10764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In short, a phosphorylated (Tyr(P)921) and nonphosphorylated (control) version of the peptide corresponding to amino acids 914–929 of IRS-4 (914IRS-4929) were synthesized. An ∼250-nmol peptide was coupled to immobilized streptavidin (Ultralink; Pierce) and subsequently incubated with ∼10 mg of precleared cell lysate from [13C]Arg-labeled (Tyr(P)921 peptide) or nonlabeled (control peptide) cell cultures for a minimum of 3 h at 4 °C. Peptide-protein complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Elution fractions from the two peptide affinity purifications were combined, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and excised in 10 fractions for nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Tyrosine Phosphoproteomic Investigation of FGF2-induced Signaling—FGFR-1 signaling relies on the reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins. In the present study, we set out to identify proteins that are tyrosinephosphorylated or tightly associated with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein after FGFR-1 activation by FGF2 treatment. The TREX293 cell line was stably transfected with cDNA encoding human FGFR-1, and the transfectant (TREX/FGFR-1) responded to treatment with FGF2 by strong phosphorylation of the FGFR-1. Complete incorporation of [13C]Arg in TREX/FGFR-1 cells was achieved by day 6 of culturing in [13C]Arg labeling medium, and cells appeared morphologically identical to cells grown in “normal” ([12C]Arg) medium. For FGF2 stimulation experiments, cells were cultured for 6 days in parallel in [13C]Arg or [12C]Arg medium, the last 24 h with serum depletion, before treatment of the [13C]Arg-labeled cells with FGF2 for 5 min. The [13C]Arg and [12C]Arg lysates were pooled for IP with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. Identification of the extracted proteins was achieved by a GeLC-MS/MS approach, which includes one-dimensional SDS-PAGE protein separation, in situ trypsin digestion, and peptide sequencing by liquid chromatography in combination with MS analysis. The isotopic ratio of Arg-containing peptides ([13C]Arg peptide intensity/[12C]Arg peptide intensity) was determined as a measure of the quantity of a protein originating from the FGF2-stimulated compared with the unstimulated sample in the Tyr(P) IP. Proteins with [13C]Arg/[12C]Arg peptide ratios >1 constitute components of the FGF2-induced cell signaling event (see Fig. 1a for an overview of the procedure). Four independent experiments were performed; three experiments were analyzed using qTOF MS, and one experiment was analyzed using the LTQ-FT MS. In total, the three qTOF runs combined identified more than 400 unique proteins, of which 19 had relative ratios higher than 1.3. However, in the single LTQ-FT analysis, we were able to identify and quantify a total of 5024 verified peptides identifying 860 unique proteins with a summed Mascot peptide score >35 (95% significance score threshold). Iterative calibration algorithms were used to achieve a final average absolute mass accuracy better than 1.7 ppm of the precursor ions analyzed by FT-MS, which is equivalent to a mass deviation of 0.0025 Da for a typical tryptic peptide with mass of 1,500 Da. The LTQ-FT MS/MS data set provided unique identification of nine proteins with [13C]Arg/[12C]Arg ratios above 1.3, in addition to verification of 18 of the 19 proteins determined from the combined qTOF analyses. For example, the docking protein ShcA was only identified from the LTQ-FT analysis. The WD repeat protein 6 (WDR6) was the only signaling component, which was identified only during the qTOF MS analyses. It was identified in each of the three individual qTOF analyses, and the reason for its absence in the LTQ-FT MS experiment is not clear. Fig. 2a depicts the number of “specific” proteins (i.e. enriched in the IP after FGF2 stimulation) versus the total number of identified proteins in the two types of MS analysis. The high sensitivity of the LTQ-FT MS instrument led to the identification of twice as many proteins as the qTOF instrument; however, only 4% of these proteins were “specific” (i.e. were significantly enriched in the Tyr(P) IP after FGF2 stimulation). Keeping in mind that MS analysis has reached sub-“gel staining” sensitivity, this finding emphasizes the need for quantitative labeling protocols such as SILAC or ICAT (10Gygi S.P. Rist B.

In comparison, qTOF analysis identified 444 proteins, 19 of which exhibited a [13C]Arg/[12C]Arg ratio >1.3. The proteins with a 1:1 ratio either contain an unchanged FGF2-independent basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation or originate from background. The LTQ-FT MS analysis identified 30% more signaling proteins than the qTOF analysis and verified all but one signaling protein (indicated by an asterisk) identified in the three qTOF analysis runs combined. b, the panels show peptide doublets from selected proteins. The ratios reflect varying degrees of enrichment in the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein fraction after FGF2 stimulation. The peptide doublet in the bottom right panel shows a 1:1 peptide ratio, which indicates either that the corresponding protein was immunopurified nonspecifically or that its phosphorylation status was not changed by FGF2 stimulation. The top panel spectra are from the LTQ-FT MS analysis, and bottom panel spectra are from the QSTAR analysis. c, for each protein, two or more peptide ratios were measured. The mean peptide ratio (mean) and standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated. The values presented here are data for PLCγ from four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In each experiment, all quantifiable peptides from each protein were analyzed for isotopic ratio (Fig. 2b). For inclusion of a protein on the list of FGF2-signaling proteins, we routinely applied the following criteria. We required that the mean isotopic ratios of the proteins were greater than 1.3 and larger than 1 by twice the S.D. value (Fig. 2c). Protein ratios varied in some cases between experiments (especially for proteins with high enrichment ratios such as PLCγ). Most likely, this was due to small changes in the basal (unstimulated) activity of the FGFR-1 and changes in the signal-to-noise ratio between experiments (9Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2056756764,"The developmental cycle of Chlamydiaceae occurs in a membrane compartment called an inclusion. IncA is a member of a family of proteins synthesized and secreted onto the inclusion membrane by bacteria. IncA proteins from different species of Chlamydiaceae show little sequence similarity. We report that the biochemical properties of Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia caviae are conserved. Both proteins self-associate to form multimers. When artificially expressed by the host cell, they localize to the endoplasmic reticulum. Strikingly, heterologous expression of IncA in the endoplasmic reticulum completely inhibits concomitant inclusion development. Using truncated forms of IncA from C. caviae, we show that expression of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the protein at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum is sufficient to disrupt the bacterial developmental cycle. On the other hand, development of a C. trachomatis strain that does not express IncA is not inhibited by artificial IncA expression, showing that the disruptive effect observed with the wild-type strain requires direct interactions between IncA molecules at the inclusion and on the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, we modeled IncA tetramers in parallel four helix bundles based on the structure of the SNARE complex, a conserved structure involved in membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells. Both C. trachomatis and C. caviae IncA tetramers were highly stable in this model. In conclusion, we show that the property of IncA proteins to assemble into multimeric structures is conserved between chlamydial species, and we propose that these proteins may have co-evolved with the SNARE machinery for a role in membrane fusion.

Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular parasites that develop in a host cell within a membrane-bound compartment, termed an inclusion. The membrane of the inclusion is initially formed by the invagination of the plasma membrane, and pinching off of a vesicle containing the infectious form of the bacterium, the elementary body (EB). 1The abbreviations used are: EB, elementary body; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DSP, dithio-bis-succinimidyl propionate; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Thereafter, EBs differentiate into noninfectious but metabolically active reticulate bodies, which proliferate within the expanding inclusion, giving rise to 1000 or more progeny per host cell. The infectious cycle ends after 2–3 days depending on the strain, when bacteria that have differentiated back to EBs are released in the extracellular medium. The composition of the inclusion and the origin of its constituents is not yet fully understood. EB-containing vesicles seem to become unable to fuse with early endosomes soon after entry (1Scidmore M.A. Fischer E.R. Hackstadt T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). They also fail to fuse with late endocytic compartments and lysosomes, thus escaping degradation by the host cell (2Fields K.A. Hackstadt T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 221-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The early separation between the chlamydial inclusion and the endocytic trafficking distinguish the inclusion from the parasitophorous vacuoles of several pathogens (reviewed in Ref. 3Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Moreno E. Desjardins M. Finlay B. Gorvel J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E183-E188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Acquisition of lipids necessary for the growth of the inclusion membrane, as well as for incorporation into bacteria (4Hatch G.M. McClarty G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), must originate from other sources. One origin of the bacterial lipid content is the Golgi apparatus, as sphingomyelin, synthesized in the Golgi apparatus from a fluorescent precursor, is transported to the inclusion and accumulates into the bacteria (5Hackstadt T. Scidmore M.A. Rockey D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4877-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This process is dependent on bacterial protein synthesis: inhibition of chlamydial early transcription or translation prevents the incorporation of sphingomyelin, and the inclusion eventually fuses with lysosomes (6Scidmore M.A. Rockey D.D. Fischer E.R. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5366-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria also appear to acquire host cell cholesterol by the same Golgi-dependent pathway as sphingomyelin (7Carabeo R.A. Mead D.J. Hackstadt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6771-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no host cell protein has been found inserted into the inclusion (2Fields K.A. Hackstadt T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 221-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The only host protein known to interact directly with the inclusion is 14-3-3, for which interaction with a bacterial component of the inclusion has been demonstrated (8Scidmore M.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1638-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Host proteins recruited to the inclusion include dynein, β-catenin, and specific Rab GTPases, but the mechanisms of their association with the inclusion are not known (9Grieshaber S.S. Grieshaber N.A. Hackstadt T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3793-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Prozialeck W.C. Fay M.J. Lamar P.C. Pearson C.A. Sigar I. Ramsey K.H. Infect.

Immun. 2003; 71: 5855-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast with the apparent absence of eukaryotic proteins in the inclusion, a large family of bacterial proteins, termed Inc proteins, are known to be inserted in this compartment (12Rockey D.D. Scidmore M.A. Bannantine J.P. Brown W.J. Microbes Infection. 2002; 4: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These proteins are unique to Chlamydiaceae, and members of the family share little primary sequence identity with each other within one species. Some of the members are somewhat conserved between different Chlamydiaceae species, but in that case the conservation is usually low. They share, however, one remarkable feature that allows the prediction of when a given protein probably belongs to the family: they possess a very large (50–80 amino acids) bilobed hydrophobic domain. Confirmation that a protein that contains such a domain is located in the inclusion requires specific antibodies against this protein (13Bannantine J.P. Griffiths R.S. Viratyosin W. Brown W.J. Rockey D.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). So far about 10 proteins have been shown to localize to the inclusion membrane, and between 40 and 90 proteins are predicted to belong to the family, from C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae genome analysis, respectively (13Bannantine J.P. Griffiths R.S. Viratyosin W. Brown W.J. Rockey D.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Toh H. Miura K. Shirai M. Hattori M. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The topology of the insertion of Inc proteins in the inclusion has not been directly addressed, but microinjection of antibodies against four of these proteins demonstrated that at least the C-terminal domain is exposed to the cytosol (15Rockey D.D. Grosenbach D. Hruby D.E. Peacock M.G. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The large hydrophobic domain is probably required for insertion in the inclusion membrane, and may be compatible with a hairpin insertion, with both extremities of the protein facing the cytosol. The mechanism by which Inc proteins are secreted out of the Chlamydiaceae for insertion in the inclusion membrane has been identified. Chlamydiaceae possess a type III secretion apparatus, which is found in several Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, and which allows for the translocation of bacterial proteins through the bacterial membranes and across a eukaryotic membrane (17Hueck C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using heterologous secretion, it was shown that Inc proteins are recognized by type III secretion machineries of other pathogens, strongly suggesting that it is the mechanism used by Chlamydiaceae to secrete these proteins into the inclusion membrane (18Fields K.A. Mead D.J. Dooley C.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Subtil A. Parsot C. Dautry-Varsat A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The first member of the Inc family to be identified, IncA, is also the one that attracted most of the attention. First cloned from C. caviae (CCA00550), it has homologs in a similar genetic environment in all sequenced genomes (CT119 in C. trachomatis serovar D and CPn0186 in C. pneumoniae CWL029). The level of sequence identity between homologs is low, and antibodies against IncA do not cross-react between different species. Antibodies against IncA from each of these species have been obtained, and have revealed an important accumulation of the protein on the membrane of the inclusion of all species (13Bannantine J.P. Griffiths R.S. Viratyosin W. Brown W.J. Rockey D.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20Bannantine J. Stamm W. Suchland R. Rockey D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 6017-6021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rockey D.D. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), as well as on fibers emanating from the inclusion that are particularly enriched in some species (22Brown W.J. Skeiky Y.A.W. Probst P. Rockey D.D. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5860-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). IncA from C. caviae was shown to be exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the inclusion, and to be phosphorylated by the host cell (15Rockey D.D. Grosenbach D. Hruby D.E. Peacock M.G. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, IncA is expressed rather late compared with most Inc proteins, the transcript being detected 12 h post-infection with the C. trachomatis serovar L2 strain and 16 h post-infection with the C. trachomatis serovar D strain (23Shaw E.I. Dooley C.A. Fischer E.R. Scidmore M.A. Fields K.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 24Belland R.J. Zhong G.M. Crane D.D. Hogan D. Sturdevant D. Sharma J. Beatty W.L. Caldwell H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8478-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). IncA is the only member of the Inc family for which a function has been proposed, namely a role in the homotypic fusion of inclusions in C. trachomatis. Typical C. trachomatis isolates occupy inclusions that fuse with each other when the cells are infected at high multiplicities of infection. This fusion is inhibited at low temperature (32 °C) and requires bacterial protein synthesis (25Van Ooij C. Homola E. Kincaid E. Engel J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of IncA in this process came from two independent studies. First, microinjection of anti-IncA antibodies blocked the fusion of inclusions in cells infected at high multiplicities of infection (16Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Second, a minority (1.5%) of C. trachomatis clinical isolates form multiple non-fusogenic inclusions and do not express IncA (26Suchland R.J. Rockey D.D. Bannantine J.P. Stamm W.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Careful analysis of this collection of variants later showed that if most of these variants (24/27) do not express IncA, three non-fusogenic strains do express a normal protein at the inclusion membrane, suggesting that other elements of the fusion machinery are missing in these strains (27Rockey D.D. Viratyosin W. Bannantine J.P. Suchland R.J. Stamm W.E. Microbiology-Sgm. 2002; 148: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with the implication of IncA in inclusion fusion is the observation that the majority of inclusion fusions occurs between 10 and 16 h post-infection with the serovar L2 (25Van Ooij C. Homola E. Kincaid E. Engel J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto A. Bessho H. Uehira K. Suda T. J. Electr. Microsc. 1991; 40: 356-363PubMed Google Scholar). This correlates with the time when IncA can be detected in the strain (16Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition of inclusion fusion at low temperature correlated with an inhibition of IncA export to the inclusion membrane in these conditions (29Fields K.A. Fischer E. Hackstadt T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3816-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the temperature block is likely to affect the export of several proteins, which could also account for the inhibition of fusion. Altogether, these data argue for a role of IncA in the fusion of inclusions observed with C. trachomatis strains. However, several questions remain unsolved. In cells infected at low multiplicity of infection, microinjection of anti-IncA antibodies leads to the septation of the inclusion (16Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). One explanation is that inclusions, like other eukaryotic organelles, are dynamic entities that can fuse and septate, and that in the presence of antibodies against IncA, fusion is slowed down, resulting in multiple inclusions. However, clinical isolates of non-fusogenic phenotypes contain only a single inclusion at low multiplicity of infection, implying that the absence of IncA does not result in multiple inclusions in this case. Microinjection of whole anti-IncA antibody was shown to induce the aggregation of IncA on the surface of the inclusion, while the protein remained homogenously distributed when Fab fragments of the same antibody were injected (15Rockey D.D. Grosenbach D. Hruby D.E. Peacock M.G. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, microinjection of anti-IncA antibody may induce a more general disorganization of the inclusion proteins involved in fusion/septation and some of the consequences of microinjection may be indirect. Even if IncA plays a direct role in C. trachomatis inclusion fusion, other roles may be envisioned, especially in other species such as C. caviae and C. pneumoniae, which appear to be less fusogenic than C. trachomatis. In this report, we investigated the biochemical properties of IncA from C. caviae GPIC strain (CcaIncA) and from C. trachomatis serovar L2 (CtrIncA). We showed that IncA from both species can self-interact. Dynamic modeling on membrane-proximal domains of CcaIncA and CtrIncA showed that tetramers of IncA are compatible with a structure similar to the SNARE complex, which is a conserved complex involved in the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. We used heterologous expression of IncA by HeLa cells to further investigate the biochemical properties of IncA. Cells, Bacteria, Antibodies, and Other Reagents—The human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, HeLa 229, was from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax (Invitrogen Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium). The GPIC strain of C. caviae was obtained from Roger Rank (University of Arkansas). C. trachomatis serovar L2 strain 434 (VR-902B) and C. trachomatis serotype D (27F0734) were from ATCC. C. trachomatis serotype D(s)5058 is a clinical isolate, which does not express IncA, and was kindly given by Drs. Dan Rockey and Walter Stamm (27Rockey D.D. Viratyosin W. Bannantine J.P. Suchland R.J. Stamm W.E. Microbiology-Sgm. 2002; 148: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Chlamydiaceae were prepared as described (30Boleti H. Benmerah A. Ojcius D. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), saponin, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2] octane (DABCO) were purchased from Sigma, paraformaldehyde was from Merck, Mowiol was from Calbiochem. Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose beads were purchased from Qiagen, dithio-bis-succinimidyl propionate (DSP) was from Interchim (Montluçon, France). The mouse anti-Chlamydia antibodies were purchased from Argene, Biosoft (12-114, Varilhes, France). Rabbit anti-histidine (sc-803) and rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (sc-8334) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, mouse anti-histidine from Invitrogen (46-0693), and rabbit anti-calnexin antibodies were from Stressgen (SPA-860). Horseradish peroxidase-linked (HRP) anti-rabbit and Cy™-3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies were obtained from Pierce, goat anti-rabbit or mouse Alexa Fluor-488 antibodies were from Molecular Probes, and goat anti-rabbit TRITC antibodies were from Immunotech (France). Rabbit anti-C. caviae IncA antibodies were prepared as described (30Boleti H. Benmerah A. Ojcius D. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids—Genomic DNA from C. caviae strain GPIC and C. trachomatis serovar L2 were prepared from bacteria using the RapidPrep Micro Genomic DNA isolation kit (Amersham Biosciences). The incA genes were amplified by PCR, and cloned in NcoI-KpnI sites of pQE-TriSystem vector for His-tagged proteins (Qiagen) and in EcoRI-KpnI sites in pEGFP-C1 vector for GFP-tagged proteins (Clontech). Sequences of the primers used are listed in Table I. In some cases, introduction of the NcoI cloning site necessitated a modification of the second amino acid of the protein. To construct Δ118CcaIncA-NS5B, the last 714 nucleotides of CcaIncA were amplified by PCR and cloned into pCMVGFPNS5BconC26 digested by NheI and BsrGI, a generous gift from Dr. D.

For infection with C. caviae strain GPIC and with C. trachomatis serovar L2, the cells were incubated in complete medium with bacteria (GPIC) for 90 min at 37 °C, washed twice in PBS, and incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C. For infection with C. trachomatis serovar D, a centrifugation step of 30 min at 3,000 × g was added before incubating the cells at 37 °C. Cross-linking Experiments—Cells (6 × 106 cells per condition) were washed three times in PBS, incubated with 0.5 mm DSP in 1% Me2SO or in 1% Me2SO alone in cross-linking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) for 30 min at 4 °C, and neutralized with three washes in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C before scraping and centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. In the case of infected cells, the supernatant fractions were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) with or without β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was used for blotting with anti-CcaIncA or anti-histidine antibodies followed with HRP- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies, and identified by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or chemifluorescence, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Co-purification of GFP-IncA and IncA-His on Histidine Affinity Columns—HeLa cells (6 × 106 per point) were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of indicated plasmid in 40 mm NaCl solution at 900 μfarad, 200 V (EasyJet, Eurogentec). Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes for 24 h and lysed on ice in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal volumes of supernatant were incubated for 2 h with 20 μl of Ni-NTA beads at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer at 4 °C, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed with transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and Western blotting. The same membrane was first probed with anti-histidine and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies, and revealed by ECL. The membrane was then stripped by a 30-min incubation at 50 °C in 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and probed again, using anti-GFP and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies, and revealed by ECL. Modeling of IncA Structure—For both CcaIncA and CtrIncA, a stretch of 39 amino acids 23 residues after the end of the second predicted transmembrane helix was modeled. The sequences were aligned by hand to the four helices in the endosomal SNARE complex (31Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), such that the hydrophobic a and d positions matched. This naturally aligned a central hydrophilic residue (glutamine for CcaIncA, threonine for CtrIncA) with the central glutamine residues in the SNARE complex, in the d position. The side chains of CcaIncA and CtrIncA were built onto the coordinates of the central part of the endosomal SNARE complex (31Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) by a molecular dynamics-based strategy essentially as published (32Nilges M. Brunger A.T. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this method, missing side chain atoms are initially placed in random positions and the resulting structure is then minimized in a three-stage protocol: first, simulated annealing with covalent and packing interactions only; second, a short molecular dynamics run with a full molecular dynamics force field in vacuo, followed by conjugate gradient minimization; and third, a molecular dynamics run in explicit solvent. We used the program X-plor (33Brunger A.T. X-plor. Yale University Press, 1992Google Scholar) for stages 1 and 2, and GROMACS 3.2 (34Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) for stage 3. We extended the third stage to a molecular dynamics trajectory in explicit solvent for 1 ns. The structures were embedded in a box of SPC water molecules with minimum distance between the solute and the box boundary of 1 nm. The system consisting of protein, water, and sodium ions to neutralize the total charge was slowly heated from 50 K to the simulation temperature (300 or 350 K) with positional restraints on the solute during 300 ps. The electrostatic interactions were treated with the Particle-Mesh-Ewald method (35Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21714) Google Scholar) for interactions beyond 1 nm; weak temperature coupling with a relaxation time of 5 ps, using the Berendsen method, was employed (36Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Vangunsteren W.F. Dinola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (24191) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 120 mm sucrose in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS, incubated for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS at room temperature, saturated in 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS and permeabilized in 0.05% saponin, 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS. To observe histidine-tagged proteins, the cells were first labeled with anti-histidine antibody before being incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 antibody. The endoplasmic reticulum and the chlamydial inclusion were labeled with anti-calnexin and anti-Chlamydia antibodies, respectively, followed by incubation with Cy™-3-conjugated goat antimouse antibodies. To quantify bacterial entry in cells transfected with CcaIncA-His, the cells were fixed 3 h after infection. Extracellular and intracellular bacteria and transfected cells were labeled as described (40Subtil A. Wyplosz B. Balañá M.E. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except that transfected cells were identified using anti-His antibodies. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol with 100 mg/ml DABCO and examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss, Germany) attached to a cooled CDD-camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), using an x63 Apochromat lens. Images were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation). IncA Proteins Are Found in High Molecular Mass Complexes—IncA proteins share the same general organization: a short N-terminal domain, a large bilobed hydrophobic domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). This domain was shown to be exposed on the cytosolic face of the inclusion membrane with CcaIncA and CtrIncA (15Rockey D.D. Grosenbach D. Hruby D.E. Peacock M.G. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The level of identity between IncA of different species is low (around 20% of identical residues, which are distributed along the whole molecule). Using tools designed to calculate the propensity of a given sequence to form coils, we noticed that all IncA proteins are predicted to engage in coiled-coil structures over the whole length of their C-terminal domain with a high probability. This prediction is strengthened by the presence of one or more leucine zipper domains in these regions. The potential of IncA to interact with other molecules via coiled-coil interactions prompted us to look for its partner(s). First, we pe"
https://openalex.org/W1973030692,"Vision relies on constancy mechanisms. Yet, these are little understood, because they are difficult to investigate in freely moving organisms. One such mechanism, translation invariance, enables organisms to recognize visual patterns independent of the region of their visual field where they had originally seen them. Tethered flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) in a flight simulator can recognize visual patterns. Because their eyes are fixed in space and patterns can be displayed in defined parts of their visual field, they can be tested for translation invariance. Here, we show that flies recognize patterns at retinal positions where the patterns had not been presented before."
https://openalex.org/W2138520275,"We have addressed the functional and structural roles of three domains of the chloroplast Rieske iron-sulfur protein; that is, the flexible hinge that connects the transmembrane helix to the soluble cluster-bearing domain, the N-terminal stromal protruding domain, and the transmembrane helix. To this aim mutants were generated in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Their capacities to assemble the cytochrome b f complex, perform plastoquinol oxidation, and signal 6redox-induced activation of the light-harvesting complex II kinase during state transition were tested in vivo. Deletion of one residue and extensions of up to five residues in the flexible hinge had no significant effect on complex accumulation or electron transfer efficiency. Deletion of three residues (Δ3G) dramatically decreased reaction rates by a factor of ∼10. These data indicate that the chloroplast iron-sulfur protein-linking domain is much more flexible than that of its counterpart in mitochondria. Despite greatly slowed catalysis in the Δ3G mutant, there was no apparent delay in light-harvesting complex II kinase activation or state transitions. This indicates that conformational changes occurring in the Rieske protein did not represent a limiting step for kinase activation within the time scale tested. No phenotype could be associated with mutations in the N-terminal stromal-exposed domain. In contrast, the N17V mutation in the Rieske protein transmembrane helix resulted in a large decrease in the cytochrome f synthesis rate. This reveals that the Rieske protein transmembrane helix plays an active role in assembly-mediated control of cytochrome f synthesis.

It catalyzes the oxidation of plastoquinol (PQH2) and the reduction of plastocyanin. The complex contains four major subunits: cyt f, cyt b6, Rieske protein, and subunit IV (for review, see Ref. 1Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Four of its redox cofactors have long been identified; they are a c-type heme in cyt f, two b-type hemes in cyt b6 (bL and bH), and an Fe2S2 cluster in the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP). A new heme ci (or x) bound to cyt b6 close to the quinone reduction Qi site, a chlorophyll, a carotenoid, and specific lipids have also been identified in the cyt b6f structures from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas) (2Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.-L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and the cyanobacterium, Mastigocladus laminosus (3Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A.

Redeker V. Zito F. Wollman F.-A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3956-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The ISP is essential for PQH2 docking and for diverting its electrons into the “high” and “low potential pathways.” After PQH2 oxidation at the Qo site located close to the lumenal face of the thylakoid membrane, one electron is injected in the “high potential chain” consisting of the ISP, cyt f, and plastocyanin. This chain channels electrons from photosystem (PS) II to PS I. The second electron from PQH2 is injected into the “low potential chain” comprised of the bL, bH, and likely the ci hemes. This second pathway results in electron transfer across the membrane to the Qi site, located close to the stromal face of the thylakoid membrane. According to the Q cycle mechanism (5Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 6Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the genesis of a PQH2 at the Qi site increases the H+/e– stoichiometry of electron flow. Diversion of electrons to the high and low potential branches is mediated by an ISP conformational change. In the related mitochondrial bc1 cyt complexes, the rotational swing of the ISP extramembrane domain leads to a cluster movement over 20 Å, which prevents a double electron injection into the high potential chain (for review, see Ref. 1Berry E.A.

Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).Besides modulating electron flow in photosynthesis, the ISP movement has been implicated in redox signaling during state transitions. State transitions are a mechanism for balancing the light absorption capacity of the two photosystems. Moreover, in Chlamydomonas, state transitions are also associated with a switch from linear to cyclic electron flow (for review, see Ref. 17Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3623-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, state transitions rely on the reversible phosphorylation of the PSII outer antenna complexes (LHCII) by a kinase that becomes activated when the plastoquinone pool becomes reduced (for review, see Ref. 18Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Binding of PQH2 to the Qo site of the b6f complex is required for LHCII kinase activation (19Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Gal A. Andersson B. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25225-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Rich P. Ohad I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Sci. Acad. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). ISP conformational changes have been postulated to play a role in the activation process (21Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Vener A.V. Ohad I. Andersson B. Curr. Opin.

However, the mechanisms that allow transduction of the activating signal from the lumenal to the stromal side of the membrane, where LHCII phosphorylation takes place, are not yet understood. Chlamydomonas LHC kinase has been cloned (24Fleischmann M.M. Ravanel S. Delosme R. Olive J. Zito F. Wollman F.A. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Depège N. Bellafiore S. Rochaix J.-D. Science. 2003; 299: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and a putative transmembrane helix is proposed. This helix might be directly involved in sensing PQH2 binding to the Qo site (22Vener A.V. Ohad I. Andersson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the existence of an intrinsic signaling pathway within the b6f complex cannot be excluded.Here, we performed an extensive mutagenesis study of the chloroplast ISP in Chlamydomonas. Our aim was to compromise its properties by various insertion/deletion/substitution in the flexible hinge, the N-terminal stromal-exposed, and the transmembrane domains and to test the consequences on electron transfer, kinase activation, and cyt b6f complex assembly in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSGrowth Conditions—Chlamydomonas strains were grown on Tris acetate-phosphate medium at pH 7.2 and 25 °C under 6 microeinsteins m–2 s–1 continuous illumination or in the dark and collected during the exponential phase at 2 × 106 cells ml–1.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Nuclear Transformation—Plasmid pACR4.5 (ampicillin-sensitive/tetracycline-resistant) containing the Chlamydomonas PetC gene (26de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used as the template for mutagenesis with the oligonucleotides: petC-Δ4,5′-CGTTATGCCGGTGGTGCGCGCgGCCGCTGTGCCCGACATGAACAAGCGCAAC-3′; petC-N17V, 5′-CAAGCGCAACATCATGgtCCTGATCCTGGCTGGCTGGTGGCGCcGGTCTGCCATCAC-3′; petC-A32K, 5′-GCCCATCACCACCCTGaagCTGGGCTACGGcGCCTTCTTCGTGC; petC-+5G, 5′-CTACATTGTTCCTCTTTACAGCTCgGGCggcggtggcggtggcGGTGGCGGCGGTGGCCAG-3′; petC-+3G, 5′-CTACATTGTTCCTCTTTACAGCTCgGGCggcggtggcGGTGGCGGCGGTGGCCAG-3′; petC-+1G, 5′-CATTGTTCCTCTTTACAGCTCgggtGGCGGTGGCGGCGGTGGC-3′; petC-Δ1G, 5′-CATTGTTCCTCTTTACAGCTCgGGTGGCGGCGGTGGCCAGGCC-3′; petC-Δ3G, 5′-CATTGTTCCTCTTTACAGCTCgGGCGGTGGCCAGGCCGCTAAG-3′.Mutant plasmids, detected by restoration of ampicillin resistance, were subsequently screened for the NotI (petC-Δ4), NarI (petC-N17V, petC-A32K), or AvaI (petC-+5G, petC-+3G, petC-+1G, petC-Δ1G, petC-Δ3G) restriction sites, underlined in the above oligonucleotide sequences. Chlamydomonas double mutant cells with a cell wall deficiency (cw15) and a deletion in PETC (petC-Δ1 in de Vitry et al. (26de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); here referred to as ΔPetC) were transformed as in Kropat et al. (27Kropat J. von Gromoff E.D. Müller F.W. Beck C.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using HindIII-linearized plasmids. Phototrophic colonies were selected on minimal medium under light intensities of 40–100 microeinsteins m–2 s–1 and became visible after ∼2 weeks. Transformants were characterized as in de Vitry et al. (26de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by restriction analysis of specific PCR-amplified products (not shown). Mutations within the Chlamydomonas PetC gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Protein Isolation, Separation, Analysis, and in Vivo Labeling—Thylakoid membranes were purified and resuspended in 10 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid) as in Breyton et al. (28Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyt b6f complexes were extracted by a Hecameg (HG) solubilization (at 30 rather than 25 mm) of thylakoid membranes (29Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Polypeptides were separated on 12–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea (30Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lanes were loaded with equal amounts (15 μg) of chlorophyll. Proteins were electrotransferred onto Immobilon NC membranes in a semidry blotting apparatus at 0.8 mA·cm–2 for about 30 min. Immunodetection employed antisera raised against subunits of the Chlamydomonas cyt b6f complex (cyt f, Rieske protein, cyt b6) at a 1/200 dilution, and bands were visualized with 125I-labeled protein A (28Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cells grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml were pulse-radiolabeled in the presence of 5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate for either 5 min in the presence of 8 μg/ml cycloheximide (an inhibitor of cytoplasmic translation) or 8 min in the presence of 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol (an inhibitor of chloroplast translation) (30Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Labeling was terminated by dilution of the isotope with 10 volumes of chilled 50 mm sodium acetate before thylakoid membrane isolation.In vivo phosphorylation was performed as described in Wollman and Delepelaire (31Wollman F.-A. Delepelaire P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using [33P]orthophosphate instead of [32P]orthophosphate (21Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml were harvested and resuspended in a phosphate-depleted medium for 30 min, then 2 μCi/ml [33P]orthophosphate was added for 90 min. Cells were harvested, resuspended in a phosphate-depleted medium, and adapted for 30 min to state I conditions (plastoquinone pool-oxidized; cells were strongly agitated in the dark). To obtain state II conditions (plastoquinone poolreduced), cells were incubated with 5 μm carbonylcyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) in the dark without agitation for 30 min (32Bulté L. Gans P. Rebéillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mm NaF and rapidly cooled to 4 °C before thylakoid membrane isolation.Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—For spectroscopic analysis, cells were collected and re-suspended in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, in the presence of 20% Ficoll to prevent cell sedimentation. Measurements were performed at room temperature with a home-built spectrophotometer (33Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as described in de Vitry et al. (26de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cyt f and b6 reduction was measured as the absorption changes at 554 and 564 nm, respectively, minus a base line drawn between 545 and 573 nm (34Finazzi G. Büschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F.-A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The slow phase (phase b) of the electrochromic shift of carotenoids, which reflects charge transfer across the membrane and cyt b6f catalysis, was measured at 515 nm. Non-saturating actinic flashes were employed to prevent multiple turnovers of the cyt b6f complex. When required, FCCP was added at the concentration of 1 μm to collapse the electrochemical proton gradient.State I-II transitions were measured according to the procedure previously employed (35Delepelaire P. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 809: 277-283Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar); cells were adapted in the dark for 40 min in the presence of glucose oxidase (2 mg/ml), glucose (20 mm), and 3-(3′,4′-dichloroprenyl)-1–1-dimethylurea (10 μm), to obtain state II. Cells were then illuminated with continuous light (590 ± 10 nm, 60 microeinsteins m–2 s–1) for 10 min to promote reversal to state I and to probe the state II to I transition. The same cells were then placed into darkness with periodic sampling to probe relaxation back to state II. This procedure allowed a true estimation of the state I-state II transition independent of other metabolic changes that accompany the aerobiosis-anaerobiosis transition.RESULTSLocation of Mutations in the Rieske Protein N-terminal, Transmembrane, and Hinge Domains—Fig. 1 shows the locations of mutations that were introduced into the Rieske ISP of Chlamydomonas (36de Vitry C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and their alignment with partial sequences of other cyt b6f and bc1 Rieske proteins. Their locations within the N-terminal region of the Chlamydomonas cyt b6f structure (2Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.-L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 2. The first three N-terminal residues (Ala1 to Ala3) and the flexible hinge (Ser43 to Gly50) of the Rieske ISP are not resolved in the structure (2Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.-L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), very likely because of their flexibility, and are not shown in Fig. 2. The eight-residue-long flexible hinge of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast Rieske protein contains two serine residues followed by a stretch of six glycines (Fig. 1). This domain is required for the ISP conformational movement. We modified the length of this domain by the addition of 1, 3, or 5 glycines (mutations +1G, +3G, and +5G) or deletion of 1 or 3 glycines (mutations Δ1G and Δ3G). In the PetC-Δ4 mutant we deleted 4 residues, Ala-Ser-Ser-Glu (ASSE), from the already short N-terminal domain to test the role of this domain in signaling.Fig. 2Mutations in the N-terminal, transmembrane, and flexible hinge of the Rieske protein in the Chlamydomonas b6f complex structure. The N-terminal domain of the Rieske protein (N-ter Rieske) is close to the C-terminal domain of cyt f (C-ter cyt f). An endogenous sulfolipid (SQDG) interacts with the Rieske protein Asn17 and cyt f Lys272 residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A characteristic feature of the cyt b6f complex is the absence of a charged residue (lysine or arginine) at the lumenal end the Rieske ISP transmembrane helix. Such charged residues at the ends of transmembrane helices serve to anchor these helices to the membrane and are found in the cyt bc1 ISP counterpart (arrow on Fig. 1). To test whether the absence of this charged residue in the cyt b6f ISP represents an important feature for function of the cyt b6f complex, we generated a mutant strain (A32K) where a polar residue has been introduced into the lumenal end of the ISP helix (Figs. 1 and 2). In the cyt b6f structures (2Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.-L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 3Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain of the Rieske protein lies close to the C-terminal domain of cyt f. In the Chlamydomonas structure, an endogenous sulfolipid (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG)) interacts via hydrogen bonds with Rieske protein Arg13 and Asn17 and cyt f Lys272. Residues Arg13 and Asn17 are conserved in cyt b6f Rieske proteins (Fig. 1). To test the role of Asn17 in proton translocation and/or possible assembly-mediated control of cyt f synthesis, we decreased the polarity of this residue by constructing the substitution N17V (see N17V in Figs. 1 and 2).Rieske ISP Hinge Mutants; Assembly of the cyt b6f Complex and Electron Transfer Properties—To further investigate the relationship between Rieske ISP flexibility and function in the cyt b6f complex, we extended the mutational approach to include insertions of up to 5 residues and deletions of up to 3 residues. Previous ISP hinge mutations (in cyanobacteria) were limited to insertion of 4 residues and deletions of 1 or 2 residues. The two-residue deletion slowed electron transfer by a factor of four (16Yan J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20925-20933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The results of immunodetection analysis indicated that the cyt b6f subunits accumulated to wild type (WT) levels in all of the flexible hinge mutants even though their Rieske proteins were of different size (Fig. 3). Spectroscopic analysis of the modified cyt b6f complex in vivo (Table I) confirmed the high tolerance of the ISP hinge for modifications in length. A dramatic consequence on electron transfer was observed only in the Δ3G mutant (three residues deletion of the hinge). The effect of this mutation (Fig. 4; note the differences in times scales on the abscissa between WT in A/B/C and Δ3G-1 in D/E/F) was to reduce in a concerted manner the rate of electron injection into both the high potential pathway, as evidenced by the kinetics of cyt f reduction (Fig. 4, panels B and E) and the low potential chain. The latter pathway was monitored by measuring the slow phase of the electrochromic signal (the “b phase,” panels A and D), which results from electron transfer between the b hemes. In addition, redox changes of the b hemes were measured directly (panels C and F). Cyt b6 redox kinetics are rather complex, resulting from cyt bL reduction by PQH2 from the Qo-site, cyt bL oxidation by cyt bH, and then cyt bH oxidation by plastoquinone at the Qi site. To directly monitor cyt bL reduction, which is linked to plastoquinol oxidation, kinetics were measured in the presence of the inhibitor 2-N-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. This compound selectively slows down cyt bH oxidation at the Qi site (37Selak M.A. Whitmarsh J. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 286-292Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and allows a correct deconvolution of the reduction signal (triangles in panels C and F).Fig. 3Accumulation of cyt b6f subunits in the Rieske ISP flexible hinge mutants. Cells from the exponential phase of growth were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12–18% acrylamide, 8 m urea). Cyt f and Rieske protein were immunodetected.

Algae were collected during exponential growth phase and resuspended in Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.2, buffer with the addition of 20% (w/v) Ficoll to prevent sedimentation. Cells were illuminated with non-saturating actinic flashes of red light at a frequency of 0.15 Hz. 3-(3′,4′-dichloroprenyl)-1–1-dimethylurea and hydroxylamine were added at concentrations of 10 μm and 1 mm, respectively, to block PSII activity. Where indicated, FCCP was added at the concentration of 1 μm to facilitate pH equilibration between the chloroplast compartments. 2-N-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) was added at the concentration of 4 μm to slow plastoquinone reduction at the Qi site. The fast and slow phases of the electrochromic signal in panels A and D represent charge separation within PSI and the cyt b6f complex, respectively. In panels B, C, E, and F, upward and downward absorption changes correspond to reduction and oxidation of the cyt b6f redox cofactors, respectively. –ΔI/I is the difference between the light transmitted through the measuring and reference cuvettes divided by the light transmitted through the reference cuvette.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It is known that a proton gradient exists across the thylakoid membranes of dark adapted Chlamydomonas cells. This gradient arises from ATP hydrolysis by the CF0-F1 ATP synthase-ATPase complex (34Finazzi G. Büschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F.-A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The gradient slows down the kinetics of plastoquinol oxidation at the Qo site. In the Δ3G mutant, the consequences of the electrochemical proton gradient on cyt b6f catalysis were larger than in the wild type; the rates of PQH2 oxidation were 12 and 50 times slower than in wild type cells in the presence and absence of the protonophore FCCP, respectively. This phenotype resembles that of two other cyt b6f mutants of Chlamydomonas; FUD2, in which the Qo site of the cyt b6f is modified because of a 36-base pair duplication in the cd loop of cyt b6 (34Finazzi G.

The aging of human lens is characterized by increasing levels of water-insoluble (WI) 1The abbreviations used are: WI, water-insoluble; WISS, water-insoluble sonicate supernatant; WS, water-soluble; AGE, advanced glycation end-product; COSY, correlation spectroscopy; DEPT, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer; HFBA, n-heptafluorobutyric acid; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; K2P, lysine-lysine-pyridinium or 1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-4-(5-amino-5-carboxypentylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydropyridinium; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; Th, Thompsons (atomic mass unit); MOLD, methylglyoxal lysine dimer; GOLD, glyoxal lysine dimer.1The abbreviations used are: WI, water-insoluble; WISS, water-insoluble sonicate supernatant; WS, water-soluble; AGE, advanced glycation end-product; COSY, correlation spectroscopy; DEPT, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer; HFBA, n-heptafluorobutyric acid; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; K2P, lysine-lysine-pyridinium or 1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-4-(5-amino-5-carboxypentylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydropyridinium; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; Th, Thompsons (atomic mass unit); MOLD, methylglyoxal lysine dimer; GOLD, glyoxal lysine dimer. proteins in association with high levels of yellow chromophores and non-tryptophan fluorescence (1Kurzel R.B.

Felius J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 322-329PubMed Google Scholar). These biochemical changes are all enhanced in senile and brunescent cataractous lenses. Glycation of lens proteins has been suggested to be a major protein modification in older lenses, and indeed diabetic patients have an increased risk of cataract formation (5Cotlier E. Can. J. Ophthalmol. 1981; 16: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar). The human lens is largely composed of elongated fiber cells that are derived from epithelial cells located in a thin layer on the anterior surface. The innermost layers of the lens are formed during embryonic development and remain throughout life (6Maisel H. Harding C.V. Alcala J.A. Kuszak J. Bradley R. Bloemendal H. The Morphology of the Lens. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 49-84Google Scholar). Due to the lifelong stability of the lens crystallins, they can continuously accumulate damaging modifications. In time, these modifications may be responsible for the protein aggregation and protein cross-linking seen in age-onset cataracts (7Fulhorst H.W. Young R.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1966; 5: 298-303PubMed Google Scholar, 8Buckingham R.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1972; 14: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Li L.-K. Roy D. Spector A. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dramatic, visible increase in protein-bound chromophores occurs during brunescent cataract formation, especially in tropical countries (10Pirie A. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1968; 7: 634-650PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kamei A. Kato M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1991; 39: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the chemical mechanisms responsible for the development of lens coloration and cataract remain unknown. In the past two decades, enormous progress has been made in our understanding of the Maillard reaction and its contribution to age-related changes and complications of diabetes. Maillard chemistry is initiated by the non-enzymatic reaction of reducing sugars (12Maillard L.C. Compt. Rend. 1912; 154: 66-68Google Scholar), dicarbonyl compounds or the degradation products of ascorbic acid (13Bensch K.G. Fleming J.E. Lohmann W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7193-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Diseases. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 123-142Google Scholar) with proteins. The intermediates, either Schiff bases and/or Amadori compounds, then undergo a series of further reactions through dicarbonyl intermediates to form advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) (15Thorpe S. Baynes J.W. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A major consequence of AGE accumulation is the formation of covalently cross-linked proteins, especially in long-lived tissue proteins. AGE cross-links may thus contribute to the pathophysiological changes seen in aging, cataract formation, and the long term complications of diabetes (16Reiser K.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 218: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the major cross-links may not have been isolated, possibly because they do not survive acid hydrolysis of the proteins. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel lysine-lysine cross-link, 1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-4-(5-amino-5-carboxypentylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydropyridinium (K2P), from enzymatic digests of aged and cataract human lens proteins. In addition, quantitative determination of this cross-link in individual lenses was performed in both normal human lenses and brunescent cataract lenses. The age-dependent increase of this cross-link in normal human lenses and its significant enhancement in cataract lenses support the possibility that glycation plays an important role in lens proteins insolubilization and precipitation during aging and cataract development. Materials—All reagents were obtained in the highest purity available from Sigma. De-ionized water (18-megohm resistance or greater) was used for all experiments. Phosphate buffers were treated with 10 g/liter Chelex resin (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) overnight to remove trace metal ion contaminants as described by Beyer and Fridovich (25Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and filtered through a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filter before use. Normal human lenses were obtained as a kind gift from the Heartland Lions Eye Tissue Bank (Columbia, MO) following cornea removal. All the lenses were clear, without obvious cataracts, and the eyes were screened for infectious diseases. The lenses were stored individually, frozen at –70 °C until use. Brunescent cataracts were collected from hospitals in Rajkot, India, and stored frozen at the Patney Eye Clinic in Rajkot, India. They were transported by hand to Columbia, MO, where they were stored individually, frozen at –70 °C until use. Preparation of Lens Proteins—Aged normal human lenses and early stage brunescent cataract lenses (dark yellow to tan in color) were decapsulated, pooled, and homogenized in deionized water (1 ml per lens) with a hand Dounce homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The 27,000 × g pellet was obtained and washed three times with an equal volume of deionized water. These supernatants were combined and designated the WS fraction. The final pellet was resuspended again in deionized water and sonicated in ice for 5 min in a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Inc. Sonicator (Model W-375) at a power setting of 4 and a duty cycle of 40%. The solubilized protein was recovered after centrifugation at 27,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended and sonicated again. The second solubilized supernatant, when combined with the first, represented 95–100% of the total WI protein and was designated the WI sonicate supernatant (WISS), as described previously (26Cheng R. Lin B. Lee K. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1537: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Cheng R. Lin B. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1587: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Cheng R. Lin B. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Newborn calf lens proteins were used as a control and prepared from the outer cortex of thawed, decapsulated lenses by removing the outer 1.0 cm of tissue with a cork borer. This tissue was homogenized in deionized water and centrifuged at 27,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed extensively against 5.0 mm Chelex-treated phosphate buffer (pH 7) and used directly. The protein content was determined using the BCA assay as described by the manufacturer (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Proteolytic Digestion of Aged Normal Human Lens or Cataract Lens Proteins—Proteolytic digestion was carried out by a modification of the method of Luthra et al. (29Luthra M. Ranganathan D. Ranganathan S. Balasubramanian D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Typical preparations contained protein from 150 to 200 aged or cataract human lenses, each protein fraction was adjusted to 10 mg/ml in 5.0 mm Chelex-treated phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 3.6 mg of porcine intestinal peptidase (Sigma P7500) was added per 100 mg of protein. The digestion mixture was then sterile filtered into a sterile tissue culture flask, bubbled with argon, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the dark. After 24 h, a solution of Pronase (Sigma P5147) was added through a syringe filter, to a level of 3.6 mg of Pronase per 100 mg of protein. Digestion was continued for 72 h, during which Pronase was added two additional times after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Following adjustment of the digest to pH 8.5 with 1.0 m NaOH, leucine aminopeptidase (Sigma L 5658) was added to a final concentration of 40 units per 100 mg of protein. The digest was sterile filtered, bubbled with argon, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After adjusting the pH of the digest to 7.6 with 1.0 m HCl, it was sterile filtered again, bubbled with argon, and further proteolysis was carried out by the sequential sterile addition of 5.0 mg of trypsin per 100 mg of protein (Sigma T8642), 5.0 mg of chymotrypsin per 100 mg of protein (Sigma C4149) followed 24 h later by the addition of 3.6 mg of proteinase K (Sigma P6556) per 100 mg of protein. Calf lens protein control and corresponding enzyme blanks incubated without added protein were also incubated and analyzed on several occasions. Amino acid analysis was used to evaluate the efficiency of the enzyme digestion by comparing the total free amino acids in a 12% sulfosalicylic acid supernatant to that of an equivalent aliquot acid hydrolyzed in 6.0 n HCl, for 20 h. Isolation and Purification of K2P from Human Lenses—WI lens proteins were separated from 150 pooled aged normal human lenses and from 350 types I and II cataract lenses from India, these were classified based on the extent of browning of the lens, and subjected to extensive enzymatic digestion. The digest was applied to Bio-Gel P-2 size exclusion chromatography, and the early eluting peak at 330 nm (Peak 1) was concentrated and multiple aliquots subjected to HPLC. The final product was judged pure by virtue of a single ninhydrin-positive spot that corresponded to a single UV and fluorescent spot on Silica Gel 60 F254 aluminum medium thin layer chromatography (Merck) and a single UV HPLC peak under various chromatographic conditions. Bio-Gel P-2 Size-exclusion Chromatography—The total digest from ∼2 g of either aged or cataract WISS protein was concentrated and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (5 × 76 cm, bed volume 1.5 liter), with 25 mm formic acid as eluant. Fractions of 14.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml per minute and monitored for absorbance at 330 nm, for fluorescence at excitation/emission = 350/450 nm, and for amino acid content by the fluorescamine assay (30Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). An enzymatic digest of calf lens protein (control) was run under the same conditions. Peak fractions were pooled according to the A330 readings. Five peaks (designated P1–P5) were obtained, and peak 1 was used for the isolation of the novel cross-link in this study. High-performance Liquid Chromatography—Peak 1, isolated from several pooled aged and cataract WISS protein digests by Bio-Gel P-2 column, was concentrated and injected into a preparative C18 reversed-phase column (Prodigy 21.2 × 250 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Lenexa, KS) with Model LC-6AD pumps, an SCL-10A controller and an SPD-M10A photodiode array detector. The column was eluted for 2 min with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), at a flow rate of 8 ml per minute, and then with a linear gradient from 5% to 45% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% HFBA over 40 min, followed by a linear increase to 100% acetonitrile over the next 5 min. The eluant from the column was monitored with an on-line diode array detector. One peak, which had a maximum absorbance at 343 nm, was collected and further purified over a semi-preparative reversed-phase Prodigy column (10 × 250 mm). The column was eluted for 2 min with 25 mm formic acid-water (buffer A), at a flow rate of 1.8 ml per minute, and then with a linear gradient to 25% buffer B (water/acetonitrile = 1/1, v/v, with 25 mm formic acid) over 25 min, followed by a linear increase to 50% buffer B over the next 8 min and continued to 100% buffer B over the next 5 min. The eluant from the column was monitored with an on-line photodiode array detector. The A343 peak was concentrated and purified once again with the same solvent system but with an analytical Prodigy RP-HPLC column. The final purification was achieved by using an analytical-reversed phase Prodigy column (4.6 × 250 mm) with the same solvents and gradient as the preparative HPLC mentioned above. After extensive drying with a speed vacuum, 1.3 mg of K2P was obtained. Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1E spectrophotometer (Varian Analytical Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) connected to a Dell PC computer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-2500 Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments Inc.). Samples for NMR spectroscopy were dissolved in 300 μl of H2O/D2O (9/1, v/v) or 100% D2O after two exchanges with D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.) and transferred to a 5-mm Advanced Microtube (Shigemi, Allison Park, PA) and scanned for 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC at 25 °C with a Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) model ARX-500 MHz spectrometer. For an external standard, 99.9% D2O with 0.75% 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt was used. For 13C NMR spectroscopy, the sample was scanned for 4 days. LC-MS and LC-MS/MS were performed with an in-line HPLC-TSQ 7000 mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray (ESI) interface. The LC system consists of a quaternary pump P4000, an auto sampler AS3000, and a photo diode array detector UV6000LP. A Phenomenex LUNA 5μ C18 (2Lerman S. Borkman R. Ophthal. Res. 1976; 8: 335-353Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar) 250- × 4.6-mm column was used for sample analysis. The column was eluted for 2 min with 25 mm formic acid-water (buffer A), at a flow rate of 0.6 ml per minute, and then with a linear gradient to 40% buffer B (100% acetonitrile in 25 mm formic acid) over 40 min, followed by a linear increase to 100% buffer B over the next 5 min. The eluant from the column was also monitored with an on-line photodiode array detector. Data were processed with the software pack Xcalibur 1.2. The masses of the parent and daughter ions in the LC-MS and LC-MS/MS experiments described below were measured within a ±0.5-Thompsons (Th) window centered on the mass-to-charge ratio of interest. The collision energy used for MS/MS experiments was either 25 or 70 eV. Quantitative Determination of K2P in Individual Normal Human Lenses and Brunescent Cataract Lenses—Thirty normal human lenses, ranging in age from 2 to 75 years, and 10 single brunescent cataract lenses (type I and II, classified based on the extent of browning of the lens) were decapsulated and homogenized individually in 0.5 ml of deionized water. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml of deionized water. The 27,000 × g pellet obtained was washed once again with 1 ml of deionized water and resuspended in 2.5 ml of deionized water. It was sonicated in a water bath for 6 min with a Heat Systems-Ultrasonic Inc. Sonicator (Model W-375) at a power setting of 4 and a duty cycle of 40%. The solubilized protein was recovered after centrifugation at 27,000 × g, representing at least 95% of the total WI fraction. The supernatants were combined and considered the WS fraction. The protein content of both WS and WI fractions was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Both the WS and WI fractions were submitted individually to enzymatic digestion, as described above. The final digests of each single lens were applied to a small size-exclusion Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography (1 × 25 cm, bed volume 19.6 ml), with 25 mm formic acid as eluant. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and monitored for absorbance at 330 nm and for fluorescence at 450 nm when excited at 350 nm. Based on 330-nm readings, peak 1 was pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml. Peak 1, 100 μl (20% of the total), was injected onto an analytical Prodigy HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Phenomenex) for quantitative determination of K2P based on the absorbance at 343 nm. The peak area was converted to picomoles/mg of lens protein according to a standard calibration curve of purified K2P. Isolation and Purification of K2P from Human Lens Protein Digests—A pooled cataract lens WISS protein digest (Fig. 1A) and a calf lens protein digest (panel B) were fractionated by Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). Five peaks were pooled from the cataract lens WISS protein digest. Very few chromophores or fluorophores were detected from the calf lens protein digest, indicating that the cataract lens chromophores were not produced during the lengthy enzymatic digestion process or contributed by the added enzymes per se. Peak 1 was concentrated and submitted to three additional purification steps by using preparative (Fig. 2A), semi-preparative (panel B), and analytical (panel C) reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 2). The absorbance profiles at 280 and 343 nm are presented and labeled in each panel. The A343 peak marked by an asterisk is K2P. The final purified K2P recovery was 1.3 mg from 8–9 g of protein digest. Structure Elucidation of K2P—The chemical structure of this novel chromophore was characterized by its absorption, fluorescence, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY, and TOCSY two-dimensional spectra and its mass spectroscopic properties. Its structure was determined to be 1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-4-(5-amino-5-carboxypentylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydropyridinium, to which we assigned the trivial name lysine-lysine pyridinium (K2P) (see Structure 1). Structure of K2P—The UV absorption spectra (Fig. 3) showed a maximum wavelength of K2P to be 343 nm at pH 7, which was unchanged at either pH 2 or 12. The emission maximum was 410 nm when excited at 343 nm (data not shown). The 343-nm absorbance is consistent with the structure of the conjugate and depends upon the presence of the nitrogens as part of the resonance structure. After purifications by preparative, semi-preparative, and analytical reversed-phase C18 columns, K2P was subjected to LC-MS and MS/MS analyses using water-acetonitrile solvents with formic acid as a counter ion (Fig. 4). As shown in panel A of Fig. 4, a single peak was eluted at 5.71 min and detected by its absorbance at 343 nm. The corresponding mass spectrum for this peak revealed a molecular ion peak at an m/z value of 370.96 Da (panels B and C), indicating a molecular mass of 369.96 Da. Based on the molecular mass, we examined a number of possible empirical formulas. Only C17H31N4O5 matched the rest of the analytical data as shown below. The LC-MS/MS fragmentation pattern of this compound is shown in panel D. The fragments, labeled as 326 (K2P-45 Da), 281 (K2P-45-45 Da), 196, 179, and 84, were assigned individually to the structure, as shown in panel E. The sequential loss of two 45-Da fragments suggests that two carboxyl groups may exist in the molecule. The lysine-derived fragments of 84 and 130 (not labeled) suggest that lysine is the possible parent amino acid for this compound. After K2P was purified by using formic acid as the counter ion, the sample was subjected to 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. A proton signal at a chemical shift (δ) of 8.1 ppm appeared in the 1H spectrum. This was likely due to residual formic acid, because when the sample was re-purified by analytical RP-HPLC with HFBA as the counter ion, the signal at 8.1 ppm disappeared. Fig. 5A shows 1H NMR spectrum of the final purified K2P in 100% D2O (full spectrum) or in H2O/D2O = 9/1 solution (see insets a and b). The chemical shifts (δ, ppm) for each hydrogen atom, the number of protons, and the coupling constants (J, Hz) between the indicated protons are summarized in Table I. All the protons were assigned and labeled (Fig. 5A). Inset e shows the exchange of H-5 by deuterium (D) in D2O. When the sample was dissolved in 100% D2O, the doublet signal of H-5, which is coupled with H-6 at 5.24 ppm in H2O, disappeared in D2O (inset b), and the corresponding signal of H-6 (7.70 ppm) appeared as a singlet in D2O instead of its doublet signal in H2O (inset a). However, when we dried the sample and reconstituted the sample in H2O/D2O (v/v, 9/1) solvent, H-5 appeared again as a doublet and coupled with the H-6 (doublet) as shown in both insets a and b. As previously reported by Henle et al. (31Henle T. Walter A. Haessner R. Klostermeyer H. Z. Lebensm.-Unters. Forsch. 1994; 199: 55-58Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) on an arginine-methylglyoxal condensed adduct, Nδ-(5-methyl-4-oxo-5-hydroimidazol-2-yl)-l-ornithine, an exchange of the proton at C-5 in D2O was observed. The signals of H-3 (t, 4.60 ppm) and H-2, 2′ (d, d, 3.63, and 3.73 ppm) were expanded in insets c and d, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated proton numbers and α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ proton signals from the two lysine residues were assigned separately. The downfield shift of methylene protons on the ϵ-carbon (3.58 ppm, 2H) suggests that the ϵ-nitrogen atom of lysine moiety is part of a heterocycle, which is in agreement with the structure suggested.Table I1H and 13C NMR data of K2P (D2O/H2O, 25 °C) Open table in a new tab Fig. 5B (panel a) shows the distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT-135) spectrum, and panel b shows the 13C NMR. The sample used for 13C NMR was purified with formic acid as a counter ion, whereas the DEPT spectrum was gathered on a sample of K2P with HFBA as a counter ion. Therefore, a 13C signal of formic acid at 175 ppm was observed. Inset c shows the expanded signals for the two carboxyl-carbons of the lysine residues, which appear at 177.4 and 177.6 ppm, respectively. The chemical shifts (δ, ppm) for each carbon were summarized in Table I together with those of protons. DEPT is a spectral editing sequence. As shown in Fig. 5B (panel a), DEPT-135 give a spectrum with positive CH and CH3 signals and negative CH2 signals. Quaternary carbons are missing from the DEPT spectrum. By the comparison of 13C NMR and DEPT data, it is clear that C-2 was CH2, C-3, -5, and -6 were either CH or CH3 and C-4 was a quaternary carbon. Based on the integration result of 1H NMR, all of C-3, -5, and -6 can be identified as CH, but not CH3. Similarly, all carbon signals from the two lysine residues were assigned and labeled on the charts mentioned above. The relationships between proton and proton, proton and carbons of H/C-2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 were considered. The H–H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) is shown in Fig. 6A, where H-3 is J-coupled to H-2 and H-2′, and H-6 is J-coupled to H-5 even though the cross signal between H-6 and H-5 was relatively weak due to the slow exchange of H-5 by deuterium (refer to Fig. 5A). The heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) spectroscopy was used to determine which protons of the molecule are bonded to which 13C nuclei (or other X nuclei). As shown in Fig. 6B, the J-coupl"

https://openalex.org/W1981906878,"Inositol-5-phosphatases are important enzymes involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes from synaptic vesicle recycling to insulin signaling. We describe a comparative study of two representative inositol-5-phosphatases, Schizosaccharomyces pombe synaptojanin (SPsynaptojanin) and human SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase SHIP2. We show that in addition to Mg2+, transition metals such as Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ are also effective activators of SPsynaptojanin. In contrast, Ca2+ and Cu2+ are inhibitory. We provide evidence that Mg2+ binds the same site occupied by Ca2+ observed in the crystal structure of SPsynaptojanin complexed with inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2). Ionizations important for substrate binding and catalysis are defined for the SPsynaptojanin-catalyzed Ins(1,4,5)P3 reaction. Kinetic analysis with four phosphatidylinositol lipids bearing a 5-phosphate and 54 water-soluble inositol phosphates reveals that SP-synaptojanin and SHIP2 possess much broader substrate specificity than previously appreciated. The rank order for SPsynaptojanin is Ins(2,4,5)P3 > phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) ≈ Ins(4,5)P2 ≈ Ins(1,4,5)P3 ≈ Ins(4,5,6)P3 > PtdIns(3,5)P2 ≈ PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 ≈ Ins(1,2,4,5)P4 ≈ Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 ≈ Ins-(2,4,5,6)P4 ≈ Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5. The rank order for SHIP2 is Ins(1,2,3,4,5)P5 > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 > PtdIns(3,4,5)P4 ≈ PtdIns(3,5)P2 ≈ Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 ≈ Ins(2,4,5,6)P4. Because inositol phosphate isomers elicit different biological activities, the extended substrate specificity for SPsynaptojanin and SHIP2 suggest that these enzymes likely have multiple roles in cell signaling and may regulate distinct pathways. The unique substrate specificity profiles and the importance of 2-position phosphate in binding also have important implications for the design of potent and selective SPsynaptojanin and SHIP2 inhibitors for pharmacological investigation. Inositol-5-phosphatases are important enzymes involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes from synaptic vesicle recycling to insulin signaling. We describe a comparative study of two representative inositol-5-phosphatases, Schizosaccharomyces pombe synaptojanin (SPsynaptojanin) and human SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase SHIP2. We show that in addition to Mg2+, transition metals such as Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ are also effective activators of SPsynaptojanin. In contrast, Ca2+ and Cu2+ are inhibitory. We provide evidence that Mg2+ binds the same site occupied by Ca2+ observed in the crystal structure of SPsynaptojanin complexed with inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2). Ionizations important for substrate binding and catalysis are defined for the SPsynaptojanin-catalyzed Ins(1,4,5)P3 reaction. Kinetic analysis with four phosphatidylinositol lipids bearing a 5-phosphate and 54 water-soluble inositol phosphates reveals that SP-synaptojanin and SHIP2 possess much broader substrate specificity than previously appreciated. The rank order for SPsynaptojanin is Ins(2,4,5)P3 > phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) ≈ Ins(4,5)P2 ≈ Ins(1,4,5)P3 ≈ Ins(4,5,6)P3 > PtdIns(3,5)P2 ≈ PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 ≈ Ins(1,2,4,5)P4 ≈ Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 ≈ Ins-(2,4,5,6)P4 ≈ Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5. The rank order for SHIP2 is Ins(1,2,3,4,5)P5 > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 > PtdIns(3,4,5)P4 ≈ PtdIns(3,5)P2 ≈ Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 ≈ Ins(2,4,5,6)P4. Because inositol phosphate isomers elicit different biological activities, the extended substrate specificity for SPsynaptojanin and SHIP2 suggest that these enzymes likely have multiple roles in cell signaling and may regulate distinct pathways. The unique substrate specificity profiles and the importance of 2-position phosphate in binding also have important implications for the design of potent and selective SPsynaptojanin and SHIP2 inhibitors for pharmacological investigation. Eukaryotic cells contain both water-soluble inositol phosphates and the corresponding phosphoinositide lipids. These molecules reside in different cellular compartments and regulate the localization and activity of proteins through their interaction with specific binding domains. Inositol and phosphatidylinositol phosphates are key modulators of cellular processes including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, cell motility and cytoskeletal organization, and transcription (1Anderson R.A.

The best known inositol-based signaling pathway is the cell surface receptor-triggered hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-(4,5)P2) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; Ins(1,4)P2, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; Ins(1,2,3,4,5)P5, inositol 1,2,3,4,5-pentakisphosphate; PtdIns-(3,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; SHIP, SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase; SPsynaptojanin, synaptojanin from S. pombe; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; diC4PtdIns, D(+)-sn-1,2-di-O-butanoylglycerol, 3-O-phospho-linked inositol. by phospholipase C to yield the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), a regulator of Ca2+ release, and diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C. The activity of the inositol-based molecules depends on which site(s) on the inositol ring is phosphorylated, and the level of phosphorylation is maintained by the combined action of a host of inositol kinases and phosphatases. Although considerable effort has been directed toward the analysis of the kinases that produce the phosphorylated inositol molecules, the study of phosphatases that oppose the activity of these kinases remains limited. There are several distinct families of inositol phosphatases that are capable of removing the phosphoryl group from the inositol ring (3Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The inositol phosphatases are classified according to the position of the phosphate that they hydrolyze. For instance, dephosphorylation of the D1 position is carried out by the inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, which is a member of an Mg2+-dependent, Li+-inhibited gene family (7York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of the D3 phosphate is catalyzed by the inositol polyphosphate-3-phosphatases that include the tumor suppressor PTEN and the myotubularin family of phosphatases (6Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). PTEN and myotubularins have the same active site sequence CX5R that characterize the protein-tyrosine phosphatase superfamily (8Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the newly identified inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatases responsible for the hydrolysis of the D4 phosphate also contain the CX5R catalytic motif (9Norris F.A. Atkins R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23859-23864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, the removal of the D5 phosphate is accomplished by a large family of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatases, which can be further classified into type I enzymes that hydrolyze only water-soluble substrates, type II enzymes that hydrolyze both water-soluble and lipid substrates, type III enzymes that hydrolyze only substrates with a 3-position phosphate, and type IV enzymes that are poorly characterized and are active only toward PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (3Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a type II 5-phosphatase SPsynaptojanin has been determined, revealing a fold similar to metal-dependent endonucleases (11Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recent studies have documented the critical roles of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatases in normal physiology and disease. The synaptojanin-catalyzed dephosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is essential for proper synaptic vesicle recycling (12Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is central to glucose homeostasis. Mice deficient of SHIP2, an SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase that dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, are hypoglycemic and sensitized to insulin, suggesting that SHIP2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type II diabetes (13Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J. Pesesse X. Sasaki T. Penninger J. Doherty M. Malaisse W. Dumont J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Erneux C. Hue L. Schurmans S. Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Certain human diseases are also associated with genetic mutations affecting the 5-phosphatase activity. The Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, mental retardation, and renal Fanconi syndrome. The oculocerebrorenal gene encodes a 5-phosphatase that exhibits diminished enzyme activity in oculocerebrorenal patients (14Lin T. Orrison B.M. Leahey A.M. Suchy S.F. Bernard D.J. Lewis R.A. Nussbaum R.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1384-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Elucidating the molecular determinants for inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase catalysis and substrate specificity is crucial to our understanding of how this family of enzymes regulates cellular signaling. In the following we describe two convenient, non-radioactive methods for assaying inositol phosphatase activity. We report a detailed kinetic analysis of the reaction catalyzed by a putative mammalian synaptojanin homologue from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SPsynaptojanin) with regard to metal ion and pH dependence. SPsynaptojanin was chosen as a model system since it is the only 5-phosphatase with a known crystal structure. To provide further insight into the function of 5-phosphatases, we also describe an investigation of SPsynaptojanin and SHIP2 substrate specificity with more than 50 water-soluble and lipid inositol phosphates. SHIP2 was chosen as a subject of study because of its importance in insulin signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target. Knowledge of the substrate specificity of inositol-5-phosphatases may shed new light on the roles played by these enzymes in cellular physiology and furnish valuable information for the design of potent small molecule inhibitors for biological studies and therapeutic development. Materials—Ins(1,5)P2, Ins(1,3,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, diC4PtdIns(5)P, diC4PtdIns(4,5)P2, diC4PtdIns(3,5)P2, and diC4PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were purchased from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT). Ins(1,4,5)P3 and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were purchased from Sigma. All other inositol phosphates were synthesized as described (15Chung S.K. Chang Y.T. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

Chem. 2002; 67: 5626-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It should be noted that InsP1s and InsP2s are racemic mixtures, whereas other inositol phosphates (InsP3s, InsP4s, and InsP5s) are chirally pure. Mutagenesis—The SPsynaptojanin mutants were constructed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using a pET22b plasmid containing the coding sequence for the SPsynaptojanin 5-phosphatase domain (residues 534–880) (11Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of SPsynaptojanin and SHIP2—The inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase domain (Ipp5c) of SPsynaptojanin was constructed into the pET22b vector with a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease site at its N terminus. The plasmid was transformed into BL21/DE3 competent cells by standard procedure. A single colony was selected and grown in LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C overnight. A 10-ml overnight culture was transferred to 1 liter of LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) and allowed to grow at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce SPsynaptojanin expression. After further incubation at room temperature with shaking for 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 30 ml of lysate buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). The cells were lysed by passage through a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. twice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min. A 2-ml 50% slurry of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was equilibrated with lysate buffer and added to the lysate supernatant. After incubation with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 1 h, the matrix was transferred into a column and washed with 20 ml of lysate buffer. The His6-tagged protein was eluted by buffers containing concentrations of imidazole of 5, 20, 50, and 110 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing SPsynaptojanin were pooled together and concentrated with a Centriprep-30 filtration unit (Amicon). Mutants were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography with a Superdex G-75 column using an elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl. Protein purity was checked by 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. The SHIP2 catalytic domain (residues 419–732) was constructed into the pET22b vector, with a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease site at its N terminus. The plasmid was transformed into BL21/DE3 competent cell by standard procedure. A 10-ml overnight culture was transferred to 1 liter of LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) and allowed to grow at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.6. Without the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the culture was incubated at room temperature with shaking for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 30 ml of lysate buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). The cells were lysed by passage through a French press cell at 12,000 p.s.i. twice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min. A 2-ml 50% slurry of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was equilibrated with the lysate buffer and added to the lysate supernatant. After incubating with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 1 h, the matrix was transferred into a column and washed with 20 ml of lysate buffer. The His6-tagged protein was eluted by an imidazole gradient from 5 to 150 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl. Fractions the SHIP2 protein were pooled together and concentrated with a Centriprep-30 filtration unit (Amicon), and the buffer was changed to 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified protein was made to 20% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Ammonium Molybdate Inorganic Phosphate Assay—In a typical assay (22McCain D.F. Zhang Z.-Y. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 345: 507-518Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) the inositol phosphate was incubated at 30 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, with or without 0.25 mm EDTA at pH of 7.4 for 10 min. To determine the steady state kinetic parameters Km and kcat, the substrate concentrations were in the range of 3–300 μm. For activity comparison, the concentrations of inositol phosphates were fixed at 200 μm. To ensure initial rate conditions, the product versus time progress curves were routinely checked for linearity at different substrate and enzyme concentrations. In all cases the enzyme concentration was at least 100-fold lower than that of the substrate, and the quantity of substrate consumed was less than 10% of the initial value, so that the steady state assumption was fulfilled. There was no product inhibition under these conditions. Reactions were started by the addition of an appropriate amount of SPsynaptojanin (4 μl) to the reaction mixture containing the substrate (100 μl). After an appropriate amount of time, usually 5 min, 25 μl of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was used to quench the reaction. Then, 65 μl of solution B was added to the mixture. 2.5 min later solution C was added. The reaction mixture was well mixed every time after the addition of reagents. UV-visible absorbance at 700 nm was measured 5 min after final mix. Here, solution B is a mixture of 3.4 ml of 2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate and 1 g of l-ascorbic acid in 4.9 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid and made freshly daily. Solution C contains 2% (w/v) sodium arsenite in 2% (v/v) acetic acid. The measurements of activity in the absence of EDTA were conducted in the same buffer, except there was no EDTA. Continuous Spectrophotometric Enzyme-coupled Assay—Kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of inositol phosphate were also determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. This assay incorporates a coupled enzyme system, which uses purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its chromogenic substrate 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine for the quantification of inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction (23Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 24Zhou B. Wang Z.-X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The change in absorbance at 360 nm was due to the conversion of 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine in the presence of inorganic phosphate. Quantitation of the inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction was determined using the extinction coefficient of 11,200 m-1 cm-1 at 360 nm and pH 7.0. Experiments were carried out at 30 °C in a 1.6-ml reaction mixture containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm Mg2+, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Sigma), and 200 μm 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine. The spectrophotometric measurements were conducted using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 14 spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. NMR Measurements—0.6 ml of 1.5 mm Ins(1,4,5)P3 was dissolved in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm deuterated Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA in D2O at pH 7.1. The spectra for Ins(1,4,5)P3 both before and after the addition of SPsynaptojanin were acquired. NMR experiments were performed at 26 °C on a Bruker DRX 300 spectrometer. Phosphorus chemical shifts were relative to an external standard (85% phosphoric acid) set at 0.0 ppm. Two-dimensional 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra were collected using an 80-ms MLEV-17 spin lock and WATERGATE water suppression with 4000 and 256 points in F2 and F1, respectively, with 16 scans per t1 point and a recycle delay of 1.5 s. The experiments used a proton sweep width of 14 ppm with the carrier set to 4.7 ppm. Spectra were processed with a cosine bell window function and zero-filled to yield data sets with 4000 and 512 points in F2 and F1, respectively. 31P-Decoupled two-dimensional 1H-1H TOCSY spectra were collected as above and used GARP 31P-decoupling during the acquisition period. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate. Proton coupled and decoupled 31P NMR spectra were collected at 121.5 MHz, with an acquisition time of 1.347 s, and 512 transition scans. Characterization of SPsynaptojanin as an Inositol Polyphosphate-5-phosphatase—Recently, the crystal structure of a previously uncharacterized putative mammalian synaptojanin homologue from S. pombe (SPsynaptojanin) was reported (11Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This was the first three-dimensional structure of a catalytic domain from the inositol-5-phosphatase family. This structure was solved after soaking the crystals of SPsynaptojanin for 20 h in 2 mm Ins(1,4,5)P3 and 1 mm CaCl2. The electron difference density indicated that the putative hydrolysis product Ins(1,4)P2, not Ins(1,4,5)P3, was bound at the active site. Given the fact that the catalytic domain of SPsynaptojanin shows significant sequence identity to those of mammalian inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatases, the presence of Ins(1,4)P2 in the active site is consistent with the expectation that SPsynaptojanin is an inositol-5-phosphatase. To further characterize the regiospecificity of SPsynaptojanin for the 5 position of Ins(1,4,5)P3, NMR measurements were conducted on a reaction containing SPsynaptojanin and Ins(1,4,5)P3 to identify the position(s) of dephosphorylation. The 1H-coupled 31P NMR spectrum of the starting material Ins(1,4,5)P3 shows that there are three phosphorus peaks, each split by one proton, consistent with the three phosphates attached to the inositol ring (Fig. 1Aa). Fig. 1Ab is the corresponding 1H-decoupled 31P spectrum of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Upon the addition of SPsynaptojanin, distinct spectral changes (Fig. 1A, c to e) occurred consistent with the disappearance of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the coincident appearance of a second set of peaks. Fig. 1Af is the 1H-coupled 31P NMR spectrum for the reaction upon prolonged incubation with SPsynaptojanin, which shows two peaks apparently split by a proton and a third peak that is insensitive to proton coupling, consistent with a single inositol bisphosphate and inorganic phosphate as the products of the reaction. To provide evidence that the inositol bisphosphate produced in the SPsynaptojanin-catalyzed Ins(1,4,5)P3 reaction is Ins(1,4)P2, we also collected the 31P NMR spectra of authentic Ins(1,4)P2 under identical conditions (Fig. 1B). Spectral comparison (Fig. 1, A, e and f, and B, a and b) suggests that the inositol bisphosphate produced in the SPsynaptojanin reaction is Ins(1,4)P2. The regiochemistry of the inositol bisphosphate produced in the SPsynaptojanin-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ins (1,4,5)P3 was further confirmed by 1H TOCSY measurements. The overlay of the 31P coupled (black) and decoupled (red) 1H TOCSY spectra shows that the inositol phosphate product has two phosphates that are linked at the 1 and 4 positions of inositol (Fig. 2), based upon the previous one-dimensional 1H NMR spectral assignments of Ins(1,4)P2 (25Cerdan S. Hansen C.A. Johanson R. Inubushi T. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14676-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, the NMR results establish that the inositol phosphate product observed in the SPsynaptojanin-catalyzed Ins(1,4,5)P3 reaction is Ins(1,4)P2, in accord with the classification of SPsynaptojanin as a 5-phosphatase. Non-radioactive Spectroscopic Assays for Inositol 5-Phosphatases—Traditionally, inositol-5-phosphatases are assayed with radioisotope-labeled substrates followed by chromatographic separation of the products from the substrates. Having established the regiospecificity of SPsynaptojanin, we set out to develop non-radioactive colorimetric procedures that would be more suitable for detailed mechanistic investigation and substrate specificity analysis. Because there are no significant absorbance or fluorescence spectral changes associated with the dephosphorylation of inositol phosphates, our assays have been focused on the determination of inorganic phosphate produced in the reaction. In this regard we adopted two methods for inorganic phosphate determination to measure inositol-5-phosphatase activity. The first method relies on the use of an ammonium molybdate reagent that reacts with inorganic phosphate to produce a bright blue color at 700 nm (22McCain D.F. Zhang Z.-Y. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 345: 507-518Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). No interference was observed with various inositol phosphates. With this assay, the steady state kinetic parameters kcat and Km for the SPsynaptojanin-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 were determined to be 11.2 ± 0.4 s-1 and 57.8 ± 3.2 μm, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 30 °C (Fig. 3A). The second method for the quantitation of inorganic phosphate is a continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay in which the coupling enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, uses the inorganic phosphate, generated by the action of the 5-phosphatase, to convert 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine and ribose-1-phosphate, resulting in an increase in absorbance at 360 nm (23Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). With the continuous coupled assay, the kcat and Km values for the same reaction under identical conditions were determined to be 11.0 ± 0.2 s-1 and 55.7 ± 2.9 μm, respectively (Fig. 3B). Thus, there is excellent agreement between these two methods, which allows some flexibility in assay choices and eliminates the need for radioactivity. Metal Ion Dependence—It is known that inositol-5-phosphatases are Mg2+-dependent phosphomonoesterases (3Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As expected, SPsynaptojanin displays no measurable activity in the absence of metal ions. The effect of Mg2+ concentration on the SPsynaptojanin reaction at 200 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 is shown in Fig. 4. As the concentration of Mg2+ is raised, the activity of SPsynaptojanin increases to a maximum at 2 mm metal ion concentration. Further increase in Mg2+ concentration leads to a decline in SPsynaptojanin activity, suggesting the existence of a second metal ion binding site that is inhibitory. Fitting the initial rate versus [Mg2+] to Equation 1, which includes the inhibitory term, yielded the kcat, Km, and Ki values for Mg2+.As listed in Table I, the Km for Mg2+ is 530 μm, which is 16-fold lower than the Ki value, consistent with the fact that the binding of Mg2+ to the second inhibitory metal binding site is much weaker than the activation site.υ=kcat[E]/(1+Km/[Mg2+]+[Mg2+]/Ki)(eq.1) Table ISPsynaptojanin metal ion dependenceMetal ionskcatKmKis-1μmmmMg2+9.64 ± 0.60530 ± 418.57 ± 0.76Mn2+7.48 ± 0.3012.0 ± 1.01.56 ± 0.17Ni2+5.48 ± 0.346.39 ± 0.562.01 ± 0.12Co2+7.28 ± 0.7314.5 ± 1.13.25 ± 0.20 Open table in a new tab To explore whether other divalent cations are also effective in activating SPsynaptojanin, we examined the effect of Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ on the enzyme-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. We found that neither Ca2+ nor Cu2+ was able to activate SPsynaptojanin. In contrast, transition metal ions Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ were all activators of SPsynaptojanin. In addition, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ exhibited similar metal ion dependence on the SPsynaptojanin reaction as observed for Mg2+, i.e. enzyme activity increased as a function of metal ion concentration to a maximum, after which additional metal ion led to enzyme inhibition (data not shown). The kinetic parameters for these metal ions are summarized in Table I. It appears that Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Mg2+ can activate SPsynaptojanin to the same extent at saturating metal ion concentrations. However, the Km values of Mn2+,Co2+, and Ni2+ for SPsynaptojanin are 30–80-fold lower than that of Mg2+. Despite the higher affinities exhibited by Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+, these metal ions are unlikely to be physiological relevant because cellular concentrations of free transition metals are significantly lower than those (6–15 μm) required for SPsynaptojanin activation.

The diphthamide at the tip of domain IV, which is the target for diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, contains a covalently attached ADP-ribose that functions as a very potent inhibitor of the factor. We have obtained an electron density map of ADP-ribosylated translation factor 2 revealing both the ADP-ribosylation and the diphthamide. This is the first structure showing the conformation of an ADP-ribosylated residue and confirms the inversion of configuration at the glycosidic linkage. Binding experiments show that the ADP-ribosylation has limited effect on nucleotide binding affinity, on ribosome binding, and on association with exotoxin A. These results provide insight to the inhibitory mechanism and suggest that inhibition may be caused by erroneous interaction of the translation factor with the codon-anticodon area in the P-site of the ribosome.

Recently, we solved the crystal structure of eEF2 from yeast in the presence and absence of the fungal inhibitor, sordarin (1Jorgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This structure revealed large conformational changes upon binding of the inhibitor demonstrating the highly dynamic nature of the translocase. This flexibility is supported by cryo-EM studies of both eEF2 and the prokaryotic eEF2 homolog EF-G bound to the ribosome showing that the C-terminal domains III, IV, and V can reorient relative to domains I, G′, and II (2Agrawal R.K.

In addition, previous results have shown that GTP hydrolysis in EF-G occurs prior to translocation and that both substituting GTP with a non-hydrolyzable analogue and deletion of domain IV results in a dramatic decrease in translocation (5Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These results indicate that EF-G and eEF2 act as GTP-driven motor proteins with domain IV being important for coupling hydrolysis and translocation. This is in contrast to the classical switch mechanism in G-proteins where GTP hydrolysis allows release of the G-protein from its substrate (reviewed in Ref. 6Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar).eEF2 contains a post-translationally modified histidine residue, which from previous NMR spectral analysis was suggested to be a 2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl] histidine, referred to as diphthamide (7Van Ness B.G. Howard J.B. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10710-10716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Van Ness B.G. Howard J.B. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10717-10720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue is located at position 699 in domain IV of yeast eEF2 (9Perentesis J.P. Phan L.D. Gleason W.B. LaPorte D.C. Livingston D.M. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1190-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cryo-EM studies of eEF2 in complex with the 80 S ribosome have shown that the area from residue 694 to 698 is close enough to interact with the codon-anticodon duplex between P-site bound tRNA and mRNA (4Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that the tip of domain IV including the diphthamide might have a role in stabilizing the codon-anticodon pairing during the translocation, thereby preventing frameshifts. Diphthamide is found only in eEF2 and is completely conserved throughout eukaryotic and archaebacterial evolution (10Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Dunlop P.C. Adolph K.W. Bodley J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dunlop P.C. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4754-4758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although, post-translational modification of histidine to diphthamide requires at least six enzymes, several mutagenesis experiments with eEF2 lacking the ability to form diphthamide have shown that the diphthamide residue is not necessary for eEF2 function (12Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Danley D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1985; 5: 3357-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The diphthamide of eEF2 is the exclusive cellular substrate for irreversible inactivation by diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) (17Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 69-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 18Iglewski B.H. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which both catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to N-3 (equivalent to Nϵ2) at the diphthamide in eEF2 (7Van Ness B.G. Howard J.B. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10710-10716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single molecule of ETA can be sufficient to arrest the protein synthesis in a cell and eventually lead to cell death, and therefore this places it among some of the most lethal toxins to humans and other susceptible animals (19Iglewski B.H. Sadoff J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 780-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both crystallographic and kinetic data suggest that the reaction mechanism most likely follows a Sn1 nucleophilic substitution involving an oxacarbenium cation (20Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is despite the observed inversion of configuration for the glycosidic bond formed between the ribose and diphthamide (23Oppenheimer N.J. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8579-8581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inversion is probably caused by the anomeric carbon of the nicotinamide ribose being susceptible to a backside nucleophilic attack from the N-3 atom in diphthamide (20Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that mutations in eEF2 preventing the biosynthesis of diphthamide confer resistance to both diphtheria toxin and ETA (12Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Danley D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1985; 5: 3357-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous work using photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis on ETA has recognized Glu-553 as an active site residue (25Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8707-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Douglas C.M. Collier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4967-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of ETA shows that it is located on a short β-strand with its side chain protruding into the active site cleft of domain III (27Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It was proposed that its side chain is closely associated with the nicotinamide-ribose bond of bound NAD+ that is broken during the ADP-ribosylation of eEF2 and thus constitutes part of the NAD+ binding site (25Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8707-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Douglas C.M. Collier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4967-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In confirmation of this, the structure of domain III of exotoxin A in complex with the non-hydrolyzable NAD+ analogue, β-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide, revealed that Glu-553 and 2′-OH of the thiazole ribose form a hydrogen bond (21Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).A cytoplasmic ADP-ribosyltransferase, found in hamster kidney cells and possessing a similar mechanism of action to ETA and diphtheria toxin, has been identified (28Fendrick J.L. Iglewski W.J. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cellular enzyme also transfers the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to the diphthamide residue of eEF2 leading to its inactivation and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. This suggests that the highly conserved diphthamide residue is a site of regulation within eEF2 and is not simply a target for bacterial attack (29Fendrick J.L. Iglewski W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Iglewski W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the cellular ADP-ribosyltransferase differs from the toxin in that it only ADP-ribosylates a fraction of the eEF2 pool within the cell and that the removal of the ADP-ribosyl moiety from eEF2 possibly results in the reactivation of eEF2, further suggesting its importance in regulation (30Iglewski W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Diphtheria toxin and ETA appear to be mimicking the action of these cellular ADP-ribosyltransferases; however, the ADP-ribosylation activity of these toxins is extremely high and may account for the apparent irreversibility observed in vivo.We have solved the structure of ADP-ribosylated diphthamide in eEF2 (ADPR-eEF2) purified from yeast and crystallized in complex with GDP and the fungal inhibitor sordarin. The crystal structure supports the previously described inversion of configuration of the N-glycosidic linkage formed between C1′ of the nicotinamide-ribose of NAD+ and N-3 of the diphthamide residue (23Oppenheimer N.J. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8579-8581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the structure shows that the interaction between Glu-553 in ETA and the nicotinamide-ribose in NAD+ is replaced by the highly conserved Asp-696 in eEF2 after the reaction. Furthermore, it appears that the trimethylammonio group of the diphthamide is close enough to interact with the β-phosphate at the ADP-ribose. The structure of the ADPR-eEF2 reaction product also reveals nearly the entire electron density for the diphthamide moiety. In addition, this structure of eEF2 contains well defined electron density for GDP and Mg2+, which results in a peptide flip of the conserved Val-28 in the P-loop compared with the previous structures of eEF2 without GDP (1Jorgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also present binding data showing that ADPR-eEF2 has comparable binding affinity to the catalytic domain of ETA as does native eEF2. Furthermore, it is shown that both ADPR-eEF2 and eEF2 bind GTP and GDP with similar affinity. In agreement with earlier results (31Davydova E.K. Ovchinnikov L.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in disagreement with others (32Burns G. Abraham A.K. Vedeler A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Sitikov A.S. Davydova E.K. Bezlepkina T.A. Ovchinnikov L.P. Spirin A.S.

Nilsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6030-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we show that yeast ADPR-eEF2 does form a stable complex with empty yeast ribosomes, and finally we determine the dissociation constant for sordarin binding to eEF2. The structure of the ADP-ribosylated diphthamide is the first high-resolution structure showing the conformation of an ADP-ribose covalently attached to a target protein residue and provides further insight to the reaction mechanism of ADP-ribosylation and the inhibitory effect on the elongation cycle of protein translation. Finally, the binding data indicate that this inhibition is caused by erroneous interactions of the protein with the ribosome during a late phase of translocation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification—Purification of eEF2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was performed as described (36Jorgensen R. Carr-Schmid A. Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The catalytic fragment of ETA with a C-terminal His6 tag (PE24H) was overexpressed and purified as described (37Armstrong S. Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46669-46675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).ADP Ribosylation of eEF2—One microgram of PE24H was added per 1 mg of eEF2 with 500 μm NAD+ in buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with 125 mm KCl (Q-125). The reaction was mixed on a nutator at room temperature for 80 min. Subsequently, the reaction volume was diluted 3-fold with Q-0 (0 mm KCl) and loaded onto a 9-ml Source-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer Q-50 (50 mm KCl). The column was eluted with a 90-ml linear gradient from Q-50 to Q-250. The eluted protein was then loaded onto a 1-ml Uno-Q column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer Q-30 and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from Q-30 to Q-500. Protein-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, and labeling efficiency was assessed by non-denaturing PAGE (6%).Fluorescence Labeling of PE24H and eEF2—The PE24H protein containing a single cysteine residue was labeled with the 5-(2-iodoacetylaminoethylamino)-1-napthalenesulfonic acid fluorophore, and both eEF2 and ADPR-eEF2 proteins were labeled with 5-iodoacetamide fluorescein (5-IAF) as described previously (38Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35029-35036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with some modifications.Fluorescence-based eEF2 Binding Assay—The fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay was used as previously described (38Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35029-35036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for eEF2 or ADPR-eEF2 binding with PE24H was determined using the following equation as part of the nonlinear fitting function of Origin 6.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA): ΔFi/ΔFmax = ([eEF2 or ADPR-eEF2] × Bmax)/(KD + [eEF2 or ADPR-eEF2]), where ΔFi is the change in fluorescence intensity for each ligand (eEF2 or ADPR-eEF2) concentration upon macromolecular association, ΔFmax is the maximum change in fluorescence intensity at saturation of the ligand-binding site within PE24H, KD is the dissociation constant for the binding of eEF2 with PE24H, and Bmax is the total PE24H concentration (number of binding sites).Measurement of Ligand Binding to eEF2—The binding of GDP, GTP, GDP-β-S, GTP-γ-S (Sigma), and sordarin (Merck) to eEF2 was measured in 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm quartz cuvettes by the quenching of intrinsic protein (Trp) fluorescence of the protein as a function of ligand concentration. Triplicate measurements were performed over a concentration range of 0–70 μm (guanine nucleotides) or 0–90 μm (sordarin) in the presence of 0.5 μm eEF2 at 25 °C in an initial volume of 600 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2). Samples were excited at 295 nm (5-nm band pass), and the fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 340 nm (5-nm band pass) in a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Varian Canada, Inc., Mississauga, ON). The fluorescence signal was collected and averaged for 15 s for each measurement. A cuvette containing buffer only was also titrated with the corresponding ligand, and the signal from this sample was subtracted from the protein-containing samples. The fluorescence intensity measurements were also corrected for the dilution factor resulting from the titration (total dilution factor was less than 5%). KD for sordarin or guanine nucleotides binding to eEF2 was determined using the same equation as described above for the fluorescence-based eEF2 binding assay where sordarin or GDP/GTP/GDP-β-S/GTP-γ-S represent the ligands binding to eEF2.ADPR-eEF2 Binding to the Ribosome—Ten pmol of 80 S ribosomes from S. cerevisiae purified on a 10–40% sucrose gradient were incubated with 100 pmol of either eEF2 or ADPR-eEF2 in 100 μl of buffer A (100 mm NH4Cl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes-NH3 (pH 7.2), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with or without 100 μm GDPNP (Sigma). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice and placed on a 50-μl volume of a 30% sucrose cushion in buffer A and centrifuged at 204,000× g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Structure Determination of ADPR-eEF2—ADPR-eEF2 in complex with sordarin was crystallized as described (1Jorgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but the cryosoaking was done very rapidly in a single step whereas a slow gradual soak was used for our structures of both apo-eEF2 and eEF2-sordarin. A 2.6-Å dataset was collected at bl711 (MAX-lab, Lund, Sweden). The data were processed and reduced with MOSFLM and SCALA (39Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar), and refinement was performed in CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSInteraction of ADPR-eEF2 with Toxin—Both native eEF2 and ADPR-eEF2 were labeled with the fluorescein fluorophore (5-AF). These proteins were labeled under the same conditions and resulted in the identical number of labels per protein. This suggests that the addition of the ADPR moiety does not affect the accessibility of any of the cysteines targeted for conjugation with the fluorescent probe. The affinity of ADPR-eEF2 for PE24H was evaluated using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based binding assay. This assay measures the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the AEDANS moiety in PE24H (donor) and the fluorescein on eEF2 or ADPR-eEF2 (acceptor) (Fig. 1A) (37Armstrong S. Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46669-46675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From the binding isotherms (Fig. 1A), the eEF2 binding constants were determined to be 1.4 (± 0.1) and 2.5 (± 0.4) μm, respectively, for the absence and presence of the ADPR moiety on eEF2. ADPR-eEF2 maintained the ability to bind to the toxin (although more weakly than for native eEF2) suggesting that the active site cleft of PE24H can still accommodate the bulky ADPR group. The fluorescently labeled eEF2 proteins were then run on a non-denaturing PAGE gel. The addition of the negatively charged phosphates for 5-AF-ADPR-eEF2 resulted in a higher mobility through the gel and also showed only one population of eEF2 for either the native or the ADP-ribosylated forms (Fig. 1B).Ribosome Binding—Ribosome binding of ADPR-eEF2 and eEF2 was illustrated by a simple co-sedimentation assay (Fig. 1C). When adding the non-hydrolyzable GTP derivative, GDPNP, to the reaction mixture, eEF2 and ADPR-eEF2 were trapped by the ribosome molecules and can therefore be pelleted. Without GDPNP only a small portion of the translocation factors was pelleted. The SDS-PAGE gel clearly demonstrates binding of ADPR-eEF2 to empty 80 S ribosomes and that ADPR-eEF2 binds at a comparable but probably slightly lower level than unmodified eEF2.GDP Binding—Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we have determined the dissociation constants for GTP and GDP binding to yeast eEF2 (Table II). Titration of eEF2 with either GTP or GDP resulted in the quenching of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the protein to 20–25% of the original signal at saturating levels of bound nucleotide (data not shown). Comparable levels of fluorescence quenching were also observed when eEF2 was titrated with the guanine nucleotide analogues (GDP-β-S and GTP-γ-S). To investigate the effect of ADP-ribosylation, dissociation constants for GTP and GDP binding to either ADPR-eEF2 or eEF2 were determined. These results show that ADP-ribosylation of eEF2 has very little (if any) effect on binding affinity for the two nucleotides and that there are no differences in affinity for GTP and GDP. The lack of difference in binding affinity for GTP and GTP to eEF2 was also shown for the two analogues GDP-β-S and GTP-γ-S, which showed dissociation constants slightly higher (lower affinity) but comparable with the authentic nucleotides (Table II).Table IIYeast eEF2 ligand bindingKDaKD were calculated from equilibrium binding experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.”YeEF2bYeast eEF2 purified from yeast cake.ADPR-YeEF2cYeast eEF2 was ribosylated with ADP-ribose by reaction with ETA.μmGDP5.1 ± 1.53.9 ± 1.1GTP3.0 ± 0.43.4 ± 0.8GDP-β-S16.1 ± 2.1GTP-γ-S12.1 ± 2.3C. albicans eEF2dKD for C. albicans eEF2 previously determined (45).Sordarin1.6 ± 0.13.1a KD were calculated from equilibrium binding experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Yeast eEF2 purified from yeast cake.c Yeast eEF2 was ribosylated with ADP-ribose by reaction with ETA.d KD for C. albicans eEF2 previously determined (45Dominguez J.M.

https://openalex.org/W1963833196,"Cleavage of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) by α-,β-, and γ-secretases releases an extracellular fragment called APPS, small Aβ peptides, and a short APP intracellular domain that may provide a transcriptional signal analogous to the Notch intracellular domain. Notch cleavage is activated by extracellular ligands on the cell surface, but the cellular localization of APP cleavage remains unclear. We now show that in transfected cultured cells, the plasma membrane SNARE protein syntaxin 1A, when expressed as a full-length protein, disrupts the Golgi apparatus and blocks trans-Golgi traffic and exocytosis. In contrast, truncated syntaxin 1A1–243 selectively abolishes exocytosis but has no apparent effect on trans-Golgi traffic or Golgi structure, whereas further truncated syntaxins 1A1–236 and 1A1–230 have no effect on either exocytosis or Golgi traffic. Using these syntaxin 1A fragments, we demonstrated that blocking trans-Golgi traffic greatly impairs APP cleavage and AICD-dependent nuclear signaling, whereas blocking exocytosis alone does not affect either process, even though secretion of APPS and Aβ40 peptide is abolished. Our data suggest that, different from Notch, cleavage of APP is independent of cell surface regulation by extracellular ligands but may be controlled by intracellular signaling.

First, cleavage of APP by α-or β-secretases releases a large fragment called APPS that contains most of the extracellular sequences of APP. A small extracellular stub, the transmembrane region, and the cytoplasmic tail of APP (referred to as “AICD” for APP intracellular domain) remain in the membrane after α/β-cleavage. These APP sequences are subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase at multiple sites in the transmembrane region (5Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 6Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). γ-secretase cleavage results in the intracellular release of the AICD and the extracellular release of small peptides, including Aβ40 and Aβ42, the major components of amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (see reviews cited above). The processing pathway of APP resembles that of Notch, a cell surface protein that functions as a ligand-dependent regulator of cell fate (7Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Hartmann D. Tournoy J. Saftig P. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notch exerts its regulatory effects by transcriptional activation of target genes, which is directly mediated by the released Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The cleavage of Notch that produces the NICD is probably performed by the same γ-secretase complex that also generates the AICD of APP (7Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Hartmann D. Tournoy J. Saftig P. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Mol.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), although it likely also has other signaling roles (10Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J.

These similarities suggest that APP may be cleaved on the cell surface by a ligand-regulated mechanism, but the subcellular localization of APP cleavage has not been established. Extensive evidence suggests that α- and β-secretases cleave APP after it has traversed the Golgi complex. For example, in cultured cells, APP is only cleaved after it has been fully glycosylated (16Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6277-6284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and in neurons, APP is cleaved after it has entered into the fast axonal transport pathway (17Amaratunga A.

However, several alternative subcellular localizations of cleavage have been suggested (23Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. George-Hyslop P.S. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and even the studies that report cleavage in a post-Golgi compartment do not address the question whether cleavage occurs prior to exocytosis or on the cell surface. The cellular localization of γ-secretase cleavage is also unclear. Presenilins, a major component of γ-secretase, are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, the cell surface, and/or endocytic vesicles (24Lah J.J. Levey A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Lah J.J. Heilman C.J. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Yi H. Counts S.E. Levey A.I. J.

Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) or to endocytosis (28Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Res. 1995; 40: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis indicates that a large amount of APP γ-cleavage occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment (23Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. George-Hyslop P.S. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), possibly by a mechanism that does not depend on presenilins (30Armogida M. Petit A. Vincent B. Scarzello S. da Costa C.A. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Chyung A.S. Greenberg B.D. Cook D.G. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J.

Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of APP cleavage is of central importance for APP function. Does APP act as a ligand-activated cell surface receptor analogous to Notch, or does APP itself constitute a ligand, either in a cell surface bound form as uncleaved APP or in a secreted form as the proteolytic products APPS and Aβ peptides? Addressing this question is not only essential for understanding the function of APP but also has implications for the role of the AICD, which may be activated either by an extracellular ligand or by intracellular signals. To our knowledge, no manipulation is currently available that selectively inhibits exocytosis and would allow addressing this question directly. Tetanus toxin light chain effectively impairs regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles by inactivating synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (33Link E. Edelmann L. Chow J.H. Binz T.

Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. Das Gupta B.R. Montecucco C.

Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of tetanus toxin light chain does not impair constitutive exocytosis (36Khvotchev M. Ren M. Takamori S. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10531-10539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus cannot be used to interfere with all exocytosis. In this paper, we exploit the unexpected observation that a fragment of the plasma membrane SNARE protein syntaxin 1A is a selective inhibitor of all exocytosis but does not alter trans-Golgi traffic, whereas full-length syntaxin 1A blocks traffic through the Golgi complex as described previously (37Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This allows for the first time testing of whether surface expression of APP is required for cleavage. We find that in cells deficient in constitutive exocytosis, α/β-cleavage and γ-cleavage of APP proceed normally in contrast to cells where Golgi traffic is disrupted, demonstrating that the biology of APP is fundamentally different from that of Notch.

Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Measurement of Aβ40 Peptide Levels—HEK293 cells and medium were collected 48 h after transfections. The cells were washed with PBS, lysed in extraction buffer (5 m GnCl, PBS, pH 8.0) at 50 μl/well, and sonicated. The cell extracts were diluted 20-fold with sample buffer (PBS, pH 8.0, containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and cleared by centrifugation. Total proteins in 1-ml aliquots of cleared cell culture medium were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, dissolved in 50 μl of extraction buffer, and diluted 20-fold with sample buffer. Aβ40 standards were prepared by dispersing the synthetic peptide in sample and extraction buffer mixture (20:1). Aβ40 levels in samples and standards were measured in duplicates by colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Miscellaneous Procedures—For measurements of constitutive exocytosis, HEK293 cells were co-transfected in 6-well plates using FuGENE 6 reagent with pHGHCMV5 and a control vector or various syntaxin 1A constructs at 1:20 ratio (typically 0.05 μg of pHGHCMV5 and 1 μg of a test plasmid/well). Constitutive hGH secretion was measured as described previously (36Khvotchev M. Ren M. Takamori S. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10531-10539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Schlüter O.M. Khvotchev M. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Immunocytochemistry of transfected HeLa cells was performed essentially as described by Cao and Südhof (9Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) using polyclonal syntaxin antibodies and monoclonal antibodies to GM130 (Transduction Laboratories) and goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes). The labeled cells were imaged on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Stage-specific Inhibitors of Secretory Membrane Traffic Based on Syntaxin 1A—syntaxin 1A is a SNARE protein of the plasma membrane that mediates Ca2+-induced synaptic vesicle exocytosis and possibly other forms of exocytosis (46Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 47Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). syntaxin 1A is composed of an N-terminal three-helical Habc domain, a SNARE motif that participates in core complex formation with other SNARE proteins, and a C-terminal transmembrane region (Fig. 1A). To test whether expression of different fragments of syntaxin 1A interferes with secretory membrane traffic, we employed four syntaxin 1A proteins, full-length syntaxin 1A1–288, and truncated syntaxin 1A1–243, 1A1–236, and 1A1–230. These proteins were co-expressed with hGH as a reporter protein that is constitutively secreted in non-neuronal cells (48Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). We found that full-length syntaxin 1A1–288 or C-terminally truncated syntaxin 1A1–243 severely inhibited constitutive hGH secretion in HEK293 and HeLa cells, whereas truncated syntaxin 1A1–236 and syntaxin 1A1–230, which contain only 7 or 13 fewer residues, respectively, than syntaxin 1A1–243, had no significant effect (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The seven residues that are present in the inhibitory syntaxin 1A1–243 protein, but absent from the innocuous syntaxin 1A1–236 protein, are located in the middle in the SNARE motif. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of syntaxin 1A1–243 may be due to the formation of inappropriate SNARE complexes, which requires a minimal length of the SNARE motif for SNARE complex formation. However, it is surprising that full-length syntaxin 1A is also inhibitory because it should behave “normally.” To explore whether the two inhibitory syntaxin 1A constructs act by distinct mechanisms, we examined the effect of transfected syntaxin 1A constructs on intracellular organelles using immunofluorescence staining for syntaxin 1A and organelle-specific markers. In agreement with previous studies (37Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), full-length syntaxin 1A1–288 caused a disorganization of the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells as visualized with an antibody to the Golgi protein GM130 (49Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Truncated syntaxin 1A1–243, however, had no effect on the morphology of the Golgi complex or any other organelle examined, despite the nearly equal inhibition of hGH secretion caused by this syntaxin construct (Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown). Furthermore, other truncated syntaxins also induced no change (data not shown). Transfection of different syntaxins into HEK293 and Vero cells had identical effects on Golgi morphology, suggesting that these results are not dependent on the cell type used (data not shown). This observation indicates that syntaxin 1A1–243 may inhibit hGH secretion by selectively interfering with exocytosis, whereas full-length syntaxin 1A1–288 disrupts trans-Golgi traffic, and shorter truncated syntaxins, such as syntaxin 1A1–236, have no effect. The selective effect of syntaxin 1A1–243 appears to operate in all cells tested by a mechanism that involves Munc18 proteins. 2M. Khvotchev and T. C. Südhof, manuscript in preparation. Differential Effects of Syntaxin 1A Constructs on APP Cleavage and Glycosylation—We co-transfected APP with control vectors or the various syntaxin 1A constructs and examined the effect of the syntaxin fragments on the glycosylation and cleavage of APP in HEK293 cells. We used immunoblotting to estimate the levels of full-length APP and of the C-terminal cleavage products of APP in the cells and measured some of the cleavage products using quantitative immunoblotting in which protein amounts are determined by 125I-labeled secondary antibodies (44Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to assess intramembranous γ-cleavage of APP, we compared untreated transfected cells with cells that had been treated with DAPT, an inhibitor of presenilin-dependent γ-secretase (50Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Holsztynska E.J. Hu K.L. Johnson-Wood K.L. Kennedy S.L. Kholodenko D. Knops J.E. Latimer L.H. Lee M.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Finally, we employed two gel systems, a standard gel system (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) to resolve larger proteins and a tricine gel system (42Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) to separate small peptides such as the C-terminal fragments. In untreated transfected cells, APP was present in multiple bands that likely correspond to partially glycosylated immature and fully glycosylated mature species (6Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 51Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). In addition, a small amount of the C-terminal APP fragments was detected (Fig. 2A). As expected, treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT increased the abundance of the C-terminal fragments but had no effect on the banding pattern of full-length APP. When we co-expressed full-length syntaxin 1A1–288 with APP, no C-terminal fragment of APP was detectable, even after the addition of DAPT (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, glycosylation of APP was altered, as evidenced by the loss of the mature forms of APP on the immunoblots. In contrast, when we co-transfected truncated syntaxin 1A1–243 (which inhibits exocytosis) or syntaxin 1A1–236 (which has no effect on exocytosis), we observed no change in the production of the C-terminal fragment or the apparent glycosylation of APP (Fig. 2A). To ensure that the truncated syntaxin 1A1–243 did not cause a kinetic impairment in APP cleavage, we quantified the amount of accumulated C-terminal fragment of APP in cells after 20 min, 60 min, and 180 min of DAPT treatment (Fig. 2B). Quantitations were performed with 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and phosphorimaging detection. We observed no difference in the rate of APP cleavage between cells in which APP had been transfected alone or co-transfected with syntaxin 1A1–243 or syntaxin 1A1–236, whereas no C-terminal fragments were detectable after transfection with full-length syntaxin 1A (Fig. 2B and data not shown). APP is glycosylated by both N- and O-linked sugars (51Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). To obtain a more detailed characterization of the glycosylation of APP after either trans-Golgi traffic or exocytosis were inhibited by co-expression of full-length syntaxin 1A1–288 or truncated syntaxin 1A1–243, respectively, we examined the effect of deglycosylating enzymes on the mobility of APP. Proteins from cells co-transfected with control vector or the various syntaxin expression vectors were treated with PNGFase (which removes N-linked sugars), with O-glycosidase (which digests O-linked sugars), and with neuraminidase (which cleaves sialic acid) (Fig. 2C). We found that the changes in electrophoretic mobility of APP induced by such treatments were identical between control-transfected and syntaxin 1A1–243-expressing cells, suggesting similar glycosylation patterns. In contrast, APP from cells expressing full-length syntaxin 1A1–288 exhibited only a small PNGase F-dependent change in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that similar to other treatments affecting the integrity of the Golgi apparatus or the exit of APP from the endoplasmic reticulum (52LeBlanc A.C. Goodyer C.G. J.

We identified and estimated the affinities of novel PXR/RXR binding sites in regulated genes and additional genomic targets of PXR with an information theory-based model of the PXR/RXR binding site. Our initial PXR/RXR model, the result of the alignment of 15 previously characterized binding sites, was used to scan the promoters of known PXR target genes. Sites from these genes, with information contents of >8 bits bound by PXR/RXR in vitro, were used to revise the information weight matrix; this procedure was repeated by screening for progressively weaker binding sites. After three iterations of refinement, the model was based on 48 validated PXR/RXR binding sites and has an average information content (Rsequence) of 14.43 ± 3.21 bits. A scan of the human genome predicted novel PXR/RXR binding sites in the promoters of UGT1A3 (19.78 bits at –8040 and 16.37 bits at –6930) and UGT1A6 (12.74 bits at –9216), both of which were identified previously as targets for PXR. These sites were subsequently demonstrated to specifically bind PXR/RXR in competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A strong PXR site was also predicted upstream of the CASP10 gene (18.69 bits at –7872) and was validated by binding studies and reporter assays as a PXR responsive element. This suggests that the PXR-mediated response extends beyond genes involved in drug biotransformation and transport."
https://openalex.org/W2091970127,"Iron regulatory protein 2 coordinates the cellular regulation of iron metabolism by binding to iron-responsive elements in mRNA. The protein is synthesized constitutively but is rapidly degraded when iron stores are replete. The mechanisms that prevent degradation during iron deficiency or promote degradation during iron sufficiency are not delineated. Iron regulatory protein 2 contains a domain not present in the closely related iron regulatory protein 1, and we found that this domain binds heme with high affinity. A cysteine within the domain is axially liganded to the heme, as occurs in cytochrome P450. The protein-bound heme reacts with molecular oxygen to mediate the oxidation of cysteine, including β-elimination of the sulfur to yield alanine. This covalent modification may thus mark the protein molecule for degradation by the proteasome system, providing another mechanism by which heme can regulate the level of iron regulatory protein 2.

Iron metabolism is exquisitely regulated by all organisms, from bacteria to humans. In mammals, the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IRP, iron regulatory protein; C123A, site-specific mutant of the 63-residue peptide with Cys-168, Cys-174, and Cys-178 changed to Ala; HOIL-1, heme-oxidized IRP-2 ubiquitin ligase-1; IRE, iron-responsive element; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. mediate the coordinate expression of proteins that participate in iron metabolism (1Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). When iron stores are low, the IRPs bind to an RNA stem-loop structure known as an iron-responsive element (IRE) located in either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated region of mRNA. If the IRE is close to the cap site, binding of the IRP blocks the initiation of translation, causing a decrease in the level of the protein encoded by that mRNA. Conversely, when the IRE is located in the 3′-untranslated region of the transferrin receptor transcript, binding of the IRP stabilizes the mRNA by decreasing susceptibility to nuclease attack, causing an increase in the level of the protein encoded by the mRNA (3Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mammals have two known IRPs, IRP1 and IRP2, with the tissue roles of each still being defined. The general mechanism by which each IRP is regulated is distinct (1Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). When cellular iron stores are low, IRP1 lacks a functional iron-sulfur center and binds to its IRE targets. When iron stores are sufficient, IRP1 regains its full iron-sulfur center, loses the ability to bind to IRE, and functions as a cytosolic aconitase. The cellular levels of IRP1 are unaffected by iron status in most cell types. In contrast, the IRP2 protein and IRE binding activity are readily detected when iron stores are limited but are low or absent when iron stores are sufficient (4Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The decrease in the IRP2 protein occurs as a consequence of rapid degradation by the proteasome; synthesis of the protein is constitutive and does not vary substantially with iron status. The sequences of the two IRPs are similar except that IRP2 contains one domain not present in IRP1. In addition to its absence from IRP1, the sequence of this 73-residue domain is not homologous to any sequences in the current National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data bases. Initial studies of the domain suggested that it was required to confer susceptibility to iron-dependent degradation, and it has thus been referred to as the “degradation domain” (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies from several laboratories have established that the domain is not absolutely required for iron-triggered degradation, suggesting that there may be multiple mechanisms by which degradation can occur (7Hanson E.S.

Biol. 2004; 24: 954-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cys-178 within the domain is required for degradation triggered by sodium nitroprusside (10Kim S. Wing S.S. Ponka P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In a recent study of the recombinant 63-residue domain, we showed that it can act as an iron sensor, mediating its own covalent modification (11Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The domain forms an iron-binding site with three cysteine residues located in the middle of the domain. The protein-bound iron then reacts with molecular oxygen to generate an oxidizing species at the iron-binding site. One cysteine residue is oxidized to dehydrocysteine and other products. We suggested that this oxidative modification may be one mechanism for marking the molecule for degradation by the proteasome system. Redox-cycling cations such as iron and copper are capable of catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species through a Fenton reaction and other types of reactions. Consequently, the concentrations of free iron and copper in the cell are held at very low levels, with their transport carefully orchestrated by a series of chaperones (12O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 13Aisen P. Wessling-Resnick M. Leibold E.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Furthermore, >75% of the body's iron content is in the form of heme (14Drabkin D.L. Physiol. Rev. 1951; 31: 345-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and, thus, a sensor that detects cellular heme levels would effectively be an iron sensor. Several investigators have presented evidence suggesting that IRP2 levels are sensitive to heme levels (8Bourdon E. Kang D.K. Ghosh M.C. Drake S.K. Wey J. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 31: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Goessling L.S. Mascotti D.P. Thach R.E. J. Biol.

Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Heme functions as a regulator of protein function in a variety of pathways from microorganisms to mammals. For example, heme regulates the iron-dependent degradation of a bacterial iron response regulator (17Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and it also regulates the import of δ-aminolevulinate synthetase into mitochondria (18Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that the novel domain in IRP2 might function as a heme sensor. Most of the procedures and sources of material were as described in our study on the iron-mediated oxidative modification of IRP2 (11Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We obtained hemin chloride, protoporphyrin IX, and zinc-protoporphyrin IX from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Hemin was dissolved to 5 mm in 100 mm NaOH, then diluted in water, and finally introduced into the incubation buffer, the pH of which was not changed by the addition of hemin. Solutions were made fresh daily. Sequencing grade porcine trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Peptide digestion, reverse phase chromatography, and mass spectrometric sequencing was carried out as described (11Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), except that LysC was replaced by trypsin at a 1:20 ratio of enzyme/peptide. Digestion was in 1 mm Tris, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 12–13 h. Except as noted under “Results,” oxidation by heme was carried out in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with 2 mm TCEP and 1 mm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid at 37 °C. Spectrophotometric binding studies were carried out with solutions of hemin and peptide that were first made anaerobic by room temperature incubation for 15 min in a chamber with an atmosphere of 97% nitrogen, 3% hydrogen, and <1 ppm oxygen (Coy Laboratory Products model 7500-000, Grass Lake, MI). UV-visible difference spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard model 8452 diode array spectrophotometer, with the concentration of heme kept equal in both the sample and reference cuvettes. The assay for heme peroxidase activity was based on the method of Vuletich and Osawa (19Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), modified for in-gel use. After incubation of the peptide and heme, SDS-containing sample buffer was added. This buffer contains 15 mm TCEP as a reducing agent and neither dithiothreitol nor β-mercaptoethanol. The other components are 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 35% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Without heating, the sample was loaded onto a 16% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate for 5 min (ECL product RPN2106, Amersham Biosciences) and visualized on x-ray film (Kodak Biomax ML or MR). The Domain Binds Heme—The 63-residue recombinantly expressed domain contains three cysteine residues, which, as we showed previously, are involved in the binding of ferrous iron (11Kang D.K. Jeong J.

The peptide also binds heme, demonstrated by the heme difference spectrum generated when heme and peptide were present in the sample cuvette and the same concentration of heme was in the reference cuvette (Fig. 1). The observed difference spectrum is similar to that observed with cytochrome P450 (20Hanson L.K. Eaton W.A. Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Gouterman M. Connell C.R. J. Am. Chem.

The Soret band intensity increases and splits with one peak moving to the blue (370–380 nm) and the other moving to the red (420 nm or higher). This is termed a “hyperporphyrin” spectrum (23Gouterman M. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. III. Academic Press, New York1978: 1-165Google Scholar) and is characteristic of a thiolate axially liganded to ferric heme. While the cytochrome P450s are the best-known example of such spectra, they are also seen in thiol-containing model compounds (24Ruf H.H. Wende P. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 5499-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Chang C.K. Dolphin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in chloroperoxidase upon thiol binding (26Sono M. Dawson J.H. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13209-13216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For convenience we will refer to this region of IRP2 as a “heme-binding domain.” The affinity of the binding of heme is at least 106m–1 as reflected by the linear titration with heme in the micromolar concentration range 2The heme-binding domain has no tyrosine nor tryptophan residues, and heme is not fluorescent so we cannot utilize fluorescence changes to estimate the binding affinity. (Fig. 2). One mole of the heme-binding domain binds 2 mol of heme. Because heme dimerizes at concentrations of 1 μm or higher (27Inada Y. Shibata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 9: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we cannot distinguish between the binding of one dimerized heme and the binding of two monomeric hemes. Because the spectral changes induced by binding establish that a cysteine is an axial ligand, we examined the behavior of a mutant peptide, which we call the C123A mutant, in which all three cysteine residues (Cys-168, Cys-174, and Cys-178) were changed to alanine (Figs. 1 and 2). Heme still binds to the peptide with high affinity, but the magnitude of the difference spectrum is much less than that for wild type. The cysteines of the peptide tend to form disulfide bonds, which we prevent by the inclusion of the phosphine TCEP in the buffer (11Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lower molecular weight phosphines are known to be able to axially ligate the heme of cytochrome P450 and induce a hyperporphyrin spectrum (24Ruf H.H. Wende P. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 5499-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Mansuy D. Duppel W. Ruf H.H. Ulrich V. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the phosphine was not required to induce the hyperporphyrin spectrum upon the binding of heme to the heme-binding domain of IRP2. This was determined by reducing the peptide with TCEP for 30 min and then separating the TCEP from the peptide by reverse phase chromatography. The TCEP-free peptide showed the same spectral changes as observed in the presence of TCEP. Heme and Oxygen Mediate Covalent Modification of the Domain—We demonstrated previously that iron could mediate an oxygen-dependent covalent modification of the domain, with oxidation of up to one of the three cysteine residues in each molecule (11Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry were utilized to demonstrate that heme also catalyzes the oxidative modification of cysteine. To minimize possible secondary reactions, we studied the stoichiometry of peptide that was 50% saturated with heme and found that half of the cysteine residue was modified (Fig. 3). Mass spectrometric analysis (Table I) demonstrated the conversion of cysteine to several products, including the novel amino acid aminomalonate, which was also observed with iron-mediated oxidation. However, with heme-mediated oxidation the quantitatively largest product observed was 32 atomic mass units less than the control peptide when analyzed without alkylation of the cysteines. Thirty-two is, of course, the mass of sulfur. When alkylated with iodoacetamide, the mass difference increased to 89 atomic mass units, implying that the product could not be alkylated and accounting for the additional loss of 57 atomic mass units from the carboxyamidomethyl moiety (32 + 57 = 89). These results indicate that cysteine undergoes β-elimination of sulfur to yield alanine as the product. In some molecules, two cysteine residues were oxidized to alanine (Table I). No modification occurred when either oxygen or heme was omitted or when either zinc protoporphyrin or free protoporphyrin was substituted for heme. Also, the C123A mutant (Cys-168, Cys-174, and Cys-178) was not modified despite its ability to bind heme. The reaction was not due to adventitious free iron from the hemin or other solutions, because diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid was always present in the reaction solution. We demonstrated previously that diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid completely blocks the iron-dependent oxidation of the peptide (11Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L.

Reverse phase mapping with analysis by high accuracy time-of-flight mass spectroscopy established that two of the three cysteines could be oxidized to alanine (Cys-174 and Cys-178), whereas Cys-168 was not.

Korzekwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7081-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The 63-residue heme-binding IRP2 peptide was exposed to heme under anaerobic conditions, and the unmodified peptide was completely separated from heme by reverse phase chromatography. When both heme and oxygen were present, the wild-type peptide was oxidatively modified as described above. In addition, up to 3% of the peptide covalently bound heme as determined from the area of the 400-nm high performance liquid chromatography chromatogram (30Williams V.P. Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 202-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). Although this is a minor reaction, it can easily be monitored by taking advantage of the inherent peroxidase activity of heme. When performed with a chemiluminescent substrate, the reaction provides a very sensitive assay for heme-linked proteins or peptides (19Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SDS gel electrophoresis separates free heme from the peptide, allowing in-gel detection (Fig. 4). Covalent binding of heme required oxygen. Examination of the susceptibility of various cysteine mutants suggested that Cys-168 is most important for the covalent binding of heme; no covalent binding to the C123A mutant (Cys-168, Cys-174, and Cys-178) could be detected. The optimal pH for the reaction was 7.0–7.2. The heme-binding domain has no histidine residues, an amino acid to which heme is covalently linked in many heme-containing proteins. Covalent linkage of the heme to the thiol of a cysteine was a reasonable possibility. Such thioether linkages, as occur in cytochrome c, are readily cleaved by silver or mercury (30Williams V.P. Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 202-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the heme-oxidized peptide with silver did not release any heme, whereas parallel treatment of cytochrome c removed all of its heme (not shown). Thus, the linkage of heme in the heme-binding domain appears not to be via a thioether linkage. The results presented here establish that IRP2 has a heme-binding domain. Studies are currently in progress to determine the three-dimensional structure of the heme-binding domain of IRP2, and we expect to find a cysteine sulfur liganded to the heme because we observed a hyperporphyrin difference spectrum upon the binding of heme to the peptide. We found that Cys-174 and Cys-178 could be oxidatively desulfurated, whereas Cys-168 was not. Conversely, Cys-168 was the primary residue for covalent linkage to heme. Thus, Cys-168 may be axially liganded to heme. After oxygen binds as the other axial ligand, the oxidizing species could attack Cys-174 or Cys-178. Because alanine is a major product, the reaction is that of a cysteine lyase. The known cysteine lyases are pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes (31Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although no cytochrome-dependent cysteine lyases have yet been described, cytochrome P450s do catalyze oxidative desulfurations (32Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3970-3979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of a carbon-sulfur bond by a thiolate has been demonstrated with low molecular weight alkenethiolates (33Wijers H.E. Boelens H. Van Der Gen A. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays Bas. 1969; 88: 519-529Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cysteine lyases yield sulfur as their other product and are important in supplying sulfur for the synthesis of iron-sulfur centers. We tested whether the heme-binding domain could function catalytically as a cysteine lyase but were unable to detect free alanine when incubated with free cysteine (not shown). Thus, we believe that the domain has evolved as a heme sensor rather than as a cysteine lyase. At a concentration of 10 μm, the heme-binding domain was saturated by 20 μm heme. Although the intracellular concentration of “free” heme is not well established, other heme-regulated systems respond at similar concentrations of heme. Mitochondrial δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase is synthesized in the cytosol with a signal peptide targeting it for import by the mitochondrion. The import is regulated by heme and was ∼90% inhibited by 25 μm heme (18Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The activity of reticulocyte δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase is decreased when the cells are exposed to 40 μm heme, and this is not due to direct inhibition of the enzyme (34Gardner L.C. Smith S.J. Cox T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22010-22018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRP2 regulates iron metabolism, and IRP2, in turn, is regulated by iron. The analyses presented in this paper establish that the novel IRP2 domain can function as a heme sensor, a physiologically effective mechanism of monitoring cellular iron status. The domain confers upon IRP2 the capability of self-modification; no other proteins are required for covalent modification in the presence of heme and oxygen. What function would be served by this reaction? Does it regulate the proteolytic degradation of IRP2? We demonstrated previously that oxidative modification of IRP2 renders it a substrate for ubiquitinylation in vitro and also that ubiquitinylated IRP2 accumulates in iron-replete cells, provided that the proteasome is inhibited 3Because ubiquitinylation can only be demonstrated in vivo when the proteasome is inhibited to prevent removal of IRP2, we recognize that ubiquitinylation might have occurred only because IRP2 was abnormally accumulating. (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Iwai and colleagues then identified HOIL-1 as a ubiquitin ligase that acts on heme-oxidized IRP2 (35Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In vivo, HOIL-1 presumably binds to oxidatively modified IRP2 but not to the native form, although we have not yet been able to demonstrate this assumption in vitro. 4J. Jeong, T. A. Rouault, and R. L. Levine, unpublished observations. Following ubiquitinylation by HOIL-1, the IRP2 would be degraded by the 26 S proteasome. However, three laboratories have presented convincing evidence that the cysteine-rich heme-binding domain is not required for iron or hemin-triggered degradation of IRP2, and the degradation appears to require 2-oxoglutarate (7Hanson E.S.

An iron, oxygen, and oxoglutarate process triggers degradation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 through the action of prolyl hydroxylases (36Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 37Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J.

Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Because the prolyl hydroxylases require iron for activity, one can readily envision a mechanism in which these hydroxylases serve as an iron sensor and mediate the covalent modification of IRP2, just as they function as an oxygen sensor in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 system. Given the presence of the heme-binding domain in IRP2 and the existence of HOIL-1 as a ubiquitin ligase acting on heme-oxidized IRP2, we suggest that there exists more than one mechanism for triggering the proteolytic degradation of IRP2. Elucidation of the physiological roles of each pathway and their organ or tissue specificity will naturally require experimental investigation. Both the domain-dependent and domain-independent pathways require oxygen, and it may be illuminating to determine the oxygen concentration dependence of the two pathways, as they may be activated at different partial pressures of oxygen. The two pathways may also link to different forms of the proteasome, which exhibits heterogeneity in both the 20 and 26 S forms (39Orlowski M. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It is known that the 20 S proteasome is capable of distinguishing native from modified proteins; the latter are proteolytically degraded whereas the former are not (40Rivett A.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1986; 28: 291-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In particular, oxidatively modified proteins are readily distinguished from native proteins by the 20 S proteasome both in vitro (41Rivett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Rivett A.J. Levine R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43Davies K.J.

Commun. 2003; 305: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Investigations from the Grune and Davies laboratories established that ubiquitin is not required for the in vivo degradation of oxidatively modified proteins (46Shringarpure R. Grune T. Mehlhase J. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This finding leaves open for experimental investigation the possibility that oxidatively modified IRP2 can be degraded by both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent pathways (39Orlowski M. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The thiolate-liganded cytochrome P450s have long been known to self-inactivate through auto-oxidation (47Sligar S.G. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P.G. Gunsalus I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 61: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We suggest that the auto-oxidation of the thiolate-liganded heme-binding domain provides an elegantly simple mechanism for regulation of the turnover of IRP2, although this is not an exclusive mechanism.

Hyperinsulinemia caused insulin resistance in the L-SACC1 male mice at 2 months of age, the earliest age examined. These mice also developed altered fat metabolism with increased visceral adiposity, increased fasting plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), and triacylglycerols (TG) and increased hepatic TG content (5Poy M.N.

The L-SACC1 mouse highlights the notion that intra-abdominal visceral adiposity and elevated plasma FFAs are commonly associated with impaired insulin clearance (6Svedberg J. Stromblad G. Wirth A.

It also emphasizes the important role of a CEACAM1-dependent insulin signaling downstream of the insulin receptor to directly regulate insulin clearance and sensitivity in liver and further regulate insulin action in extrahepatic tissues. Thus far, models of hepatic insulin resistance, including the LIRKO mouse with liver-specific insulin receptor ablation, which developed impaired insulin clearance, have primarily demonstrated that insulin signaling in hepatocytes is required to mediate insulin sensitivity in liver and extrahepatic tissues (12Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 13Fisher S.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is interesting, however, that the extent of impairment of fat metabolism is disproportionate to the extent of insulin resistance. For instance, LIRKO and other mice with primary hepatic insulin resistance did not develop elevated FFAs despite higher insulin levels than l-SACC1 transgenics (12Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 14Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional mechanisms may underlie insulin resistance in these models. The association of hepatic insulin resistance with elevation in FFA levels and increased visceral adiposity in L-SACC1 mice provides a potential mechanism to explain this apparent discrepancy. Chronic hyperinsulinemia caused by impaired insulin clearance in L-SACC1 mice may lead to increased hepatic triglyceride content and output (15Semenkovich C.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Parks E.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2772S-2774SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus contributing to hepatic insulin resistance that is brought about by the transgene. With normal pancreatic β-cell function in L-SACC1 mice, elevation in plasma triglycerides may, in turn, promote insulin secretion and proliferation of visceral adipose tissue (17McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). This eventually increases plasma FFAs output even in the absence of lipolysis (18Robinson C. Tamborlane W.V. Maggs D.G. Enoksson S. Sherwin R.S. Silver D. Shulman G.I. Caprio S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E737-E743PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous plasma FFAs are preferentially removed by re-esterification in liver and by oxidation in muscle, heart, liver, and other tissues (19Lewis G.F. Carpentier A. Adeli K. Giacca A. Endocrinol. Rev. 2002; 23: 201-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). When the uptake of FFAs is exceedingly high, it may interfere with glucose uptake. It may also elevate the level of long chain fatty acyl-CoA, reducing the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 by malonyl-CoA (20Zammit V.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This leads to increased transport of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs to the mitochondrial matrix to undergo β-oxidation (21Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions that partition the β-oxidation product, acetyl-CoA, to the citric cycle interfere with glucose metabolism and promote insulin resistance (22Randle P.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The tight correlation between high fasting plasma FFAs and insulin resistance has been supported by the observation that fasting plasma FFAs are commonly elevated in obese and insulin-resistant individuals (23Baldeweg S.E.

Given the regulatory role of plasma FFAs in insulin sensitivity, we investigated the role of FFAs in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in L-SACC1 mice. To this end, we treated L-SACC1 females, which, unlike their male counterparts, did not develop hyperglycemia until 8 months of age, following increased visceral adiposity and impaired insulin clearance, with carnitine to normalize FFAs levels (24Maccari F. Arseni A. Chiodi P. Ramacci M.T. Angelucci L. Hulsmann W.C. Lipids. 1987; 22: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We report that normalization of FFAs levels by carnitine in 6-month-old L-SACC1 mice restored insulin levels and prevented hyperglycemia. By decreasing lipolysis, nicotinic acid also restored receptor-mediated insulin uptake. Because carnitine does not modulate insulin internalization directly, these data suggest that increased visceral adiposity contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in L-SACC1 females. Animal Maintenance and Treatment—Animals were kept in a 12-h dark/light cycle and fed standard chow ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the relevant Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committees at the Medical College of Ohio and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco. When carnitine was used, 6-month-old wild type (WT) and L-SACC1 mice were treated at 1600 h for 1 or 2 weeks with a daily intraperitoneal injection of saline (vehicle-treated) or 0.2–1.5 g/kg body weight of L-carnitine, 0.4 g/ml saline (L-carnitine; Inner Salt Raw; Sigma). 6-Month-old mice were treated with two daily intraperitoneal injections of 200 mol/kg body weight of nicotinic acid (Sigma) or saline for 2 weeks (25Tunaru S. Kero J. Schaub A. Wufka C. Blaukat A. Pfeffer K. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Phenotypic Analysis—Following an overnight fast (with food being removed at 1700 h on the day prior to the experiment), mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 μg/g body weight) between 1100 and 1200 h. Whole venous blood was drawn from the retro-orbital sinuses to measure fasting glucose levels using a glucometer (Accu-chek; Roche Applied Science), plasma insulin, C-peptide, and leptin levels by radioimmunoassays (Linco Research), plasma FFAs using the NEFA C kit (Wako), triglycerides using the Infinity Triglycerides reagent (Sigma), and cholesterol using the Infinity Cholesterol reagent (Sigma). For liver and kidney functions, serum ALT (Sigma) and blood urea nitrogen (Infinity BUN reagent; Sigma) were measured, respectively. Visceral adipose tissues were weighed, and visceral adiposity was expressed as a percentage of total body weight. Liver and muscle triacylglycerols were determined as described previously (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Serum β-Hydroxybutyrate—Following an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized, and blood was drawn to determine serum 3-hydroxybutyric acid levels by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy following ethyl acetate/diethyl ether extraction of plasma deproteinized with 7% perchloric acid (26Tanaka K. West-Dull A.D.G.H. Lynn T.B. Lowe T. Clin. Chem. 1980; 26: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Serum Carnitine Levels—Free carnitine and acylcarnitines were quantified in serum from fasted mice by tandem mass spectrometry (27Rashed M.S. Bucknall M.P. Little D. Awad A. Jacob M. Alamoudi M. Alwatter M. Ozand P.T. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 15 μl of serum was extracted with 200 μl of methanol containing stable isotopically labeled internal standards. Dried extract was derivatized with butanolic HCl to form butyl esters that were in turn analyzed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of the precursor ions of m/z 85. CoA Ester Levels—Tissues were removed from fasted mice and snap frozen in liquid N2. Approximately 100–200 mg were added to an ice-cold mortar and pestle containing 1.5 ml of 6% perchloric acid and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and 50 μl of 0.32 m dithiothreitol was added to the supernatant. CoA esters were measured using a modified HPLC procedure (28King M.T. Reiss P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Intracellular Glucose 6-Phosphate—The liver was removed from fasted 4-month-old WT and l-SACC1 mice and snap frozen. 1 g was homogenized, resuspended in 5 ml of 6 n perchloric acid, and centrifuged (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 3.5, and it was placed on ice and mixed with 0.2 m triethanolamine buffer, 0.2 mm NADP, and 5 mm MgCl2 before adding 170 units/liter Glc-6-P-dehydrogenase. Absorbance was measured at 340 nm before and after the addition of enzyme, and Glc-6-P content was calculated in μmol/g of tissue (29Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer N.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis 3. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar). Insulin and Glucose Tolerance Tests—These tests were performed on anesthetized fasted mice, as described previously (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Glucose Uptake in Isolated Muscle—Glucose uptake in response to 200 microunits/ml of insulin by soleus muscle removed from hind limbs of fasted mice was determined as described previously (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Insulin Binding and Internalization—Primary hepatocytes, isolated as described previously (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), were grown for 24 h prior to [125I]insulin (10 pm) binding at 4 °C (30Li Calzi S. Choice C.V. Najjar S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E801-E808PubMed Google Scholar). Unbound insulin was removed, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 0–60 min before incubating in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline (pH 3.5) for 10 min. The acid wash was counted as surface-bound, noninternalized insulin, and NaOH-solubilized cells were counted as internalized cell-associated ligand. Internalized insulin was measured as a percentage of cell-associated per specifically bound ligand (the sum of surface-bound plus cell-associated ligand). Biotin Labeling of Surface Membrane Proteins—Following incubation of primary hepatocytes in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin at 37 °C for 5 min, cells were incubated with biotin as previously described (3Choice C.V.

Following lysis in 1% Triton-X, proteins were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against the α-subunit of the insulin receptor (α-IRα) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins were then analyzed by electrophoresis and sequential immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and α-IRα, followed by detection with ECL. Insulin Receptor Quantification—Primary hepatocytes from 6-month-old mice were grown at 37 °C in triplicate plates before incubating at 4 °C for 5 h with insulin (0–1,000 ng/ml) and 125I-labeled insulin (20 pm; 5.0 × 104 cpm/ml) (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). NaOH-lysed cells were counted, and the insulin receptor number was determined by Scatchard plot analysis using the SCAFIT version 4.7 program (National Institutes of Health). Fatty Acid Synthesis in Primary Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells/25 cm3, serum-starved overnight, and incubated with 3 ml of prewarmed fresh serum-free medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate (Amersham Biosciences) in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were harvested in 0.5 n KOH to determine protein concentration (Bio-Rad) and fatty acid synthesis in cpm of incorporated 14C/μg of proteins (31Maltese W.A. Reitz B.A. Volpe J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Synthase Activity—Livers were removed and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors (32Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and fatty acid synthase activity was assayed in the postmitochondrial supernatant (33Hennigar R.A. Pochet M. Hunt D.A. Lukacher A.E. Venema V.J. Seal E. Marrero M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Synthesis in Vivo—Synthesis of fatty acids was determined in vivo by the 3HOH method in 7-month-old nonfasted mice at 1400–1500 h (34Erickson S.K. Lear S.R. Dean S. Dubrac S. Huling S.L.

Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 Phosphorylation—The liver was removed from fasted 6-month-old mice and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors (32Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with agarose-streptavidin, resolved by 6–15% gradient SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with α-phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (pACC1) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) to detect phosphorylated ACC1 followed by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin to determine the total amount of ACC1 in the immunopellet. The pACC1/ACC1 ratio was used as a measure of ACC1 activation (35Abu-Elheiga L. Almarza-Ortega D.B. Baldini A. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10669-10677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). mRNA Levels—Liver mRNA was purified using the MicroPoly(A) Pure kit (Ambion), analyzed by Northern blot, and probed with cDNAs for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and glucokinase mRNA levels were normalized with β-actin. Statistics—Data were analyzed with Statview software (Abacus Concepts) using one-factor analysis of variance analysis. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Abnormal Metabolism in L-SACC1 Female Transgenics—Similar to L-SACC1 males (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), L-SACC1 females developed a 2–5-fold increase in plasma insulin levels by 2 months of age (Table I). They maintained normal glucose uptake in soleus muscle at submaximal insulin concentrations (200 microunits/ml) (Fig. 1A) and glucose transporter-4 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Glucose levels decreased to a similar extent in L-SACC1 and WT mice following insulin injection (Fig. 1C). This suggests that peripheral tissues in L-SACC1 mice, especially skeletal muscle, maintained intrinsic insulin sensitivity to glucose uptake. However, in control mice, glucose levels returned to normal within 3 h, whereas in L-SACC1 mice, they remained suppressed (Fig. 1C), consistent with the observation that L-SACC1 removed injected insulin less efficiently than WT mice.Table IMetabolic parameters in L-SACC1 female mice Phenotype characterization of age-matched 2-, 4-, and 6-month-old WT and L-SACC1 mice was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 10–12 mice per category were tested.

In view of the fact that muscle glucose uptake is normal, glucose intolerance is likely to arise from hepatic insulin resistance. This is supported by the ∼50% reduction (p < 0.05) in insulin receptor number in hepatocytes isolated from l-SACC1 females (Fig. 2B). Unlike l-SACC1 males, which developed random hyperglycemia by 2 months of age (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), l-SACC1 females did not develop fed hyperglycemia until 8 months of age (107.0 ± 4.00 mg/dl versus 112.0 ± 5.20 in WT at 6 months of age and 135.4 ± 4.4 mg/dl versus 113.9 ± 6.6 in WT; p < 0.05 at 8 months of age). Accordingly, mRNA levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase were significantly higher (∼3-fold) in l-SACC1 female livers at 8 but not at 6 months of age (Fig. 2C). In contrast, mRNA levels of glucokinase were not significantly altered at 8 months of age (Fig. 2C). Like males (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), fasting glucose was normal in l-SACC1 females even at 8 months of age (110.3 ± 4.1 mg/dl versus 112.2 ± 4.1 in WT), consistent with normal β-cell insulin secretory function in l-SACC1 mice (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Altered Hepatic FFA Metabolism in L-SACC1 Females—Like their male counterparts (5Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernström M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), L-SACC1 females exhibited increased body weight (not shown) and visceral adiposity at all ages examined (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). However, plasma leptin levels were normal (Fig. 3B, p > 0.05). This suggests that the food intake in L-SACC1 was normal and that visceral obesity is not attributed to changes in food intake. L-SACC1 mice also showed elevated fasting plasma FFAs and TG starting at 2 months of age (Table I). Hepatic acetyl- and malonyl-CoA levels were normal (Table II). Together with normal ACC1 activity in fasted L-SACC1 mice (pACC/ACC = 0.9–1.1 versus 1.1–1.3 in WT mice), this suggests that fatty acid synthesis is normal in L-SACC1 females under fasting conditions. Under nonfasting conditions, fatty acid synthase activity in liver extracts of 2-month-old L-SACC1 females was normal (174.3 ± 6.6 cpm/μg versus 177.7 ± 6.5 in WT mice); so was hepatic de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis measured in vivo in 7-month-old L-SACC1 females (Table III). Similarly, fatty acid synthesis in whole body, skeletal muscle, heart, and small intestine of nonfasted L-SACC1 females was normal (Table III).Table IIEffects of L-carnitine on lipid and insulin metabolism of 6-month-old L-SACC1 females Vehicle- or carnitine-treated 6-month-old WT and L-SACC1 female mice (5–9 mice/group) were fasted overnight, and the whole venous blood was drawn to determine serum β-hydroxybutyrate carnitine, FFA, TG, insulin, and C-peptide levels. Liver and gastrocnemius muscle were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen to measure CoA metabolites and TG.

Because fatty acid synthesis is normal, FA substrates of TG synthesis are likely to derive from adipose tissue. Serum acyl- and acetylcarnitine/total carnitine ratios were high (Table II). Because carnitine esters that are released from the liver equilibrate with plasma more rapidly than those released from muscle and brain (36Leiter E. Herberg L.

One receptor, Tom70, binds large, hydrophobic mitochondrial precursors. The current model of Tom70-mediated import involves multiple dimers of the receptor recognizing a single molecule of substrate. Here we show via a battery of biophysical and spectroscopic techniques that the cytosolic domain of Tom70 is an elongated monomer. Thermal and urea-induced denaturation revealed that the receptor, which unfolds via a multistate pathway, is a relatively unstable molecule undergoing major conformational change at physiological temperatures.

One of the two TIM (translocase of the inner membrane) complexes then completes the sorting of the imported protein into the appropriate compartment of the mitochondrion (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Many mitochondrial precursor proteins are unusually hydrophobic (5Claros M.G. Perea J. Shu Y. Samatey F.A. Popot J.L. Jacq C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), including proteins soluble in the matrix (such as the dehydrogenase Adh3), peripheral membrane proteins such as the β-subunit of the F1-ATPase, and integral membrane proteins such as members of the carrier family. These proteins have been shown to require the Tom70 receptor for efficient import into mitochondria (6Hines V. Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brutsch H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3191-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Sollner T. Pfaller R. Griffiths G. Pfanner N. Neupert W.

Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these precursor proteins might make use of cytosolic chaperones (11Lithgow T. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 98-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and recently, Tom70 was shown to act both as a receptor directly interacting with precursors and as a docking site for cytosolic forms of Hsp70. Tom70 is composed of multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs: a degenerate 34-amino-acid sequence widely characterized as mediators of protein-protein interactions (12Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 13Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Structurally, a single TPR motif forms a pair of antiparallel α-helices that are often arranged in large super-helical arrays of between 3 and 20 repeats (14Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) that can form a contiguous surface suitable for binding to short segments of peptide ligand (15D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Tom70 from yeast and mammalian systems suggests that the receptor has seven TPR motifs (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 16Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The three N-terminal TPRs of Tom70 show a high degree of similarity to TPR motifs seen in Hsp70-binding proteins and perform a similar role in Tom70, serving as a clamp for the C-terminal peptide of Hsp70 (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 17Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). By contrast, the TPR segments in the central region of Tom70 specifically recognize loops of the precursor ligand (18Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A truncated form of Tom70, lacking the C-terminal segment, cannot suppress the temperature sensitivity of a Δtom70 mutant (19Riezman H. Hase T. van Loon A.P. Grivell L.A. Suda K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2161-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and might represent a secondary ligand-binding site (16Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Precursor proteins are then transferred to the translocation channel, but this transfer depends on the interaction Tom70 makes with the single TPR segment in the Tom20 receptor (20Haucke V. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The current model for how Tom70 assists the import of precursor proteins has the receptor existing as a homodimer that is only transiently associated with the TOM complex (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 21Meisinger C. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Model K. Lim J.H. Sickmann A. Muller H. Meyer H.E. Wagner R.

Multiple dimers of Tom70 are thought to be required to bind each of the internal targeting sequences of the precursor and facilitate its transfer through the import pore of the TOM complex (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 22Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of Tom70 dimers stems from its apparent slow mobility under blue native gel electrophoresis (25Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the presence of a 500-kDa complex when ADP/ATP carrier-bound Tom70 is analyzed by the same technique (22Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain of Tom70 has been suggested to mediate oligomerization (23Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18403-18406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, recent work indicates that these transmembrane domains may not associate in vivo (25Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a biophysical characterization of the cytosolic domain of Tom70, the first such study involving a subunit of the mitochondrial import apparatus. Tom70 is shown to be a monomer that adopts an elongated shape. This monomer is also shown to be intrinsically unstable, unfolding at physiological temperatures. We propose that the inherent fluidity of Tom70 is an important factor in mitochondrial import, allowing flexibility in the interactions it needs to make with Hsp70, precursor ligand, and Tom20. Protein Expression and Purification—DNA encoding residues 51–617 of Tom70 was amplified via PCR from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GTATTCCATGGACACAAAGGACTCTCAAAGG-3′ and 5′-AGAGGCCATGGATGTAACTGAAGGCAAG-3′. The resultant PCR product was digested with BspHI and BamHI restriction enzymes and cloned into the NcoI/BglII region of a pQE60 expression vector (Qiagen). Recombinant protein was expressed in a BL21(DE3) expression strain and purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography, anion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. Protein was kept in a buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Spectroscopic Methods—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter using a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C in a 1-cm path length quartz cell. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5.0 nm for all spectra, unless otherwise stated, and a scan speed of 10 nm/min was used. Circular dichroism spectra were measured on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter using a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C. Far UV spectra from 190 to 250 nm were collected with 5-s/point signal averaging. θ222 measurements were made with the signal averaged over 15 s. The concentration of the protein was 0.1 mg/ml with 0.1-cm path length. For a comparison of unfolding transitions collected at different protein concentrations, the data were normalized by calculating the fraction of unfolded protein as described previously (26Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 311-330Google Scholar). All unfolding data were fit to either a two- or a three-state unfolding model as described previously (27Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 28Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—A Beckman Optima model XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric absorbance optical detection system was used for all sedimentation experiments. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, 100 μl of Tom7051–617 (1.5 mg/ml) dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and 120 μl of reference were loaded into a conventional double sector filled epon centerpiece (path length 1.2 cm) with quartz windows and mounted in a Beckman An-60 Ti rotor. Data were collected at 290 nm with five averages, at time intervals of 240 min and radial intervals of 0.001 cm, until sedimentation equilibrium was attained (∼16 h). The establishment of sedimentation equilibrium was ascertained by overlaying the data until no apparent movement was observed between consecutive data. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C with a rotor velocity of 15,000 rpm. To estimate the signal due to nonsedimenting contaminants, high speed depletion was performed at 40,000 rpm for at least 3 h, and the resulting baseline offset (E) was calculated by averaging the absorbance over a radial range of 0.1 cm in the resulting plateau adjacent to the sample meniscus. For all samples, the values for E represented <5% of the initial absorbance, indicating the presence of only minor amounts of low mass contaminants. Solvent densities and viscosities were computed using SEDNTERP (29Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm (35,130 m–1 cm–1) and partial specific volume of Tom7051–617 (0.733 ml/g at 20 °C) were calculated from the amino acid composition. An equivalent molar mass (M′), assuming a single species, was obtained from the nonlinear least squares best-fit at a single speed according to the exponential relationship using the program SEDPHAT (30Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar),c(r)=c(r0)exp[ω22RTM′(1−v¯ρ)(r2−r02)]+E (Eq. 1) where c(r) is the concentration at radius r, c(r0) is the concentration at the reference radius r0, ω is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, v̄ is the partial specific volume of the solute, ρ is the solvent density, and E is the baseline offset. For sedimentation velocity experiments, 380 μl of sample (0.25–2.0 mg/ml) and 400 μl of reference were employed under the same solution conditions as the sedimentation equilibrium experiments described above. Experiments were conducted at a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm, and the data were collected in continuous mode, at a single wavelength, a time interval of 300 s, and a step size of 0.003 cm without averaging. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a continuous size distribution model using the program SEDFIT (31Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Tom7051–617—The cytosolic domain of Tom70 (residues 51–617) was expressed in recombinant form and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Tom7051–617 was shown to be functional, as it could bind in vitro-translated phosphate carrier, a known substrate for Tom70 (18Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Beddoe T. Russel Grimwade School of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia2003: 161Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the Tom7051–617 was analyzed by far UV circular dichroism (Fig. 1B). Tom7051–617 was observed to have double minima at 222 and 208 nm, which is indicative of protein with a high helical content. Deconvolution of the CD data (using the method described by Aggerbeck et al. (34Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) shows that Tom7051–617 has an α-helical content of 73%. Considering that the seven putative TPR motifs in Tom70 constitute 54% of the total structure of the protein, the predicted α-helical content is in reasonable agreement with the observed data, indicating the presence of helical content in addition to that contained in the TPRs. Recombinant Tom7051–617 Is Monomeric—Tom70 has been suggested to form a dimer in the outer mitochondrial membrane with subunit association mediated by its transmembrane domain (23Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18403-18406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies had suggested Tom7051–617 to be monomeric (18Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas studies by Young et al. (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) with the same protein indicated that Tom70 elutes as a dimer via size exclusion chromatography. In our study, Tom7051–617 eluted from size exclusion chromatography at a position equivalent to a 125-kDa globular protein, suggesting that Tom7051–617 is dimeric (Fig. 2A). To investigate the solution properties of Tom7051–617 further, the purified protein was subjected to sedimentation velocity analyses in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The absorbance versus the radial position from the axis of rotation profiles is plotted at 6-min intervals for Tom7051–617 at an initial protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml (Fig. 2B). The data are overlaid with the continuous size distribution best-fit (30Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) calculated as described in the legend for Fig. 2. The c(s) distribution best-fit presented in Fig. 2C shows that the protein exists as a single species with a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 3.9 s, which was calculated with a frictional ratio (f/f0) of 1.7 and suggests that Tom7051–617 exists as an asymmetric monomer in solution. The root mean square deviation of this analysis was calculated to be 0.0051, and together with the clearly observable superimposition of the fits and data presented in Fig. 2B, this indicates a superior fit to the model. Similar data were obtained over a protein concentration range of 0.25–2.0 mg/ml, demonstrating that the effect is not concentration-dependent. Assuming a prolate ellipsoidal shape calculated using the v̄ method (29Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar), the axial ratio is estimated to be 5.4, indicating that in aqueous solution, Tom7051–617 is 5.4 times longer than it is wide. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were also performed on Tom7051–617 under the same solution conditions as employed for the sedimentation velocity analyses (Fig. 3). From Equation 1, the equivalent molar mass of Tom7051–617 at an initial concentration of 1.5 mg/ml was calculated to be 56.9 kDa (data not shown). This is in good agreement with the monomeric mass of the protein (65.9 kDa) and is consistent with the sedimentation velocity results (Fig. 2C).Fig. 3Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of Tom7051–617. Bottom panel, the absorbance at 290 nm is plotted as a function of radial position (r) subtracted from the radius of the sample meniscus (rm). The open circles represent the sedimentation equilibrium data of Tom7051–617 at an initial protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml obtained at a rotor velocity of 15,000 rpm. The solid line represents the nonlinear least squares best-fit to a single species according to Equation 1, yielding an equivalent molar mass of 56.7 kDa, which is consistent with the monomeric molar mass of the recombinant protein. Top panel, the residuals for the nonlinear best-fit described above are plotted as a function of radial position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of Tertiary Structure and Stability by Spectroscopy—To further characterize the structure of Tom7051–617, equilibrium unfolding data derived from intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were combined with data on global unfolding of the secondary structure, as provided by far-UV CD analysis. The fluorescence emission spectra of Tom7051–617 (Fig. 4A) shows an emission maximum at 333 nm, which is typical of a buried tryptophan residue. Upon the addition of 6 m urea, the emission maximum red-shifted to 353 nm as well as displaying a concomitant decrease in emission intensity. To excite both tyrosine and tryptophan residues, the excitation wavelength was set at 275 nm. There was a complete absence of tyrosine emission at 303 nm in the spectra, although Tom7051–617 in its native state has 21 tyrosine residues (Fig. 4B). When Tom7051–617 is unfolded in the presence of 6 m urea, tyrosine fluorescence becomes visible at 303 nm. This is a clear indication of high resonance energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan in natively folded Tom7051–617. The urea-induced unfolding profiles for Tom7051–617, as monitored by changes in fluorescence emission intensity at 333 nm, are shown in Fig. 5. The profiles were identical over a 10× protein concentration range (30–300 μg/ml) and were fully reversible. There was a single transition from fully folded to unfolded protein with Tom7051–617 centered around 2.8 m urea (Table I). The protein was fully unfolded when urea concentration exceeded 4 m. The lack of a concentration-dependent step in the unfolding pathway further suggests that the native state of Tom7051–617 is monomeric.Table IParameters for the two- and three-state fits to the denaturation transition curvesTwo state analysisThree state analysisΔGF → UmF → UD50%F → UΔGF → ImF → ID50%F → IΔGI → UmI → UD50%I → Ukcal/molkcal/mol/mmkcal/molkcal/mol/mmkcal/molkcal/mol/mmFluorescence intensity0.03 mg/ml3.17 ± 0.021.15 ± 0.082.70.3 mg/ml3.50 ± 0.061.2 ± 0.102.9Far-UV CD0.05 mg/ml2.04 ± 0.11.94 ± 0.11.055.4 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.13.30.25 mg/ml2.3 ± 0.12.21.045.2 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.083.4 Open table in a new tab In addition, changes in the secondary structure of Tom7051–617 during unfolding were monitored by far-UV CD. The resultant data show that Tom7051–617 unfolds via a single intermediate (Fig. 6). The first transition, as monitored by CD, occurred with a midpoint of ∼1 m urea (Fig. 6, Table I) and was associated with ∼30% loss of far-UV signal (Fig. 6, inset). The second transition resulted in a complete loss of secondary structure when urea concentration exceeded 4 m (Fig. 6, inset). The formation of this intermediate was shown to be highly reproducible over a 5× protein concentration range (50–250 μg/ml). As the midpoints for the structural transitions observed via CD (1 and 3.4 m) were not the same as for the transition monitored by fluorescence (2.7 m), it is clear that at least two intermediate species are formed during the unfolding of Tom7051–617. Therefore, the minimal pathway is N ↔ I1 ↔ I2 ↔ U. In both CD and fluorescence-monitored unfolding experiments, Tom7051–617 unfolding was shown to be fully reversible The data from both experiments were therefore combined and analyzed using either a two- or a three-state model, respectively (Table I). The thermal stability of Tom7051–617 was also determined by monitoring the change in the secondary structure by circular dichroism. As this denaturation is irreversible, it is unable to be fitted to a thermodynamic model. However, the raw data curve shows that Tom70 unfolds via two transitions (Fig. 7) with midpoints (Tm) of 41 ± 1 and 52 ± 1 °C. The presence of two transitions indicates the formation of an intermediate species, in good agreement with the urea titration data obtained by CD analysis. This profile was highly reproducible and independent of the heating rate or protein concentration. Much of the recent study of helical repeat proteins has focused on the design of “idealized” motifs: artificial proteins in which large scale sequence alignment techniques have been employed to determine the most common residue at each position of an otherwise highly degenerate consensus sequence. Such studies have been performed on ankyrin repeats (35Mosavi L.K. Minor Jr., D.L. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16029-16034Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); leucine-rich repeats (36Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Binz H.K. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and TPR repeats (37Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and have given insight into the global characteristics of each motif. However, very little work has been done on the biophysical properties of naturally occurring TPR arrays. In this study, we present a focused biophysical and spectroscopic analysis of the TPR arrays of Tom70. Our study is also the first such analysis of a component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. The underlying appeal of designing idealized helical repeat arrays is their propensity to exhibit high thermal stability. However, ironically, to date, similar studies on naturally occurring helical repeat arrays have often displayed thermal instability. For example, studies involving an idealized ankyrin helical repeat (an α-helix/β-hairpin/α-helix repeat) showed that the stability of the protein tended to increase as more and more repeats were added, so much so that the Tm of an artificial 4× ankyrin repeat was 81 °C (35Mosavi L.K. Minor Jr., D.L. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16029-16034Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, biophysical studies of naturally occurring 4× ankyrin repeat proteins, p16INK4d and myotrophin, yielded TmS of 44 and 53 °C, respectively (38Mosavi L.K. Williams S. Peng Zy Z.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Tang K.S. Guralnick B.J. Wang W.K. Fersht A.R. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1869-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 40Zhang B. Peng Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More strikingly, Notch, a receptor with six functional ankyrin repeats, has a Tm of just 45 °C (41Zweifel M.E. Barrick D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14357-14367Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). So far, this disparity between idealized and natural stabilities is yet to be explained. The thermal unfolding data presented in this study show that this inconsistency also applies between idealized and naturally occurring TPRs, with the observation that the thermal unfolding midpoint of Tom7051–617 occurs at 41 °C, as compared with 83 °C as seen in an idealized 3× TPR repeat (37Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This instability might be vital for the function of the receptor, with Tom70 presumably needing to display some plasticity in order for it to recognize the wide catalogue of sequences found within the mitochondrial protein ligands. The unfolding pathway of Tom7051–617 also contrasts that observed in idealized helical arrays in that it unfolds via at least one intermediate. The N ↔ I1(↔I2) ↔ U unfolding pathway of Tom70 was evident in both urea and thermally induced denaturation assays, as observed via CD, with I1 visible at 1 m urea. All intermediates observed were found to be reproducible over a 10-fold concentration range, with urea-induced denaturation also being fully reversible. The transition I1 ↔ I2 was observed by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence as Tom7051–617 was denatured via urea, with I2 apparent at 2.8 m. The single tryptophan residue of Tom70 resides in TPR1 (residue 124), and during unfolding, has an increase in solvent exposure. As there is no significant loss of secondary structure associated with this transition, its presence could be a result of localized unfolding around TPR1 or of Tom7051–617 moving from a semiglobule to a more extended shape. The presence of an intermediate species during thermal unfolding is intriguing and suggests that the protein consists of independent domains with significantly different stabilities. This is supported by previous work which showed that idealized TPR motifs consisting of one, two, or three TPR motifs had midpoints of thermal denaturation of 49, 74, and 83 °C, respectively, which suggests that there is a correlation between the number of repeats and stability (37Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As Tom7051–617 has two sets of repeats, one with two TPR motifs and the second with five motifs present (16Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it is possible that the presence of an intermediate species reflects the different stabilities of these structures. Given the “nonglobular” asymmetry of Tom70 and the low amount of coiling in the terminal regions of Tom70, this hypothesis seems more plausible than conventional unfolding of a hydrophobic core domain following the unfolding of terminal random or near random coil regions. In keeping with the differential domain stability suggested for TPR motifs, the urea-induced unfolding pathway of Tom7051–617 also indicated the presence of intermediate species. The first transition (N → I1) resulted in a loss of secondary structure, whereas the transition from I1 to I2 was only observed by fluorescence spectroscopy. It is thought that the apparent stability of idealized repeat arrays stems from the cooperative nature of array folding and unfolding, thus explaining why unfolding profiles of idealized TPR motifs display a simple N ↔ U pattern with a high midpoint (37Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the presence of an intermediate in the unfolding pathway of Tom7051–617 indicates that it has two separate TPR arrays, capable of folding and unfolding independently, with presumably separate functions. This correlates well with the primary structure of Tom70, with TPRs 1 and 2 separated from TPRs 3–7 via a 233-residue linker region. TPRs 1 and 2 are required for binding cytoplasmic Hsp70 (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), which anchors the chaperone, whereas its mitochondrial precursor payload is recognized by multiple binding sites thought to exist in TPRs 3–7 (9Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 16Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that each transition reflects the actual conformational changes associated with the function of Tom70. To date, a definitive demarcation between regions of Tom70 responsible for chaperone binding, precursor binding, and translocation is yet to be made. Moreover, it is generally accepted that a minimum of three proximal TPR repeats are required in order for an array to be stable (15D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The presence of just two TPR motifs in the N-terminal region of Tom70 could account for the relative instability of the molecule. Until recently, it was thought that Tom70 dimerization was mediated by a putative oligomerization motif located within its transmembrane domain (23Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18403-18406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent work by Waizenegger et al. (25Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) has shown that the transmembrane domain of Tom70 is interchangeable with the transmembrane domain of the strictly monomeric Tom20, without affecting the function of either receptor in vivo (42Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We have shown, via a number of independent techniques that the recombinant cytosolic domain of Tom70 is monomeric. Firstly, the lack of a concentration-dependent step in the unfolding pathway of Tom70 would suggest that the molecule does not dimerize. Secondly, through sedimentation analyses, we have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of Tom70 exists as a flexible, elongated monomer. Further analysis of the sedimentation velocity data shows that the Tom7051–617 monomer is asymmetric, with the protein appearing 5.4 × long as it is wide. It is worth noting here that one of the major pieces of evidence indicating that Tom7051–617 dimerizes is its elution as a species of 120–140 kDa when the protein is subjected to size exclusion chromatography, an observation that can now be attributed as an anomaly due to the asymmetric nature of the Tom70 cytosolic domain. Our sedimentation velocity data correspond favorably with a structural model based on a linear 4× repeat structure of protein phosphatase 5, a fold in which multiple TPR motifs are arranged in a super-helical array (14Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This extended shape would expose a large surface area to precursor protein substrates, consistent with the theory that Tom70 contains multiple binding sites (16Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and would also account for the relative instability of the receptor and for the flexibility."

Here, by in vivo complementation experiments with Tar-EnvZ hybrid receptor mutants in which the HAMP linker forms a heterodimer with Tar and EnvZ-type subunits, we found that mutations at one linker only affect the function of EnvZ in the same subunit. However, the same mutations affect the EnvZ function of both subunits when only a Tar or EnvZ-type HAMP linker is used. These results suggest that intersubunit interactions in the HAMP linker normally mediate signal transduction through both subunits in a sensor dimer, whereas the signal is asymmetrically transduced through the linker in a heterodimer. This is the first demonstration that two HAMP linkers in a sensor dimer are functionally coupled for normal signal transduction; however, this functional coupling can be reduced when the HAMP linkers lose their symmetric nature.

This is the first demonstration that two HAMP linkers in a sensor dimer are functionally coupled for normal signal transduction; however, this functional coupling can be reduced when the HAMP linkers lose their symmetric nature. The HAMP linker is widely found in histidine kinases, chemoreceptors, bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases, and phosphatases (1Heinz D.W. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the primary sequence homology among predicted HAMP linkers is low, they all share a similar helix-turn-helix fold based on secondary structure prediction. A cysteine-scanning study on the Tar linker supports this model of HAMP linker structure (4Butler S.L. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10746-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis found a number of mutations clustered in the HAMP linker of various sensor proteins, which usually lead to biased signaling modes (5Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Harlocker S.L. Rampersaud A. Yang W.P. Inouye M. J.

(Tokyo). 1992; 111: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that the HAMP linker plays an active role in signal transduction rather than being just a simple structural element connecting the sensor and transmitter modules of sensor proteins. However, the exact function of the HAMP linker on signal transduction remains to be determined. Functional hybrid histidine kinases have been constructed by fusing the sensor module of chemoreceptors (also called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) to the transmitter module of histidine kinase EnvZ using the HAMP linker from either protein. In Taz1, the sensor module of chemoreceptor Tar is fused to the transmitter module of EnvZ using the Tar linker (10Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In Trz, the sensor module of chemoreceptor Trg is fused to the transmitter module of EnvZ using the Trg linker (11Baumgartner J.W. Kim C. Brissette R.E. Inouye M. Park C. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ, the sensor module of Tar is fused to the transmitter module of EnvZ using the EnvZ linker with one Ala insertion at the N-terminal end and the EnvZ linker with a Pro to Gln mutation at position 185 (the position number is based on EnvZ sequence), respectively (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A number of functional hybrid histidine kinases have also been constructed by fusing the sensor module of one histidine kinase with the transmitter module of another histidine kinase at the HAMP linker region (NarQ-NarX, NarX-NarQ, and NarX-CpxA fusions) or by replacing the HAMP linker of one histidine kinase (NarX) with the HAMP linker of another histidine kinase (CpxA) (13Appleman J.A. Chen L.L. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, functional hybrid chemoreceptors have been constructed in which Tar-Tsr (14Krikos A. Conley M.P. Boyd A. Berg H.C. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1326-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Tap-Tar (15Weerasuriya S. Schneider B.M. Manson M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 914-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Trg-Tsr (16Feng X. Baumgartner J.W. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fusions are made using the Tsr, Tar, and Tsr linkers, respectively, and a Aer-Tsr fusion is made using the Aer linker (17Kristich C.J. Glekas G.D. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The ligand responsiveness of all these hybrid sensor proteins indicates that a common mechanism may be shared for signal transduction. It also implies that the HAMP linkers of different sensor proteins function in a similar manner for signal propagation. Furthermore, specific interactions within the HAMP linker seem to be critical for the linker function, as several Tar-EnvZ (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) hybrid sensor proteins carrying a hybrid HAMP linker exhibit non-regulatable phenotypes in vivo. Cumulative results have suggested that an intrasubunit signal transduction mechanism is adapted by sensor proteins for transmembrane signaling (19Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol.

However, it is not clear how the intrasubunit signaling across the membrane is interpreted in the cytoplasmic domain of sensor proteins and what the function is of the HAMP linker in this signal propagation. In the present report, we carried out in vivo complementation experiments using Tar-EnvZ hybrid receptor mutants, which carry the Tar linker or EnvZ linker in combination with the autophosphorylation site mutation (H243V) or a G2 box mutation (G405A). As shown in Fig. 1A, in this dimer only the active center (active center 2) that was formed between domain A from the G405A mutant and domain B from the H243V mutant is active. Furthermore, we examined the effect of mutations at one of the receptor heterodimer linkers or homodimer linkers on the activities of the two active centers in the EnvZ transmitter dimer. Through these analyses we concluded that an intrasubunit asymmetric signal transduction could occur through the HAMP linker in a receptor heterodimer. However, for native histidine kinases or receptor proteins such as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, intersubunit interactions between the two linkers normally mediate symmetric signal transduction through both subunits in a dimer. Strains and Plasmids—Strain RU1012 (MC4100 ara+, Φ (ompC-lacZ) 10–25 ΔenvZ::Kmr) (10Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was used for complementation assay. pYY0405 (Taz1H1, Cmr) carrying the H243V mutation in the envZ gene (26Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was digested by NdeI and BamHI. The released fragments were subcloned into Tez1A1, Tez1PQ, and Tez1 (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), replacing the original NdeI/BamHI fragments to construct Tez1A1H1, Tez1PQH1, and Tez1H1 with an Ampr antibiotic marker, respectively. These plasmids were then digested by XbaI and BamHI, and the released fragments were subcloned back into pYY0405, replacing the original XbaI/BamHI fragments for the construction of Tez1A1H1, Tez1PQH1, and Tez1H1 with a Cmr antibiotic marker, respectively. By site-directed mutagenesis, Tez1A1, Tez1PQ, and Tez1 carrying the G405A mutation in the EnvZ transmitter module were constructed and named Tez1A1(G405A), Tez1PQ(G405A), and Tez1(G405A) (all with the Ampr antibiotic marker), respectively. In addition, the L189D and F220D mutations were introduced independently into Tez1A1H1, Tez1PQH1, and Tez1H1 (all with the Cmr antibiotic marker) or Tez1A1(G405A), Tez1PQ(G405A), and Tez1(G405A) (all with the Ampr antibiotic marker) by site-directed mutagenesis. Also, the A231V mutation was introduced into Taz1H1 (pYY0405) (with the Cmr antibiotic marker) and Taz1(G405A) (with the Ampr antibiotic marker) (27Zhu Y. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis to construct Taz1(A231V/H1) and Taz1(A231V/G405A), respectively. A diagram showing the composition of each receptor variants is shown in Fig. 1B. β-Galactosidase Assay—Each pair of complementing hybrid sensor protein constructs was transformed sequentially into RU1012 cells. β-galactosidase activities of RU1012 cells transformed with various hybrid sensor constructs were determined as previously described (28Yang Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For each set of data presented in each figure, we picked three independent colonies for the β-galactosidase assay. The error bars reflect the standard deviations of measurements on the three independent samples. The complementation assay for all the combinations presented in one figure was carried out in one experiment. Each experiment was repeated at least twice, and the data shown in the figure represent one of these experiments. As the absolute value of miller units varied in each experiment but the ratios were kept at a similar level, the ratio rather than the numeric value was used as the basis for defining the phenotypes of different variants. The phenotypes were scored as “aspartate-regulatable” if the ratio of β-galactosidase activities (miller units) with and without aspartate treatment is reproducibly larger than two. Preparation of the Membrane Fraction—Membrane fractions containing different Taz1, Tez1A1, or Tez1PQ variants were prepared as described previously (18Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein amounts were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of total membrane proteins (5 μg) were used for Western blot analysis. Signal Transduction through the Hetero-HAMP Linkers— Taz1H1, a Taz1 mutant carrying an autophosphorylation site mutation, H243V (termed H1), and Taz1(G405A), a Taz1 mutant harboring a G2 box mutation, G405A, were unable to respond to the Taz1 ligand, aspartate, to activate ompC-lacZ expression in RU1012 cells (26Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Zhu Y. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, when they were co-expressed as the result of heterodimer formation, one functional active center of EnvZ (Fig. 1A, active center 2) could be formed and enabled the RU1012 cells to respond to aspartate, exhibiting an ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotype (Fig. 2, column 1). A similar result was previously observed in the complementation experiment between Taz1H1 and Taz1N6 or Taz1G1 (28Yang Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the HAMP linker in each subunit of a sensor dimer in signal transduction, we carried out a complementation assay using Taz1, Tez1A1, and Tez1PQ receptor mutants harboring the H1 or the G405A mutation. Combinations of these receptor mutants would result in sensor proteins with only one functional active center of EnvZ in which the HAMP linker forms a heterodimer with the Tar and EnvZ-type subunits or forms a homodimer with either the Tar or EnvZ-type subunit. Note that all Taz1, Tez1A1, and Tez1PQ homodimers exhibit an aspartate-regulatable phenotype in RU1012 cells (10Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Taz1H1 with Tez1A1(G405A) or Tez1PQ(G405A) in RU1012 cells resulted in an ompC-lacZ “constitutive-on” phenotype (Fig. 2, columns 2 and 3, respectively), whereas co-expression of Taz1(G405A) with Tez1A1H1 or Tez1PQH1 in RU1012 cells led to an ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotype (Fig. 2, columns 4 and 5, respectively). The results of both sets of heterodimer complementation experiments indicate that having different HAMP linkers in the Taz/Tez heterodimer does not interfere with the dimer formation of the downstream EnvZ transmitter module. Importantly, these results also suggest that the different HAMP linkers in the Taz/Tez heterodimer lead to asymmetric activities for the two active centers of EnvZ. The aspartate-regulatable complementation between Taz1(G405A) and Tez1A1H1 or Tez1PQH1 further implies that the HAMP linker of a single subunit of the sensor dimer is sufficient for signal transduction. The Effect of HAMP Linker Mutations on Signal Transduction—Next we examined the effect of mutations in the Tar or EnvZ linker on signal transduction of the linker heterodimers. It has been shown that the A231V mutation in the Tar linker of Taz1 resulted in an ompC-lacZ/constitutive-off/phenotype in RU1012 cells (18Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We introduced this A231V mutation into Taz1H1 and Taz1(G405A) to construct Taz1(A231V/H1) and Taz1(A231V/G405A) and then examined the effect of this mutation on the complementation between Taz1H1 and Tez1A1(G405A) (Fig. 3A, column 2) or between Taz1H1 and Tez1PQ(G405A) (Fig. 3A, column 3) as well as between Taz1(G405A) and Tez1A1H1 (Fig. 3A, column 4) or between Taz1(G405A) and Tez1PQH1 (Fig. 3A, column 5). We found that RU1012 cells co-expressing Taz1(A231V/H1) with Tez1A1(G405A) or Tez1PQ(G405A) retained ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotypes, whereas RU1012 cells co-expressing Taz1(A231V/G405A) with Tez1A1H1 or Tez1PQH1 exhibited ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotypes. Note that without the A231V mutation, co-expression of Taz1(G405A) with Tez1A1H1 (Fig. 2, column 4) or Tez1PQH1 (Fig. 2, column 5) resulted in an ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotype. Therefore, within the Taz/Tez heterodimers, the A231V mutation in the Tar linker of Taz1 affected the function of the EnvZ transmitter domain only when the same subunit (the Taz1 subunit) contributed the conserved autophosphorylation site His residue for the active center. On the other hand, in the case of the Taz1 linker homodimer, co-expression of Taz1(A231V/H1) with Taz1(G405A) (Fig. 3A, column 1) and Taz1(A231V/G405A) with Taz1H1 (Fig. 3A, column 6) both led to ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotypes, indicating that the A231V mutation affects both active centers of EnvZ, no matter in which of the two subunits the mutation is present. By Western blot, we examined the membrane fraction of RU1012 cells co-expressed with Taz1, Tez1A1, or Tez1PQ variants. As shown in Fig. 3B, although we could not distinguish individual receptor variants, both proteins appeared to be expressed in the co-expression system. The membrane fractions of RU1012 cells co-expressed Taz1(A231V/H1) with Tez1A1H1 (lane 4) or Tez1PQH1 (lane 5), and Taz1(A231V/G405A) with Tez1(G405A) (lane 2) or Tez1PQ(G405A) (lane 3) contained more receptor proteins compared with those of RU1012 cells expressing Taz1(A231V/H1) alone (lane 1). Note that all the non-functional sensor proteins were expressed and localized in the membrane at a similar level when individually expressed (data not shown). In addition, using the membrane fractions isolated in lanes 2–5, the kinase activity of EnvZ could be recovered (data not shown). We also introduced the L189D or F220D mutation, known to cause an ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotype in EnvZ (5Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), into the Tez1A1(G405A) or Tez1A1H1 linker (the residue numbers are based on the EnvZ sequence) and re-examined the complementation assay between Tez1A1(G405A) and Taz1H1 or between Tez1A1H1 and Taz1(G405A). Consistent with the observation shown in Fig. 3A, aspartate-regulatable phenotypes were retained when the mutations (L189D in Fig. 3C and F220D in Fig. 3D) were added to Tez1A1H1 forming a heterodimer with Taz1(G405A) (Fig. 3C, column 2, and D, column 2, respectively). These results indicate that the mutations in the Tez1A1 linker have no effect on the function of the EnvZ transmitter module when the Taz1 subunit contributes the conserved His residue for the active center. Similar results were obtained by co-expression of Tez1PQ (L189D/H1 or F220D/H1) with Taz1(G405A) or Tez1PQ (L189D/G405A or F220D/G405A) with Taz1H1 (data not shown). Also, in the case of the linker homodimer, both mutations in the Tez1A1 (L189D in Fig. 3C, columns 3 and 4, and F220D in Fig. 3D, columns 3 and 4) or in the Tez1PQ (data not shown) caused ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotypes, no matter in which of the two subunits the mutations were present. The effect of the linker mutations on the phenotypes of the linker heterodimers supports the notion that the input signal across the membrane can be propagated only through one of the HAMP linkers in a linker heterodimer. There is a possibility that the EnvZ linker interacts directly with the intrasubunit kinase domain to modulate its activity, leading to the observation that mutations at one linker affect the function of EnvZ only in the same subunit. However, this is highly unlikely because the linker mutations affected the phenotypes of the linker homodimers, suggesting that intersubunit interactions in the linker region are responsible for mediating signal transduction through both linkers in a dimer. The fact that both the Tar and EnvZ linkers behave in a similar way in the complementation assays indicates that the structurally conserved HAMP linkers have a similar function in signal transduction. Complementation between Tez1 and Taz1/Tez1A1/Tez1PQ— Unlike Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ, Tez1 in which the sensor module of Tar is connected to the transmitter module of EnvZ through the EnvZ linker could not respond to aspartate and resulted in an ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotype in RU1012 cells (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the phase of the EnvZ linker in Tez1 might be changed in respect to the transmembrane domain of Tar, in turn locking the activities of the EnvZ transmitter module in a lower kinase/phosphatase ratio and resulting in the ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotype. Therefore, it is interesting to test how the EnvZ linker in Tez1 modulates the two active centers of EnvZ in complementation experiments of Tez1 with Taz1, Tez1A1, or Tez1PQ. As shown in Fig. 4A, column 1, co-expressing Tez1(G405A) with Tez1H1 resulted in an ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotype in RU1012 cells. On the other hand, co-expressing Tez1H1 with Taz1(G405A) (Fig. 4A, column 2), Tez1A1(G405A) (column 3), or Tez1PQ(G405A) (column 4) resulted in aspartate-regulatable phenotypes for the first two complementations and a constitutive-on phenotype for the last complementation. At the same time, RU1012 cells harboring Tez1(G405A) with Taz1H1 (Fig. 4A, column 5), Tez1A1H1 (column 6), or Tez1PQH1 (column 7) exhibited a constitutive-on, an aspartate-regulatable, or a constitutive-off phenotype, respectively. It is interesting that although the Tez1 linker is non-functional in the Tez1 homodimer, the signal input could still be transduced through the Taz1 linker in the Taz1/Tez1 heterodimer. It is also intriguing that co-expressing Tez1 with Tez1A1 and co-expressing Tez1 with Tez1PQ in RU1012 cells resulted in different phenotypes. The exact mechanisms for these differences remain to be determined; however, these complementation data indicate that the Tez1 linker and the HAMP linker in Taz1, Tez1A1, or Tez1PQ asymmetrically modulate the two active centers in the downstream EnvZ transmitter module in a linker heterodimer. Next, we examined the effect of the F220D mutation on the complementation of Tez1 with Taz1, Tez1A1, or Tez1PQ. It has been shown that the F220D mutation in Tez1 resulted in an ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotype in RU1012 cells (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of Tez1 linker homodimers, RU1012 cells co-expressing Tez1(F220D/H1) with Tez1(G405A) or Tez1(F220D/G405A) with Tez1H1 exhibited ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotypes (Fig. 4B, columns 1 and 5, respectively). However, in Taz/Tez heterodimers, co-expressing Tez1(F220D/H1) with Taz1(G405A) (Fig. 4B, column 2) led to an ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotype similar to that of the co-expression of Tez1H1 with Taz1(G405A) (Fig. 4A, column 2), indicating that the F220D mutation has no effect on the active center of EnvZ in a linker heterodimer in which Taz1 contributes the conserved His residue. These results further confirm the notion that signal input across the membrane can be transduced only through one of the HAMP linkers in a linker heterodimer. On the other hand, co-expression of Tez1(F220D/H1) with Tez1A1(G405A) (Fig. 4B, column 3) or Tez1PQ(G405A) (column 4) and co-expression of Tez1(F220D/G405A) with Taz1H1 (column 6), Tez1A1H1 (column 7), or Tez1PQH1 (column 8) all resulted in ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotypes. Together with the results obtained in the absence of the F220D mutation (see Fig. 4A), these data suggest that although both Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ are functional hybrid receptors with aspartate-regulatable phenotypes in RU1012 cells, whereas Tez1 is a non-functional receptor with an ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotype, their linkers appear to interact with each other in different manners. However, the F220D mutation may still cause a similar conformational change in all the linkers to block signal transduction, as all of them are derived from EnvZ. Complementation between Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ—To further explore the above notion, we examined the complementation between Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ with or without the L189D and F220D mutations. Co-expressing Tez1A1H1 with Tez1A1(G405A) (Fig. 5, column 1) or Tez1PQH1 with Tez1PQ(G405A) (column 2), which form linker homodimers, resulted in ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotypes in RU1012 cells. The complementation between Tez1A1H1 and Tez1PQ(G405A) (column 3) or between Tez1PQH1 and Tez1A1(G405A) (column 4) led to an ompC-lacZ constitutive-on or an ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotype, respectively. Both L189D and F220D mutations in the Tez1PQH1 linker (Fig. 5, columns 5 and 6) or in the Tez1A1(G405A) linker (columns 7 and 8) could suppress the aspartate-regulatable phenotype, resulting in ompC-lacZ constitutive-on phenotypes. These results further support the notion that in the Tez1/Tez1A1, Tez1/Tez1PQ, or Tez1A1/Tez1PQ heterodimers, intersubunit interactions at the HAMP linker are able to propagate signals through either subunit within a dimer because both subunits have HAMP linkers from the same origin. In this study, we tested the in vivo signaling function of HAMP linker heterodimers and homodimers. Complementation experiments were carried out using Tar-EnvZ hybrid receptor mutants in which the HAMP linker forms a heterodimer with Tar and EnvZ type subunits. The results indicate that the two linkers in a linker heterodimer appear to take two independent conformations in respect to each other and thus differentially modulate the two active centers in the EnvZ transmitter module to result in different in vivo phenotypes. RU1012 cells co-expressing Taz1(G405A) with Tez1A1H1 or co-expressing Taz1(G405A) with Tez1PQH1 could respond to aspartate, leading to ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotypes. The A231V mutation in the Tar linker blocked signal transduction and the L189D/F220D in the Tez1A1 or the Tez1PQ linker had no effect on the aspartate-regulatable phenotypes. This further suggests that in the Taz/Tez heterodimer, signal transduction through the HAMP linker is mediated by one single subunit, the Taz1 subunit, which contributes the conserved His residue for the active center. It is intriguing that, like the co-expression of Taz1(G405A) with Tez1A1H1 or Tez1PQH1, the co-expression of Tez1H1 with Taz1(G405A) led to an ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotype. Incorporation of the F220D mutation in the Tez1H1 linker also had no effect on this aspartate-regulatable phenotype. Note that homodimers of Taz1, Tez1A1, and Tez1PQ are able to respond to aspartate, whereas homodimers of Tez1 are non-functional, exhibiting an ompC-lacZ constitutive-off phenotype in RU1012 cells (10Utsumi R.

A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results support the conclusion that the HAMP linkers in a heterodimer could independently modulate the activities of two downstream active centers of the receptor transmitter module. Interestingly, in the case of linker homodimers, complementing Taz1H1 with Taz1(G405A), Tez1A1H1 with Tez1A1(G405A), and Tez1PQH1 with Tez1PQ(G405A) led to ompC-lacZ aspartate-regulatable phenotypes in RU1012 cells. Incorporation of the HAMP linker mutations in either subunit within these linker homodimers blocked signal transduction, no matter which subunit in a dimer contributed the conserved His residue for the active center. These results indicate that when the two linkers form a homodimer, linker mutations cause a dominant effect on signal transduction, in contrast to the effect of the linker mutations on the linker heterodimers. The complementation experiments between hybrid receptors harboring the EnvZ linker (Tez1) and its variants (Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ) or between Tez1A1 and Tez1PQ further suggest that the signal input cannot be asymmetrically transduced when the HAMP linkers in a dimer are derived from the same origin. Possible intersubunit interactions between the two linkers may prevent the individual linker from functioning independently. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the first time that in a linker heterodimer, signal input from the periplasmic sensor module can be asymmetrically transduced through the linker domain to the transmitter module. However, in normal signal transduction by histidine kinases or receptor proteins, such as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins as seen in a linker homodimer, signal transduction cannot occur asymmetrically through the linker domain because of the interactions between the linkers of both subunits in a dimer. It has been suggested that an intrasubunit asymmetric signal transduction mechanism is adapted by sensor proteins, particularly by Tar, for transmembrane signaling (19Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J.

A piston, rotation, tilt, or combination of those movements may be generated by ligand binding and further transduced across the membrane (19Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol.

It also has been implied that such an intrasubunit asymmetric signal transduction mechanism may apply to signal propagation through the cytoplasmic portion of sensor protein dimers (20Yang Y. Park H. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Gardina P.J. Manson M.D. Science. 1996; 274: 425-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Tatsuno I. Homma M. Oosawa K. Kawagishi I. Science. 1996; 274: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Taz1, when the signal is asymmetrically generated through only one of the two ligand-binding pockets in the Tar receptor domain, the signal-generating subunit appears to be responsible for signal transduction (20Yang Y. Park H. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also, Tar dimers with only one functional cytoplasmic domain are able to respond to aspartate, suggesting that the signal input can be propagated through a single subunit in a dimer (21Gardina P.J. Manson M.D. Science. 1996; 274: 425-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Tatsuno I. Homma M. Oosawa K. Kawagishi I. Science. 1996; 274: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, although these approaches indicate that the intrasubunit signaling is sufficient for the receptor function, it cannot be ruled out that the asymmetric signal across the membrane may be able to be transduced through both subunits in a sensor protein dimer. In Taz1, aspartate-binding site mutations that block signal generation in one subunit caused high basal level ompC-lacZ expression in RU1012 cells for the active center of EnvZ containing the conserved His residue on the same subunit. Therefore, it was not feasible to monitor signal transduction in the non-signal generating subunit. Furthermore, the Tar heterodimer with only one cytoplasmic domain makes it impossible to examine the possible intersubunit signal transduction mechanism. Here, our results demonstrate that although intrasubunit asymmetric signal transduction could occur in a linker heterodimer, it could not be maintained in a linker homodimer because the two HAMP linkers are functionally coupled to convert the asymmetric signal input across the membrane into a symmetric signal affecting both subunits in the cytoplasmic transmitter module. Different models have been proposed for the function of the HAMP linkers as to how they mediate proper signal propagation (3Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The wide distribution of the HAMP linkers in different sensor proteins, together with their structural similarities, suggests that they may share common mechanisms for signal transduction. Our previous study (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) has suggested that specific interactions between the two predicted helices in the HAMP linker are critical for the linker function, as the two helices have to be derived from the same protein for construction of a functional Tar-EnvZ hybrid receptor. A similar conclusion was drawn from a recent report characterizing a set of NarX-NarQ, NarX-CpxA, and NarQ-CpxA hybrid receptors (13Appleman J.A. Chen L.L. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our present data further support the previous proposal that the HAMP linker adapts a four-helix bundle structure in a dimer receptor as shown in Fig. 1A (12Zhu Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The specific interactions between the two helices within one HAMP linker subunit allow a proper signal transduction, whereas the intersubunit interactions within the four-helix bundle enable the signal input to be further propagated in both HAMP linker subunits. An important and unique aspect of histidine kinases and other receptor proteins, such as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, is their need to function as a dimer. The ability of the HAMP linker to modulate the function of the two downstream active centers in a dimmer by converting an asymmetric input signal into a symmetric signal may present a unique mechanism for signal transduction in these sensor proteins.

The core promoter, which lacks a typical TATA motif and has a high GC content, was defined within the –129 bp immediately upstream from the major transcription start site by transient transfection experiments. In this region, we identified four DNA-protein complexes, named A, B, C, and D, by a combination of DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

Vertebrate collagens, a large family of extracellular proteins, are critically important for the formation and function of virtually every organ system (1Vuorio E. de Crombregghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Among them, fibrillar collagen, which includes five different molecular types I, II, III, V, and XI, participates in the formation of fibrils with molecules packed in quarter-staggered arrays (2van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 3Brown J.C. Timpl R. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1995; 107: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The fibrillar collagens are divided into major types (I–III) and minor types (V and XI) based on their relative expression levels. Minor fibrillar collagen types V and XI are incorporated into the fibrils of the much more abundant collagen types I and II, respectively, and act as regulators of the sizes and shapes of the resultant heterotypic fibrils (4Adachi E. Hayashi T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1986; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughn L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J.

The predominant molecular form of type V is the heterotrimer [α1(V)]2α2(V) and is expressed in most tissues (8Burgeson R.E. El Adli F.A. Kaitila I.I. Hollister D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Other forms of type V collagen include the [α1(V)]3 homotrimer that is synthesized in cultures of hamster lung cells (9Haralson M.A. Michell W.M. Rhodes R.K. Kresina T.F. Gay R. Miller E.J. Proc.

Cross-type heterotrimer composed of α2(V) and α1(XI) chains is present in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line A204 and bovine vitreous (13Kleman J.-P. Hartmann D.J. Ramirez F. van der Rest M. Eur. J.

These findings suggest that type V and type XI chains constitute a single collagen type in which different combinations of chains associate in a tissue-specific manner. Recently, a fourth chain, α4(V), expressed in rat Schwann cells was reported (15Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This α chain, which can form molecules with α1(V) and α2(V) chains, seems to be the counterpart of the mouse and human α3(V) chain (16Imamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Type V collagen, which is widely expressed spatially and temporally, is expressed in the mouse embryo as early as 11 days post-coitum (17Wu Y.-L. Sumiyoshi H. Khaleduzzaman M. Ninomiya Y. Yoshioka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Altered production of type V collagen is associated with some connective tissue pathology, such as inflammation, some forms of cancer, and atherosclerosis (18Narayanan A. Engel S. Page R.C.

Characterization of the cis-acting elements and trans-acting nuclear factors that modulate correct patterns of gene expression is necessary for understanding physiological and pathological conditions. Among the collagen genes, the transcriptional regulation of type I collagen has been most extensively studied, showing common features of the proximal promoter and tissue-specific enhancer (21Ramirez F.

J. 1995; 310: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested that the GAGA boxes in the promoter and the first exon of the COL5A1 gene affect the transcription. We have recently characterized the proximal promoter of the COL11A1 (26Matsuo N. Wang Y-H. Sumiyoshi H. Sakata-Takatani K. Nagato H. Sakai K. Sakurai M. Yoshioka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Col5a1 genes (27Sakata-Takatani K. Matsuo N. Sumiyoshi H. Tsuda T. Yoshioka H. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these studies, we demonstrated that the CCAAT binding factor, CBF/NF-Y, bound to the CCAAT motif in the proximal promoter and is involved in activation of the genes. Recently, human and mouse full-length pro-α3(V) sequences were provided (16Imamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These were shown to be closely related to the pro-α1(V) chain. In situ hybridization of mouse embryo detected its expression in epimysial sheaths of developing muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in joints, where it probably forms molecules with α1(V) and α2(V). In the present study, we cloned the human promoter DNA fragment and characterized the core promoter of the α3(V) collagen gene. DNase I footprinting and DNA binding assays have demonstrated four nuclear protein binding sites in the promoter region. Cell transfection experiments showed that one works as an activator and two as repressors. Finally, functional analysis combined with oligonucleotide competition and supershift assays showed that CBF/NF-Y acts as a transcriptional activator of COL5A3. Cells and Cell Culture Conditions—Most of the cell lines used in this study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) cell banks. A204 cells (human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, ATCC HTB-82), HT-1080 cells (human fibrosarcoma cell line, ATCC CCL-121), U251MG cells (human glioblastoma cell line, JCRB, IFO50288), IMR32 cells (human neuroblastoma cell line, ATCC CCL-1277), and A498 cells (human epithelial cell line, ATCC HB-44) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sanko Junyaku, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/air environment. Jurkat cells (human T cell line, ATCC TIB-152) and YST-1 cells, a primary cell line of human Schwannoma cells (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nagashima, Yokohama City University School of Medicine), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the same environment. Isolation of RNA—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified by optical density (A260) and stored at –80 °C until used. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; CBF/NF-Y, CCAAT-binding factor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ss, single-stranded; FP, footprint; wt, wild-type; CEBP, cAMP element-binding protein.-PCR)—The expression of COL5A3 mRNA in various cell lines was investigated by RT-PCR. Three micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed by random hexamer priming using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR using COL5A3-specific primer pairs and glyceraldehide-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers. The primers are listed in Supplemental Materials Table S1. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles using a step cycle of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. The amplified fragment was eluted from the gel and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. Screening Human BAC Library and Cloning of Genomic DNA Fragment—A human genomic BAC library was screened to obtain the COL5A3 genomic fragment using the PCR protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Genome System, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The primers specific for the COL5A3 used in the PCR-based screening are listed in Supplemental Materials Table S1. The DNA from the PCR-positive BAC clone was purified and the sequences at both ends were determined by a direct sequencing method using Sp6 and T7 primers specific for the BAC cloning vector arms. The sequences were compared with those in the EMBO/GenBank™ data base. To obtain a smaller DNA fragment that contains the promoter region of COL5A3, the DNA was digested with ApaI because this restriction site was located just upstream of the initiating ATG codon. The resulting fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript (SK+) vector. The sublibrary was screened by colony hybridization. Rapid Amplification of 5′-cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—The 5′-RACE experiment was carried out according to the method described by Frohman et al. (28Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA from A204 or YST-1 cells was reverse transcribed using the COL5A3-specific primer, RACE1 or RACE3 (Fig. 2C). Homopolymeric dC was added to the 3′-end of the first strand cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in the presence of dCTP. The dC-tailed cDNA was amplified with PCR using a poly(dG) containing the 5′ adapter primer and a 3′ COL5A3-specific primer, RACE2 or RACE4, which was located just upstream of RACE1 or RACE3, respectively (Fig. 2C). PCR was carried out for 35 cycles using a step cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 72 °C for 8 min. The 5′-RACE products were purified by electrophoresis on a 4% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, and then subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing. In Vitro Transcription and RNase Protection Assay—RNase protection assays were carried out to confirm the transcription initiation sites. A 252-bp genomic fragment, containing putative transcription initiation sites from the data of the 5′-RACE experiment, was generated by PCR. This PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, followed by digestion with EcoRI, and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript (SK+) vector. After linearization with BamHI, the antisense riboprobe was synthesized using the in vitro transcription kit, MAXIscript (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer's instructions. This riboprobe was examined by 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, and the full-length riboprobe was recovered from the gel. RNase protection analysis was performed using a ribonuclease protection assay kit, RPAIII (Ambion), following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 μg of total RNA isolated from A204 or YST-1 cells and 8 × 104 cpm of riboprobe were dissolved in 10 μl of hybridization buffer and incubated overnight at 42 °C. After digestion with the RNase A/T1 mixture, protected RNA fragments were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. As a size marker, 32P-end-labeled ϕX174 DNA/HaeIII marker was loaded onto the same gel. After the run had finished, the gel was transferred onto 3MM paper (Whatman) and dried under vacuum. The dried gel was visualized by autoradiography using a Bio Imaging Analyzer FLA-5000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Construction of Chimeric Plasmids—The ApaI genomic fragment corresponding to the region from –1785 to +112 bp of the COL5A3 was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). To generate the 5′ stepwise deletion constructs, PCR procedures were applied. PCR was performed using sets of oligonucleotide primers that are SacI site-linked 5′ and HindIII site-linked 3′ primers specific for the COL5A3 sequence and the pGL3–1785/+109 plasmid as a template. These PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, followed by digestion with SacI and HindIII, and subcloned into the SacI/HindIII site of pGL3-Basic vector. Internal deletion and substitution mutation constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the pGL3–310/+109 plasmid as a template. The primers used in the PCR amplification are listed in Supplemental Materials Table S1. The PCR products were digested with endonuclease, followed by self-ligation. All mutagenesis plasmids were digested with SacI and HindIII and re-cloned into the SacI/HindIII site of pGL3-Basic vector. Construction of the dominant negative CBF-B/NF-YA was generated by RT-PCR as previously described (26Matsuo N. Wang Y-H. Sumiyoshi H. Sakata-Takatani K. Nagato H. Sakai K. Sakurai M. Yoshioka H. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Transient transfection experiments were carried out using A204 and YST-1 cells. The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 per 35-mm dish ∼18 h before transfection. For transient transfection, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into these cells by using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent system (Invitrogen). Plasmid pRL-TK vector (Promega) was always cotransfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After an additional cultivation for 48 h, the transfected cells were harvested, lysed, centrifuged to pellet the debris, and subjected to luciferase assay. Luciferase activities were measured as chemiluminescence in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cotransfection experiments with a mutant type of CBF-B/NF-YA subunit expression vector were performed as previously described (26Matsuo N. Wang Y-H. Sumiyoshi H. Sakata-Takatani K. Nagato H. Sakai K. Sakurai M. Yoshioka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Sakata-Takatani K. Matsuo N. Sumiyoshi H. Tsuda T. Yoshioka H. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All transfections were repeated in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts from A204 and YST-1 cells were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells, 1 × 108, were scraped in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 × g, and washed with PBS before being recentrifuged. The pellets were resuspended in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, and homogenized. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by resuspension in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) and mixed by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C until used. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNase I Footprinting Assay—Probes for DNase I footprinting were generated by PCR amplification using sets of oligonucleotides that are SacI site-linked 5′ and HindIII site-linked 3′ primers specific for COL5A3, and all PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. These plasmids were digested with HindIII and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment to fill in the HindIII overhanging sites. After digestion with SacI, these probes were examined by a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and 3′ end-labeled probes were recovered from the gel. DNase I footprinting was performed according to the protocol described by Galas and Schmitz (31Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the 3′ end-labeled probe (50,000 cpm) was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with 50 μg of nuclear extracts (or bovine serum albumin as control) in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC). After the addition of 5 units of DNase I (or 0.1 unit with bovine serum albumin as control) to the mixture, the incubation was continued for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of a stop buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 μg of yeast tRNA), and DNA fragments were subsequently extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol before being loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred onto 3 MM paper, dried, and exposed to a BioImaging Analyzer FLA-5000. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Wild-type and mutant probes used for EMSA were generated by PCR using each set of HindIII site-linked primers, and all PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. All plasmids were digested with HindIII and the digested fragments were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment to fill in the HindIII overhanging sites. The binding reaction was carried out for 30 min at 25 °C in 25 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 250 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol) containing 20,000–30,000 cpm of labeled probe, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5–15 μg of nuclear extracts. For the competition assays, double strand oligonucleotides containing a consensus CBF, CBF mutant, NF-1, CEBP, GATA-1, c-Myb, and MEF-1 binding site were generated by annealing equimolar complementary oligonucleotides. The consensus sequences are shown in Fig. 7A. For the supershift assay, anti-CBF-A/NF-YB, anti-CBF-B/NF-YA, anti-CBF-C/NF-YC, anti-NF-1, anti-CEBP, and anti-GATA-1 polyclonal antibodies and preimmune goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were purchased. For these interference assays, 5–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor or 2 μg of antibody was added to the reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of radiolabeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in a 0.25× Tris borate electrophoresis buffer at 200 V. Following completion of running, the gel was transferred onto 3MM paper and dried under vacuum. The dried gel was visualized by autoradiography using a BioImaging Analyzer FLA-5000. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assay—CHIP assays were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, A204 and YST-1 cells were inoculated at a density of 5 × 106 per 100-mm dish. The cells were fixed in a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, cells were removed from dishes in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and sonicated four times for 10 s yielding DNA fragments 200–1000 bp in size. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in CHIP dilution buffer, precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry, and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured on the ssDNA/protein A-agarose slurry, and washed with low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, and LiCl wash buffer and finally washed twice with TE buffer. The immunocomplexes were eluted by incubation for 15 min at 25 °C with 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol). To reverse the cross-linking of DNA, the elutes were treated with 8 μlof5 m NaCl and incubated for 4 h at 65 °C, followed by treatment with proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C. The DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. PCR were carried out for 40 cycles using a step cycle of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 8 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. DNA Sequencing—Nucleotide sequences were determined by automated DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). RNA Expression of COL5A3 in Cultured Cells—Initially, we examined the expression of the COL5A3 in various culture cells using the RT-PCR technique. As shown in Fig. 1, the predicted band of 295 bp was observed in YST-1 (strong) and A204 (weak) cells. The PCR products were verified by nucleotide sequence to confirm the specificity of the amplified COL5A3 sequence. By contrast, the band was not detected in HT1080, Jurkat, U251MG, IMR32, and A498 cells. From these results, we decided to use A204 and YST-1 cell lines for the analysis of the COL5A3 promoter. Structural Analysis of the 5′ Portion of COL5A3—To obtain the COL5A3 genomic fragment, we screened a human genomic BAC library by PCR, and isolated one positive clone, 218M16. Compared with the EMBO/GenBank™ data base, DNA sequences of both ends of the clone were identical with those of two clones, AC008742 and AC020931, in chromosome 19 of Homo sapiens. From the data base, this BAC genomic fragment, which was ∼141 kb in size, contained the promoter region and both exons and introns 1–32 of COL5A3 (Fig. 2A). To subclone a DNA fragment containing the promoter region, the BAC genomic fragment was digested with ApaI endonuclease and subcloned into the pBluescript (SK+) vector. The sublibrary was screened by colony hybridization and the insert DNA of the positive clone was sequenced using COL5A3-specific or vector-specific primers. As a result, a 1897-bp genomic fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of COL5A3 was isolated (Fig. 2B). To determine the transcription initiation sites of COL5A3, 5′-RACE experiments and RNase protection assays were performed. The 5′-RACE was carried out using total RNA derived from A204 and YST-1 cells. Sixteen independent clones, eight clones from A204 cells and eight clones from YST-1 cells, were selected and sequenced. As shown in Fig. 2C, the 5′-ends of the COL5A3 cDNA were located at 113 to 119 bp upstream from the initiating ATG codon, and 13 of the 16 RACE products were generated from the same position, which suggested that the major transcription initiation site is located 119 bp upstream from the initiating ATG codon. On the basis of these data, we also performed RNase protection assays to confirm the transcription initiation sites. In this experiment, we used a 357-nucleotide riboprobe spanning nucleotides containing the putative transcription initiation site, and at least two specific protected bands were observed in both A204 and YST-1 cells (Fig. 2D). The protected bands were about 115 and 100 nucleotides in size, and the larger protected band corresponded to the results of the 5′-RACE. Therefore, we concluded that COL5A3 contains at least two transcription initiation sites and that the major transcription initiation site is located 119 bp upstream from the initiating ATG codon. The COL5A3 promoter also lacks a canonical TATA box and has a high GC content. Functional Analysis of the COL5A3 Promoter Region—To define the proximal regulatory regions in the COL5A3 promoter, a series of chimeric constructs containing progressive 5′ end and internal deletions linked to the luciferase gene were transfected into A204 and YST-1 cells (Fig. 3A), and luciferase assays were carried out. The longest construct, pGL3–1785/+109, derived from a 1.9-kb genomic fragment of the 5′-flanking region of COL5A3, had strong transcriptional activity. The activity of each construct was compared with this construct. As shown in Fig. 3B, deletion from –1785 to –129 bp had no significant change on luciferase activity; however, deletion to –40 bp resulted in a significantly lower luciferase activity compared with that of pGL3–1785/+109, and deletion to the +3 bp showed almost complete loss of luciferase activity in both A204 and YST-1 cells. In addition, the deletion mutant of pGL3–310/+109(del–129/+2), which is deleted between –129 and +2, also showed a significantly lower luciferase activity in both cells. These results indicate that the region between the –129 and +2 bp is important for basal transcriptional activity of the COL5A3 promoter. Identification of Nuclear Factor Binding Sites in the Core Promoter of the COL5A3—To identify transcription factor binding sites on the proximal promoter region of COL5A3, we initially performed DNase I footprinting. Two different probes, which contain the region from the –160 to –51 bp (Fig. 4A) and from the –96 to +30 bp (Fig. 4B), were used in this experiment. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, two protected regions, FP (footprint) 1 in the –124 to –117 bp, and FP2 in the –69 to –63 bp regions, were"
