https://openalex.org/W4308437988,"Low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols are small-molecule antioxidants required for the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis. However, many host-associated microbes, including the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, unexpectedly lack LMW-thiol biosynthetic pathways. Using reactivity-guided metabolomics, we identified the unusual LMW thiol ergothioneine (EGT) in H. pylori. Dietary EGT accumulates to millimolar levels in human tissues and has been broadly implicated in mitigating disease risk. Although certain microorganisms synthesize EGT, we discovered that H. pylori acquires this LMW thiol from the host environment using a highly selective ATP-binding cassette transporter-EgtUV. EgtUV confers a competitive colonization advantage in vivo and is widely conserved in gastrointestinal microbes. Furthermore, we found that human fecal bacteria metabolize EGT, which may contribute to production of the disease-associated metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide. Collectively, our findings illustrate a previously unappreciated mechanism of microbial redox regulation in the gut and suggest that inter-kingdom competition for dietary EGT may broadly impact human health."
https://openalex.org/W4308648934,"Maternal health is an important aspect of women's health during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Specifically, during pregnancy, different health factors like age, blood disorders, heart rate, etc. can lead to pregnancy complications. Detecting such health factors can alleviate the risk of pregnancy-related complications. This study aims to develop an artificial neural network-based system for predicting maternal health risks using health data records. A novel deep neural network architecture, DT-BiLTCN is proposed that uses decision trees, a bidirectional long short-term memory network, and a temporal convolutional network. Experiments involve using a dataset of 1218 samples collected from maternal health care, hospitals, and community clinics using the IoT-based risk monitoring system. Class imbalance is resolved using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. DT-BiLTCN provides a feature set to obtain high accuracy results which in this case are provided by the support vector machine with a 98% accuracy. Maternal health exploratory data analysis reveals that the health conditions which are the strongest indications of health risk during pregnancy are diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and age of pregnant women. Using the proposed model, timely prediction of health risks associated with pregnant women can be made thus mitigating the risk of health complications which helps to save lives."
https://openalex.org/W4309077888,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for regulating various DNA-templated processes. Here, we report the existence of a histone PTM in mammalian cells, namely histone H3 with hydroxylation of proline at residue 16 (H3P16oh), which is catalyzed by the proline hydroxylase EGLN2. We show that H3P16oh enhances direct binding of KDM5A to its substrate, histone H3 with trimethylation at the fourth lysine residue (H3K4me3), resulting in enhanced chromatin recruitment of KDM5A and a corresponding decrease of H3K4me3 at target genes. Genome- and transcriptome-wide analyses show that the EGLN2-KDM5A axis regulates target gene expression in mammalian cells. Specifically, our data demonstrate repression of the WNT pathway negative regulator DKK1 through the EGLN2-H3P16oh-KDM5A pathway to promote WNT/β-catenin signaling in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study characterizes a regulatory mark in the histone code and reveals a role for H3P16oh in regulating mammalian gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W4308525289,"Osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone tumor, is an aggressive heterogeneous malignancy defined by complex chromosomal aberrations. Overall survival rates remain at ~70%, but patients with chemoresistant or metastatic disease have extremely poor outcomes of <30%. A subgroup of tumors harbor amplification of chromosome 8q24.2 and increased expression of the oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation-1 (PVT-1), which is associated with an extremely poor clinical prognosis. This study demonstrates that PVT-1 is critical for osteosarcoma tumor-initiation potential. Chromatin Hybridization by RNA Purification analysis identified Tripartite-Motif Containing Family 28 (TRIM28) as a novel PVT-1 binding partner. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed the PVT-1/TRIM28 complex binds and increases SUMOylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (Vps34), which leads to enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of tumor suppressor complex 2 (TSC2), thus contributing to increased self-renewal and stem cell phenotypes. Furthermore, we identified that osteosarcoma cells with increased PVT-1 have enhanced sensitivity to the SUMOylation inhibitor, TAK-981. Altogether, this study elucidated a role for PVT-1 in the enhancement of cancer stem-like behaviors, including migration and invasion, in osteosarcoma, and identified the novel PVT-1/TRIM28 axis signaling cascade as a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4308526988,"A broad set of factors are associated with falling (e.g., age, sex, physical activity, vision, health), but their co-occurrence is understudied. Our objectives were to quantify the number and pattern of co-occurring fall-related factors. Data were obtained from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 1,957, 60-85 years). Twenty fall-related factors were included (based on previous research), covering a wide range including cognitive, motor, sensory, health, and physical activity measures. The number and pattern of co-occurring fall-related factors were quantified with logistic regression and cluster analyses, respectively. Most participants (59%) had ≥4 fall-risk factors, and each additional risk factor increased the odds of reporting difficulty with falling by 1.28. The identified clusters included: (1) healthy, (2) cognitive and sensory impaired, and (3) health impaired. The mean number of co-occurring fall-related factors was 3.7, 3.8, and 7.2, for clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p&lt;0.001). These observations indicate that co-occurrence of multiple fall-risk factors was common in this national sample of U.S. older adults and the factors tended to aggregate into distinct clusters. The findings support the protective effect of physical activity on fall-risk, the association between gait speed and falls, and the detrimental effect of health-related factors on difficulty with falls (e.g., arthritis, prescription medications). Cluster analyses revealed a complex interplay between sex and BMI that may alter the role of BMI in the etiology of falls. Cluster analyses also revealed a large detrimental effect of health-related factors in cluster 3; it is important to extend current fall interventions (typically focused on balance, flexibility, strength, cognitive, fear factors) to include health-related interventions that target factors such as BMI and arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W4308575294,"Background With limited national studies available, we characterized the association of frailty with outcomes of surgical resection for colonic volvulus. Methods Adults with sigmoid or cecal volvulus undergoing non-elective colectomy were identified in the 2010–2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was identified using the Johns Hopkins indicator which utilizes administrative codes. Multivariable models were developed to examine the association of frailty with in-hospital mortality, perioperative complications, stoma use, length of stay, hospitalization costs, non-home discharge, and 30-day non-elective readmissions. Results An estimated 66,767 patients underwent resection for colonic volvulus (Sigmoid: 39.6%; Cecal: 60.4%). Using the Johns Hopkins indicator, 30.3% of patients with sigmoid volvulus and 15.9% of those with cecal volvulus were considered frail. After adjustment, frail patients had higher risk of mortality compared to non-frail in both sigmoid (10.6% [95% CI 9.47–11.7] vs 5.7% [95% CI 5.2–6.2]) and cecal (10.4% [95% CI 9.2–11.6] vs 3.5% [95% CI 3.2–3.8]) volvulus cohorts. Frailty was associated with greater odds of acute venous thromboembolism occurrences (Sigmoid: AOR 1.50 [95% CI 1.18–1.94]; Cecal: AOR 2.0 [95% CI 1.50–2.72]), colostomy formation (Sigmoid: AOR 1.73 [95% CI 1.57–1.91]; Cecal: AOR 1.48 [95% CI 1.10–2.00]), non-home discharge (Sigmoid: AOR 1.97 [95% CI 1.77–2.20]; Cecal: AOR 2.56 [95% CI 2.27–2.89]), and 30-day readmission (Sigmoid: AOR 1.15 [95% CI 1.01–1.30]; Cecal: AOR 1.26 [95% CI 1.10–1.45]). Frailty was associated with incremental increase in length of stay (Sigmoid: +3.4 days [95% CI 2.8–3.9]; Cecal: +3.8 days [95% CI 3.3–4.4]) and costs (Sigmoid: +$7.5k [95% CI 5.9–9.1]; Cecal: +$12.1k [95% CI 10.1–14.1]). Conclusion Frailty, measured using a simplified administrative tool, is associated with significantly worse clinical and financial outcomes following non-elective resections for colonic volvulus. Standard assessment of frailty may aid risk-stratification, better inform shared-decision making, and guide healthcare teams in targeted resource allocation in this vulnerable patient population."
https://openalex.org/W4308575300,"Serum prealbumin level is slightly higher, whereas albumin is lower in peritoneal dialysis (PD) than hemodialysis (HD) patients. It is unknown whether albumin to prealbumin ratio (APR) is associated with mortality risk among PD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of APR and its prediction value on long-term outcomes of PD patients.The study population were prevalent PD patients at a tertiary hospital. Based on APR, a total of 220 PD patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1: top tertile, median APR: 121.1; IQR:109.5-131.9 (n = 73, male: 37%; age: 59±13); group 2: middle tertile, median APR: 97.1; IQR 93.5-100.0 (n = 73, male:37%; age: 54±14), and group3: bottom tertile, median APR: 81.3; IQR:76.8-85.0 (n = 74, male:38%; 54±11). Patients were followed up for a maximum of 5 years. Outcome of interest was all-cause mortality.Group 1 was characterized by older age, higher prevalence of diabetes, lower nPCR, higher Davies score and hs-CRP level. APR positively correlated to hs-CRP (β = 0.149, p = 0.045), but negatively correlated to nPCR (β = -0.161, p = 0.034). Hyperprealbuminemia, accounting for 0%, 23.3%, and 82.4% in groups 1,2, and 3, was associated with a lower risk for mortality (HR:0.41, 95%CI = 0.23-0.73). The cumulative survival is significantly lower in group 1 than the other two groups. By multivariable Cox regression, APR (HR:1.02; 95%CI:1.01-1.03) was found to be an independent predictor of long-term mortality.PD patients with high APR are characterized by having more comorbidities and marked malnutrition-inflammation status, and are associated with long-term mortality, whereas hyperprealbuminemia and lower APR are favorable prognostic factors."
https://openalex.org/W4308650988,"The mitochondrial translocator protein (18 kDa; TSPO) is a high-affinity cholesterol-binding protein that is an integral component of the cholesterol trafficking scaffold responsible for determining the rate of cholesterol import into the mitochondria for steroid biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that TSPO declines in aging Leydig cells (LCs) and that its decline is associated with depressed circulating testosterone levels in aging rats. However, TSPO's role in the mechanistic decline in LC function is not fully understood. To address the role of TSPO depletion in LC function, we first examined mitochondrial quality in Tspo knockout mouse tumor MA-10 nG1 LCs compared to wild-type MA-10 cells. Tspo deletion caused a disruption in mitochondrial function and membrane dynamics. Increasing mitochondrial fusion via treatment with the mitochondrial fusion promoter M1 or by optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) overexpression resulted in the restoration of mitochondrial function and mitochondrial morphology as well as in steroid formation in TSPO-depleted nG1 LCs. LCs isolated from aged rats form less testosterone than LCs isolated from young rats. Treatment of aging LCs with M1 improved mitochondrial function and increased androgen formation, suggesting that aging LC dysfunction may stem from compromised mitochondrial dynamics caused by the age-dependent LC TSPO decline. These results, taken together, suggest that maintaining or enhancing mitochondrial fusion may provide therapeutic strategies to maintain or restore testosterone levels with aging."
https://openalex.org/W4308654369,"The emergence of genetic data coupled to longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) offers the possibility of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). In PheWAS, the whole phenome can be divided into numerous phenotypic categories according to the genetic architecture across phenotypes. Currently, statistical analyses for PheWAS are mainly univariate analyses, which test the association between one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. In this article, we derived a novel and powerful multivariate method for PheWAS. The proposed method involves three steps. In the first step, we apply the bottom-up hierarchical clustering method to partition a large number of phenotypes into disjoint clusters within each phenotypic category. In the second step, the clustering linear combination method is used to combine test statistics within each category based on the phenotypic clusters and obtain p-values from each phenotypic category. In the third step, we propose a new false discovery rate (FDR) control approach. We perform extensive simulation studies to compare the performance of our method with that of other existing methods. The results show that our proposed method controls FDR very well and outperforms other methods we compared with. We also apply the proposed approach to a set of EMR-based phenotypes across more than 300,000 samples from the UK Biobank. We find that the proposed approach not only can well-control FDR at a nominal level but also successfully identify 1,244 significant SNPs that are reported to be associated with some phenotypes in the GWAS catalog. Our open-access tools and instructions on how to implement HCLC-FC are available at https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/HCLCFC."

https://openalex.org/W4308623246,"This study contributes to the emerging literature on public perceptions of neurotechnological devices (NTDs) in their medical and non-medical applications, depending on their invasiveness, framing effects, and interindividual differences related to personal needs and values. We conducted two web-based between-subject experiments (2×2×2) using a representative, nation-wide sample of the adult population in Germany. Using vignettes describing how two NTDs, brain stimulation devices (BSDs; NExperiment 1 = 1,090) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs; NExperiment 2 = 1,089), function, we randomly varied the purpose (treatment vs. enhancement) and invasiveness (noninvasive vs. invasive) of the NTD, and assessed framing effects (variable order of assessing moral acceptability first vs. willingness to use first). We found a moderate moral acceptance and willingness to use BSDs and BCIs. Respondents preferred treatment over enhancement purposes and noninvasive over invasive devices. We also found a framing effect and explored the role of personal characteristics as indicators of personal needs and values (e.g., stress, religiosity, and gender). Our results suggest that the future demand for BSDs or BCIs may depend on the purpose, invasiveness, and personal needs and values. These insights can inform technology developers about the public's needs and concerns, and enrich legal and ethical debates."
https://openalex.org/W4308623293,"Hypertension appears to be one of the commonest comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, although whether hypertensive individuals have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with non-hypertensives is unclear. It is also unclear whether the absolute level of systolic blood pressure, or the type of anti-hypertensive medication is related to this risk. Analyses were conducted using data from the UK Biobank and linked health records. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the impact of hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and medications on the risk of severe COVID-19. 16,134 individuals tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, 22% (n = 3,584) developed severe COVID-19 and 40% (n = 6,517) were hypertensive. Hypertension was associated with 22% higher odds of severe COVID-19 (Odds ratio (OR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.33), compared with normotension after adjusting for confounding variables. In those taking anti-hypertensive medications, elevated SBP showed a dose-response relationship with severe COVID-19 (150-159mmHg versus 120-129mmHg (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.44, 2.53), &gt;180+mmHg versus 120-129mmHg (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.06, 3.51)). SBP &lt;120mmHg was associated with greater odds of severe COVID-19 (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.11, 1.78). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers were not associated with altered risk of severe COVID-19. Hypertension is an important risk factor for COVID-19. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is warranted in case of more severe strains or other viruses in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4308623414,"Automation has played a key role in improving the safety, accuracy, and efficiency of manufacturing and industrial processes and has the potential to greatly increase throughput in the life sciences. However, the lack of accessible entry-point automation hardware in life science research and STEM education hinders its widespread adoption and development for life science applications. Here we investigate the design of a low-cost (~$150) open-source DIY Arduino-controlled liquid handling robot (LHR) featuring plastic laser-cut parts. The robot moves in three axes with 0.5 mm accuracy and reliably dispenses liquid down to 20 μL. The open source, modular design allows for flexibility and easy modification. A block-based programming interface (Snap4Arduino) further extends the accessibility of this robot, encouraging adaptation and use by educators, hobbyists and beginner programmers. This robot was co-designed with teachers, and we detail the teachers' feedback in the context of a qualitative study. We conclude that affordable and accessible LHRs similar to this one could provide a useful educational tool to be deployed in classrooms, and LHR-based curricula may encourage interest in STEM and effectively introduce automation technology to life science enthusiasts."
https://openalex.org/W4308654638,"The reprocessing of daily used medical devices is often inadequate, making them a potential source of infection. In addition, there are usually no consistent and technically standardized procedures available for this purpose. Hence, the aim of this study is to analyze the bacterial contamination and the effectiveness of Ultraviolet light-based (UV light-based) reprocessing of daily used medical devices.Six different everyday medical devices (20 each; stethoscopes, tourniquets, bandage scissors, reflex hammers, tuning forks, and nystagmus glasses) were tested for bacterial contamination. All medical devices were then exposed to UV-C light for 25 seconds. Medical devices with a smooth surface were pre-cleaned with a water-based wipe. Contact samples were taken before and after reprocessing.Immediately after clinical use, 104 of 120 contact samples showed an average bacterial contamination of 44.8±64.3 colony forming units (CFU) (0-300 CFU), also including potentially pathogenic bacteria. Two further culture media were completely overgrown with potentially pathogenic bacteria. The stethoscopes were found to have the highest average contamination of 90±91.6 CFU. After reprocessing, 118 of 120 samples were sterile, resulting in an average residual contamination of 0.02±0.1 CFU in two samples, whereby only bacteria of the ordinary skin flora were found.The present study shows the potentially clinically relevant bacterial contamination of everyday used medical devices. The reprocessing method tested here using UV light appears to be a suitable method for disinfection, especially for objects that up to now have been difficult to disinfect or cannot be disinfected in a standardized manner."
https://openalex.org/W4308679231,"β1 integrins are important in blood vessel formation and function, finely tuning the adhesion of endothelial cells to each other and to the extracellular matrix. The role of integrins in the vascular disease, cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) has yet to be explored in vivo. Endothelial loss of the gene KRIT1 leads to brain microvascular defects, resulting in debilitating and often fatal consequences. We tested administration of a monoclonal antibody that enforces the active β1 integrin conformation, (clone 9EG7), on a murine neonatal CCM mouse model, Krit1flox/flox ;Pdgfb-iCreERT2 (Krit1ECKO ), and on KRIT1-silenced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, endothelial deletion of the master regulator of integrin activation, Talin 1 (Tln1), in Krit1ECKO mice was performed to assess the effect of completely blocking endothelial integrin activation on CCM. Treatment with 9EG7 reduced lesion burden in the Krit1ECKO model and was accompanied by a strong reduction in the phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate, myosin light chain (pMLC), in both retina and brain endothelial cells. Treatment of KRIT1-silenced HUVECs with 9EG7 in vitro stabilized cell-cell junctions. Overnight treatment of HUVECs with 9EG7 resulted in significantly reduced total surface expression of β1 integrin, which was associated with reduced pMLC levels, supporting our in vivo findings. Genetic blockade of integrin activation by Tln1ECKO enhanced bleeding and did not reduce CCM lesion burden in Krit1ECKO mice. In sum, targeting β1 integrin with an activated-specific antibody reduces acute murine CCM lesion development, which we found to be associated with suppression of endothelial ROCK activity."
https://openalex.org/W4308532635,"Extensive protein synthesis is necessary for uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation, requiring hyperactive ribosome biogenesis. Our previous Pan-cancer study has identified EXOSC8 as a potential copy number variation (CNV)-driven rRNA metabolism-related oncogene in colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we further investigated proliferation-prompting functions and mechanisms of EXOSC8 in CRC by performing in silico analyses and wet-lab experiments. We uncovered that increased EXOSC8 expression and CNV levels are strongly associated with ribosome biogenesis-related factor levels in CRC, including ribosome proteins (RPs), eukaryotic translation initiation factors and RNA polymerase I/III. EXOSC8 silence decreases nucleolar protein and proliferation marker levels, as well as rRNA/DNA and global protein syntheses. Clinically, EXOSC8 is upregulated across human cancers, particularly CNV-driven upregulation in CRC was markedly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, EXOSC8 knockdown increased p53 levels in CRC, and the oncogenic proliferation phenotypes of EXOSC8 depended on p53 in vitro and in vivo. We discovered that EXOSC8 knockdown in CRC cells triggers ribosomal stress, nucleolar RPL5/11 being released into the nucleoplasm and ""hijacking"" Mdm2 to block its E3 ubiquitin ligase function, thus releasing and activating p53. Furthermore, our therapeutic experiments provided initial evidence that EXOSC8 might serve as a potential therapeutic target in CRC. Our findings revealed, for the first time, that the RNA exosome gene (EXOSC8) promotes CRC tumorigenesis by regulating cancer-related ribosome biogenesis in CRC. This study further extends our previous Pan-cancer study of the rRNA metabolism-related genes. The inhibition of EXOSC8 is a novel therapeutic strategy for the RPs-Mdm2-p53 ribosome biogenesis surveillance pathway in CRC."

The acceptability of the HOPE tool was investigated using patient vignettes drawn from clinical practice.177 GPs responded. 88 (49.71%) reported that they were comfortable asking patients about spiritual health. GPs felt most comfortable raising the topic after a patient cue (mean difference between pre and post cue 26%). The HOPE tool was viewed as acceptable to use with patients by 65% of participants, although its limitations were acknowledged. Qualitative data showed concerns about regulator (the GMC) and peer disapproval were major barriers to discussions, especially in the case of discordance between patient and doctor background.Only half of GPs are comfortable discussing spiritual health. Dedicated training, using a structured approach, with regulatory approval, may help overcome barriers to GPs discussing spiritual health. Further research into the benefits, and risks, of discussion of spiritual health in the GP consultation is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4308576609,"Repellents serve an important role in bite protection. Tick repellents largely rely on biomechanisms that induce responses with direct contact, but synthetic pyrethroids used as spatial repellents against insects have received recent attention for potential use in tick protection systems. An in vitro vertical climb assay was designed to assess spatial repellency against Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum , and Ixodes scapularis adult, female ticks. Climbing behavior was assessed with and without the presence of two spatial repellents, transfluthrin and metofluthrin. Repellency parameters were defined to simulate the natural questing behavior of ambushing ticks, including measures of detachment, pseudo-questing duration, climbing deterrence, and activity. Significant effects were observed within each parameter. D . variabilis showed the greatest general susceptibility to each repellent, followed by A . americanum , and I . scapularis . The most important and integrative measure of repellency was climbing deterrence–a measure of the spatial repellent’s ability to disrupt a tick’s natural propensity to climb. Transfluthrin deterred 75% of D . variabilis , 67% of A . americanum , and 50% of I . scapularis . Metofluthrin was slightly more effective, deterring 81% of D . variabilis , 73% of A . americanum , and 72% of I . scapularis . The present study poses a novel paradigm for repellency and reports a preliminary assessment of spatial repellent effect on tick behavior. Further research will assess spatial repellency in a more natural setting, scale exposure conditions, and incorporate host cues."

https://openalex.org/W4308623265,"Segregation of adult males from adult females and immature animals is known to occur in some beluga whale populations, but it is unclear if such segregation occurs in Hudson Bay, where the largest summering population in the world is found. Using imagery from a photographic aerial survey conducted in August 2015, we examined spatial distribution by age class with respect to several environmental variables near two of three main estuaries, Churchill and Seal River, used by Western Hudson Bay belugas in the summer season. Belugas photographed during aerial surveys were classified by age manually using an identification decision tree, and GPS coordinates of their locations were plotted in ArcGIS. Distribution by age class was examined in relation to five habitat characteristics: distance to coastal habitat, bathymetry, sea surface temperature, and extent of river plume. Habitat characteristics and the proportion of animals by age classes were similar in both estuaries, indicating no segregation, and suggesting the environmental data assessed were not associated with patterns of distribution and density of age classes at the spatial and temporal scale being investigated. Overall density of calves was almost three times higher at the Seal River; however, suggesting this location may be preferred for calf rearing in the summer season. Results provide a greater understanding of spatial patterns of beluga whale habitat use in western Hudson Bay, and information useful in conservation and management advice."
https://openalex.org/W4308623340,"Since early March 2020, government agencies have utilized a wide variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and have struggled to determine when it is appropriate to return to in-person activities after an outbreak is detected. At many universities, fundamental issues related to understanding the spread of the disease (e.g. the transmission rate), the ability of administrators to respond quickly enough by closing when there is a sudden rise in cases, and how to make a decision on when to reopen remains a concern. Surveillance testing strategies have been implemented in some places, and those test outcomes have dictated whether to reopen, to simultaneously monitor community spread, and/or to isolate discovered cases. However, the question remains as to when it is safe to reopen and how much testing is required to remain safely open while keeping infection numbers low. Here, we propose an extension of the classic SIR model to investigate reopening strategies for a fixed testing strategy, based on feedback from testing results. Specifically, we close when a predefined proportion of the population becomes infected, and later reopen when that infected proportion decreases below a predefined threshold. A valuable outcome of our approach is that our reopening strategies are robust to variation in almost all model parameters, including transmission rates, which can be extremely difficult to determine as they typically differ between variants, location, vaccination status, etc. Thus, these strategies can be, in theory, translated over to new variants in different regions of the world. Examples of robust feedback strategies for high disease transmission and a fixed testing capacity include (1) a single long lock down followed by a single long in-person period, and (2) multiple shorter lock downs followed by multiple shorter in-person periods. The utility of this approach of having multiple strategies is that administrators of universities, schools, business, etc. can use a strategy that is best adapted for their own functionality."

Young people in sub-Saharan Africa experience significant adversities and systemic challenges despite technological advancements and demographic transition that the region is experiencing. We examined the nexus between experiences of loneliness, low social support, and presence of suicidal ideation among in-school adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Method A total of 19,119 in-school adolescents from eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa were included in this study. Suicidal ideation was the main outcome variable and loneliness, and social support were the explanatory variables. Percentages were used to summarise the prevalence of suicidal ideation, loneliness, and social support among the in-school adolescents. A multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was later used to determine the association between suicidal ideation and the explanatory variables and covariates using Stata v16. Four models were tested using the regression analysis. We presented the regression results using adjusted odds ratios (aOR), with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Overall, the past year prevalence of loneliness, peer support, one or more close friends, and suicidal ideation were 10%, 33.4%, 90.1%, and 14.5%, respectively. In-school adolescents who felt lonely (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.69, 2.09) were more likely to experience suicidal ideation. However, those who received peer support (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.97) and had one or more close friends (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.68, 0.86) were less likely to experience suicidal ideation. Conclusion These results point to the significant roles of loneliness, and lack of social support, in understanding suicidal ideations. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa need to improve child and adolescent mental health policies and programmes to respond to these risk factors and mental health challenges. Programmes with a differential focus on the needs of males and females, younger and older adolescents will be important in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4308650999,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a group of tumors that arise along the human biliary duct tree, ranking second in primary hepatic malignancies. Intrahepatic CCA (iCCA) represents about 10%-20% of CCAs. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that iCCAs' incidence and mortality have been increasing globally over the past few decades. In this study, we found that the EIF3H expression level in iCCA tissues was significantly increased compared to the adjacent non-cancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC). A similar tendency of EIF3H mRNA and protein level was confirmed in iCCA cell lines using RT-qPCR and Western blot. EIF3H has been identified as a critical molecule that plays a pro-neoplasmic role in iCCA both in vivo and in vitro, such as proliferation, migration, and anti-apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that EIF3H knockdown can promote the degradation of CCND1 and the proteolysis of CCND1 is mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Thus, we come to the conclusion that EIF3H promotes proliferation and migration of iCCAs, inhibiting apoptosis of iCCA cells at the same time by stabilizing the CCND1 protein structure. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of tumorigenesis role of EIF3H in iCCAs and a potential therapeutic target for iCCA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4308730154,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate the effects of work interference with family (WIF) on depressive symptoms among married working women. Methods Data from 2014‒2018 of the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Families were used. Only married women living with their husbands and wage workers were included, whereas those diagnosed with depression at the baseline year and those with missing values were excluded. A total of 1,504 individuals were included as the study population. The impact of WIF on depressive symptoms was analyzed using the generalized estimating equation model with a logit link. Results After adjusting for all the potential confounding variables, it was found that WIF had an effect on depressive symptoms. Women whose work interfered with their family were 1.58 times more likely to experience depressive symptoms than those who did not experience WIF (95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.30‒1.92). WIF due to irregular working hours had the highest odds ratio for depression (Adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.01, 95% CI: 1.32‒3.08). Women with WIF were more likely to develop depressive symptoms when they had two or more children (With 2 children, Adjusted OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.31‒2.18; With 3 or more children, Adjusted OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.07–2.49). Conclusions Thus, married working women who experienced WIF were found to be at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms. Therefore, considering how prevailing stereotypes that roles of men and women are separated can harm women’s mental health, policy measures should be implemented to ensure women’s quality of life based on the work-family balance."

Coping with the illness becomes a challenge due to supply problems and lack of access to health care facilities. It is expected these limitations, along with lockdown and social distancing measures, have affected the routine disease management of these patients, being more pronounced in low- and middle-income countries with a flawed health care system.The purpose of this study is to describe a protocol for a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the Adhera® MejoraCare Digital Program, an mHealth intervention aimed at improving the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak in Paraguay.A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be carried out, with repeated measures (baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month) under two conditions: Adhera® MejoraCare Digital Program or waiting list. The primary outcome is a change in the quality of life on the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 3-Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Other secondary outcomes, as the effect on anxiety and health empowerment, will be considered. All participants must be 18 years of age or older and meet the criteria for chronic disease. A total of 96 participants will be recruited (48 per arm).It is expected that the Adhera® MejoraCare Digital Program will show significant improvements in quality of life and emotional distress compared to the waiting list condition. Additionally, it is hypothesized that this intervention will be positively evaluated by the participants in terms of usability and satisfaction. The findings will provide new insights into the viability and efficacy of mHealth solutions for chronic disease management in developing countries and in times of pandemic.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04659746."

The present study aimed to compare the hematological parameters of reproductive-age women taking hormonal contraceptives at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia in 2021.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2021. A total of 240 study participants were recruited by using a consecutive sampling technique. Data on socio-demographic variables and clinical data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire and medical record reviews, respectively. Three milliliter venous blood was collected for complete blood count analysis using Unicel DxH 800 coulter hematology analyzer. Data was entered into Epi-data 4.4.3.1 version then exported to IBM SPSS v25 for analysis. Kruskal-Wallis H, Dunn-Bonferroni pairwise comparison test, and Spearman's correlation analysis were used for inferential statistics. P&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.The median and interquartile range of platelet count among combined oral contraceptive users was 285(238-332) which is significantly higher than that of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate users 246(220-226) (p = 0.010), implant user 247(221-297) (p = 0.034), and controls 256(224-278) (p = 0.015). The result also showed long-term use of implant negatively correlated with red blood cell count (p = 0.033).This finding concludes that combined oral contraceptive users had a higher platelet counts than controls while long-term use of implants can result in low red blood cells count. Therefore, a baseline evaluation of complete blood count in women desiring contraceptive methods would also be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4308567741,"Introduction High levels of treatment adherence are critical for achieving optimal treatment outcomes among patients with tuberculosis (TB), especially for drug-resistant TB (DR TB). Current tools for identifying high-risk non-adherence are insufficient. Here, we apply trajectory analysis to characterize adherence behavior early in DR TB treatment and assess whether these patterns predict treatment outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of Philippines DR TB patients treated between 2013 and 2016. To identify unique patterns of adherence, we performed group-based trajectory modelling on adherence to the first 12 weeks of treatment. We estimated the association of adherence trajectory group with six-month and final treatment outcomes using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. We also estimated and compared the predictive accuracy of adherence trajectory group and a binary adherence threshold for treatment outcomes. Results Of 596 patients, 302 (50.7%) had multidrug resistant TB, 11 (1.8%) extremely drug-resistant (XDR) TB, and 283 (47.5%) pre-XDR TB. We identified three distinct adherence trajectories during the first 12 weeks of treatment: a high adherence group (n = 483), a moderate adherence group (n = 93) and a low adherence group (n = 20). Similar patterns were identified at 4 and 8 weeks. Being in the 12-week moderate or low adherence group was associated with unfavorable six-month (adjusted OR [aOR] 3.42, 95% CI 1.90–6.12) and final (aOR 2.71, 95% 1.73–4.30) treatment outcomes. Adherence trajectory group performed similarly to a binary threshold classification for the prediction of final treatment outcomes (65.9% vs. 65.4% correctly classified), but was more accurate for prediction of six-month treatment outcomes (79.4% vs. 60.0% correctly classified). Conclusions Adherence patterns are strongly predictive of DR TB treatment outcomes. Trajectory-based analyses represent an exciting avenue of research into TB patient adherence behavior seeking to inform interventions which rapidly identify and support patients with high-risk adherence patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4308574737,"Older adult carers of people who experience psychosis are at increased risk of developing physical and mental health problems due to the compounding factors of supporting their care-recipient and the health changes associated with ageing. Effective interventions exist but can be difficult to access and maintain prolonged engagement. Self-directed writing therapies, frequently referred to as Written Emotional Disclosure (WED), might be a suitable alternative intervention to improve the wellbeing of carers.This study aimed to determine the feasibility (recruitment, retention and primary outcome completion) and acceptability of a specific WED intervention known as Positive Written Disclosure (PWD). Informal carers of people with psychosis were randomised to PWD, neutral writing or no writing. Quantitative outcomes including positive and negative affect, carer wellbeing, quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress, self-efficacy, leisure time satisfaction as well as health care utilisation were collected at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month assessments. Qualitative feedback was also collected via questionnaire and semi-structured interviews from those randomised to either writing group.We successfully met our progression criteria, recruiting to target and within timeframes whilst attaining 97% retention and 84% primary outcome data completed at 6 months. Carers randomised to the positive writing group described the intervention as enabling them to have a more positive attitude and focus on activities for themselves. Both writing groups described their tasks as providing distraction from caring responsibilities. However, some carers found the narrow positive emotion focus challenging.PWD is a feasible and acceptable intervention for older adult carers of people with psychosis within a community setting. Further refinement of the writing protocol to include choice in type of emotion disclosed in addition to screening for some level of need may be required in future trials to reduce floor/ceiling effects of outcomes which may explain the lack of change observed."

For a proof-of-concept study, saliva samples were obtained from 28 persons with mild or moderate COVID-19-related symptoms who were tested RT-PCR positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. In an outpatient setting, 972 individual saliva samples were utilized. All saliva samples were FISHed with a Cy3-labeled SARS-CoV-2-specific DNA probe and were analyzed manually by fluorescence microscopy (proof-of-concept) or with the SARS-CoV-2 application of the Biotrack-MED® analyzer, a semi-autonomous multi-sample filter cytometer. The proof-of-concept study showed a sensitivity of 96.0% and a specificity of 98.5% and is therefore comparable to the RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. The outpatient setting showed a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 94.5% and seems therefore a valid assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals that are healthy, mild or moderate symptomatic. In conclusion, the method evaluated in this study, the FISH-based SARS-CoV-2 application of the Biotrack-MED® analyzer, is a sensitive and reliable assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W4308574755,"The early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clinically elucidated, leading to an increased mortality rate in patients with HCC. HCC is a systemic disease related to disorders of blood homeostasis, and the association between red blood cells (RBCs) and HCC tumorigenesis remains elusive. We performed data-independent acquisition proteomic analyses of 72 clinical RBC samples, including HCC (n = 30), liver cirrhosis (LC, n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 25), and characterized the clinical relevance of RBCs and tumorigenesis in HCC. We observed dynamic changes in RBCs during HCC tumorigenesis, and our findings indicate that, based on the protein expression profiles of RBCs, LC is a developmental stage closely approaching HCC. The expression of hemoglobin (HbA and HbF) in peripheral blood dynamically changed during HCC tumorigenesis, suggesting that immature erythroid cells exist in peripheral blood of HCC patients and that erythropoiesis is influenced by the onset of LC. We also identified the disrupted autophagy pathway in RBCs at the onset of LC, which persisted during HCC tumorigenesis. The oxytocin and GnRH pathways were disrupted and first identified during the development of LC into HCC. Significantly differentially expressed SMIM1, ANXA7, HBA1, and HBE1 during tumorigenesis were verified as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis of HCC using parallel reaction monitoring technology. This study may enhance the understanding of HCC tumorigenesis from a different point of view and aid the early diagnosis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W4308574828,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive recessive genetic disease. Early identification is critical for achieving maximal treatment benefit. Survival motor neuron (SMN) 2 copy number may be a needed descriptor of disease severity than SMA type. Therefore, we assessed knowledge of SMN2 copy number among those with SMA and their caregivers via a phone survey. Only patients with SMA (or their caregivers) registered in the Cure SMA database with no SMN2 copy number on file were eligible. Descriptive results are reported. Backward stepwise multinomial logistic regressions determined if specific factors predicted knowledge of SMN2 copy number. Engagement with the SMA community (odds ratio [OR] 1.82; p&lt;0.0001), ability to walk (OR 1.74; p = 0.006), and current age at time of survey (OR = 0.98; p&lt;0.0001) each positively predicted knowledge of SMN2 copy number. Of 806 completed surveys, the majority (n = 452; 56.3%) did not know SMN2 copy numbers for themselves (n = 190; 62.5%) or their loved ones (n = 261; 52.4%). Of these, 66 respondents (8.2%) said genetic testing had not been done. Motor function increased linearly with increasing SMN2 copy number. SMN2 copy number is emerging as a critical descriptor of severity for SMA as type becomes more obsolete with early drug treatment. Communication of SMN2 copy numbers is recommended as a standard part of the treatment plan."
https://openalex.org/W4308575291,"Altered climate, nutrient enrichment and changes in grazing patterns are important environmental and biotic changes in temperate grassland systems. Singly and in concert these factors can influence plant performance and traits, with consequences for species competitive ability, and thus for species coexistence, community composition and diversity. However, we lack experimental tests of the mechanisms, such as competition for light, driving plant performance and traits under nutrient enrichment, grazer exclusion and future climate. We used transplants of Silene latifolia , a widespread grassland forb in Europe, to study plant responses to interactions among climate, nutrients, grazing and light. We recorded transplant biomass, height, specific leaf area (SLA) and foliar carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) in full-factorial combinations of future climate treatment, fertilization, grazer exclusion and light addition via LED-lamps. Future climate and fertilization together increased transplant height but only in unlighted plots. Light addition increased SLA in ambient climate, and decreased C:N in unfertilized plots. Further, transplants had higher biomass in future climatic conditions when protected from grazers. In general, grazing had a strong negative effect on all measured variables regardless of added nutrients and light. Our results show that competition for light may lead to taller individuals and interacts with climate and nutrients to affect traits related to resource-use. Furthermore, our study suggests grazing may counteract the benefits of future climate on the biomass of species such as Silene latifolia . Consequently, grazers and light may be important modulators of individual plant performance and traits under nutrient enrichment and future climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4308575795,"This study aimed to explore the effect of carbon fiber couch on radiotherapy dose attenuation and gamma pass rate in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans. A phantom inserted with an ionization chamber was placed at different positions of the couch, and the dose was measured by the chamber. Under the same positioning, the phantom dose was calculated using the real and virtual couch images, and the difference in the planned dose of radiotherapy was compared. Ten clinical IMRT plans were selected as dose verification data, and the gamma pass rates were compared between couch addition and non-addition conditions. When the radiation field was near 110° and 250°, the measured value attenuation coefficient of the ionization chamber at the joint of the couch was up to 34%; the attenuation coefficient of the treatment couch from the actual couch image calculated using the treatment planning system (TPS) was up to 33%; the attenuation coefficient of the virtual couch calculated using the TPS was up to 4.0%. The gamma pass rate of the dose verification near gantry angles 110° and 250° was low, and that of the joint could be lower than 85% under the condition of 3%/3 mm. The gamma pass rates of the radiation field passing through the couch were all affected. The dose was affected by the radiation field passing through the couch, with the largest effect when passing through the joint part of the treatment couch, followed by that of the main couch plate and extension plate. When the irradiation field passed through the joint and near 110° and 250° of the main couch, the dose difference was large, making it unsuitable for treatment."

Participants with no experience in mindfulness based intervention, were randomized to receive (36 patients) or not (34 patients) mindfulness-based stress reduction program for chronic back pain (MBSR-CBP). The program was performed in 9 sessions. Patients with chronic low back pain due to symptomatic discopathy (degenerative disc disease or herniated disc) were included. The principal outcome was changes in the blood level of cortisol and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)). Secondary outcomes (psychological factors, pain, and quality of life) were measured by validated questionnaires.Of the 96 randomized patients, 70 who completed the study were included in the analysis (mean [range] age: 53 [33-73] years; 66% females). MBSR-CBP stopped the increase in cortisol, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (p = 0.05). It reduced depression (p = 0.046) and stress (p = 0.0438), perceived pain (p &lt; 0.0001), and limitations related to health (p &lt; 0.0001). It also increased the physical function (p = 0.002) and sleep quality (p = 0.05). Furthermore, it significantly increased life satisfaction (0.006), well-being (p = 0.001) and vitality (p &lt; 0.0001). It also increased self-compassion (p &lt; 0.0001) and significantly reduced the overidentification (p&lt;0.0001) and catastrophization (p = 0.002).MBSR-CBP could be part of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of patients suffering from chronic low back pain."
https://openalex.org/W4308623262,"Despite the various initiatives carried out in Brazil and in the world, the challenge of offering essential medicines in adequate presentations remains, especially to the public affected by diseases considered neglected and the pediatric population, for whom the therapeutic options remain limited. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the production of manipulated medicines as a strategy to mitigate therapeutic and access gaps to essential medicines within the Brazilian public health system, called the Unified Health System (SUS). The evaluation, carried out between 2020 and 2021, identified, among the medicines considered essential to the Brazilian health context, those unavailable, for which strategies were evaluated to mitigate the identified unavailability, which is conventionally called therapeutic gaps. For 57% (n = 235) of pharmaceutical presentations identified as therapeutic gaps in SUS, manipulation was identified as the best strategy to promote access. Of these presentations, 30% (n = 70) were identified as priorities in the context of patient care and were mainly related to the demands of the pediatric public and those affected by poverty-related diseases. Concerning poverty-related diseases, the absence of evidence on the development of a standard formula for drugs with indication for such diseases was demonstrated. The need for an annual investment of approximately US$74.75 per capita was estimated to offer treatments in adequate presentations to SUS users, which should reflect in the improvement of the quality of life of about 26 thousand people. It was observed that this investment amount corresponds to only 3% of the budget for the purchase of medicines financed exclusively by the Ministry of Health thorugh the Strategic Component of Pharmaceutical Assistance (CESAF) approved for 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4308648867,"Immersive projection display system is widely adopted in virtual reality and various exhibition halls. How to maintain high display quality in an immersive projection environment with uneven illumination and the color deviation caused by the inter-reflection of light is still a challenging task. In this paper, we innovatively propose a deep learning-based radiation compensation for an L-shaped projector-camera system. This method employs complex reflection phenomena to simulate the light transport processing in an L-shaped environment, we also designed a Dark-Channel Enhanced-Compensation Net (DECNet) which composed of a convolutional neural network called Compensation Net, a DarkChannelNet and another subnet (such as sensing network) aiming at achieving high-quality reproduction of projected display images. The final output of DECNet is the compensation image to be projected. It is always a critical problem to establish appropriate evaluation and analysis indexes throughout the research of light pollution compensation algorithms. In this paper, PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE are proposed to quantitatively analyze the image quality. The experimental results show that this method has certain advantages in reducing the inter-reflection of the projection plane. And our method could also well replace the traditional process using the backlight transmission matrix. It can be concluded to a certain that this method can be extended to other more complex projection environments with strong scalability and inclusiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4308654215,"High throughput technologies in genomics enable the analysis of small alterations in gene expression levels. Patterns of such deviations are an important starting point for the discovery and verification of new biomarker candidates. Identifying such patterns is a challenging task that requires sophisticated machine learning approaches. Currently, there are a variety of classification models, and a common approach is to compare the performance and select the best one for a given classification problem. Since the association between the features of a data set and the performance of a particular classification method is still not fully understood, the main contribution of this work is to provide a new methodology for predicting the prediction results of different classifiers in the field of biomarker discovery. We propose here a three-steps computational workflow that includes an analysis of the data set characteristics, the calculation of the classification accuracy and, finally, the prediction of the resulting classification error. The experiments were carried out on synthetic and microarray datasets. Using this method, we showed that the predictability strongly depends on the discriminatory ability of the features, e.g., sets of genes, in two or multi-class datasets. If a dataset has a certain discriminatory ability, this method enables prediction of the classification performance before applying a learning model. Thus, our results contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between dataset characteristics and the corresponding performance of a machine learning method, and suggest the optimal classification method for a given dataset based on its discriminatory ability."
https://openalex.org/W4308659012,"Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a critical regulator of appetite and energy expenditure in rodents and humans. MC4R deficiency causes hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure, and impaired glucose metabolism. Ligand binding to MC4R activates adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a secondary messenger that regulates several cellular processes. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein-1-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (CRTC1) is a cytoplasmic coactivator that translocates to the nucleus in response to cAMP and is reportedly involved in obesity. However, the precise mechanism through which CRTC1 regulates energy metabolism remains unknown. Additionally, there are no reports linking CRTC1 and MC4R, although both CRTC1 and MC4R are known to be involved in obesity. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking CRTC1, specifically in MC4R cells, are sensitive to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and exhibit hyperphagia and increased body weight gain. Moreover, the loss of CRTC1 in MC4R cells impairs glucose metabolism. MC4R-expressing cell-specific CRTC1 knockout mice did not show changes in body weight gain, food intake, or glucose metabolism when fed a normal-chow diet. Thus, CRTC1 expression in MC4R cells is required for metabolic adaptation to HFD with respect to appetite regulation. Our results revealed an important protective role of CRTC1 in MC4R cells against dietary adaptation."
