https://openalex.org/W1974955132,"For more than two decades, researchers have argued that young children do not understand mental states such as beliefs. Part of the evidence for this claim comes from preschoolers' failure at verbal tasks that require the understanding that others may hold false beliefs. Here, we used a novel nonverbal task to examine 15-month-old infants' ability to predict an actor's behavior on the basis of her true or false belief about a toy's hiding place. Results were positive, supporting the view that, from a young age, children appeal to mental states—goals, perceptions, and beliefs—to explain the behavior of others."

We describe how these neuropeptides excite distinct neuronal populations in the central amygdala, which provides the major output of the amygdaloid complex to the autonomic nervous system. We identified these two neuronal populations as part of an inhibitory network, through which vasopressin and oxytocin modulate the integration of excitatory information from the basolateral amygdala and cerebral cortex in opposite manners. Through this network, the expression and endogenous activation of vasopressin and oxytocin receptors may regulate the autonomic expression of fear."

Here, we describe a simple, rapid, and robust approach to modifying solid surfaces, based on an ultrathin cross-linkable film of a random copolymer, which does not rely on specific surface chemistries. Specifically, thin films of benzocyclobutene-functionalized random copolymers of styrene and methyl methacrylate were spin coated or transferred, then thermally cross-linked on a wide variety of metal, metal oxide, semiconductor, and polymeric surfaces, producing a coating with a controlled thickness and well-defined surface energy. The process described can be easily implemented and adapted to other systems."

Much has been discovered on the properties of these proteases; however, regulatory mechanisms of enzyme-substrate interaction in neurons and their involvement in pathological changes are still not fully understood. It is mainly because of the membrane-associated cleavage of these proteases and the lack of information on new substrates processed in a similar way to APP. Here, using RNA interference-mediated BACE1 knockdown, mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are deficient in either BACE1 or presenilins, and BACE1-deficient mouse brain, we show clear evidence that β subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels are sequentially processed by BACE1 and γ-secretase. These results may provide new insights into the underlying pathology of Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of age-dependent dementia. The major pathological features of Alzheimer disease are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are the deposits of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β peptide; Alp, alkaline phosphatase; APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme; CTF, C-terminal fragments; CTFβ, C-terminal fragment produced after BACE1 cleavage; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; FL, full-length; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PS, presenilin; VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel; WB, Western blotting; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively.

Although the properties of both proteases as APP processing enzymes are relatively well established, the regulatory mechanisms of sequential cleavage by both proteases in neurons are not completely clear. This is partly because of the fact that APP and its family proteins are still the only substrates identified for both β- and γ-secretases, although a number of integral membrane proteins have been reported to be processed either by BACE1 (8Kitazume S.

Identifying new substrates for both β- and γ-secretases in neurons would therefore be useful to further explore the precise mechanism by which BACE1 and γ-secretase function in cohort. Recently, our laboratory has been focusing on examining the role of voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) β in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease and the regulation of APP processing in lipid rafts. 2Oyama, F., Miyazaki, H., Sakamoto, N., Ikeda, T., Becquet, C., Machida, Y., Kaneko, K., Uchikawa, C., Suzuki, T., Kurosawa, M., Tamaoka, A., Sakurai, T., and Nukina, N., manuscript submitted for publication. , 3Sakurai et al., manuscript in preparation. VGSC is a large, multimeric complex that consists of an α subunit and one or more β subunits. To date, nine functional α subunits and four β subunits have been identified (11Yu F.H. Westenbroek R.E. Silos-Santiago I. McCormick K.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Ferriera H. Lilly J. DiStefano P.S. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7577-7585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Although VGSCβ subunits are not essential to the basic operation of sodium channels, they are considered to be important auxiliary subunits, because co-expression of β subunits are required to reconstitute full properties of the native sodium channel and to modify channel properties and intracellular localization (11Yu F.H. Westenbroek R.E. Silos-Santiago I. McCormick K.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Ferriera H. Lilly J. DiStefano P.S. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7577-7585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hanlon M.R. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2886-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the course of analyzing the VGSCβ, we found that these subunits are preferentially associated with Lubrol-WX-resistant membranes in the mouse brain and possess putative BACE1 cleavage sites juxtaposed to the transmembrane region (14Turner III, R.T. Koelsch G. Hong L. Castanheira P. Ermolieff J. Ghosh A.K. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the possibility that VGSCβ subunits could be processed sequentially by BACE1 as well as γ-secretase. Here we show direct evidence that these subunits are indeed novel substrates of both proteases. Reagents and Antibodies—DAPT and Lubrol-WX were purchased from Calbiochem and Serva Electrophoresis, respectively. Antibodies used in this study were as follows. For mouse monoclonal antibodies, anti-human BACE1 ectodomain (MAB9311, R & D Systems), anti-c-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), anti-GM130 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-β-tubulin (Sternberger Monoclon), and anti-V5 (Invitrogen) were used. For rabbit polyclonal antibodies, anti-BACE1 (IBL), anti-human BACE1 (BioSource), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-prion protein (FL-253, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PS1 (H-70, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PS2 loop (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used. Mouse/rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488/546-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Cultures—The cerebra from C57BL newborn mice were enzymatically digested in papain solution (20 units/ml, Worthington) for 20 min at 37 °C. The tissues were then washed extensively with Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) and mechanically dissociated with fire-polished glass pipettes. The cells were subsequently seeded on poly(l-lysine) (Sigma; Mr 70,000–150,000)-coated culture dishes and maintained in Neurobasal medium containing 1× B27 supplement, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HEK cells, N2a cells, MEFs, and HTB-148/H4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Generation of BACE1 Knock-out Mice—A BACE1 knock-out mouse line was generated by inserting a neomycin expression cassette from pMC1neopA (Thomas and Capecchi, 1987) (Stratagene) into exon 1 (glutamate 19 of the BACE1 cDNA). The insertion of the neo-cassette introduces a premature translational stop codon into the open reading frame of the BACE1 gene. Successful knock down of BACE was confirmed by Southern, Northern, and Western blot analysis. Mammalian Expression Vectors—Plasmids encoding full-length (FL) VGSCβ1–β4 subunits (GenBank™ accession numbers: β1, U85786; β2, XM134787; β3, AY049036; and β4, BK001031.1) were generated by PCR from mouse brain cDNAs. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Truncated versions of mouse VGSCβ1–β4 (VGSCβ1–β4–1/2, Fig. 3A) were also constructed via PCR, and the resulting PCR products were subcloned into pSecTag2/HygroB (Invitrogen). The sequences of all of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Generation of C-terminal-specific Anti-VGSCβ Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to mouse VGSCβ1, -2, -3, or -4 were raised against the C terminus of each subunit (β1, ITSESKENCTGVQVAE; β2, GEGNAEDGTK; β3, IPSENKENSVVPVEE; β4, GLPGSKAEEKPPTKV and underlined as shown in Fig. 1B). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated C-terminal peptide for each VGSCβ subunit was used for immunization, and antibodies were affinity purified by the peptide immobilized on SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce). The specificity of each antibody was verified by immunoblot analysis. Production of End-specific VGSCβ4 Antibodies—A cleavage site-directed antibody was generated as described, with minor modifications (15Kikuchi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to the predicted N-terminal region of C-terminal fragment (CTF) β4 from in vitro cleavage assay (NH2-QVVDKLEKV) with the C-terminal Cys. The peptide was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. For antibody purification, a shorter peptide, NH2-QVVDKLC, and acetyl-QVVDKLC were synthesized and coupled with SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce). The antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography on the immobilized NH2-QVVDKLC. To obtain N-terminal end-specific antibody, the affinity-purified antibody was further adsorbed against the immobilized acetyl-QVVDKLC. We designated these new antibodies as QV6 antibody. Preparation of Detergent-soluble Brain Membrane Extracts—Various regions of the mouse brain were dissected from BDF1 (wild type) or C57B6 × 129SV (BACE1-deficient) mice, and the tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of dissection buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with 1× Complete™). The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was rehomogenized in 10 volumes of the same buffer and recentrifuged as above. The final pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of dissection buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with constant rocking. Detergent-soluble protein extract was collected as the supernatant after spinning at 40,000 × g for 20 min. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Membranes (DRMs) from Primary Cultures—Primary cortical neuron cultures were lysed with 1% Lubrol WX at 4 °C in MES-buffered saline (pH 6.5) supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After lysis, the detergent-resistant membranes were prepared essentially as previously described (16Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—BACE1 small interfering RNA (siGENOME™ SMARTpool, Dharmacon) was transfected into MEFs or H4 cells with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were collected for further analysis after 2–3 days. Phosphatase Assay—Full-length VGSCβ subunit cDNAs were cloned into pAPtag-4 (GenHunter Corporation) to express VGSCβ subunits fused with soluble human placental alkaline phosphatase (Alp) at their N termini (AP-β). Each AP-β and BACE1 were transfected into HEK cells with β-galactosidase to normalize the expression levels. Alkaline phosphatase activity in the medium was measured after 24 h in essentially the same way as described previously (9Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In Vitro Cleavage Assay and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Synthetic peptides (50 μm) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, were incubated with 25 μg/ml recombinant human BACE1 (R & D Systems) at 30 °C for 12 h. Monoisotopic mass values of the peptides were measured by a Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) operated in the reflector mode. The peptide solution was desalted with ZipTip C18 (Millipore) and co-crystallized with equal volumes of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka) matrix in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All MALDI spectra were calibrated externally using a peptide standard. Cleavage sites were searched by calculating monoisotopic masses of possible peptides with PAWS software (Genomic Solutions, 65.219.84.5/paws.html) based on the peptide sequence used as a substrate with ±0.1% mass tolerance. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips or growth chambers were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for ∼3 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h in PBS, washed extensively, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After primary antibody incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and subsequently incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The cells were finally washed three times with PBS and mounted in VECTASHIELD® (Vector) and then analyzed by confocal microscopy (the spectral confocal scanning system TCS SP2 from Leica). Western Blotting Analysis—Cells that were ready to be analyzed by Western blotting were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer (8.6% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 10 mm sodium fluoride (NaF), 50 mm Tris, 0.038% EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and Complete™). Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Appropriate volumes of protein lysates were then mixed with 4× SDS gel-loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mm dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, and an appropriate amount of bromphenol blue), boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and resolved in 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gels (Atto). Proteins were subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.22 μm, Schleicher & Schuell), and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, Sigma) for 1 h. The blots were then incubated with appropriately diluted primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, each for 1 h at room temperature, with extensive washing with TBS-T after each incubation. Finally, the blots were developed with ECL solutions and exposed onto Hyperfilm™ MP (Amersham Biosciences). Others—Band intensities on immunoblots were either quantified by ImageJ (version 1.32j, NCBI) after scanning with an EPSON ES-8000 scanner or captured by the FUJIFILM LAS-1000+ system and analyzed using image analyzing software. The value obtained from one data point was divided by the value obtained for its own internal control (β-tubulin) and set to 100%. Ratios from other data points were compared accordingly and expressed as relative ratio of change. All significance between two sets of data was determined by unpaired Student's t test. VGSCβ Subunits Are Preferentially Associated with Lipid Rafts—DRMs prepared with Lubrol-WX (Lubrol rafts) have been shown to be especially useful for the analysis of APP processing, because BACE1 and γ-secretase can be efficiently recovered (16Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 17Riddell D.R. Christie G. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1288-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To confirm the association of VGSCβ subunits with Lubrol rafts in neuronal cells, we fractionated mature postnatal primary cortical neuron cultures (4 weeks) with Lubrol-WX and examined their expression patterns by Western blotting (WB). As shown in Fig. 1A, each of the VGSCβ subunits was substantially and prominently recovered in fraction 3 of the preparation that was also enriched in prion protein, a marker of lipid raft domains, as well as BACE1, CTFs of presenilin-1/2, and the mature form of APP. These results indicate that VGSCβ subunits are preferentially associated with lipid rafts in neurons. Indeed, based on the preferential amino acid residues flanking the BACE1 cleavage site (14Turner III, R.T. Koelsch G. Hong L. Castanheira P. Ermolieff J. Ghosh A.K. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we found several putative BACE1 cleavage sites juxtaposed to the transmembrane region on each VGSCβ subunit (Fig. 1B, arrows (↓)). The recovery of these proteins in the prion protein-enriched fraction and the presence of putative BACE1 cleavage sites led us to examine whether VGSCβ subunits are physiological substrates for both proteases. VGSCβ Subunits Are Novel Substrates of BACE1—First we introduced FL VGSCβ subunits into human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells in the presence or absence of human BACE1 to examine the processing pattern of each VGSCβ subunit by WB with C-terminal-specific VGSCβ antibodies generated in our laboratory (Fig. 2A). For VGSCβ1, -2, and -4, introduction of FL-VGSCβ subunits revealed strong expression at ∼37 kDa, and co-expression of BACE1 dramatically reduced the expression of FL-VGSCβ with a concomitant production of smaller C-terminal fragments (CTFβs). In contrast, strong expression of CTFβ3 was detected without BACE1 transfection, and co-expression of BACE1 reduced the expression of FL-VGSCβ3 and CTFβ3. This implies that perhaps CTFβ3 could be processed further by other protease(s) in HEK cells. Experiments were repeated with VGSCβ constructs tagged with V5 at the C terminus, and essentially the same pattern was observed (Fig. 2A, V5). Because we were unable to detect smaller CTFβ3 by WB upon the addition of BACE1, VGSCβ3 was not analyzed in some of the later experiments. Next, the specificity of this cleavage was confirmed by knock-down (Fig. 2B) and knock-out experiments (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2B, using a cell line that expresses high levels of endogenous BACE1 (HTB-148/H4), small interfering RNA-mediated BACE1 suppression significantly reduced (about 80%) the production of CTFβ1, -2, and -4 with an accumulation of the FL proteins. Similar to Fig. 2B, the lack of BACE1 in MEFs led to a reduction of CTFβ expression (Fig. 2C). In summary, these data suggest that the proteolysis of FL-VGSCβ subunits and production of CTFβs are correlated to the expression and/or activity of BACE1. We have now confirmed that BACE1 is able to cleave FL-VGSCβ subunits, but whether the extracellular domain of VGSCβ subunit is shed is unknown. To this end, we generated N-terminal truncated VGSCβ constructs with (β1–β4–1) or without (β1–β4–2) putative BACE1 cleavage sites (Fig. 3A). We introduced these constructs into HEK cells and examined the expression of VGSCβ, first, with anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myc antibodies by WB. Of note, only results for the VGSCβ4 subunit are shown here, because similar results were obtained for VGSCβ1, -2, and -3. As shown in Fig. 3B, the introduction of β4–1 or -2 alone gave strong FLAG and c-Myc immunoreactivities, and the co-expression of BACE1 with β4–1 led to the complete disappearance of FLAG expression. These results suggest that the FLAG-tagged extracellular domain was processed and released (more evidence to be shown in Fig. 3D). As a result of this cleavage, the expression of full-length β4–1 (Fig. 3B, the upper c-Myc band, middle panel) was largely reduced with a concomitant increase in truncated β4–1 (Fig. 3B, the lower c-Myc band, middle panel). In contrast, co-expression of BACE1 with β4–2 did not lead to any obvious change in FLAG or c-Myc immunoreactivity. Second, to visualize the expression of these proteins with respect to their cell surface expression, we performed immunocytochemistry on non-permeabilized HEK cells with 1) anti-FLAG, 2) N-terminal end-specific CTFβ4 antibodies (the QV6 antibody) that only detect CTFβ4 but not FL-β4, and 3) anti-BACE1 antibodies that recognize the N-terminal extracellular region of BACE1. As shown in Fig. 3C [a′], there were virtually no FLAG immunoreactivities detected on the cell surface membrane when β4–1 and BACE1 co-expressed at the same time, indicating that amino acid residues 143–161 contained a putative BACE1 cleavage site. To show the processing in an alternative way, we made use of the newly generated QV6 antibody that detected only the CTFβ4 produced by BACE1 (see Fig. 3C, right lower panel, for specificity). Using this cleavage site-directed antibody, we found a co-localization between cleaved β4 and BACE1 (Fig. 3C, [b–b″]). In contrast, FLAG-labeled β4–2 proteins showed intense co-localization with BACE1 on the cell surface, (Fig. 3C, [c–c″]), and there was virtually no immunoreactivities detected by the QV6 antibody (Fig. 3C, [d]). Furthermore, to show the N termini of VGSCβs were actually released from the cell surface, we fused an Alp tag to the N terminus of each FL-β subunit and measured the Alp activity in the medium 24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 3D, there was a significant increase of Alp activity in the conditioned medium upon co-expression of BACE1 and Alp-tagged FL VGSCβ, compared with the VGSCβ alone-transfected condition. In summary, these data clearly indicate that the sequence adjacent to the transmembrane domain on each VGSCβ subunit contains a putative BACE1 cleavage site(s), and the N-terminal part of VGSCβ is shed and released similar to that of APP. Confirmation of the Predicted Putative BACE1 Cleavage Sites on VGSCβ Subunits—To demonstrate that BACE1 is able to cleave the VGSCβ subunit directly and to confirm the putative cleavage sites that we predicted in Fig. 1B on each VGSCβ subunit, we employed an in vitro cleavage assay using the recombinant BACE1 catalytic domain and peptides corresponding to the extracellular domain of each VGSCβ subunit containing putative BACE1 cleavage sites (β1, amino acids 122–160; β2, amino acids 128–157; β3, amino acids 121–159; β4, amino acids 132–161) (Figs. 3A and 4). Peptides were synthesized, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and incubated with or without recombinant BACE1. The APP peptide (662–679, KTEEISEVKMDAEFRHDS) was also included in this assay to confirm the activity of recombinant BACE1 (data not shown). The resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It is worth noting that only the masses that can be assigned to the sequence of each peptide were labeled in the MALDI spectra (Fig. 4, A–D), and we cannot exclude the possibility that other relatively minor processing sites exist. Furthermore, some of the peptides may not be properly recovered in this assay (for example, the TSVVSE peptide for VGSCβ3). As shown in Fig. 4, peptides incubated without BACE1 (Fig. 4, A–D, Con) exhibited peaks of 4616.0, 3500.4, 4522.1, and 3475.2 arbitrary intensity, corresponding to the calculated masses of ex-VGSCβ1–4, respectively (Fig. 4E). Co-incubation of BACE1 with ex-VGSCβ peptides (Fig. 4, A–D, +BACE1) led to the production of new peaks, indicating that ex-VGSCβ peptides were processed by BACE1. Fig. 4E summarizes all of the peptide fragments and cleavage sites on each ex-VGSCβ peptide that are preferentially processed by BACE1. Importantly, all of the processing sites revealed by this in vitro cleavage assay are included in the putative BACE1 cleavage sites that we predicted and indicated in Fig. 1B. CTFβs of VGSCβ Subunits Are Further Processed by γ-Secretase—Next we tested whether CTFβs could be further processed by γ-secretase similar to that of the APP family (1Wolfe M.S. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 233-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eggert S. Paliga K. Soba P. Evin G. Masters C.L. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

As a first step to examining whether CTFβs are substrates of γ-secretase, we incubated HEK cells transfected with VGSCβ subunits and BACE1 with a γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, co-incubation with DAPT led to a significant accumulation of CTFβ1, -2, and -3. In contrast, a small but consistent increase was observed for CTFβ4. Similar results were also obtained by the addition of another γ-secretase inhibitor, L-685, 458 (data not shown). Overexpression of BACE1 also led to the production of small immunoreactive bands for VGSCβ1, -2, and -4, which were DAPT-inhibitable (Fig. 5C). Overexpression indicates that these smaller immunoreactive bands were possibly the intracellular domains and that their production depended on the γ-secretase activity. To further confirm the role of γ-secretase in processing these CTFβs, we transfected BACE1 and VGSCβ subunits into the MEFs that are either deficient in presenilin-1 (PS1 knock-out), presenilin-2 (PS2 knock-out) or both presenilins (double knock-out) (19Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Compared with that of wild type MEFs, the lack of PS1 increased the expression of all CTFβs being examined by 2-fold, whereas the absence of PS2 resulted in a 1.5–2-fold increase in the expression of CTFβ1 and CTFβ3 and a 3–4-fold increase in CTFβ2 and CTFβ4. Interestingly, the lack of both PS1 and PS2 (double knock-out) produced a synergistic accumulation of all CTFβs, because a >6-fold increase was observed (Fig. 5D, and quantified in E). This observation is supported by published data demonstrating that PS1 and PS2 are functionally redundant and the complete deficiency in both presenilins results in a more severe phenotype (20Feng R. Wang H. Wang J. Shrom D. Zeng X. Tsien J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5F, the addition of DAPT also led to a significant accumulation of CTFβ2 and CTFβ4 (2–2.5-fold increase, right panel) in the mature primary cortical neuron cultures, indicating that these C-terminal fragments were also processed in a similar manner in neurons (of note, there were no CTFβ1 and CTFβ3 detected in primary neurons). These results confirm that CTFβ2 and CTFβ4 are present in neuronal cells and suggest that the inability of γ-secretase inhibitors to produce a significant accumulation of CTFβ4 in Fig. 5A is likely due to the inhibitor-specific effect on VGSCβ4 in the overexpression system. In Vivo Cleavage of VGSCβ by BACE1—The lack of CTFβ1 and CTFβ3 expression in the primary neurons led us to investigate the processing of VGSCβ subunits in the mouse brain. First, we examined the expression pattern of VGSCβ subunits in protein lysates prepared from wild type mouse brain, because it has high BACE1 activity. Essentially the same as in the primary neuron system, CTFβ2 and CTFβ4 (but not CTFβ1 and CTFβ3) were readily detected in protein extracted from the cerebral cortex (CX), cerebellum (CB), spinal cord (SP), and subcortical area (SC) of adult mice (Fig. 6A, left panels). Next, to confirm that BACE1 is the protease that cleaves VGSCβ2 and VGSCβ4"

The Fe 2+ is accessible through a long nonpolar tunnel that holds a carotenoid derivative in one of the crystals. On binding, three consecutive double bonds of this carotenoid changed from a straight all-trans to a cranked cis-trans-cis conformation.

G8 predominantly uses germline-encoded residues of its δ chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loop to bind T22 in an orientation substantially different from that seen in αβ TCR/peptide-MHC.

In contrast, LEAFY has more specialized functions in angiosperms, where it specifically induces floral fate during the reproductive phase. This raises the question of a concomitant change in the biochemical function of LEAFY during the evolution of land plants. We report that the DNA binding domain of LEAFY, although largely conserved, has diverged in activity. On the contrary, other, more rapidly evolving portions of the protein have few effects on LEAFY activity."
https://openalex.org/W2107782164,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to postnatal neovascularization. Risk factors for coronary artery disease reduce the number of EPCs in humans. Since EPC apoptosis might be a potential mechanism to regulate the number of EPCs, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) on EPC apoptosis. Atorvastatin, mevastatin, or VEGF prevented EPC apoptosis induced by H2O2. The antiapoptotic effect was reversed by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Forkhead transcription factors (FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4) exert proapoptotic effects and are phosphorylated and, thereby, inactivated by Akt. Therefore, we elucidated the involvement of forkhead transcription factors. Atorvastatin induced the phosphorylation of the predominant forkhead factor FOXO4 in EPCs. In addition, atorvastatin reduced the expression of the proapoptotic forkhead-regulated protein Bim in a PI3K-dependent manner. Consistently, overexpression of FOXO4 activated the Bim promoter as determined by reporter gene expression and stimulated the expression of Bim, resulting in an increased EPC apoptosis. Statins failed to prevent EPC apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bim or nonphosphorylatable FOXO4, suggesting that the protective effects of statins depend on this pathway. In summary, our results show that FOXO-dependent expression of Bim plays a pivotal role for EPC apoptosis. Statins reduce oxidative stress-induced EPC apoptosis, inactivate FOXO4, and down-regulate Bim."
https://openalex.org/W2086104179,"TRPM3 is a poorly understood member of the large family of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Here we describe five novel splice variants of TRPM3, TRPM3α1–5. These variants are characterized by a previously unknown amino terminus of 61 residues. The differences between the five variants arise through splice events at three different sites. One of these splice sites might be located in the pore region of the channel as indicated by sequence alignment with other, better-characterized TRP channels. We selected two splice variants, TRPM3α1 and TRPM3α2, that differ only in this presumed pore region and analyzed their biophysical characteristics after heterologous expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. TRPM3α1 as well as TRPM3α2 induced a novel, outwardly rectifying cationic conductance that was tightly regulated by intracellular Mg2+. However, these two variants are highly different in their ionic selectivity. Whereas TRPM3α1-encoded channels are poorly permeable for divalent cations, TRPM3α2-encoded channels are well permeated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Additionally, we found that currents through TRPM3α2 are blocked by extracellular monovalent cations, whereas currents through TRPM3α1 are not. These differences unambiguously show that TRPM3 proteins constitute a pore-forming channel subunit and localize the position of the ion-conducting pore within the TRPM3 protein. Although the ionic selectivity of ion channels has traditionally been regarded as rather constant for a given channel-encoding gene, our results show that alternative splicing can be a mechanism to produce channels with very different selectivity profiles.

Most of the encoded proteins exhibit common structural features such as six predicted transmembrane (TM) domains with a putative pore loop between TM5 and TM6 and the so-called TRP box after TM6 (1Clapham D.E.

The diversity of TRP channels is further increased by the fact that most members of the TRP gene family can give rise to several different transcripts due to alternative splicing (8Lis A. Wissenbach U. Philipp S.E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg′s Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In a few cases, the functional consequences of these alternative splice events are now beginning to emerge. For example, miss-plicing of TRPM6 transcripts is associated with a hereditary disorder called hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (9Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann N.L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E. Ristoff E. Dinour D. Syrrou M. Nielsen S. Sassen M. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Nat.

Their lengths range from 1544 to 1579 amino acid residues. Functional data were only reported for the TRPM3a splice variant. Heterologously expressed TRPM3a exhibits a constitutive, Ca2+ concentration-dependent Ca2+ entry that can be augmented by Ca2+ store depletion or by stimulation of muscarinic receptors (12Lee N.

On its amino terminal end, however, this variant, which we will refer to as TRPM31325 throughout this report, possesses an additional 153 amino acids completely missing in the other reported TRPM3 variants. As is the case with TRPM3a, TRPM31325 generates constitutively active, Ca2+-permeable channels when heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. The activity of TRPM31325 channels can reportedly be enhanced by hypo-osmotically induced cell swelling (13Grimm C.M. Kraft R. Sauerbruch S. Schultz G. Harteneck C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this report we describe five novel TRPM3 splice variants that we cloned as full-length cDNA constructs from mouse brain. These variants are 1699–1721 amino acid residues long and are characterized by a novel amino terminal sequence of 61 residues not described so far. Interestingly, two of the novel variants, designated TRPM3α1 and TRPMα2, differ only in a region between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains where the pore-forming region of the channel is assumed. This region is 12 amino acids longer in TRPM3α1 compared with TRPM3α2; additionally, a proline is substituted by an alanine. The principal finding of our study is that this alteration of the primary structure induces a large change in the ionic selectivity of the resulting ion channels. We thus identify alternative splicing as a mechanism to modify the selectivity of TRPM3 channels. Cloning of TRPM3 Variants—Oligonucleotide primers A, 5′-GAG AGC TGA GCG CAG GCT G-3′, and Z, 5′-TCC TGC AAC ACA CGG TAA GCC-3′, were used to amplify Trpm3 transcripts after oligo(dT)18 primed reverse transcription of mouse brain total RNA. For amplification we used the Long Expand PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) and the following conditions: addition of the enzymes at 62 °C followed by 2 min at 94 °C, 10 cycles (94 °C, 10 s; 62 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 5 min), 25 cycles (94 °C, 10 s; 62 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 5 min + 20 s/cycle) and 7 min at 68 °C. Sequencing both strands of subcloned fragments identified five independent clones encoding TRPM3α1, three encoding TRPM3α2, and three encoding TRPM3α3. Regarding TRPM3α4 and TRPM3α5, one clone was found for each splice variant (Fig. 1C). We introduced the ribosome binding site ACC GCC ACC and a Myc tag in-frame immediately 5′ to the start codon of Trpm3α1 and Trpm3α2 cDNAs, which were subsequently cloned into pCAGGS-IRES-GFP (15Warnat J. Philipp S. Zimmer S. Flockerzi V. Cavalié A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 631-638Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) for transient dicistronic expression of TRPM3 together with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). To generate stably transfected clones the TRPM3α1 and TRPM3α2 cDNAs were fused in-frame to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) cDNA in the pEYFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) allowing expression of TRPM3-EYFP fusion proteins. The sequences of Trpm3α1, Trpm3α2, Trpm3α3, Trpm3α4, and Trpm3α5 have been submitted to GenBank™ under accession numbers AJ544532, AJ544534, AJ544533 AJ544535, and AJ544536. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines— HEK-293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged 3 times a week until they reached passage 30. For transient transfection, cells grown to 70–80% confluence were transfected with TRPM3α1, Myc-tagged TRPM3α1, Myc-tagged TRPM3α2, or pCAGGS-IRES-GFP (mock) using PolyFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells were either used directly or passaged 24 h after transfection to reduce cell density. For generation of clones stably expressing Myc-tagged TRPM3α1-EYFP or TRPM3α2-EYFP fusion proteins, transfected cells were kept for 5 weeks in 500 μg/ml G418. Single surviving cells were isolated by cell sorting using a MoFlo fluorescent-associated cell sorter (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany) and expanded. Cell clones were tested for their EYFP fluorescence and for expression of TRPM3 in Western blots using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies and anti-GFP antibodies (Roche Applied Science). Detection of TRPM3 mRNA and Proteins—The 3450- and 1684-bp fragments, covering the entire coding sequence of the mouse Trpm3α1 cDNA, were labeled by random priming with [α32P]dCTP and served as probes for Northern blots. Filters were exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens at -80 °C for 2 weeks before they were stripped and hybridized with a 239-bp cDNA fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as control. In situ hybridizations were performed on 20-μm cryosections of perfusion-fixed brain (16Giehl K. Mestres P. Exp. Brain Res. 1995; 103: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and fresh brain from C57 Bl6/J × 129 SVJ or NMRI mice with similar results. Sections from fresh tissue were air dried for 30 min, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and finally dehydrated and defatted in 70 and 100% ethanol.

Control reactions with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled probe resulted in background grain densities. Specimens were exposed to x-ray films for 5 days and then to Kodak NTB2 photoemulsion for 3 weeks. Western blots were performed as described (17Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Biol.

Cells from four 3-cm dishes grown to 60–70% confluence were lysed in 200 μl of Laemmli buffer and analyzed using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies and anti-GFP antibodies. Electrophysiological Recordings—Standard tight-seal, whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed with an EPC9 amplifier controlled by Pulse software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Electrodes had resistances of 2.5–5 mΩ measured in standard bath solution and were coated with Sigmacote (Sigma). TRPM3-expressing cells were identified by their green fluorescence on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135; Zeiss) and used 24–96 h after transfection. Cells were voltage-clamped at -15 mV, and the instantaneous current-voltage relationship was probed at 1-s intervals with fast (1 mV/ms) voltage ramps ranging from -115 mV to +85 mV. During recordings that lasted longer than 60 s, the interval between voltage ramps was often increased to 10 s. From the voltage ramps, the current at -80 mV and +80 mV and the reversal potential were obtained by offline analysis. Pipette solutions contained (in mm) 100 CsAsp, 45 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES or 130 CsAsp, 10 NaCl, 5 K4BAPTA (1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′,-tetraacetic acid), 10 HEPES. When indicated, either 1 or 10 mm MgCl2 was added to the pipette solution. The resulting free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated with MaxChelator (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html) and are indicated in the figures. pH was adjusted to 7.2 (CsOH and HCl) and osmolality to 305–315 mosmol/kg (adjusted with H20 or glucose). A liquid junction potential of ∼15 mV was corrected for. Cells were maintained during the recordings at room temperature in Ringer solution. All extracellular solutions (Table I) were based on 10 mm HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.2 (hydroxide of main cation and HCl) and osmolality to 315–335 mosmol/kg (glucose or H20). Solutions were applied for short duration by a custom-made local perfusion system whose outlet was placed at <200 μm from the recorded cell.Table IIonic composition of extracellular solutions The concentrations (in mm) of the salts that were used for extracellular solutions in patch clamp experiments.

In brief, HEK-293 cells and HEK cell clones stably expressing Myc-tagged TRPM3-EYFP fusion proteins were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips to ∼50–70% confluence and measured 48–72 h later using an imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsried, Germany). Cells were loaded with 5 μm fura-2-AM for 30 min at room temperature, washed in Ringer solution containing (in mm) 138 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 20 glucose, 10 HEPES, (pH 7.2 adjusted with NaOH, 315 mosmol/kg) for 20 min, and analyzed in a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Ratio images were acquired every 3 s and analyzed online. Ratio values were converted to free Ca2+ concentration after calibration of the setup using a calibration kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Averages and S.E. values were calculated from traces obtained from individual cells and smoothed with a sliding window function (window size: 15 s) with the Origin data analysis software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). All reagents used in electrophysiological or Ca2+ imaging experiments were from Sigma. Results are given as mean ± S.E., and the two-tailed Student's t test was used to calculate p values. Identification and Cloning of TRPM3 Variants from Mouse Brain—Screening public databases we identified two partial human TRPM3 cDNA clones, AL136545 and XM_0136545 (Fig. 1C). Both clones derive from a single gene locus on human chromosome 9. The corresponding mouse gene shows a highly similar organization with 28 exons and spans more than 850 kb on mouse chromosome 19b (NCBI gene number 226025, Fig. 1A). Primers A and Z (Fig. 1A) were deduced from the mouse genomic sequence. Their sequences are located 5′ and 3′ to stop codons flanking an open reading frame with a predicted translation start that is also present in the human cDNA of clone AL136545. Using this primer combination, ∼5.2-kbp cDNA fragments from mouse brain total RNA were amplified by reverse transcription PCR and subcloned (Fig. 1B). Similar products were amplified from mouse eye (data not shown). Each clone contained the complete coding sequence of mouse Trpm3. We identified five different splice variants, designated TRPM3α1, TRPM3α2, TRPM3α3, TRPM3α4, and TRPM3α5 (Fig. 1C). Their amino acid sequences comprise 1699 up to 1721 amino acids, which are encoded by exons 1, 3–7, and 9–28. The predicted exons 2 and 8 (NCBI gene number 226025) are not present in the cDNA of these TRPM3 variants from mouse, but 18 amino acid residues encoded by the corresponding exon 8 have been detected in the recently described human hTRPM3f variant (12Lee N. Chen J. Wu S. Sun L. Huang M. Levesque P.C. Rich A. Feder J.N. Gray K.R. Lin J.H. Janovitz E.B. Blanar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Exon 2 encodes a 59-amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino terminal part of the human TRPM31325 variant (13Grimm C.M. Kraft R. Sauerbruch S. Schultz G. Harteneck C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21493-21501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) but is absent in the a–f variants of hTRPM3. Exon 1 codes for a completely novel amino terminal sequence that is not present in any of the already described human TRPM3 variants. Among 13 independent mouse cDNA clones, we could not find a single one that contained exon 1 together with 2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that these exons are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion. This could be explained either by tightly regulated posttranscriptional processing or by expression of these variants from alternative promoters. Starting from residue 156, however, mouse TRPM3 proteins show ∼97% amino acid sequence identity to the human variants. Therein, mouse TRPM3α1 corresponds to human TRPM3c, mTRPM3α2 to hTRPM3a, mTRPM3α3 to hTRPM3b, mTRPM3α4 to hTRPM3e and mTRPMα5 to hTRPM3d (Fig. 1C). The close correspondence between the respective mouse and human transcripts indicates that not only the amino acid sequence but also the splice events are highly conserved between mouse and human. Such strong conservation is highly suggestive of functional importance of TRPM3 proteins generally but also of their regulation and modification by alternative splicing. Expression Pattern of TRPM3—We subsequently analyzed the expression pattern of the mouse Trpm3 gene by Northern blot and by in situ hybridization (Fig. 2). We found Trpm3 expression in brain and eye with transcripts of ∼1.8, ∼2.6, ∼3.7, ∼5.8, ∼7.6, ∼9.4, >12, and >15 kb. (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous results (13Grimm C.M. Kraft R. Sauerbruch S. Schultz G. Harteneck C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21493-21501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we could not detect Trpm3 transcripts in mouse kidney by Northern blot (data not shown). In situ hybridization experiments showed Trpm3 transcripts in several regions of the mouse brain such as the dentate gyrus, the intermediate lateral septal nuclei, the indusium griseum, and the tenia tecta (Fig. 2, C and D). Strongest Trpm3 expression was found in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus (Fig. 2, B–D) where transcripts could readily be detected in 20 μg of total RNA (Fig. 2A). TRPM3α1 and TRPM3α2 Form Cation Channels Regulated by Intracellular Mg2+—Alternative splicing within exon 24 of both the mouse and the human TRPM3 gene leads to the presence of 12 additional amino acid residues and the additional replacement of an alanine by a proline residue (Fig. 1D) (12Lee N. Chen J. Wu S. Sun L. Huang M. Levesque P.C. Rich A. Feder J.N. Gray K.R. Lin J.H. Janovitz E.B. Blanar M.A. J. Biol.

Huang M. Levesque P.C. Rich A. Feder J.N. Gray K.R. Lin J.H. Janovitz E.B. Blanar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) but absent in all other variants, lies between the presumed fifth and sixth transmembrane domains (Fig. 1C). In analogy to the topologically similar members of the TRPV subfamily (19Voets T. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is likely that this part of the protein contributes to the pore-forming region of the channel (Fig. 1D). The variants TRPM3α1 and TRPM3α2 differ only in this region (Fig. 1, C and D). We set out to test whether this change in the primary sequence altered the biophysical characteristics of the resulting ion channels. To this end, we expressed TRPM3 variants in HEK-293 cells, which do not express TRPM3 endogenously (Fig. 2A). Starting with TRPM3α1, we noticed that transfected cells, but not control cells, exhibit a constitutively active, outwardly rectifying current. This current was already visible directly after establishing the whole cell configuration (Fig. 3, A and B). Replacing the extracellular cations by the impermeant cation N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) shifted the reversal potential from -9.5 ± 0.5 to -66.2 ± 0.8 mV (n = 5), indicating that the current was predominately carried by cations (Fig. 3A). When we used pipette solutions without Mg2+, TRPM3α1-induced currents increased strongly within the first minutes of whole cell recording (Fig. 3, B and C). Conversely, when we increased the free Mg2+ concentration in the recording pipette to 9 mm (Fig. 3, C and D), TRPM3α1-induced currents vanished rapidly. Using 0.9 mm free Mg2+ in the recording pipette, currents of intermediate size were observed (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that TRPM3α1 is regulated by physiological concentrations of free intracellular Mg2+, which typically is found to be in the order of 0.5–1 mm (20Romani A.M. Scarpa A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D720-D734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next turned to TRPM3α2 and asked whether this variant also forms a functional channel. In extracellular Ringer solution, TRPM3α2 currents were small and increased only slightly during prolonged recording (Fig. 4A). However, when we again replaced all extracellular cations with NMDG+, we observed large outward currents, which disappeared as soon as standard conditions were re-established (Fig. 4, A and B). Such currents were not observed in control cells measured under identical conditions. The absence of detectable inward currents under these conditions indicates that, similar to TRPM3α1, the TRPM3α2-induced conductance is mainly permeable to cations. We then tested whether intracellular Mg2+ also regulated TRPM3α2 channels. Very similar to our results with TRPM3α1, we found large currents in the absence of intracellular Mg2+ but no detectable currents with 7 mm free Mg2+ in the pipette solution (Fig. 4C). Therefore, block by intracellular Mg2+ appears to be a common property of the two splice variants. Block by intracellular Mg2+, however, is not a unique feature of TRPM3 channels but has also been described for the related ion channels TRPM6 (21Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W.

TRPM7 has been shown to be endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells and is thought to be the molecular correlate of an endogenous current that has been named MagNuM (22Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) or MIC (23Kozak J.A. Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented above we have taken several measures to ensure that the contribution of the endogenous MagNuM/MIC current does not compromise our data. 1) We verified that current densities in control cells examined under identical conditions were much smaller than current densities in transfected cells (Figs. 3B and 4, A and B). 2) Measurements with divalent free extracellular solutions (NMDG solution, Table I) were performed within 90 s of establishing the whole cell configuration (Figs. 3A and 4, A and B). At that time point, the endogenous MagNuM/MIC current still is very small (Ref. 22Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar and data not shown). 3) For the experiments shown in Fig. 4C, we added 10 mm Mg2+ to the NMDG solution. This avoids any increase of outward current densities in control cells compared with the current density in standard Ringer solution (data not shown). Despite these precautions, however, the formal possibility exists that the observed outwardly rectifying currents do not flow through TRPM3 proteins but result from up-regulation of endogenous TRPM7 channels. We found, however, that the currents in TRPM3α1-expressing cells exhibited a time-dependent facilitation upon depolarization to values higher than +60 mV (Fig. 3E, arrows), similar to those described for TRPM4, TRPM5, and TRPM8 (4Nilius B.

On the other hand, the small GTPase Rac, essential for the gp91phox activity, is likely dispensable to the Nox3 system.

The prototype Nox enzyme gp91phox, also termed Nox2, is predominantly expressed in professional phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, and tightly associates with the membrane-integrated protein p22phox to form cytochrome b558; the association stabilizes both proteins (5Quinn M.T.

The activation of gp91phox requires the two specialized proteins p47phox and p67phox, each containing two SH3 domains, and the small GTPase Rac (Fig. 1B).

A mutant p67phox carrying the substitution of Glu for Arg-102 in the third TPR fails to interact with Rac and is incapable of supporting superoxide production by gp91phox (36Koga H. Terasawa H.

In addition, the deletion of a region C-terminal to the Rac-binding domain in p67phox (amino acid residues 200–212), a so-called activation domain, or the V204A substitution leads to an impaired activation of gp91phox (38Hata K.

This Nox protein is also inactive without the SH3-harboring regulatory proteins. Activation of Nox1 occurs in the presence of both Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and Noxa1 (Nox activator 1), novel respective homologues of p47phox and p67phox, even without cell stimulants such as PMA (44Bánfi B.

Because substitution of Ala for Val-205 of Noxa1, corresponding to Val-204 of the classical activator p67phox, results in a loss of superoxide production by gp91phox (48Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the activation domain of Noxa1 may be also involved in the gp91phox activation; however its role in the Nox1 activity remains unclarified. Nox3 has been initially identified as the third oxidase abundant in the human fetal kidney (49Kikuchi H. Hikage M. Miyashita H. Fukumoto M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 254: 237-243Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 50Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). This oxidase has been recently shown to be highly expressed in the inner ear of mouse and involved in formation of otoconia, tiny mineralized structures, which is required for perception of balance and gravity; mouse mutations in Nox3 result in a head tilt phenotype because of a lack of otoconia (51Paffenholz R. Bergstrom R.A. Pasutto F. Wabnitz P. Munroe R.J. Jagla W. Heinzmann U. Marquardt A. Bareiss A. Laufs J. Russ A. Stumm G. Schimenti J.C. Bergstrom D.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two groups of investigators have very recently reported Nox3 regulation by oxidase organizers and activators (48Cheng G.

Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46065-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cheng et al. (48Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Nox3 is inactive in the absence of the organizers and activators but can be activated by Noxo1 alone and also by p67phox alone, but to a lesser extent; the p67phox-dependent activation is further enhanced by p47phox. On the other hand, Bánfi et al. (52Bánfi B. Malgrange B. Knisz J. Steger K. Dubois-Dauphin M. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46065-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) have shown that Nox3 on its own generates low levels of ROS in a PMA-dependent manner, whereas full activation of Nox3 requires both an organizer and an activator. Thus the effects of the regulatory proteins on the Nox3 activity are somewhat controversial. In addition, whether p22phox participates in the Nox3 system has remained to be elucidated. The role of Rac in the Nox3-dependent superoxide production has also remained unknown. In the present study, we show that ectopic expression of Nox3 in a variety of cells leads to superoxide production without cell stimulants such as PMA. The superoxide-producing activity of Nox3 absolutely requires p22phox and Nox3 is coimmunoprecipitated with p22phox, indicating that Nox3 forms a functional complex with p22phox. The oxidase organizers and activators, each being dispensable for the Nox3 activity, can modulate the superoxide production by Nox3. In the absence of the activators, p47phox and Noxo1 can enhance the Nox3 activity, which requires the interaction of the organizers with p22phox, further supporting a link between Nox3 and p22phox. The p47phox-induced enhancement can be facilitated by p67phox and Noxa1, whereas these activators have an ability to suppress the Noxo1-mediated enhancement. In contrast to these possible regulatory roles of the organizers and activators, Rac does not appear to be involved in the Nox3 activity. Chemicals—PMA was purchased from Research Biochemicals International, diphenyleneiodonium chloride was purchased from Sigma, and GF109203X was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. Other chemicals used were of the highest purity commercially available. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA for human Nox3 was cloned by PCR, using a human fetal kidney cDNA library (Clontech) as a template with two specific primers, 5′-CGAGGATCCATGATGGGGTGCTGGATTTT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGTGAATTCAGAAGCTCTCCTTGTTGTAAT-3′ (reverse primer). The human Nox3 cDNA obtained encodes the full-length protein containing 568 amino acid residues, the sequence of which is identical to that previously reported by Cheng et al. (50Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The human cDNAs encoding gp91phox/Nox2, Nox1, p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, Noxo1, Noxa1, a dominant negative form of Rac1 with the T17N substitution, and a constitutively active form of Rac1 with the Q61L substitution were prepared as described previously (36Koga H.

The cDNA fragment for the tandem SH3 domains of Noxo1 (amino acids 154–292), Noxo1-(SH3)2, was constructed by PCR using the human Noxo1 cDNA. Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA fragments were ligated to the indicated expression vectors. All the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities. Transfection of cDNAs Encoding Nox3, gp91phox, p22phox, and Cytosolic Regulatory Proteins in COS-7, Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)293, HeLa, or CHO Cells—The cDNAs for Nox3 and gp91phox were ligated to the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were ligated to the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (53Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). p47phox and Noxo1 were constructed for expression as an HA-tagged protein, p67phox and Noxa1 as a Myc-tagged protein, and p22phox as a protein without a tag. Transfection of the monkey kidney COS-7 cells and HeLa cells with the cDNAs was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), whereas FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfection of the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells and the HEK293 cells. Superoxide-producing Activity of Cells Expressing Nox3 or gp91phox— The transfected cells were cultured for 30 h and harvested by incubation with trypsin/EDTA for 1 min at 37 °C. After being washed with Hepes-buffered saline (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 17 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), the cells were tested for estimation of the superoxide-producing activity. The activity was determined by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence with an enhancer-containing luminol-based detection system (DIOGE-NES, National Diagnostics), as described previously (30Ago T.

After the addition of the enhanced luminol-based substrate, the cells were stimulated at 37 °C with 200 ng/ml of PMA. The chemiluminescence was assayed at 37 °C using a luminometer (Auto Lumat LB953, EG&G Berthold). The superoxide-producing activity was too low to be reliably measured by the cytochrome c reduction method (29Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

The resultant pellet was used as the membrane fraction for detection of the p22phox protein. On the other hand, total cell lysates of CHO and COS-7 cells were used for estimation of expression of p47phox, p67phox, Noxo1, and Noxa1. Membrane fractions or total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with anti-p22phox polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-integrin β1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance Research Products), or an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science).

https://openalex.org/W2056977665,"Benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (BOA) is an allelochemical most commonly associated with monocot species, formed from the O-glucoside of 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one by a two-step degradation process. The capacity of Arabidopsis to detoxify exogenously supplied BOA was analyzed by quantification of the major known metabolites BOA-6-OH, BOA-6-O-glucoside, and glucoside carbamate, revealing that detoxification occurs predominantly through O-glucosylation of the intermediate BOA-6-OH, most likely requiring the sequential action of as-yet-unidentified cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucosyltransferase activities. Transcriptional profiling experiments were also performed with Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to BOA concentrations, representing I50 and I80 levels based on root elongation inhibition assays. One of the largest functional categories observed for BOA-responsive genes corresponded to protein families known to participate in cell rescue and defense, with the majority of these genes potentially associated with chemical detoxification pathways. Further experiments using a subset of these genes revealed that many are also transcriptionally induced by a variety of structurally diverse xenobiotic compounds, suggesting they comprise components of a coordinately regulated, broad specificity xenobiotic defense response. The data significantly expand upon previous studies examining plant transcriptional responses to allelochemicals and other environmental toxins and provide novel insights into xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms in plants."

Here, we analyze the TCR sequences of a natural gammadelta T cell population specific for the major histocompatibility complex class Ib molecule T22. We find that T22 recognition correlates strongly with a somatically recombined TCRdelta complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) motif derived from germ line-encoded residues. Sequence diversity around these residues modulates TCR ligand-binding affinities, whereas V gene usage correlates mainly with tissue origin. These results show how an antigen-specific gammadelta TCR repertoire can be generated at a high frequency and suggest that gammadelta T cells recognize a limited number of antigens."

We present an explanatory framework for caste evolution in the eusocial wasp genus Polistes (Vespidae), which is a model system for insect eusocial evolution. We hypothesize that Polistes worker and gyne castes stem from two developmental pathways that characterized the bivoltine life cycle of a solitary ancestor. Through individual-based simulations, we show that our mechanistic framework can reproduce colony-level characteristics of Polistes and, thereby, that social castes can emerge from solitary regulatory pathways. Our explanatory framework illustrates, by specific example, a changed perspective for understanding insect social evolution."

Here, we reveal that the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx) Tpx1 is required for the peroxide-induced activation of Pap1. Tpx1, like other eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs, is highly sensitive to oxidation, which inactivates its thioredoxin peroxidase activity.

Indeed, in contrast to the previously described role for Tpx1 in the activation of the Sty1 stress-activated protein kinase by peroxide, we find that both catalytic cysteines of Tpx1 are required for Pap1 activation. Moreover, overexpression of the conserved sulfiredoxin Srx1, which interacts with and reduces Tpx1, allows rapid activation of Pap1 at higher concentrations of H2O2. Conversely, loss of Srx1 prevents the reduction of oxidized Tpx1 and prolongs the inhibition of Pap1 activation.

Oxidative stress, the intracellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and proposed as a molecular cause of aging (1Beckman K.B.

Reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anions (O·), and hydroxyl radicals (OH·), are generated as by-products of cellular metabolism and as a result of exposure to UV light and other environmental agents (3Halliwell B.

Reactive oxygen species are also employed as intracellular signaling molecules by pathways involved in proliferation, stress responses, mating behavior, and apoptosis. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species activate signaling pathways as part of the oxidative stress response to restore homeostasis by increasing the expression of genes encoding antioxidant and repair proteins.2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys Prxs) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-Cys Prx, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DEM, diethylmaleate; IAA, iodoacetamide; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: 2-Cys Prx, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DEM, diethylmaleate; IAA, iodoacetamide; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase. are extremely abundant and highly conserved thioredoxin peroxidase enzymes with important roles in resistance to oxidative stress (4Hofmann B.

The catalytic mechanism of these enzymes involves two conserved cysteine residues; the “peroxidatic” and the “resolving” cysteines. During the catalytic breakdown of peroxide, the peroxidatic cysteine thiol is oxidized by peroxide to a sulfenic acid. The reduction of the enzyme to its original active redox state occurs by a mechanism involving thioredoxin and the resolving cysteine. The sulfenic acid derivative of the peroxidatic cysteine can be further oxidized to an inactive sulfinic form that cannot be reduced by thioredoxin (8Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B.

Science. 2004; 304: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the sulfiredoxin Srx1 forms a peroxide-induced disulfide with the 2-Cys Prx Tsa1 and reduces the sulfinic acid to a sulfenic acid form that can then be further reduced by thioredoxin (9Biteau B. Laberre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Orthologues of Srx1 are conserved in mammals and have been shown to be involved in reduction of the sulfinic acid form of 2-Cys Prx from humans (11Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that the susceptibility of the thioredoxin peroxidase activity of eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs to inactivation allows increasing levels of H2O2 to activate peroxide signaling (8Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that 2-Cys Prxs have active roles in peroxide signaling in both budding yeast (13Ross S.J. Findlay V.J. Malakasi P. Morgan B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and fission yeast (14Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, our recent studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe demonstrated that the 2-Cys Prx Tpx1 is required for the peroxide-induced activation of Sty1, the S. pombe homologue of the p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase, through the formation of a peroxide-induced disulfide between the peroxidatic cysteine of Tpx1 and a cysteine residue of Sty1 (14Veal E.A.

Interestingly, unlike the thioredoxin peroxidase activity of Tpx1, the regulation of Sty1 by Tpx1 does not require the resolving cysteine (14Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 15Koo K.H. Lee S. Jeong S.Y. Kim E.T. Kim H.J. Kim K. Song K. Chae H.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that the S. cerevisiae 2-Cys Prx, Tsa1, has a peroxidase-independent chaperone activity that is important in protecting cells from heat stress (6Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs have thioredoxin peroxidase-independent roles in signal transduction and protection of cells from stress.In S. pombe, different levels of H2O2 induce distinct patterns of oxidative stress-induced gene expression (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bähler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). These different transcriptional responses are dependent on the AP-1-like transcription factor Pap1 and the Atf1 transcription factor, which are related to the mammalian transcription factors Nrf2 and ATF2, respectively (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The transcriptional response to low levels of H2O2 is dependent on Pap1, whereas Atf1 is more important at higher levels (Fig. 1) (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In unstressed conditions Pap1 associates with the nuclear export factor Crm1, ensuring that Pap1 remains cytoplasmic (18Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, following stress Pap1 becomes oxidized, inhibiting its association with Crm1 and resulting in the nuclear accumulation of Pap1 (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N.

Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Atf1 is phosphorylated by the Sty1 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), although the role of this phosphorylation is unknown (22Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Whereas Sty1 and Atf1 are increasingly activated by increasing levels of peroxide (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), in contrast Pap1 is oxidized and accumulates in the nucleus much more rapidly at low levels of peroxide than at higher levels (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the induction of Pap1-dependent genes is reduced, and Atf1-dependent transcription increases as peroxide levels increase (Fig. 1). The molecular mechanism(s) by which Pap1 oxidation and activation are inhibited at increased peroxide concentrations is unknown.In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae the Gpx3 peroxidase is directly involved in the peroxide-induced oxidation and nuclear accumulation of the Yap1 transcription factor (23Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M-B. Vihn J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In contrast, here we show that the single orthologue of Gpx3 in S. pombe, Gpx1, is not required for the peroxide-induced activation of Pap1. Instead, we reveal that the 2-Cys Prx Tpx1 is essential for the peroxide-induced oxidation and nuclear accumulation of Pap1. Furthermore, both catalytic cysteines of Tpx1 are required for the regulation of Pap1, in contrast to the Tpx1-dependent regulation of the peroxide-induced activation of the Sty1 SAPK (14Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We propose that the inhibition of Pap1 activation by increasing peroxide concentrations is due to increased oxidation of Tpx1, inactivating the thioredoxin peroxidase activity. In support of this model, we demonstrate that the overexpression of srx1+, which encodes the S. pombe orthologue of the Srx1 sulfiredoxin in S. cerevisiae, reduces the peroxide-induced oxidation of Tpx1 and promotes the nuclear accumulation of Pap1 at higher levels of H2O2. Furthermore, deletion of the srx1+ gene prevents reduction of oxidized Tpx1, inhibiting the peroxide-induced nuclear accumulation of Pap1 and Pap1-dependent gene expression at higher concentrations of H2O2. Thus, we propose that the levels of H2O2 and the peroxide-induced expression of the Sty1-regulated gene srx1+ together control the redox state of the peroxidatic cysteine of Tpx1 and thus act as the key determinants of the pattern of gene expression induced by different levels of oxidative stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth Media—The S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) and Rep41FLAG (gift from S. Whitehall). The Tpx1-expressing plasmids used were Rep1tpx1+, Rep1tpx1C48S, and Rep1tpx1C169S (14Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Chromosomal tagging was performed using plasmids based on Rep42PkC (26Craven A.R. Griffiths D.J.F. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. Gene. 1998; 221: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Gene Tagging and Strain Construction—Strains were constructed that express either Pap1 (SB3) or Tpx1 (AD1) tagged at the C terminus with 3xPk epitopes from their normal genomic locus, respectively. ∼500 bp of the C terminus of the coding region of Pap1 and the whole coding region of Tpx1 were amplified by PCR and ligated into PstI/BamH1-digested or NdeI/BamH1-digested Rep42PkC derivatives, respectively. These plasmids were linearized and introduced into CHP429 cells to create SB3 and AD1, respectively. Strains containing Pk epitope-tagged Pap1 and either Δtpx1 (SB4) or Δsty1 (SB5) were generated from a cross between SB3 and either VX00 or JP140, respectively. The SB6 (Δsrx1) and SB13 (Δgpx1) strains were generated using specific ura4+ disruption cassettes created by PCR with oligonucleotide primers containing 90 bp of DNA upstream and downstream of the chosen open reading frame. The disruption cassettes were introduced into either CHP429 or CHP428 to create SB6 and SB13, respectively. An h+ Δsrx1 strain (SB7) was obtained from a cross between SB6 and CHP428. SB8 (Δsrx1 Pap1-Pk) and SB9 (Δsrx1 Tpx1-Pk) were from crosses between SB7 and either SB3 or AD1, respectively. SB14 was from a cross between SB13 and SB3. The DNA sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in strain construction are available on request.RNA Analysis—Cells were grown to mid-log phase in either EMM2 or YE5S medium and then harvested. RNA extraction (27Sambrook I. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Section 7. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and Northern blotting with gene-specific probes were performed as described previously (28Morgan B.A. Bouquin N. Merrill G.F. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of oligonucleotide primers used to obtain specific probes are available on request.Sensitivity Tests—The sensitivity of mutant strains to peroxide were compared by halo tests; ∼2 × 106 cells were pipetted along separate lines radially from the edge of the plate toward a disk soaked in 5 μl of 15% (v/v) H2O2. Plates were examined after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. The small zone of growth inhibition of wild type cells around a peroxide-soaked filter gives only a small window for detecting increases in resistance. Therefore, spot tests were used to examine potential increases in the resistance of wild-type cells; 10-fold dilutions of cultures, grown to mid-log phase in EMM2, were spotted onto EMM2 agar plates containing the indicated concentrations of the more thermostable peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, using a 96-well plate replica plater (Sigma-Aldrich).Indirect Immunofluorescence—To examine the intracellular localization of Pap1, mid-log phase growing cells were harvested from cultures treated with H2O2 or diethylmaleate (DEM), fixed with paraformaldehyde, and analyzed using the immunofluorescence protocol described previously (29Veal E.A. Toone W.M. Jones N. Morgan B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35523-35531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated overnight at room temperature with an an anti-Pk primary antibody (mouse anti-Pk-TAG; Serotec) and detected using a 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Pk epitope-tagged Pap1 was visualized by excitation at 450–490 nm using a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective and the Axiovision digital imaging system.Detecting the Redox State of Tpx1 and Pap1—To examine the oxidation state of Tpx1 or Pap1, exponentially growing cells expressing either Pk epitope-tagged Tpx1 or Pap1 were harvested, and lysates were then prepared by acid lysis with trichloroacetic acid (30Delaunay A. Isnard A-D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In the case of Pap1, these lysates were also treated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on non-reducing 15% (Tpx1) or 8% (Pap1) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a Protran® nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience). Mouse anti-Pk primary antibodies (mouse anti-Pk-TAG; Serotec) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used to detect epitope-tagged Pap1 or Tpx1, which were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation of Srx1—Exponentially growing cells were harvested and lysates were prepared as described previously (29Veal E.A. Toone W.M. Jones N. Morgan B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35523-35531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged Srx1 was partially purified from duplicate samples of lysates using anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a non-reducing 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose (see above). FLAG-Srx1 was detected on one-half of the membrane using anti-FLAG (M2) primary antibodies (Sigma), and Pk epitope-tagged Tpx1 was detected on the other half using anti-Pk primary antibodies (mouse anti-Pk-TAG; Serotec). Both halves were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma), and proteins were visualized as described above.RESULTSTpx1 Regulates Pap1-dependent Gene Expression—It has recently been shown that increased expression of antioxidant enzymes with peroxidase activity, such as the glutathione peroxidase Gpx1, stimulates the peroxide-induced nuclear accumulation of Pap1 (21Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, in S. cerevisiae an orthologue of Gpx1, the Gpx3 peroxidase, acts as a redox sensor and transducer for the peroxide-induced activation of Yap1 (23Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M-B. Vihn J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Hence, to investigate whether Gpx1 is required for the peroxide-induced activation of Pap1, a Δgpx1 mutant was constructed. Examination of the peroxide-sensitivity revealed that the Δgpx1 mutant was much less sensitive to peroxide than a Δpap1 mutant (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Gpx1 does not play a major role in the regulation of Pap1. Moreover, the peroxide-induced expression of the Pap1-dependent gene trr1+, which encodes thioredoxin reductase (18Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), was not inhibited by loss of Gpx1 expression (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that Pap1 is normally activated by a Gpx1-independent mechanism(s) in response to peroxide.Fig. 2Tpx1, but not Gpx1, is required for the regulation of Pap1-dependent gene expression.A, cells of the wild-type control (CHP429), Δtpx1 (VX00), Δgpx1 (SB13), and Δpap1 (TP108–3c) strains were evenly distributed along a radial line from the edge of an agar plate toward a central disk soaked in H2O2 and then incubated at 30 °C. B, Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from cells of the wild-type control (CHP429), Δgpx1 (SB13), Δpap1 (TP108–3c), and Δtpx1 (VX00) strains treated with 0.2 mm H2O2 for 0, 20, or 40 min. Gene-specific probes were used to examine the expression of the indicated genes. The level of trr1+ RNA was quantified relative to the leu1+ loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recently, we demonstrated that the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin Tpx1 regulates peroxide-induced activation of Sty1 and Atf1 (14Veal E.A.

Furthermore, the peroxide-induced expression of the ctt1+ gene encoding catalase is dependent on Tpx1 (14Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The expression of ctt1+ has been shown to be regulated by both the Pap1 and Atf1 transcription factors (Fig. 1) (16Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether Tpx1 regulates Pap1 activity we examined the effect of loss of tpx1+ on the peroxide-induced expression of trr1+, a gene whose expression is dependent on Pap1 but not on Atf1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown) (18Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Analyses of RNA isolated from wild-type, Δpap1, and Δtpx1 strains revealed that Tpx1, like Pap1, was required for the peroxide-induced expression of trr1+ (Fig. 2B). It was unlikely that the complete absence of any peroxide-induced increase in trr1+ expression in Δtpx1 cells was due to the reduced peroxide-induced activation of Sty1 in these cells (14Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), as it has previously been shown that trr1+ expression is induced by 0.2 mm H2O2 even in a Δsty1 strain (18Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Indeed, the similar effects of the loss of Pap1 or Tpx1 on peroxide-induced expression of trr1+ (Fig. 2B) suggest that Tpx1 is a key regulator of Pap1 activity in S. pombe.Tpx1 Is Specifically Required for the Peroxide-induced Nuclear Accumulation and Oxidation of Pap1—Previous data revealed that Pap1 is predominantly regulated through alteration of its cellular distribution in response to oxidative stress (18Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined whether Tpx1 was required for the peroxide-induced nuclear accumulation of Pap1 by indirect immunofluorescent analyses using anti-Pk antibodies of tpx1+ and Δtpx1 cells expressing Pk epitope-tagged Pap1 from its normal chromosomal locus. As expected, Pap1 was detected in the nucleus of tpx1+ cells within 5 min following treatment with 0.2 mm H2O2 and was excluded again from the nucleus by 60 min (Fig. 3A). In contrast, there was no detectable accumulation of Pap1 in the nuclei of Δtpx1 cells at any time point following treatment with 0.2 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3A). Importantly, re-introduction of the wild-type tpx1+ gene into Δtpx1 cells restored the peroxide-induced nuclear a"

We used a combination of genetic and biogeochemical markers to produce a direct field estimate of assortative mating in phytophagous insect populations. We show that individuals of the same insect species, the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis, that develop on different host plants can display almost absolute reproductive isolation-the proportion of assortative mating was >95%-even in the absence of temporal or spatial isolation."

This study analyzed the role of oxidative stress as a mechanism of the dopaminergic neurotoxicity produced by the combined paraquat and maneb model of the Parkinson disease phenotype. Transgenic mice overexpressing either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase or intracellular glutathione peroxidase and non-transgenic mice were exposed to saline, paraquat, or the combination of paraquat + maneb twice a week for 9 weeks. Non-transgenic mice chronically exposed to paraquat + maneb exhibited significant reductions in locomotor activity, levels of striatal dopamine and metabolites, and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, no corresponding effects were observed in either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase transgenic mice. Similarly, the increase in levels of lipid hydroperoxides in the midbrain and striatum of paraquat + maneb-treated non-transgenic mice was not detected in either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase transgenic mice. To begin to determine critical pathways of paraquat + maneb neurotoxicity, the functions of cell death-inducing and protective mechanisms were analyzed. Even a single injection of paraquat + maneb in the non-transgenic treated group modulated several key pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, Bad, Bcl-xL, and upstream stress-induced cascade. Collectively, these findings support the assertion that protective mechanisms against paraquat + maneb-induced neurodegeneration could involve modulation of the level of reactive oxygen species and alterations of the functions of specific signaling cascades. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease based on its role in the cascade of biochemical changes that lead to dopaminergic neuronal death. This study analyzed the role of oxidative stress as a mechanism of the dopaminergic neurotoxicity produced by the combined paraquat and maneb model of the Parkinson disease phenotype. Transgenic mice overexpressing either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase or intracellular glutathione peroxidase and non-transgenic mice were exposed to saline, paraquat, or the combination of paraquat + maneb twice a week for 9 weeks. Non-transgenic mice chronically exposed to paraquat + maneb exhibited significant reductions in locomotor activity, levels of striatal dopamine and metabolites, and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, no corresponding effects were observed in either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase transgenic mice. Similarly, the increase in levels of lipid hydroperoxides in the midbrain and striatum of paraquat + maneb-treated non-transgenic mice was not detected in either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase transgenic mice. To begin to determine critical pathways of paraquat + maneb neurotoxicity, the functions of cell death-inducing and protective mechanisms were analyzed. Even a single injection of paraquat + maneb in the non-transgenic treated group modulated several key pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, Bad, Bcl-xL, and upstream stress-induced cascade. Collectively, these findings support the assertion that protective mechanisms against paraquat + maneb-induced neurodegeneration could involve modulation of the level of reactive oxygen species and alterations of the functions of specific signaling cascades.

A lack of evidence for heritability of the idiopathic form of PD has pointed to environmental risk factors as potential contributors to the disease etiology. In accord with that possibility, exposures to environmental agents have been linked repeatedly with the development of PD (1Tanner C.M.

Animal models, epidemiological studies, and clinical case reports have repeatedly identified exposure to the herbicide paraquat (PQ) and the fungicide maneb (MB) as potential risk factors for the PD phenotype (1Tanner C.M.

Neurology. 1998; 50: 1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratories have demonstrated extensively that exposure to the combination of PQ + MB produces a potentiated loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc of mice compared with either compound alone (16Thiruchelvam M. Richfield E.K. Baggs R.B. Tank A.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model exemplifies the “multiple hit” hypothesis associated with PD. Furthermore, the neurotoxicity of PQ + MB seems to be highly selective to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Additionally, we have shown that exposure during critical periods of development and during advanced age as well as gender and genetic background all modify the susceptibility and response of dopaminergic neurons to PQ and MB (17Thiruchelvam M. McCormack A. Richfield E.K. Baggs R.B. Tank A.W. Di Monte D.A. Cory-Slechta D.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 589Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Thiruchelvam M. Richfield E.K.

Neurosci. 2004; 19: 845Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms by which low chronic exposures to pesticides induce a Parkinson disease phenotype in experimental models are not known, several have been shown, even at relatively low levels to produce excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Until recently, these chemically induced ROS that lead to oxidative stress have been investigated for their ability to cause (often nonspecific) damage to intracellular molecules. However, current advances in understanding the importance of oxidative species in the regulation of signal transduction pathways suggest additional mechanisms of toxicity. It is very likely that the specific mechanism(s) of neurotoxicity of systematic exposure to low levels of PQ + MB involve several targets. Studies to date have only examined the effects of each compound alone and mostly involved in vitro assays, acute exposures, or intracerebral administration of these xenobiotics. PQ is known as a potent redox cycler, which in the presence of molecular oxygen can generate superoxide anions leading to oxidative stress and consequently neuronal cell damage or death (20Jones G.M. Vale J.A. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 123Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). There are also studies indicating the ability of PQ to cause oxidation of cellular NADPH and increased levels of lipid peroxidation (21Suntres Z.E. Toxicology. 2002; 180: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Intrahippocampal injection of PQ causes neuronal cell death in rats, mostly by apoptosis (22Melchiorri D. Del Duca C. Piccirilli S. Trombetta G. Bagetta G. Nistico G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of these rats with the free radical scavenger, U74389G, significantly reduced hippocampal injury. Intranigral injections of PQ in rats leads to the induction of oxidative stress, behavioral dysfunction, and physiological and neuropathological effects, all of which were prevented by pretreatment with M40401, a non peptidyl superoxide dismutase mimetic (23Mollace V. Iannone M. Muscoli C. Palma E. Granato T. Rispoli V. Nistico R. Rotiroti D. Salvemini D. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 335: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations have clearly demonstrated that paraquat causes neurotoxicity after intracerebroventricular or intracerebral injections in experimental animals. However, acute exposure using this route of administration does not exhibit selective neurotoxicity toward the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Although systemic administration of PQ has yielded varying outcomes in in vivo models, more recent studies have consistently shown selective dopaminergic cell loss in the SNpc (17Thiruchelvam M. McCormack A. Richfield E.K. Baggs R.B. Tank A.W. Di Monte D.A. Cory-Slechta D.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 589Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 25Widdowson P.S. Farnworth M.J. Upton R. Simpson M.G. Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 1996; 15: 583Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) of neurotoxicity of MB are currently less well understood. Commercial MB contains as a major active component manganese-ethylenebis-dithiocarbamate (Mn-EBDC) but also includes other inert compounds. Direct delivery of Mn-EBDC to the lateral ventricles produces selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rats (26Zhang J. Fitsanakis V.A. Gu G. Jing D. Ao M. Amarnath V. Montine T.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 336Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the ability of Mn-EBDC to inhibit preferentially mitochondrial complex III has been demonstrated. The Mn-EBDC complex has also been reported to produce oxidative stress by catalyzing catechol oxidation in vitro (27Fitsanakis V.A. Amarnath V. Moore J.T. Montine K.S. Zhang J. Montine T.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which may contribute to its selective neuronal vulnerability. A recent study (28Zhou Y. Shie F.S. Piccardo P. Montine T.J. Zhang J. Neuroscience. 2004; 128: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) provided evidence that in vitro exposure to Mn-EBDC is able to inhibit proteasomal function and induce α-synuclein aggregation. It was suggested that the neurotoxic effects as well as proteasomal inhibition were associated with oxidative stress because they were prevented by pretreatment with antioxidants. Mn-EBDC is metabolized to the EBDC anion and manganese, both of which are neurotoxic. EBDC alone was capable of enhancement of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced neurotoxicity (29McGrew D.M. Irwin I. Langston J.W. Neurotoxicology. 2000; 21: 309PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of neurotoxicity associated with exposure to the combination of these two pesticides are not yet known but are clearly of significance given its potential to induce a Parkinson disease phenotype. Although oxidative stress has been implicated repeatedly in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease, the role that ROS plays in mediating oxidative stress and subsequently nigrostriatal dopamine system neurotoxicity following exposure to PQ + MB has not been determined. To explore further the mechanism(s) and the role of antioxidant enzymes in the neurotoxicity associated with PQ + MB, transgenic mice overexpressing the corresponding human proteins were used in these studies. The use of SOD1 and Gpx1 transgenes also allows a comparison of the effectiveness of intracellular endogenous antioxidants targeting different reactive oxygen species. PQ neurotoxicity, for example, is thought to involve the generation of superoxide anions, which in the presence of excess Cu,Zn-SOD might lead to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide and modulation of neurotoxicity. This work demonstrates that overexpression of either Cu,Zn-SOD or GPx1 leads to significant neuroprotection against combined PQ + MB-induced DA neurotoxicity. Transgenic Mice and Treatment—The generation of transgenic mice with human GPx1 and SOD1 genes in a C57BL/6 × CBA/J background was reported previously (30Mirochnitchenko O. Palnitkar U. Philbert M. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8120Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Ishibashi N. Prokopenko O. Reuhl K.R. Mirochnitchenko O. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Ishibashi N. Prokopenko O. Weisbrot-Lefkowitz M. Reuhl K.R. Mirochnitchenko O. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mouse lines GPE23 and SOD42 containing 200 and 70 copies, respectively, of the corresponding human genes were used. Normal and transgenic animals for the experiments were obtained by breeding homozygous transgenic founders and non-transgenic mice with the same genetic background. SOD and GPx1 transgenic mice show increased activities of SOD and GPx1, respectively, in most tissues, as reported earlier. The total level of enzymatic activity in brain of corresponding enzyme was about 3.6 times higher in GPx1 animals and about 2.5 times higher in SOD transgenic mice. We also reported previously that neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial cells overproduce corresponding antioxidant enzymes (31Ishibashi N. Prokopenko O. Reuhl K.R. Mirochnitchenko O. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Animals were maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 25 °C and fed ad libitum. For PQ + MB treatment, non-transgenic and transgenic males matched for age were injected intraperitoneally twice a week for 9 weeks (a total of 18 injections) with saline, 5 mg/kg PQ, or 5 mg/kg PQ + 15 mg/kg MB. Mice were sacrificed 1 week after the last injection, and striatum, frontal cortex, and midbrain were dissected for various outcome measures. In a separate set of experiments, mice were treated with a single injection of saline or the doses of PQ + MB, as stated above, and sacrificed for analysis after 16 or 40 h. Tissues were harvested from striatum, midbrain, and frontal cortex for biochemical analysis. Experimental protocols have been approved by the University of Medicine and Dentistry Animal Care and Use Committee. Locomotor Activity—Automated locomotor activity chambers equipped with infrared photobeams (Opto-Varimex Minor, Columbus Instruments International Corp., Columbus, OH) were used to quantify locomotor activity. Photobeam breaks were recorded each minute for 45 min for horizontal, vertical, and ambulatory movements. Mice were habituated to the locomotor activity chambers in three 45-min sessions occurring on consecutive days, with all mice receiving intraperitoneal saline injections prior to the session. After the third habituation session, PQ + MB treatment began, and the effects on locomotor activity were assessed immediately and 24 h after injections 1, 4, 8, 14, 16, and 18. Activity was also measured 1 week following the last PQ + MB exposure to determine the persistence of effects. Dopamine and Metabolite Analyses—Neurotransmitter concentrations in the striatum and frontal cortex were measured 1 week following the last injection of saline, PQ, or PQ + MB. Following cervical dislocation and rapid decapitation, frontal cortex and striatal blocks were dissected. High pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection analysis was performed as described previously (33Thiruchelvam M. Brockel B.J. Richfield E.K. Baggs R.B. Cory-Slechta D.A. Brain Res. 2000; 873: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and normalized to protein concentration as measured by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The concentrations of the neurotransmitters were expressed in units of ng/mg of protein. Immunohistochemistry for Tyrosine Hydroxylase—Brains used for immunolabeling studies were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 week and subsequently stored in 30% sucrose. Fixed brains were cut into 30-μm coronal sections and collected in cryoprotectant. Sections were prepared as described previously (18Thiruchelvam M. Richfield E.K. Goodman B.M. Baggs R.B. Cory-Slechta D.A Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), incubating with a primary antibody to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 48 h, at a dilution of 1:4000, and with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for 24 h, at a dilution of 1:500. Sections were incubated with avidin/biotin solution using the Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) for 2 h and then developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride for 2–5 min. Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, counter-stained with cresyl violet for visualization of neuronal nuclei, and cover-slipped for stereological analysis. Stereological Analysis—After delineation of the SNpc at low magnification (×4 objective), one side of every fourth section from the entire midbrain region was sampled at higher magnification (×100 objective) using the stereology module of the Stereo Investigator imaging program (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT) with an Olympus Provis microscope. The optical fractionator method, an unbiased quantitative technique, was used for counting TH+ (TH-positive and cresyl violet-positive neurons) and TH- (cresyl violet-positive only) cells. Criteria for TH+ and TH- neurons were determined as described previously (19Thiruchelvam M.J. Powers J.M. Cory-Slechta D.A. Richfield E.K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 845Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Barlow B.K. Richfield E.K. Cory-Slechta D.A. Thiruchelvam M. Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mean thickness was determined by measuring two fields from five sections per sample, and the entire depth of field was sampled, ignoring the upper and lower 0.5 μm. All samples were evaluated by one experimenter without knowledge of mouse status. Paraquat Toxicokinetic Study—Male mice from all the three lines (nTg, Gpx1, and SOD) were treated with an acute dose of 5 mg/kg PQ + 15 mg/kg MB and sacrificed 1 h after exposure. This time point was chosen based on our previous paraquat toxicokinetic studies that suggest the peak levels of paraquat in tissue occur at this time point. Mice were perfused with saline to remove all blood from brain to reduce variability in sampling. The frontal cortex, striatum, midbrain, and cerebellum were dissected and weighed. The analysis of paraquat was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry using a Waters Alliance 2690 interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Classic instrument. The tissues were first extracted and then separated on a 5-μm (15 cm × 4.6 mm) Zorbax RX C8 reverse phase column, with gradient elution from a highly aqueous to a highly organic mobile phase. Paraquat was extracted from the brain using a microwave-assisted solvent extraction method. Roughly 30 mg of brain tissue was extracted in acetic acid and water. The mixture was sonicated and then extracted using a moderate power microwave program. The analyte was isolated from larger mass molecules using a 10-kDa microcentrifuge membrane. The analyte was ionized by electrospray ionization and extracted in positive mode. The spectrum was acquired in full scan (150–250 m/z and 150–1000 m/z) mode. The chromatograms for all brain extracts showed peaks corresponding to PQ (m/z 184–186). An m/z of 184 suggests other chemical species (possibly adducts) related to paraquat. A calibration curve using m/z of 186 was used and was linear over a concentration range of 0.4 to 25 ng. Paraquat concentration was expressed as ng/mg tissue. Lipid Peroxidation—Levels of lipid peroxidation were measured in tissue homogenates using the Lipid Peroxidation Assay Kit II (Calbiochem). Tissues were homogenized in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene (1:10 w/v ratio). Samples were pretreated with catalase for elimination of H2O2 interference. The assay is based on the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions by hydroperoxides under acidic conditions. Stable complex of ferric ions with the indicator dye xylenol orange was measured at 560 nm according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blotting—Proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis as reported previously (31Ishibashi N. Prokopenko O. Reuhl K.R. Mirochnitchenko O. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, tissue samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 1.5 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 mm glycerophosphate and 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate)). Samples were sonicated, and SDS-PAGE (5×) sample buffer was added to the final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were loaded on 10 or 15% PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed using specific antibodies. Blocking and antibody incubation solutions contained 5% nonfat dry milk. Milk was replaced with bovine serum albumin for testing phosphorylated proteins. Proteins were detected using the Western Lighting™ chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies tested included the following: rabbit anti-Bax, rabbit anti-Bcl-xL, rabbit anti-Bad, mouse anti-phospho-Bad (Ser-112), rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), rabbit anti-Bak, and rabbit anti-actin (all Cell Signaling Tech. Inc.). For quantitative analysis, bands on the films with linear exposure range were scanned on a model 300A densitometer using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analyses—Body weights were analyzed by using repeated measures analysis of variance with time as a “within the group factor” and treatment as a “between the group factor.” Total locomotor activity counts for each session, levels of DA and serotonin and metabolites and turnover, levels of PQ in toxicokinetic studies, and levels of Bax, Bcl-xL, Bad, and phospho-p44/42 MAPK were analyzed using two factor analysis of variance with transgene and treatment as between the group factors. Post-hoc assessments were carried out based on main effects or interactions as appropriate. For all analyses, p values of ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Gross Effects of Treatment—Body weights were monitored throughout the experimental duration. No treatment-related changes in body weights were observed in any of the groups at any time point during the course of the treatment. Locomotor Activity—Mice were habituated to the locomotor chambers during a 3-day period, and horizontal activity counts were evaluated. All mice were also injected with saline on these days to habituate them to the injection procedure. Mice within each line were randomly assigned to treatment groups to ensure similar base-line activity levels. Exposure to PQ alone and PQ + MB significantly decreased locomotor activity immediately following each injection, but only in the non-transgenic line, with a greater decrease observed in the PQ + MB-treated group as compared with PQ alone (data not shown). Both the GPx1 and SOD mice treated with either PQ alone or with PQ + MB displayed activity levels similar to the corresponding saline-treated mice. Additionally, only the PQ + MB-treated nTg mice showed residual reductions in locomotor activity when measured 24 h after injections, with all other groups returning to control levels at these time points. Locomotor activity was evaluated again 1 week after the last treatment, when analysis of variance confirmed a significant effect of transgenic status (F(2, 66) = 24.7, p < 0.0001) and an interaction of transgenic status and treatment (F(4, 66) = 2.58, p = 0.045). As shown in Fig. 1, the only group still demonstrating a significant decrease in locomotor activity 1 week post-termination of treatment was the nTg group treated with PQ + MB as compared with the saline and PQ alone treated groups (p = 0.01) (Fig. 1). Dopamine and Metabolite Analysis—Striatal and frontal cortical levels of DA, DOPAC, HVA, DA turnover, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and 5-HT were evaluated in tissues obtained 1 week post-treatment to preclude measurement of any acute effects of treatment (Fig. 2). At this time, significant effects of transgenic status in levels of striatal DA were found (F(2, 62) = 4.49, p = 0.01), with post-hoc analysis confirming a significant decrease (30%) in striatal DA only in the nTg group treated with PQ + MB (p < 0.05), without corresponding changes in either the GPx1 and SOD groups. Similarly, striatal DOPAC levels were reduced by PQ alone and by PQ + MB and HVA by PQ + MB only in nTg mice (both p < 0.05). GPx1 and SOD mice treated with PQ alone or PQ + MB showed no change in DA, DOPAC, or HVA levels as compared with their saline-treated counterparts. Striatal levels of 5-HT or its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and DA turnover analyzed as DOPAC + HVA)/DA or DOPAC/DA were unaffected by treatment in any of the groups (data not shown). Frontal cortical levels of DA, DOPAC, HVA, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, or 5-HT were also unaffected by treatment in any of the groups (data not shown). Stereological Analysis—Numbers of both dopaminergic (TH+) and non-dopaminergic (TH-) neurons in the SNpc were determined by unbiased stereology, and corresponding counts are depicted in Fig. 3. Non-transgenic mice treated with PQ alone showed an 18% decrease in TH+ neurons in the SNpc (p = 0.02). This is consistent with previous observations from our laboratory, where PQ alone failed to alter locomotor activity or decrease striatal DA levels but still resulted in loss of TH+ neurons in the SNpc. Additionally, nTg mice treated with the combination of PQ + MB showed a further decrease in the number of TH+ neurons (37%, p < 0.0001). This decrease was also significantly greater than the nTg mice treated with PQ alone (p = 0.02), suggesting a potentiated loss of TH+ neurons with combined exposure. No observable difference in non-dopaminergic neurons was observed. In contrast, no reductions in TH+ neurons were seen in response to PQ or to PQ + MB in either the GPx1- or SOD-treated groups. Paraquat Toxicokinetics—The concentration of PQ in different brain regions was quantified in the nTg, GPx1, and SOD mice to ascertain that the differences in toxicity were not because of differences in PQ toxicokinetics. PQ levels were determined in the striatum and midbrain, because these are the regions most affected by PQ and MB in the nTg mice. Analysis of variance showed that PQ levels in the nTg, GPx1, and SOD mice were significantly different in the striatum and midbrain (F(3, 13) = 9.7, p = 0.0012, and F(3, 13) = 12.7, p = 0.0004, respectively) (Fig. 4). Non-transgenic and GPx1 mice showed comparable PQ levels in both the striatum and midbrain, whereas SOD mice showed a significantly higher concentration of PQ in both regions than in either nTg or GPx1 mice. Although the mechanism associated with these transgenic differences in toxicokinetics is unknown at present, the observation demonstrates that the difference in dopamine neuroto"
https://openalex.org/W2067083561,"In yeast, aggregation and toxicity of the expanded polyglutamine fragment of human huntingtin strictly depend on the presence of the endogenous self-perpetuating aggregated proteins (prions), which contain glutamine/asparagine-rich domains. Some chaperones of the Hsp100/70/40 complex, modulating propagation of yeast prions, were also reported to influence polyglutamine aggregation in yeast, but it was not clear whether they do it directly or via affecting prions. Our data show that although some chaperone alterations indeed act on polyglutamines via curing endogenous prions, other alterations decrease size and ameliorate toxicity of polyglutamine aggregates without affecting prion propagation. Therefore, the role of yeast chaperones in polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity is not restricted only to their effects on the endogenous prions. Moreover, chaperone interactions with prion and polyglutamine aggregates appear to be of a highly specific nature. One and the same chaperone alteration, substitution A503V in the middle region of the chaperone Hsp104, exhibited opposite effects on one of the endogenous prions ([PSI+], the prion form of Sup35) and on polyglutamines, increasing aggregate size and toxicity in the former case and decreasing them in the latter case. On the other hand, different members of a single chaperone family exhibited opposite effects on one and the same type of aggregates: excess of the Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1 increased polyglutamine aggregate size and toxicity, whereas excess of the other Hsp40 chaperone, Sis1, decreased them. As many stress-defense proteins are conserved between yeast and mammals, these data shed light on possible mechanisms modulating polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity in mammalian cells. In yeast, aggregation and toxicity of the expanded polyglutamine fragment of human huntingtin strictly depend on the presence of the endogenous self-perpetuating aggregated proteins (prions), which contain glutamine/asparagine-rich domains. Some chaperones of the Hsp100/70/40 complex, modulating propagation of yeast prions, were also reported to influence polyglutamine aggregation in yeast, but it was not clear whether they do it directly or via affecting prions. Our data show that although some chaperone alterations indeed act on polyglutamines via curing endogenous prions, other alterations decrease size and ameliorate toxicity of polyglutamine aggregates without affecting prion propagation. Therefore, the role of yeast chaperones in polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity is not restricted only to their effects on the endogenous prions. Moreover, chaperone interactions with prion and polyglutamine aggregates appear to be of a highly specific nature. One and the same chaperone alteration, substitution A503V in the middle region of the chaperone Hsp104, exhibited opposite effects on one of the endogenous prions ([PSI+], the prion form of Sup35) and on polyglutamines, increasing aggregate size and toxicity in the former case and decreasing them in the latter case.

The hallmark of poly-Q diseases is the formation of insoluble cytosolic and nuclear inclusions (1Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Huntington disease is one of the best known poly-Q disorders (2The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7118) Google Scholar). It is caused by an expansion of the poly-Q stretch in the essential protein called huntingtin (Htt) to more than 37 amino acids. The length of the poly-Q stretch inversely correlates with the time of onset of the disease and the time of formation of Htt aggregates (3Martindale D. Hackam A. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L. Wellington C. McCutcheon K. Singaraja R. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Devon R. Kim S.U. Bredesen D.E. Tufaro F. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The role of various types of aggregates in cell toxicity remains a matter of debate (4Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Recent models propose that toxicity of poly-Q Htt arises from sequestration of certain essential proteins by Htt aggregates (5Perez M.K. Paulson H.L. Pendse S.J. Saionz S.J. Bonini N.M. Pittman R.N.

Ross C.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The poly-Q stretch is located within the N-terminal (exon 1) region of Htt, which is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions (8Li S. Li X. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 146-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment of Htt with poly-Q extensions, when expressed in mice, aggregated and was sufficient to cause Huntington disease-like neurodegeneration (9Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M.

This indicates that at least some parameters of poly-Q associated aggregation and toxicity could be reproduced in the experimental assays using only N-terminal poly-Q expanded fragments of Htt. Several models for studying poly-Q aggregation and toxicity have been developed by using simple organisms such as fruit flies (11Jackson G.R. Salecker I. Dong X. Yao X. Arnheim N. Faber P.W. MacDonald M.E. Zipursky S.L. Neuron. 1998; 3: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (427) Google Scholar), nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (12Faber P.W. Alter J.R. MacDonald M.E. Hart A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast assays usually employ short constructs derived from the poly-Q expanded exon 1 of Htt. Although poly-Q aggregation has been readily observed in yeast (13Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 14Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a yeast-based assay for poly-Q toxicity has not been available until recently. It turned out that efficient cytoplasmic aggregation and toxicity of the chimeric protein, containing the N-terminal region of Htt with expanded poly-Q stretch, fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), could be detected only in the yeast strains bearing an endogenous yeast QN-rich protein, Rnq1, in its prion form, called [RNQ+], or [PIN+] (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the absence of a prion, poly-Q aggregates are rarely found, and toxicity is not seen. Rnq1, a protein of unknown function, is one of several known yeast proteins containing QN-rich prion domains (19Chernoff Y.O. Mutat. Res. 2001; 488: 39-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Chernoff Y.O. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This group also includes Sup35, Ure2, and New1. Yeast prions are self-perpetuating amyloid-like protein aggregates, which are thought to propagate via a nucleated polymerization process, mediated by interactions between prion domains. By itself, the Rnq1 prion ([PIN+]) is not harmful to yeast cells, but it appears that QN-rich aggregates of Rnq1 “seed” aggregation of the heterologous poly-Q protein, leading to toxicity. The QN-rich domain of New1 in its prion form has also been shown to facilitate aggregation of a poly-Q construct originated from the mammalian mutant ataxin-3 involved in Machado-Joseph disease, although cell toxicity of that protein was not detected in yeast (21Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Further analysis has demonstrated that [PIN+]-dependent toxicity of the Htt-derived poly-Q construct in yeast is associated with a defect of endocytosis, possibly via sequestration of some components of the vesicle-assembly machinery by poly-Q aggregates (22Meriin A.B. Zhang X. Miliaras N.B. Kazantsev A. Chernoff Y.O. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7554-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As subcellular localization of Htt in mammalian cells has led to a suggestion that it may play a role in vesicle trafficking (23Velier J. Kim M. Schwarz C. Kim T.W. Sapp E. Chase K. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 152: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it is possible that the yeast model reflects certain features of cell toxicity that are relevant to mammalian Huntington disease. As many studies suggest a critical relationship between poly-Q aggregation and cell toxicity, chaperone proteins counteracting aggregation are well positioned as likely antagonists of the poly-Q disorders. Indeed, some chaperones of the evolutionary conserved Hsp70 and Hsp40 families counteracted poly-Q aggregation in vitro (14Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and antagonize poly-Q aggregation and, in some cases, toxicity in vivo, as seen in Drosophila and cultured mammalian cells (24Warrick J.M.

In yeast, aggregates of the heat-damaged proteins are solubilized and refolded by the chaperone complex, including Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40 (28Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Overproduction of some Hsp70 and Hsp40 proteins (14Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E.

A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), simultaneous depletion of the Ssa1 and Ssa2 proteins of the Hsp70 family (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), or a point mutation in the Hsp40 protein Ydj1 (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) were shown to counteract poly-Q aggregation in yeast cells. Hsp104 was shown to be essential for poly-Q aggregation in yeast, whereas its overproduction eliminated or reduced poly-Q aggregation at least in some assays (13Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 15Cao F. Levine J.J. Li S.H. Li X.J. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 2000; 97: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, one concern with most of these experiments is that they did not take into account the prion status of yeast cells. As endogenous yeast prions promote poly-Q aggregation (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and inactivation or overproduction of yeast chaperones of the Hsp104/Hsp70/Hsp40 complex is known to affect prion propagation (19Chernoff Y.O. Mutat. Res. 2001; 488: 39-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Chernoff Y.O. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), chaperones could influence poly-Q aggregates indirectly via alterations in propagation of the endogenous yeast prions. For example, Hsp104 is essential for propagation of [PIN+] (30Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as other yeast QN-rich prions (31Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 32Moriyama H. Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that elimination of Hsp104 counteracted poly-Q aggregation simply by eliminating initial [PIN+] “seeds” (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Here, we have systematically examined the effects of various yeast chaperones of the Hsp104/Hsp70/Hsp40 complex on poly-Q aggregation and toxicity in the series of isogenic yeast strains that differ only by prion composition. Our data show that although some chaperone alterations certainly act on poly-Q aggregates indirectly by modulating prion propagation, other alterations appear to influence poly-Q without affecting endogenous yeast prions. Moreover, at least one Hsp104 alteration exhibited differential effects on toxicity of poly-Q aggregates and endogenous prion, and various members of the Hsp70 and Hsp40 families differed from each other in regard to their effects on poly-Q aggregation and toxicity. Yeast Strains—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were derivatives of 74-D694, MATa ade1–14 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 (31Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). “Strong” [PSI+] derivative OT56, “weak” [PSI+] derivative OT55 (33Newnam G.P. Wegrzyn R.D. Lindquist S.L. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and [psi–] derivative OT60 (34Bailleul P.A. Newnam G.P. Steenbergen J.N. Chernoff Y.O. Genetics. 1999; 153: 81-94PubMed Google Scholar) also contain the [PIN+] prion. The [psi– pin–] strain GT17 (34Bailleul P.A. Newnam G.P. Steenbergen J.N. Chernoff Y.O. Genetics. 1999; 153: 81-94PubMed Google Scholar) contains no prions. The [PSI+ pin–] strain GT490 was OT56, cured of [PIN+] by expressing the dominant-negative Hsp104 derivative Hsp104-KT218,620 (35Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For this purpose, OT56-derived colonies that retained [PSI+] after pulse induction of Hsp104-KT218,620 expression were then cured of [PSI+] by excess wild-type Hsp104 and checked for retention of [PIN+] (see the description of the [PIN+] assay below). As wild-type Hsp104 usually does not cure [PIN+], isolates becoming [pin–] after excess Hsp104 treatment were identified as originating from the [PSI+ pin–] derivatives. Lack of the aggregated (prion) form of Rnq1 in these derivatives was then confirmed by a differential centrifugation assay (36Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The [psi– pin–] strain GT234 (MATα ade1–14 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 lys2) (35Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was used as a tester strain for the [PIN+] assay (see below). Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise noted. Plasmids—Poly-Q constructs contained the N-terminal portion of the Htt exon 1 with a poly-Q stretch of either 25 residues (Q25 control) or 103 residues (Q103), fused to GFP, and expressed under control of the galactose-inducible PGAL promoter. The high copy 2-μm DNA-based URA3 poly-Q-expressing plasmids, originated from pYES2 (Invitrogen), were described previously (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J.

The PGAL-HSP104 clone with the dominant-negative substitution K302N (Library Hsp104) was isolated from the pRS316Gal-based yeast cDNA library, obtained from A. Bretscher (39Liu H. Krizek J.

Media—Standard procedures and media were used for yeast transformation and phenotypic assays (see Ref. 44Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The non-inducing media contained 2% glucose (Glu). To induce the PGAL promoter, glucose was substituted with 2% galactose (Gal) in the solid media or 2% of each galactose and raffinose (Gal+Raf) in the liquid media. Liquid cultures were grown with at least a 1/5 liquid/flask volumetric ratio on the shaker at 225 rpm. Plate Assay for Cytotoxicity—To assess cytotoxicity qualitatively, yeast transformants were patched on the Glu medium selective for the plasmid(s), and velveteen replica plated onto the Gal medium of the same composition, to induce the PGAL promoter. This was followed by the second passage on Gal medium via either velveteen replica plating or spotting with a spotter from Replicatech. Differences in growth are better seen after the second passage. At least eight independent transformants were tested in each case for each strain/plasmid combination. All or the vast majority of them did usually show the same results. Typical representatives are shown on the figures. Quantitative Assay for Cytotoxicity—To measure cytotoxicity quantitatively, yeast cultures were pregrown overnight in the synthetic Glu liquid medium, selective for the plasmid(s), and inoculated at 105 cells/ml into the liquid Gal+Raf medium of the same composition, to induce the PGAL constructs. Aliquots were taken after various periods of incubation and plated onto Glu medium selective for the plasmid(s). Colonies were counted after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. Two platings of each of two independent cultures for each strain/plasmid combination were performed at each time point. Averages of four counts are shown on the figures. Standard deviations never exceeded 35% of the value for a given time point. Note that the Q103-expressing cultures grew much slower in the –Ura-Trp/Gal (or Gal+Raf) medium than in the –Ura-His/Gal (or Gal+Raf) medium. These differences were reproducible in both plate assay and quantitative assay (for example, see Fig. 5) so that accurate comparisons could be made only between cultures growing in the same conditions. Assays for [PSI+] and [PIN+]—The presence of the prion form of the Sup35 protein ([PSI+]) was detected by its ability to cause readthrough of the ade1–14 (UGA) mutant allele (31Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Sup35 is a translation termination factor, and its aggregation results in termination readthrough. The [psi–] ade1–14 strains are unable to grow on –Ade medium and exhibit a dark red color on organic complete (YPD) medium, whereas [PSI+] ade1–14 strains are able to grow on –Ade medium and exhibit a light pink color on YPD medium. The presence of [PIN+] in the [psi–] background was tested on the basis of the ability of overproduced Sup35 to induce de novo formation of [PSI+] in the [PIN+] but not [pin–] background (36Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The [psi–] strains, tested for [PIN+], were mated to the [psi– pin–] strain GT234, bearing the multicopy plasmid pSTR7 with the SUP35 gene. The [PIN+] diploids, in contrast to the [pin–] diploids, grew on –Ade medium after 10–14 days of incubation due to induction of [PSI+]. In each experiment, 12 colonies originating from four independent cultures were tested for [PIN+] loss. GFP Detection by Fluorescence Microscopy—GFP fluorescence images were taken using the Olympus BX41 microscope with a ×100 objective, with a narrow band GFP filter. Cultures were grown over-night in the synthetic Gal+Raf medium selective for the plasmid(s), as described above for quantitative assays. Only cells showing fluorescence were counted and grouped into different classes based on the patterns observed. Endocytosis Assay—Mid-log phase cells grown in the Gal+Raf medium were concentrated 10 times, incubated for 12 min in the selective Gal+Raf medium with 8 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes), washed two times with the same medium without dye, and left at 30 °C with shaking for 45 min (22Meriin A.B.

FM4-64 staining was detected on the BX41 fluorescence microscope with TRITC filter. Protein Isolation and Differential Centrifugation—Proteins were isolated from yeast cultures, grown overnight in plasmid-selective synthetic Gal+Raf medium, and analyzed according to the previously published protocol (22Meriin A.B. Zhang X. Miliaras N.B. Kazantsev A. Chernoff Y.O. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7554-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as described below. At least two independent cultures (originated from independent transformants) were checked per each strain/plasmid combination. Cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by 10-min vortexing with 600 μm acid-washed glass beads in the lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1/5 of one proteinase inhibitor tablet, Roche Diagnostics, predissolved in distilled water). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. This step also precipitates some of the Q103 and Q25 protein; the fraction of protein precipitated in these conditions was not influenced by the chaperone composition (not shown). The resulting supernatant was fractionated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min (and when specifically mentioned, f"

The three-dimensional solution structure of V. hederaceae leaf cyclotide-1 (vhl-1), a leaf-specific expressed 31-residue cyclotide, has been determined using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. vhl-1 adopts a compact and well defined structure including a distorted triple-stranded β-sheet, a short 310 helical segment and several turns. It is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, which, together with backbone segments, form a cyclic cystine knot motif. The three-disulfide bonds are almost completely buried into the protein core, and the six cysteines contribute only 3.8% to the molecular surface. A pH titration experiment revealed that the folding of vhl-1 shows little pH dependence and allowed the pKa of 3.0 for Glu3 and ∼5.0 for Glu14 to be determined. Met7 was found to be oxidized in the native form, consistent with the fact that its side chain protrudes into the solvent, occupying 7.5% of the molecular surface. vhl-1 shows anti-HIV activity with an EC50 value of 0.87 μm.

Cyclotides are a recently characterized family of naturally occurring circular mini-proteins of 28 to 37 amino acid residues isolated from plants of the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 2Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Their head-to-tail backbone and six conserved cysteine residues make up a topologically unique structure designated as a cyclic cystine knot in which two disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments form an embedded ring that is penetrated by a third disulfide bond (3Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the structure of kalata B1, the first example characterized in the cyclotide family, and its sequence is presented in Table I. The fact that cyclotides are exceptionally resistant to thermal and proteolytic degradation has led to the suggestion that the cyclic cystine knot motif contributes greatly to their stability. By contrast, the amino acid sequences between the six cysteines, which form six loops that present on the surface of the molecules, affect the surface characteristics and biological activities of the cyclotides. The cyclotides have been divided into two subfamilies, Möbius and bracelet cyclotides (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol.

Lloydia (Cinci.). 1973; 36: 207-208PubMed Google Scholar). Some cyclotides, for example, kalata B1, circulins, and cyclopsychotride A, effectively show several different inhibitory activities, suggesting that the loops of one cyclotide molecule may have various biological functions and can potentially bind to different target sites. Perhaps most interesting is the finding that kalata B1 and kalata B2 inhibit the growth and development of Helicoverpa punctigera larvae, leading to the suggestion that cyclotides play an important role in plant defense against pests or pathogens (16Jennings C.

The diverse bioactivities, along with their unique structural characteristics, render the cyclotides extremely important in terms of potential agro-chemical or pharmaceutical applications (4Craik D.J. Toxicon. 2001; 38: 1809-1813Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cyclotides, like many other defense proteins, are derived from precursor polypeptides, which undergo a process of post-translational modification. Recently we reported the isolation and characterization of cyclotide cDNA clones from V. odorata (19Dutton J.L. Renda R.F. Waine C. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Jennings C.V. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46858-46867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A single full-length cDNA transcript encodes one or several cyclotides, which are separated by conserved peptide fragments termed N-terminal repeats that may function in the cyclization and folding of cyclotides (19Dutton J.L. Renda R.F. Waine C. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Jennings C.V. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46858-46867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We also synthesized the N-terminal repeats based on the cDNA clones and elucidated their α-helical solution structures by NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly the N-terminal repeat sequences were not as conserved as those predicted from cDNA clones from O. affinis (16Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This might result from the fact that the cDNAs from V. odorata encode both subfamilies, Möbius and bracelet cyclotides, instead of representing mainly one subfamily of cyclotides, as was the case for the cDNAs isolated from O. affinis (16Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 19Dutton J.L. Renda R.F. Waine C. Clark R.J. Daly N.L.

To date, ∼50 cyclotides have been reported from a number of species of the Rubiaceae and Violaceae plant families, and all have molecular masses ranging from 2.8 to 3.5 kDa. A recent study by HPLC and LC-MS on cyclotides from Viola hederaceae revealed that up to 66 different masses, most likely corresponding to the same number of cyclotides, were discerned in extracts of various parts of the plant (20Trabi M. Craik D.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2204-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cyclotides are a very diverse family of proteins and potentially are much more common in plants than had previously been realized. To expand our knowledge of structure-activity relationships of the cyclotides, we introduce a new strategy for determining the sequence of cyclic disulfide rich peptides, report the isolation and characterization of four novel cyclotides from V. hederaceae, and present the solution structure of vhl-1, one of the new cyclotides. Isolation and Purification of vhl-1—Fresh whole plant of V. hederaceae was collected from a garden in Brisbane, Australia and separated into different parts: leaves, petioles, flowers, pedicels, roots, bulbs, as well as above and below ground runners. The leaves were homogenized using a blender (Moulinex) and extracted with dichloromethane:methanol (1:1) overnight. Plant debris was removed using a cotton plug. The filtrate was repeatedly partitioned with dichloromethane and water. The organic soluble fraction was discarded, and the methanol/water layer was concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Bücchi) prior to lyophilization. Then the mixture was diluted with distilled water to a final methanol concentration <20% and lyophilized on a freeze-drier (Speed-Vac). The dried material was redissolved in a minimal amount of buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid prepared in distilled water). The solution was then passed through a solid phase filter (Sartorius) before purification using preparative RP-HPLC on an Agilent 1100 series system with variable wavelength detector and Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (250 × 22 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å). Gradients of buffer A (0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) were employed with a flow rate of 8 ml/min and a gradient of 1% buffer B per minute. Further purification was performed using semipreparative RP-HPLC on a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) and using an analytical Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å). The final purity was examined with analytical RP-HPLC on a Grom column (150 × 2 mm, 3 μm, equipped with a security-guard column) with a flow rate of 300 μl/min. Masses were analyzed on a Micromass LCT mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Aminoethylation of Cysteines—The reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bonds was performed according to the method described in the literature (21Göransson U. Broussalis A.M. Claeson P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with minor modification. 5 nmol of vhl-1 was reduced with 0.4 μmol of dithiothreitol in 200 μl 0.25 m Tris-HCl, containing 1 mm EDTA and 8 m guanidine HCl (pH 8.5, 37 °C) under N2. After 2 h, 20 μmol of bromoethylamine dissolved in 20 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, containing 1 mm EDTA and 8 m guanidine HCl (pH 8.5) was added. The reaction was incubated in a water bath at 37 °C in the dark under N2 overnight and terminated by injection onto RP-HPLC and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% buffer B in 80 min. The molecular masses of the collected fractions were confirmed by LCT-ESI-MS prior to lyophilization and storage at -20 °C. Reduction of vhl-1 and MALDI-MS Analysis—To ∼6 nmol of vhl-1 in 20 μlof0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), 1 μlof0.1 m TCEP was added, and the solution was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reduction was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS after desalting using Ziptips (Millipore), which involved several washing steps followed by elution in 10 μlof80% acetonitrile (0.5% formic acid). The desalted samples were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with matrix consisting of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile (0.5% formic acid). The instrument used was a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). 200 shots per spectra were acquired in positive ion reflector mode. The laser intensity was set to 1800, the accelerating voltage was set to 20,000 V; the grid voltage was set to 64% of the accelerating voltage, and the delay time was 165 ns. The low mass gate was set to 500 Da. Data were collected between 500 and 5000 Da. Calibration was undertaken using a peptide mixture obtained from Sigma Aldrich (MSCal1). Enzymatic Digestion and Nanospray MS-MS Sequencing—To the reduced peptide, trypsin, endoproteinase GluC (endo-GluC), or a combination of both were added to give a final peptide-to-enzyme ratio of 50:1. The trypsin incubation was allowed to proceed for 1 h, the endo-GluC was over 3 h, while for the combined digestion trypsin was added initially for 1 h followed by the addition of endo-GluC for a further 3 h. The digestions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 0.5% formic acid and desalted using Ziptips (Millipore). Samples were stored at 4 °C prior to analysis. The fragments resulting from the digestion were examined first by MALDI-TOF-MS followed by sequencing by nanospray MS-MS on a QStar mass spectrometer. A capillary voltage of 900 V was applied and spectra were acquired between m/z 60–2000 for both TOF spectra and product ion spectra. The collision energy for peptide fragmentation was varied between 10 and 50 V, depending on the size and charge of the ion. The Analyst software program was used for data acquisition and processing. The MS-MS spectra were examined and sequenced based on the presence of both b and y series of ions present (N- and C-terminal fragments). The same procedure was utilized for the sequencing of the three other novel cyclotides isolated from V. hederaceae. Chymotrypsin digests using the same conditions as for trypsin were also conducted to confirm the results obtained for each of the peptide sequences. NMR Experiments—The sample for NMR spectroscopy was prepared by dissolving vhl-1 in 70% H2O, 25% CD3CN, and 5% D2O to a final concentration of 1.4 mm, since aggregation of the peptide was observed in 100% water. All spectra were recorded on Bruker ARX 500 or Bruker ARX 600 spectrometers equipped with a shielded gradient unit, with sample temperature in the range 283–330 K. All spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using time proportional phase incrementation (22Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). For TOCSY (23Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), using MLEV-17 (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 80 ms, and NOESY (25Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) with mixing times of 100, 200 and 250 ms, water suppression was achieved using a WATERGATE (water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation) (26Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar) sequence. Double quantum-filtered COSY (27Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) and E-COSY (28Griesinger C. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar) were also recorded. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by recording a series of one-dimensional spectra and two-dimensional TOCSY spectra at 298 K over a period of 20 h immediately after dissolution of a sample in 25% CD3CN and 75% D2O. The pH dependence was monitored for vhl-1 at 298 K by altering the sample pH from 2.0 to 6.0 by adding HCl or NaOH. The pKa of the titrating Glu3 and Glu14 residues was determined for vhl-1 by nonlinear curve fitting of the data points. The 3JHN-Hα coupling constants were obtained from a high resolution one-dimensional spectrum and from line shape analysis of the anti-phase cross-signal splitting in a high resolution DQF-COSY spectrum. All two-dimensional spectra were collected over 4096 data points in the f2 dimension and 512 increments in the f1 and processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station. The f1 dimension was generally zero-filled to 2048 real data points, with the f1 and f2 dimensions being multiplied by a sine-squared function prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were internally referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2silapentane-5-sulfonate. Structural Restraints—Distance restraints were derived primarily from cross-peaks in a 250-ms mixing time NOESY spectrum recorded at 298 K. The cross-peaks were analyzed and resonance assignments were achieved using the program SPARKY. 2Goddard, T. D. and Kneller, D. G., SPARKY 3 program, University of California, San Francisco. 25 backbone dihedral restraints were added on the basis of 3JHN-Hα coupling constants derived from the splitting of the amide and α protons and were constrained to -120 (±30)° for 3JHN-Hα in the range 8.5 ± 0.5 Hz (residues 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 19, 21, 24, and 30), -120 (±15)° for 3JHN-Hα greater than 9.5 Hz (residues 26, 27), and -65 (±30)° for 3JHN-Hα less than 5.8 Hz (residues 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 31). One additional constraint of -100 (±80)° (residue 18) was applied where the 3JHN-Hα coupling constant is ∼7.00 Hz, and the intraresidue Hαi-HNi NOE is weaker than the sequential Hαi-HNi NOE. Residues 22, 23, 28, and 29 with intense Hαi-HNi NOEs and 3JHN-Hα coupling constants of ∼7 Hz were restrained to 50 (±40)°. 3JHα-Hβ coupling constants derived from an E-COSY spectrum, together with NOE intensity patterns from the NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 100 ms, were used to determine the stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons and 17 χ1 dihedral angle restraints. Ten hydrogen bonds were determined based on slow exchange data and preliminary structure calculations. 20 restraints of 1.7–2.2 and 2.7–3.2 Å for these hydrogen bonds were added and used in the final structure calculation. Structure Calculation—Initial structures were calculated using DYANA (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) based on NOE data output from SPARKY. After an iterative process in which preliminary structures were used to resolve ambiguities, sets of 50 structures were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within the program CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This protocol involved a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature was lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 500 steps of Powell minimization. The resultant structures were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell (32Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A set of 20 structures with the lowest overall energy that had no violations of distance restraints greater than 0.2 Å or dihedral angle restraints greater than 3° was chosen to represent the structure of vhl-1. Structures were visualized using the program MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) and analyzed with PROMOTIF_NMR (34Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). The 20 final structures of vhl-1 and associated restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (ID code: 1ZA8). Isolation and Purification of Cyclotides—Cyclotides show several defining characteristics, including late elution on HPLC and a mass range from 2.8 to 3.5 kDa. Based on these characteristics, we have established an effective and efficient procedure to isolate and purify cyclotides from various components of the crude plant extracts (16Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In the current study, we divided fresh collected plant material into eight parts (leaves, petioles, flowers, pedicels, above ground runners, below ground runners, bulbs, and roots) and used the extraction protocol to obtain crude cyclotide extracts. RP-HPLC profiles of different parts of V. hederaceae are shown in Fig. 2. Repeated RP-HPLC resulted in the separation and purification of four novel cyclotides corresponding to chromatographic peaks 4, 5 (two peptides), and 6. The molecular masses of these cyclotides determined as shown in Table I by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry revealed they were new when compared with the molecular masses of known cyclotides. The cyclotide corresponding to chromatographic peak 3 is expressed only in leaves, but its mass of 3117.8 matches a reported cyclotide cycloviolacin O10 isolated from V. odorata (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Chromatographic peak 7 corresponds to a cyclotide named vhr1, whose molecular characterization was reported recently (20Trabi M. Craik D.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2204-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the four novel cyclotides, the two corresponding to peak 5 are expressed in several different tissues and were designated as cycloviolacins H2 and H3. The one with a relatively late retention time corresponding to peak 6 is only expressed in leaves and named as vhl-2 (V. hederaceae leaf cyclotide-2). Special emphasis was put on a cyclotide vhl-1 with a retention time of 32.0 min (peak 4) as it is relatively abundant and expressed specifically in leaves and not in any other parts of the plant. From the crude extract of V. hederaceae leaves vhl-1 was isolated and purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC as shown in the last panel in Fig. 2. The yield of vhl-1 was about 1 mg/kg fresh plant material. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Amino acid analysis of vhl-1 indicated that it is composed of 31 amino acids: 1 Ala, 6 Cys, 2 Glu or Gln, 2 Phe, 2 Gly, 3 Ile, 2 Lys, 1 Leu, 1 Met, 2 Asp or Asn, 5 Ser, 1 Thr, 2 Val and 1 Tyr. It shows resistance to enzymatic cleavage by trypsin, consistent with the presence of a cyclic cystine knot motif characteristic of all cyclotides. After reduction and alkylation, each reduced and S-aminoethylated cysteine contributes to an increment of molecular mass by 44 Da. Nanospray MS and LC-ESI-MS analysis of the native (3330, mono-isotopic mass) and S-aminoethylated peptide (3594) demonstrated that, like other cyclotides, six cysteines are present in three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Tryptic cleavage was then carried out on the alkylated peptide in an attempt to use a recently proposed “loop sequencing” method for determining the primary structure of cyclotides (21Göransson U. Broussalis A.M. Claeson P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Göransson U. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48188-48196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, this approach resulted in very complicated enzymatic fragments, implying that, besides the six alkylated cysteines, several other positively charged amino acid residues exist in the primary structure. All of the alkylated cysteines and positive residues provide cleavage sites for trypsin and, as a result, produce additional fragments, complicating the MS-MS data. An alternative strategy outlined in Fig. 3, which includes both enzymatic digestion and MS-MS fragmentation, was used to complete the sequence analysis. The native cyclotide was reduced by TCEP and subjected to enzymatic digestion directly, without alkylation of the cysteines. The reduction of the peptide was confirmed by the observation of peaks at m/z 11123+ and 8344+, which correspond to a molecular mass of 3336 Da due to the addition of six protons to the native peptide. Digestion of the reduced peptide with endo-GluC gave rise to two major peaks at m/z 627.72+ and 707.33+ corresponding to two fragments with masses of 1253.5 and 2118.9 and implying the presence of two glutamic acid residues. Several other peaks with relatively low intensities were also produced after digestion by trypsin or a combination of trypsin and endo-GluC. The study of the MS-MS fragmentation of the first fragment at m/z 627.72+ resulted in completion of its amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 4A, suggesting that it consists of 11 amino acid residues with the sequence SCAF*ISFCFTE. The b2 ion of the fragment at m/z 191 could be either SC or CS. However, it was determined to be SC by comparison with known cyclotides and further confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The second fragment at m/z 707.33+ was difficult to analyze by MS-MS fragmentation because of its length. However, two partial sequences from both N-terminal (VIGCSCKNKV-) and C-terminal (-LNSISCGE) were observed as highlighted in Fig. 4B and in the supplemental Table I. The b and y ions greater than ∼5% in relative intensity are labeled in Fig. 4, and a number of ions that allow full sequence elucidation are also present in"
https://openalex.org/W2022096651,"Proteasome inhibitors have emerged as promising anticancer therapeutic agents. Bortezomib (PS-341), a specific proteasome inhibitor, exhibits antitumor activity against a wide range of malignancies and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. However, the molecular mechanisms of bortezomib-mediated apoptosis remain unclear. To characterize the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by proteasome inhibitors, we examined levels of Bcl-2 protein family members (Bik/NBK, Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL), release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and -3 in human colon cancer cell lines DLD1, LOVO, SW620, and HCT116; human lung cancer cell line H1299; and human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 after they were treated with bortezomib. The result showed that bortezomib induced rapid accumulation of Bik/NBK but not other Bcl-2 family members in all six cell lines. Bortezomib-mediated Bik/NBK accumulation and apoptosis were also observed in human embryonic kidney cells 293 and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Moreover, dramatic Bik/NBK accumulation and apoptosis induction were observed when cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and calpain inhibitor I (ALLN). Furthermore, no detectable changes in IkappaBalpha levels or in NFkappaB functionality were found after treatment with bortezomib. Finally, Bik/NBK accumulation was caused by stabilization of the protein from degradation and was associated with bortezomib cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction. Pretreatment of DLD1 cells with Bik/NBK siRNA reduced bortezomib-mediated Bik/NBK accumulation and cell death. Our results suggested that Bik/NBK is one of the mediators of proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2134370171,"The Neoproterozoic glaciations supposedly ended in a supergreenhouse environment, which led to rapid melting of the ice cover and precipitation of the so-called cap carbonates. If Earth was covered with ice, then extraterrestrial material would have accumulated on and within the ice and precipitated during rapid melting at the end of the glaciation. We found iridium (Ir) anomalies at the base of cap carbonates in three drill cores from the Eastern Congo craton. Our data confirm the presence of extended global Neoproterozoic glaciations and indicate that the duration of the Marinoan glacial episode was at least 3 million, and most likely 12 million, years."
https://openalex.org/W2033568440,"ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease, cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) in plasma to generate smaller, less thrombogenic fragments. The interaction of von Willebrand factor with specific ADAMTS13 domains was characterized with a binding assay employing von Willebrand factor immobilized on a plastic surface. ADAMTS13 binding was saturable and reversible. Equilibrium binding occurred within 2 h and the half-time for dissociation was ∼4 h. Binding to von Willebrand factor was similar with either recombinant ADAMTS13 or normal plasma ADAMTS13; plasma from a patient who lacked ADAMTS13 activity showed no binding. The stoichiometry of binding was one ADAMTS13 per two von Willebrand factor monomers, and the Kd was 14 nm. The ADAMTS13 metalloprotease and disintegrin domains did not bind VWF detectably. ADAMTS13 truncated after the first thrombospondin type 1 repeat bound VWF with a Kd of 206 nm, whereas ADAMTS13 truncated after the spacer domain had a Kd of 23 nm, which is comparable with that of full-length ADAMTS13. Truncation after the eighth thrombospondin type 1 repeat reduced the binding affinity by ∼3-fold and truncation after the seventh thrombospondin type 1 repeat in addition to the CUB domains increased the affinity for von Willebrand factor by ∼2-fold. Therefore, the spacer domain is required for ADAMTS13 binding to von Willebrand factor.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The largest multimers of VWF are most active in platelet interactions, and thrombosis can result if large multimers accumulate as a result of ADAMTS13 deficiency. VWF is secreted into plasma as ultra-large multimers that are proteolysed to smaller forms by the metalloprotease, ADAMTS13 (1Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev.

Deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity because of a congenital absence of the protein or because of the production of inhibitory anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies leads to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (4Furlan M.

The ADAMTS family is characterized by a modular domain structure consisting of a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) repeat, a cysteine-rich region, and a spacer domain (12Cal S. Obaya A.J. Llamazares M. Garabaya C. Quesada V. Lopez-Otin C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 283: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Most ADAMTS family members have a variable number of additional C-terminal TSP1 repeats. ADAMTS13 contains seven additional TSP1 repeats and two CUB domains at its C terminus and is the most divergent member of the family (13Zheng X. Chung D. Takayama T.K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E.

CUB domains were first identified in the complement proteins C1r and C1s and have since been identified in many different proteins (16Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In BMP-1 and cubilin, the CUB domains mediate interactions with procollagen and intrinsic factor vitamin B12, respectively (17Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

The importance of the C-terminal TSP1 repeats and CUB domains in ADAMTS13 is suggested by their evolutionary conservation from Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) through mice and humans 2J. E. Sadler, unpublished observations. (22Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11552-11554Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although their functions remain unclear because ADAMTS13 truncated after the spacer domain retains full activity in cleaving VWF in vitro (23Zheng X.

Interestingly, however, a peptide from the first CUB domain has been shown to inhibit cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 in a shear-dependent assay, suggesting that the C-terminal domains may interact with VWF (25Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). To characterize the domains of ADAMTS13 that interact with VWF, we have investigated the binding of recombinant variants of ADAMTS13 to immobilized VWF. The Kd for binding was comparable with the plasma concentrations of VWF and ADAMTS13, and the stoichiometry suggested that ADAMTS13 can bind to the majority of VWF subunits. Binding was strongly dependent on the spacer domain of ADAMTS13 and also appeared to be modulated by the TSP1 and CUB domains that were closest to the C-terminus. Materials—Anti-ADAMTS13 C-terminal antibody was made in rabbits against the predicted ADAMTS13 sequence EMQDPQSWKGEKEGT (amino acid residues 1414–1427) with a Cys residue added to the N terminus (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Inc., Canadensis, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antihuman VWF was from Dako. Purified human VWF was a gift of C. Mazurier (Laboratoire français du Fractionnement et des Biotechnologies, Lille, France). Plasmid Constructs—A full-length cDNA with C-terminal V5 epitope and His6 tag encoding ADAMTS13 (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Plasmids encoding the C-terminal truncations of ADAMTS13 were prepared as described previously (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These included constructs in which V5 epitope and His6 tags were inserted after ADAMTS13 amino acid residues Gln289, Gly385, Glu439, Cys555, and Ala685 cloned in pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) or after Arg1075 and Ala1191 cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). All C-terminal truncation constructs were digested with HindIII and EcoRV and ligated into HindIII and EcoRV digested full-length ADAMTS13 in pcDNA4/TO. Stable Transfections—T-REx™ 293 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% Tet-System Approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5 μg/ml blasticidin S. Cells were replated at ∼90% confluence into 6-well dishes the day before transfection, and they were transfected using 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 250 μl of Opti-Mem (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. After 48 h, the cells were split 1:50 and 1:100 into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% Tet-System approved fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml blasticidin S, and 300 μg/ml Zeocin™. Isolated colonies were picked after 14 days and propagated in the same medium. Recombinant Protein Expression—For recombinant protein expression, stably transfected cell lines were plated at 50% confluence and cultured in Opti-Mem containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline to induce expression from the tetracycline-inducible promoter of pcDNA 4/TO. Medium was collected after 3 days and 1 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added. Medium was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was concentrated at least twenty-fold by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep YM-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The concentration of recombinant ADAMTS13 was measured using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with peroxidase conjugated anti-V5 antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The luminograms were scanned, and the relative amount of protein detected was estimated by densitometry using NIH Image 1.62 (developed at National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The concentration of V5-tagged ADAMTS13 constructs was determined by standardization with the V5-tagged Positope™ reference protein (Invitrogen) (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Binding Assay—Human VWF (7.5 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, was incubated in a 96-well Nunc-Immuno™ Plate MaxiSorp™ surface microtiter plate overnight at room temperature. Unbound VWF was removed, and 200 μl of 2.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Tween PBS) was added and incubated for 60 min. The wells were washed twice with Tween PBS and incubated with 100 μl of sample-containing recombinant ADAMTS13 or plasma in 5 mm EDTA. Unbound protein was aspirated, and the wells were washed with Tween PBS three times. For solubilization, 100 μl of 4× sample loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 712 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% bromphenol blue) was added. Solubilized protein was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to 5% SDS-PAGE, transferred by blotting to Immobilon P, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Plasma ADAMTS13 was detected as above with the anti-ADAMTS13 C-terminal peptide antibody and peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody. For colorimetric assay, the wells were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody in Tween PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 60 min and washed three times with Tween PBS. Color development was with 100 μl of 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) in 50 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0, for 10 min. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 1.5 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 490 nm was determined. Purification of IgG—Plasma was obtained from patients with TTP with informed consent under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington University. Fresh frozen plasma from a patient with autoimmune TTP (500 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 60 min at room temperature. The protein G-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed with 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized by the addition of 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Soluble VWF Competition—Increasing concentrations of VWF in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m urea were added with 5.5 nm ADAMTS13 to microtiter wells precoated with VWF as indicated above and incubated for >120 min. The wells were washed with Tween PBS and incubated with 1:5000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody for 60 min. Color development was with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as described above. The Ki was calculated using the equation IC50 = (1 + [immobilized VWF]/Kd)Ki with the Kd of 14 nm determined from the binding experiments described. Steck-Wallach Plot—Data were plotted using the method of Steck and Wallach (26Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 97: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) according to the equation VWFADAMTS13=Kdn[ADAMTS13]+1n(Eq. 1) where [ADAMTS13] is the concentration of free ADAMTS13, n is number of ADAMTS13 binding sites per VWF monomer, VWF is the number of VWF monomer subunits immobilized per assay well, ADAMTS13 is the number of ADAMTS13 bound, and Kd is the dissociation constant of ADAMTS13. The number of VWF monomers bound was determined by visualization of bound VWF using 5% SDS-PAGE, Western blotting with polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated anti-VWF (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and the chemiluminescent ECL detection system. The luminograms were scanned, and the relative amount of VWF was detected as described above. The absolute concentration was determined by standardization with known quantities of VWF. The number of ADAMTS13 molecules bound was determined as described above. Time Course of ADAMTS13-VWF Association and Dissociation—The conformation of VWF is changed significantly by binding to hydrophobic (octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass) or hydrophilic (mica) surfaces (27Raghavachari M. Tsai H. Kottke-Marchant K. Marchant R.E. Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces. 2000; 19: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, an assay system was developed to study the interactions of immobilized VWF and ADAMTS13. Cleavage of VWF in solution by ADAMTS13 requires denaturation of the VWF with guanidine, urea, or shear stress (2Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tsai H.M. Sussman I.I. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2171-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but ADAMTS13 cleaved immobilized VWF in the absence of denaturants (data not shown). Therefore, binding reactions were done in the presence of EDTA to inactivate ADAMTS13 (28Tsai H.M. Sussman I.I. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2171-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound ADAMTS13 was detected by solubilization of the microtiter well-bound protein to minimize dissociation that might occur during the antibody incubation step using the ELISA-based detection system. Binding of recombinant ADAMTS13 was apparent after 1 min of incubation and reached equilibrium by ∼2 h (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained if the reactions were done in the absence of EDTA although the extent of binding was less (data not shown). The time course of dissociation was assessed in the presence of anti-VWF antibody to prevent rebinding of ADAMTS13. Bound ADAMTS13 decreased over time, and dissociated ADAMTS13 increased reciprocally (Fig. 2A) with a half-time for dissociation of ∼4 h (Fig. 2B). A relatively small fraction of bound ADAMTS13 (11–15%) was eluted in 60 min, making it feasible to measure binding by an ELISA-based colorimetric detection method in subsequent experiments. ADAMTS13 Binds Specifically to VWF—ADAMTS13 did not bind significantly to immobilized bovine serum albumin demonstrating the specificity of ADAMTS13 for VWF over the more abundant plasma protein, albumin (Fig. 3A). ADAMTS13 binding to immobilized VWF was inhibited by rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF immunoglobulin and by immunoglobulin from TTP patients with autoinhibitory antibodies against ADAMTS13 but not by nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulin (Fig. 3A). Soluble VWF in PBS did not compete well with the immobilized VWF for ADAMTS13 binding, but soluble VWF did inhibit binding in reactions containing 1 m urea (Fig. 3B) indicating that urea may induce a change in VWF conformation similar to that caused by immobilization on a surface. The IC50 of the soluble VWF was 100 nm, and the calculated Ki was 90 nm. Because the Kd of ADAMTS13 binding to VWF in 1 m urea solution is ∼14 nm (data not shown), a conformational change in only a fraction of the urea-denatured VWF in solution may explain the disparity in the Ki and Kd. ADAMTS13 from Normal Plasma Binds VWF—Patients with TTP may lack plasma VWF cleaving protease activity because of a congenital absence of ADAMTS13 or because of the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 inhibitory antibodies. Plasma from normal blood donors or from a patient with TTP caused by inhibitory antibodies was used in the VWF binding assay. Bound ADAMTS13 increased when increasing concentrations of normal plasma were incubated with immobilized VWF, whereas bound ADAMTS13 was not detected when plasma from the patient with TTP was used (Fig. 4). Comparable binding was detected when either 100 ng of recombinant ADAMTS13 or 100 μl of fresh-frozen plasma were used (data not shown); this result is consistent with a plasma concentration of 1 μg/ml ADAMTS13 that has been estimated by others (29Gerritsen H.E. Robles R. Lammle B. Furlan M. Blood. 2001; 98: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As was shown previously (Fig. 3B), the soluble VWF in plasma did not appear to inhibit the binding of ADAMTS13 to immobilized VWF. These results demonstrate that substantial binding of ADAMTS13 and VWF occurs readily in the complex milieu of plasma as well as in PBS. The Affinity and Stoichiometry of ADAMTS13/VWF Binding— The binding of ADAMTS13 to a known amount of immobilized VWF was measured to determine the stoichiometry of binding; a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5. In this experiment, the stoichiometry of VWF subunits to ADAMTS13 was 2, and it ranged from 1 to 4 in other experiments. The Kd was determined to be 14 nm with a range of 9 to 16 nm. The Kd for binding of ADAMTS13 to immobilized VWF is comparable with the independently determined Km of 16 nm for the cleavage of VWF that was pretreated with guanidine-HCl. 3P. J. Anderson, unpublished results. Domains of ADAMTS13 Required for Binding VWF—To define the domains of ADAMTS13 that interact with VWF, we utilized C-terminal truncations of ADAMTS13 in the binding assay. The constructs are named by the domain of ADAMTS13 with which they end (Fig. 6) and have a V5 epitope and (His)6 tag appended to the ADAMTS13 coding sequence. In previous studies of ADAMTS13 activity, C-terminal truncations that included at least the spacer domain were able to cleave VWF (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that the spacer might interact directly with the substrate. When employed in direct binding assays, the metalloprotease and disintegrin constructs did not bind VWF over the low background of nonspecific binding to bovine serum albumin (Fig. 7A). TSP1-1 and Cys-rich constructs bound to VWF with relatively low affinity, and addition of the spacer domain to the spacer construct restored binding further to approximately equal that of full-length ADAMTS13. These results support a major role for the spacer domain in the productive interaction of ADAMTS13 with VWF.Fig. 7Binding of ADAMTS13 constructs to immobilized VWF. Binding reactions were performed and bound recombinant ADAMTS13 proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody.

B, binding to immobilized VWF of TSP1-7 (♦), TSP1-8 (□), and full-length ADAMTS13 (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding activity of additional constructs with truncations toward the C terminus suggest that more distal TSP1 and CUB domains may also affect binding to VWF. TSP1-8, which lacks the two C-terminal CUB domains, reproducibly had a slightly lower affinity for immobilized VWF compared with full-length ADAMTS13 (Fig. 7B). Removal of another TSP1 repeat (TSP1-7 construct), however, reproducibly increased the binding affinity for VWF. The Kd values for the binding of selected C-terminal truncation constructs were calculated (Table I). The affinity of construct TSP1-1 for VWF is ∼15-fold lower than that of full-length ADAMTS13 but substantially greater than that of the shorter disintegrin and metalloprotease constructs, which do not bind detectably. Removal of the two CUB domains (TSP1-8) reduces the affinity for VWF by ∼3-fold, whereas removal of the two CUB domains and a C-terminal TSP1 repeat (TSP1-7) increases the affinity for VWF by ∼2-fold, relative to full-length ADAMTS13. The Kd of 23 nm for the spacer construct is slightly higher than that of full-length ADAMTS13. Therefore, the interaction of the spacer domain with VWF is critical for binding, but binding also is affected by the proximal TSP1-1 domain and possibly by the C-terminal TSP1-7, TSP1-8, and CUB domains.Table IBinding of ADAMTS13 variants to immobilized VWFADAMTS13 constructKdnmFull-length14 ± 1.2TSP1-1206 ± 38Spacer23 ± 0.9TSP1-76.9 ± 1.5TSP1-845 ± 11 Open table in a new tab ADAMTS13 binds specifically to immobilized VWF and with a binding affinity that is comparable with the independently determined Km for proteolytic activity. The Kd is also near the estimated plasma concentration of ADAMTS13 of 8 nm (29Gerritsen H.E. Robles R. Lammle B. Furlan M. Blood. 2001; 98: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), suggesting that modest changes in the plasma concentration of ADAMTS13 may significantly affect the hemostatic function of VWF. The stoichiometry of binding suggests that each ADAMTS13 molecule binds a monomer or dimer of VWF subunits (Fig. 5); several ADAMTS13 molecules might bind under sufficient fluid shear stress to each multimeric VWF molecule, which can contain as many as 40 subunits. Because soluble, nondenatured VWF does not compete for binding to immobilized VWF, binding of ADAMTS13 to VWF may not occur to an appreciable extent in the absence of fluid shear stress. The inability of soluble VWF to prevent binding to immobilized VWF (Fig. 3B) suggests that the conformation of the VWF is changed by binding to the surface of the microtiter plate. With atomic force microscopy, the structure of VWF was shown to be altered by adsorption on hydrophilic mica or on hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass, and VWF had a much more extended structure on the hydrophilic surface (27Raghavachari M. Tsai H. Kottke-Marchant K. Marchant R.E. Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces. 2000; 19: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The microtiter plates used in the assay system consist of polystyrene coated with a MaxiSorp™ surface that promotes interactions with hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions of a protein, and these plates have characteristics of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Although soluble VWF in PBS cannot compete for binding to immobilized VWF, it can compete in the presence of 1 m urea (Fig. 3B). Therefore, surface binding of VWF may induce a change in conformation that has some similarity to the conformational change that is induced by urea; both enable the binding of ADAMTS13. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that VWF and ADAMTS13 co-immunoprecipitate in the presence of 1 m urea but not in the absence of denaturants (30Zhang W. Motto D. Ginsburg D. Blood. 2004; 104: 126Crossref Google Scholar). Long “strings” of polymerized VWF bind to the endothelial cell surface after stimulation of VWF secretion with histamine, and this cell surface binding may also induce a conformational change in VWF that promotes interaction with ADAMTS13 (31Padilla A. Moake J.L. Bernardo A. Ball C. Wang Y. Arya M. Nolasco L. Turner N. Berndt M.C. Anvari B. Lopez J.A. Dong J.F. Blood. 2004; 103: 2150-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ADAMTS13 binding to immobilized VWF reached equilibrium relatively slowly over ∼2 h (Fig. 1). If the kinetics of binding are similar in vivo, equilibrium probably is not achieved in the circulation. The half-time for dissociation was ∼4 h (Fig. 2). This slow dissociation time validated the use of an additional 60-min incubation step with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody for color development in an ELISA-style binding assay, which allows the rapid processing of many simultaneous reactions. Because binding of ADAMTS13 to VWF could be detected readily using plasma samples from healthy controls but not from a patient with TTP (Fig. 4), this binding assay might be adapted for clinical determinations of ADAMTS13. With the ELISA method and C-terminal truncations of ADAMTS13, the contribution of specific structural domains to VWF binding could be estimated. The metalloprotease and disintegrin constructs do not detectably bind VWF as compared with other constructs (Fig. 7A). The TSP1-1 construct binds with a Kd of ∼206 nm (Table I), suggesting that the TSP1 domain interacts with VWF, although the TSP1-1 construct reportedly does not cleave full-length VWF (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The apparent catalytic inactivity of the TSP1-1 construct suggests that additional critical binding sites are required for productive interaction with VWF. Alternatively, the assays employed to date may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a low level of cleavage by this low affinity protease. Addition of the cysteine-rich domain did not increase binding to VWF above that of TSP1-1 (Fig. 7A), but the further addition of the spacer domain increased the affinity of binding ∼10-fold, nearly equal to the affinity of full-length ADAMTS13 (Table I). The large contribution of the ADAMTS13 spacer to VWF binding is consistent with the observation that the spacer domain is required for ADAMTS13 cleavage of VWF in vitro (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The central role of the spacer domain in productive substrate binding is supported by studies of antibodies to ADAMTS13 in TTP that show that every patient with autoimmune TTP has had antibodies against the spacer domain (24Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Klaus C. Plaimauer B.

Fijnheer R. Voorberg J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations after TSP1-7 or TSP1-8 gave additional interesting results. The nearly normal affinity of the spacer construct for VWF might suggest that the C-terminal TSP1 repeats and CUB domains are not needed for VWF interactions, and to date the presence or absence of these domains has had little effect on the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS13 truncation mutants (23Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, direct binding data (Fig. 7B) suggest that the C-terminal TSP1 domains and CUB domains may contribute to interactions with VWF. Compared with full-length ADAMTS13, there is a small but reproducible 2-fold decrease in the VWF affinity of TSP1-8, and a 3-fold increase in the affinity of TSP1-7 (Table I). Two other studies also are consistent with a role for CUB domains in binding VWF. A synthetic peptide from the first CUB domain inhibited the binding of ADAMTS13-coated beads to VWF attached to the surface of endothelial cells (34Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Bernardo A. Fujikawa K. Ball C. Nolasco L. Lopez J.A. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29633-29639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Also, ADAMTS13 and VWF can be co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of 1 m urea, and this interaction was blocked by a bacterially expressed second CUB domain (30Zhang W. Motto D. Ginsburg D. Blood. 2004; 104: 126Crossref Google Scholar). The concordance among these various independent approaches suggests that distal TSP1 and CUB domains may be important for the binding and cleavage of VWF in vivo. The accumulating data suggest that several structural domains of ADAMTS13 contribute to a complex, regulated interaction with its VWF substrate. The spacer domain clearly plays a major role, perhaps by binding to a specific feature of VWF that may be spatially removed from the cleaved Tyr1605–Met1606 bond, and this feature could become accessible under high fluid shear stress, upon binding to a surface, or in the presence of mild denaturants. Additional domains of ADAMTS13 may also participate, and direct binding data appear to implicate the proximal TSP1-1 domain and the distal TSP1-7, TSP1-8, and CUB domains (Table I). If several ADAMTS13 domains cooperate with the metalloprotease domain to recognize VWF, there may be a corresponding number of distinct sites on VWF with which these domains interact. On the basis of other studies that suggest a functional relationship between ADAMTS13 and specific domains of VWF, ADAMTS13 binding sites on VWF might reside in domain A1 (35Nishio K. Anderson P.J. Zheng X.L. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the C-terminal helix of domain A2 (36Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Fujimura Y.

https://openalex.org/W2047599807,"Recent studies show that Eph receptors act mainly through the regulation of actin reorganization1. Here, we show a novel mode of action for EphB receptors. We identify synaptojanin 1 — a phosphatidylinositol 5′-phosphatase that is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis2,3 — as a physiological substrate for EphB2. EphB2 causes tyrosine phosphorylation in the proline-rich domain of synaptojanin 1, and inhibits both the interaction with endophilin and the 5′-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin 1. Treatment with the EphB ligand, ephrinB2, elevates the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and promotes transferrin uptake. A kinase inactive mutant of EphB2 and a phosphorylation site mutant of synaptojanin 1 both neutralize the increase of transferrin uptake after ephrinB2 treatment. These mutants also inhibit AMPA glutamate receptor endocytosis in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, incorporated transferrin does not reach endosomes, suggesting dual effects of EphB signalling on the early and late phases of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our results indicate that ephrinB–EphB signalling regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis in various cellular contexts by influencing protein interactions and phosphoinositide turnover through tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptojanin 1."

Thus, the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is an obligatory step in the control of glucose uptake in muscle and fat and the reduction of hepatic glucose output regulated by insulin.

The sufficiency of an Akt PH domain mutant to rescue PTEN-deficient Drosophila indicates that Akt is the primary target activated by increased PI(3,4,5)P3 levels.

In these studies, high expression of full-length PTEN suppressed insulin-stimulated Akt activation and glucose transport. Conversely, expression of dominant negative PTEN enhanced Akt activation (32Ono H. Katagiri H. Funaki M. Anai M. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Onishi Y. Fujishiro M. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the role of PTEN is controversial as recent results derived from the expression of a dominant inhibitory PTEN mutant indicate that endogenous PTEN may not modulate the metabolic function of insulin in fat cells (34Mosser V.A.

SHIP2 (Src homology 2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase 2) is a recently identified lipid phosphatase that hydrolyzes the 5′-phosphate of the inositol ring from PI(3,4,5)P3. SHIP2 is more broadly detected than the isoform SHIP1, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells (35Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Hori H. Wada T. Hirai H. Haruta T. Langlois W.J. Kobayashi M.

Numerous studies have shown that expression of dominant negative SHIP2 inactivates insulin signaling by blocking the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (38Wada T. Sasaoka T. Funaki M.

Consistent with a role for SHIP2 as a negative regulator of insulin signaling, homozygous disruption of SHIP2 causes severe hypoglycemia and death within a few hours after birth (41Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J. Pesesse X. Sasaki T. Penninger J. Doherty M. Malaisse W. Dumont J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Erneux C. Hue L. Schurmans S. Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Heterozygous disruption of this gene leads to insulin hypersensitivity as demonstrated by an increase in GLUT4 translocation and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles in response to insulin. Injection of d-glucose resulted in a more rapid glucose clearance in SHIP2(+/-) mice than in wild-type mice (41Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J. Pesesse X. Sasaki T. Penninger J. Doherty M. Malaisse W. Dumont J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Erneux C. Hue L. Schurmans S. Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, no information on insulin-induced Akt activation or on metabolic regulation by insulin in fat cells from heterozygous mice was provided in these studies. Furthermore, a recent study suggested that the phenotype of the SHIP2 knock-out mouse generated by Clement et al. (41Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J. Pesesse X. Sasaki T. Penninger J. Doherty M. Malaisse W. Dumont J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Erneux C. Hue L. Schurmans S. Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) may have been due to an incomplete knock-out of SHIP2, as a separately generated SHIP2 knock-out mouse was normoglycemic and resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity (42Sleeman M.W. Wortley K.E. Lai K.M. Gowen L.C. Kintner J. Kline W.O. Garcia K. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Glass D.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus the role of SHIP2 as a negative regulator of insulin signaling in white adipose tissue remains unclear. Based on the above review of the literature, definitive experiments testing the role of PTEN or SHIP2 in insulin signaling in adipocytes through depletion of these proteins have not yet been conducted. In this present investigation, we have tested the relative importance of endogenous SHIP2 and PTEN in the control of insulin induced Akt activation and 2-deoxyglucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by RNAi-based gene silencing. Depletion of PTEN markedly enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt and GSK-3α phosphorylation, as well as insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Surprisingly, almost complete loss of SHIP2 had no detectable effect on these insulin-regulated events. Taken as a whole, these results reveal the surprising result that PTEN, but not SHIP2, functions as a suppressor of insulin signaling to glucose transport through the PI 3-kinase → Akt pathway in cultured adipocytes.

The 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with siRNA duplexes by electroporation. Briefly, the adipocytes, on the 4th or 5th day of differentiation, were detached from culture dishes with 0.25% trypsin and 0.5 mg of collagenase/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Half of the cells from one 150-mm dish were then mixed with the indicated siRNA duplexes, which were delivered to the cells by a pulse of electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser II system at the setting of 0.18 kV and 950 microfarads capacitance. After electroporation, cells were immediately mixed with fresh medium before reseeding into multiple-well plates, designated for Western blotting or deoxyglucose uptake assay. siRNA-induced Degradation of PTEN and SHIP2—The siRNA species purchased from Dharmacon were designed to target the following cDNA sequences: scrambled, 5′-CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGG-3′; PTEN siRNA, 5′-GTATAGAGCGTGCAGATAA-3′; SHIP2 siRNA, 5′-GTGAGGAGGAGATATCTTT-3′. Either 30 nmol of scrambled siRNA, 30 nmol of PTEN siRNA, or 20 nmol of SHIP2 siRNA species were electroporated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described previously (16Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A.

After 72 h, cells were harvested, and equal amounts of protein from different lysates resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyses by immunoblot with indicated antibodies. Immunoblotting—3T3-L1 adipocytes electroporated with indicated siRNA were starved overnight in serum-free DMEM medium. Cells were then incubated without or with the indicated insulin concentrations for 30 min and then harvested with lysis buffer containing 1% SDS. Equal amounts of protein from lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Proteins were then detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Detection of Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Trisphosphate (PIP3)— 3T3-L1 adipocytes electroporated with the indicated siRNA were starved overnight in serum-free DMEM medium. Cells were incubated without or with the indicated insulin concentrations for 10 min, and then phospholipids were extracted with 1:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol, as described (44Lawe D.C. Sitouah N.

Aliquots of the resulting organic phase were applied on activated (110 °C, 1 h) TLC plates. The phospholipids were separated by the chromatographic solvent system chloroform: methanol:acetone:acetic acid:water (80:26:30:24:16) with the PIP3 standard, run in parallel. The areas corresponding to PIP3 were eluted from the plate using chloroform:methanol (1:1). The organic phase was then dried, resuspended in a small volume, and spotted onto Hybond nitrocellulose for probing with anti-PIP3 monoclonal antibody (Echelon) to specifically detect PIP3. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Assay—Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was estimated by measuring 2-deoxyglucose uptake as described (16Jiang Z.Y.

Briefly, siRNA-transfected cells were reseeded on 24-well plates and cultured for 72 h and then washed twice and starved for 2 h with Krebs-Ringer's Hepes buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were then stimulated with insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was initiated by addition of [1,2-3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose to a final assay concentration of 100 μm for 5 min at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by three washes with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer's Hepes buffer, and the cells were solubilized with 0.4 ml of 1% SDS, and 3H uptake was quantitated by scintillation counting. Nonspecific deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from each determination to obtain specific uptake. Insulin-stimulated Deoxyglucose Transport Is Enhanced by siRNA-based Depletion of Endogenous PTEN but Not by Depletion of SHIP2 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—It has been reported that both PTEN and SHIP2 phosphatases are expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (32Ono H.

In addition, it has been shown that SHIP2(+/-) mice exhibit hypersensitivity to insulin and more rapid glucose clearance than wild-type mice (41Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J.

Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), suggesting that SHIP2 may be a negative regulator for glucose transport. However, more definitive approaches, such as depletion of the endogenous phosphatases, have not been used to address the function of SHIP2 and PTEN phosphatases in insulin signaling in either primary or cultured adipocytes. Thus, our first set of experiments was designed to selectively deplete endogenous SHIP2 versus PTEN proteins in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Assays were then performed to examine how the absence of each one of these phosphatases affects insulin-stimulated signaling. To specifically decrease SHIP2 or PTEN expression levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we used a siRNA-mediated gene silencing technique recently applied successfully to these cells (16Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L.

After 72 h, the cells were harvested, and PTEN and SHIP2 protein expression levels were assessed by immunoblotting. As depicted in Fig. 1, the protein expression level of PTEN was reduced by ∼50% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes electroporated with PTEN-directed siRNA but not with scrambled or SHIP2-directed siRNA (Fig. 1). Expression of SHIP2 protein was unaffected by treatment of the cultured adipocytes with PTEN-directed siRNA (Fig. 2). However, electroporation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with SHIP2-directed siRNA caused a marked reduction of SHIP2 protein expression (about 90% depletion, Fig. 2), without a detectable change in PTEN protein level (Fig. 1). Thus, selective depletion of both PTEN and SHIP2 phosphatases can be achieved by siRNA-mediated gene silencing in cultured adipocytes.Fig. 2Depletion of SHIP"
https://openalex.org/W2058600996,"The zebrafish gene, mind bomb (mib), encodes a protein that positively regulates of the Delta-mediated Notch signaling. It interacts with the intracellular domain of Delta to promote its ubiquitination and endocytosis. In our search for the mouse homologue of zebrafish mind bomb, we cloned two homologues in the mouse genome: a mouse orthologue (mouse mib1) and a paralogue, named mind bomb-2 (mib2), which is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human. Both Mib1 and Mib2 have an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in their C-terminal RING domain and interact with Xenopus Delta (XD) via their N-terminal region. Mib2 is also able to ligate ubiquitin to XD and shift the membrane localization of Delta to intracellular vesicles. Importantly, Mib2 rescues both the neuronal and vascular defects in the zebrafish mibta52b mutants. In contrast to the functional similarities between Mib1 and Mib2, mib2 is highly expressed in adult tissues, but almost not at all in embryos, whereas mib1 is abundantly expressed in both embryos and adult tissues. These data suggest that Mib2 has functional similarities to Mib1, but might have distinct roles in Notch signaling as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Both Mib1 and Mib2 have an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in their C-terminal RING domain and interact with Xenopus Delta (XD) via their N-terminal region. Mib2 is also able to ligate ubiquitin to XD and shift the membrane localization of Delta to intracellular vesicles. Importantly, Mib2 rescues both the neuronal and vascular defects in the zebrafish mibta52b mutants. In contrast to the functional similarities between Mib1 and Mib2, mib2 is highly expressed in adult tissues, but almost not at all in embryos, whereas mib1 is abundantly expressed in both embryos and adult tissues. These data suggest that Mib2 has functional similarities to Mib1, but might have distinct roles in Notch signaling as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling mechanism, in which both the ligands and receptors are type 1 transmembrane proteins, thus restricting the Notch pathway to the regulation of interactions between physically adjacent cells (1Sorkin A.

To date, four Notch receptors and five ligands (Delta-like (Dll)-1, -3, and -4, and Jagged (Jag) 1 and 2) have been described in mammals. The interactions between these Notch receptors and ligands are essential for a wide range of developmental cell-to-cell interactions. When ligand-receptor interactions induce the sequential proteolytic cleavage events that release the intracellular domain of Notch receptor from the cell membrane, the Notch signaling pathway is activated (4Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 5Annaert W. De Strooper B.

In the nucleus, the intracellular domain of Notch receptor forms a complex with CSL (CBF1/RBP-Jκ, Su(H), Lag-1). This complex is a transcriptional activator, which induces the expression of genes encoding Hairy/Enhancer-of-split (HES)-related proteins, which inhibit the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (7Iso T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21232-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Many components of the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila were originally identified by mutants that confer a similar neurogenic phenotype in early embryos. The mutations of these genes, such as notch, delta, E(SPL), mastermind, and neuralized, result in an increase of neural cells at the expense of epidermal structures (9Thomas J.B. Crews S.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2476-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The signaling by Notch receptors involves three successive cleavages: the S1 cleavage in the trans-Golgi network by Furin-like proteases, the ligand-dependent extracellular S2 cleavage by metalloproteinases, and the intramembraneous S3 cleavage by γ-secretase complexes to release the active intracellular domain of Notch receptor (10Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the signaling cell, Delta-Notch interactions result in the endocytosis of Delta, which carries along the bound Notch extracellular domain, and the endocytosis-defective Delta mutants have reduced signaling capacity. The ligand-dependent extracellular S2 cleavage of Notch receptor is coupled to the trans-endocytosis of the Notch extracellular domain into the ligand expressing/signal sending cell (2Kramer H. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/53/PE1)PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there are two candidate genes, Neuralized (Neur) and Mib, which promote the ubiquitination and endocytosis of Notch ligands. Recently, Itoh et al. (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev.

Although Mind bomb and Neur might be key regulators in the endocytosis of Delta for the activation of Notch receptors, the molecular diversity of the vertebrate genes encoding five Notch ligands (Dll1, Dll3, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and four Notch receptors (Notch1–4) in mammals suggests that there might be an additional E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates Notch ligands. Indeed, all of these ligands have unique expression patterns, and the knock-out mice for each gene display a distinct phenotype. In parallel with the diversity of the ligands, more complex endocytic machinery might exist as well (12Hrabe de Angelis M. McIntyre 2nd, J. Gossler A.

In our search for the mouse Mind bomb homologue, we found one Mind bomb orthologue (Mib1) and one Mind bomb paralogue, Mind bomb-2 Mib2 (AY974090) skeletrophin (21Takeuchi T. Heng H.H. Ye C.J.

Here we show that Mib2 is another E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates the Notch ligand, Delta, and promotes its endocytosis. We propose that Mib2 might be an important E3 ubiquitin ligase for Delta in the Notch signaling pathway. Cloning of the Mouse mib2 Gene and Generation of Mutations in the Mib2 RING Finger Domain—PCR was carried out using mouse brain cDNA as the template and oligonucleotide primers designed to obtain the open reading frame of the mouse mib2 gene. The PCR for mib2 yielded a product of about 2750 bp, which was cloned into the hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mib, mind bomb; DA, dorsal artery; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. -tagged pcDNA vector (Invitrogen) or the pEGFPN3 vector (Clontech). The mib2 mutants with mutations in the RING finger domain were generated using DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All of the cloned cDNA vectors were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Northern Blot Analysis—Two probes were generated to detect the N- and C-terminal regions of Mib2. The PCR primers for the N-terminal probe (5′-probe) were mib2NL (CAGGTCGTGTGGTGGACAT) and mib2NR (GCTGTTGTGCTTGGTGAGAG). The PCR primers for the C-terminal probe (3′-probe) were mib2CL (GGTCGCTGTGATGTGAATGT) and mib2CR (CTGCCTGTCGTCCCTGAAG). For the expression analysis in the mouse adult tissues, the Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized with both probes. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Details of the RNA in situ hybridizations with zebrafish embryos were described for the various probes: huC (22Kim C.H. Ueshima E. Muraoka O. Tanaka H. Yeo S.Y.

Development. 2001; 128: 3675-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the β-galactosidase co-injected with the synthesized mRNAs, the embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 1 h and stained in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining buffer. In situ probes for mouse mib1 and mib2 were generated from HindIII-cleaved pcDNA-Mib1 and pcDNA-Mib2 expression vectors by Sp6 RNA polymerase (Fermentas). In situ probes for zebrafish mib1 and mib2 were cloned into pBluescript vectors (Invitrogen) and synthesized with SalI-cleaved vectors by T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas). The PCR primers for the zebrafish mib1 probe were z-mib1L (AGCAGACGGCATTACACCTT) and z-mib1R (TACCTTTCCCTCCACAGCAC). The PCR primers for the zebrafish mib2 probe were z-mib2L (ACATCAACATCCGCAACAAC) and z-mib2R (CGCTCCTCCATCTGTCTGTA). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK-293A or HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with appropriate amounts of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche). The lysates were sonicated several times, and the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the supernatants, containing 15–40 μg of protein, were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blotted with the primary antibody of interest and a secondary antibody. To detect the immunoreactive bands, ECL plus was used (Amersham Biosciences). Zebrafish Maintenance and mRNA Microinjections—Zebrafish were raised and maintained under standard conditions. The zebrafish mutant mibta52b was used as the mib1 mutant. The mouse mib2 cDNA was subcloned into the pCS2+ vector and the sense RNA encoding full-length mouse mib2 was transcribed in vitro using the SP6 Message Machine (Ambion, Austin, TX). The synthesized mib2 mRNA was microinjected into one-cell or two-cell stage zebrafish embryos. The amount of mRNA (∼100 pg) injected into the embryos was visually estimated from the injection volume. Immunoprecipitation—HEK-293A cells, transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm plate, were resuspended in IP buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol). After the cells were disrupted, the extracts were centrifuged to remove the debris. The supernatants were cleared using protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. The indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated by the addition of protein A/G beads pre-complexed with an anti-HA antibody or anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 8 h. The immune complexes bound to the protein A/G beads were washed with IP buffer and boiled in 2× SDS gel loading buffer, and the eluted proteins were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel. Immunoreactive proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Ub antibody (P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by either a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Promega) or an anti-HA horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Vitro and in Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—In vitro ubiquitination assays were modified from those previously described (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions contained ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1; Calbiochem), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5a (E2; Calbiochem), N-terminal His-tagged ubiquitin (Sigma), and ATP (2 mm). The purified GST-fused Mib1 and Mib2 RING and their mutants were added to the reactions. After incubation at room temperature, the reactions were analyzed by Western blotting to detect the ubiquitinated proteins. To detect the ubiquitination activity in vivo, HEK-293A cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm plate. MG132 (2 μm) was added 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. The lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (2 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS), and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated and the immunoreactive proteins were detected with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Promega). Subcellular Localization Analysis—HeLa cells were transfected with various plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 3% sucrose for 30 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were incubated in blocking solution (3% skim milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) overnight at 4 °C, and then stained with mouse anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 3% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with an anti-mouse antibody conjugated with TRITC for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and then stained with Hoechst (10 μg/ml) for 2 min. After three washes, the cells were mounted on glass slides and analyzed with a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. All images were collected on a Zeiss AxioCam HRc camera. Mib2 Is a Mib1 Paralogue—Zebrafish Mib1 is a E3 ubiquitin ligase that is an essential component of Notch signaling in lateral inhibition (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). By searching the EST and genomic databases, we found that the human and mouse genomes contained one mib orthologue (mib1, AY974091) and one mib paralogue, mind bomb-2 (mib2, AY974090). To investigate the function of Mib2, its cDNA was cloned and amplified through reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse brain and thymus RNA. During sequence confirmation, we found that it has several splicing variants. To clone the dominant form among the splicing variants, we compared the restriction enzyme digestion patterns and the sequences of independently subcloned cDNAs. From this comparison, we concluded that there were two major splicing variants. We also amplified the variable region of these two variants to determine the most abundant form in the various tissues. One of the two variants represented about 70% of the total mib2 transcripts, with slight differences in the various tissues. We also found that part of the mib2 amino acid sequences differs from the sequence of skeletrophin in the NCBI database. However, extensive confirmations of the different regions revealed that our sequence is correct (Fig. 1A). Mouse Mib1 and Mib2 have 36% identity and 52% similarity in their amino acid sequences, and they also have remarkable resemblance in their domain organization (Fig. 1, A and B). Mib2 has two herc2/mib domains, one ZZ zinc finger, one mib repeat, ankyrin repeats, and two RING domains (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). All of these domains are organized in a similar manner as compared with those of Mib1. Mib2 appears to be evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human (data not shown). Northern blot analyses using 5′- and 3′-probes revealed a 4.4-kb mib2 transcript, which could include its open reading frame (∼2.8-kb). We could not distinguish the splicing variants, which might be because of a small difference in the nucleotide length. mib2 was highly expressed in the heart, brain, liver, and kidney (Fig. 1C), whereas mib1 was highly expressed in testis (data not shown). The different expression patterns of these two genes suggest a distinct role of mib2 in vivo as compared with those of mib1. Mib2 Is an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase—Zebrafish Mib1 has an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with Delta, both in vitro and in vivo (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence homology and the similar domain organization, we speculate that Mib2 might have a similar biochemical activity. To test the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of the Mib2 RING finger in vitro, GST-Mib2 RING finger fusion proteins were incubated with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), ubiquitin, and ATP. The presence of ubiquitinated substrates was detected by Western blotting. As expected, a typical reaction mixture containing the RING finger domain from Mib1 resulted in a smear of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated substrates (Fig. 2B, lane 2), whereas a similar reaction containing GST was devoid of such activity (Fig. 2B, lane 1). When GST-Mib2 RING was tested in this assay, we observed robust ubiquitination in an E1 and E2 (UbcH5a) dependent manner (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5), indicating that Mib2 RING possesses an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Because Mib2 contains two RING finger domains, we tested which domain is necessary for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. We generated three RING mutant proteins that have a mutation in the first RING domain (Rmut1; C822S), the second RING domain (Rmut2; C899S), and both domains (Rmut3; C822S and C899S). In the mutant proteins containing a mutation in the second RING domain, the ubiquitination activity was strongly diminished (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5), whereas the mutation in the first RING domain did not affect the self-ubiquitination activity, indicating that the second Mib2 RING is directly responsible for the ubiquitin ligation in this reaction. To test the self-ubiquitination activity of Mib2 in vivo, HEK-293A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding full-length Mib2-GFP and Mib1-GFP. At 36 h post-transfection, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP (B2) antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-Ub (P4D1) antibody. Both Mib1 and Mib2 displayed increased levels of ubiquitination activity as compared with the mock-transfected control, and ubiquitination was dramatically increased in the presence of the proteosome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 5), suggesting the proteosomal degradation of these ubiquitinated proteins. Mib2 Interacts with Xenopus Delta Ligand—Both zebrafish Mib1 and Drosophila Neur interact with Delta, and they ubiquitinate it to target it to the cellular endocytic machinery (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev.

Cell. 2001; 1: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Mib2 also interacts with and ubiquitinates Delta, HA-tagged Mib2 (HA-Mib2) was co-transfected with either myc-tagged Xenopus Delta (XD-myc) or Xenopus Delta without its intracellular domain (XD-Δicd-myc) in HEK-293A cells. HA-Mib2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody to detect the co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged ligands. The results showed that both Mib1 and Mib2 interact with XD, but not with XD-Δicd (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that Mib2 binds to XD and that the intracellular domain of Delta ligand is essential for the interaction with Mib2. To identify the region of Mib2 that interacts with Delta ligand, XD-myc was co-transfected with HA-Mib2 or truncated forms of Mib2: the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–427), the middle region (amino acids 319–785), and the C-terminal region (amino acids 778–921) (Fig. 3A). All of the Mib2 forms were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody to detect the co-immunoprecipitation of XD-myc. Both full-length Mib2 and the truncated protein that included the N-terminal region were co-immunoprecipitated with XD-myc (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, these results indicate that Mib2 interacts with the intracellular domain of Delta through its N-terminal region. Mib2 Ubiquitinates Xenopus Delta Ligand—Zebrafish Mib1 interacts with Delta through its N-terminal and middle regions, and the Zebrafish Mib1 RING finger domain is responsible for the ubiquitination of Delta (11Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Because Mib2 also showed comparable activities in terms of self-ubiquitination and interaction with Delta, we examined whether it promotes ubiquitination of Delta. Accordingly, XD-myc and the candidate E3 ubiquitin ligases were co-transfected in HEK-293A cells. XD-myc was immunoprecipitated by an anti-Myc antibody, and the presence of ubiquitinated XD-myc was detected with an anti-Ub antibody. The ubiquitination of XD-myc was enhanced in the presence of both HA-Mib2 and HA-Mib1 (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 6). As expected, Mib2 mutant 3, which has mutations in the first and second RING domains (C822S and C899S), showed a basal level of ubiquitination, and the C-terminal region of Mib2, which does not bind Delta, showed a relatively low level of ubiquitination (Fig. 3D, lanes 4 and 5). From these data, we concluded that Mib2 interacts with and ubiquitinates Delta through its N-terminal region and RING finger domain, respectively. Mib2 has two RING finger domains, and the second Mib2 RING is directly responsible for self-ubiquitination (Fig. 2C). To test whether both RING finger domains are essential for the ubiquitination of Delta, Mib2 mutant proteins with point mutations in their RING finger domain (Mut1, 2, and 3 as previously described) were co-transfected with XD-myc. Unexpectedly, none of these mutants ubiquitinated XD-myc in vivo (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–5), despite the self-ubiquitination activity of the Mib2 RING mutant (Rmut1; C822S) in vitro (Fig. 2C, lane 3). These data indicate that both RING domains in Mib2 are essential for proper ubiquitination of its substrate, Delta. Mib2 Changes the Subcellular Localization of Xenopus Delta Ligand—To characterize the subcellular localization of Mib2, we used subcellular markers that distinguish the intracellular subcompartments (26Pfeffer S. Cell. 2003; 112: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with Mib2-GFP were stained with specific antibodies for the endogenous markers, EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1; early endosome), M6PR (mannose 6-phosphate receptor; late endosome), or HA-Hrs (hepatocyte responsive serum phosphoprotein; ubiquitinated cargo). Interestingly, Mib2-GFP co-localized with the early endosomal marker, EEA1, but not with M6PR or Hrs (supplemental materials Fig. 1). Taken together, these results indicate that Mib2 is an endosomal protein localized in the early endosomal compartments. In general, the ubiquitination of membrane proteins serves as a tag for endocytosis or for lysosomal targeting (27Aguilar R.C. Wendland B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To test whether Mib2 promotes the endocytosis of Delta, we coexpressed XD-myc along with Mib2-GFP in HeLa cells. When Mib2-GFP alone was expressed, it was localized in the cytoplasm as punctate structures (Fig. 4C, b and b′). XD-myc alone was expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4C, a and a′). In contrast, when both XD-myc and Mib2-GFP were co-expressed, XD-myc expression on the cell surface was decreased, and it accumulated in the cytoplasm as a vesicular structure, where it co-localized with Mib2-GFP (Fig. 4C, c and c″). These observations suggest that Mib2 promotes vesicular accumulation of Delta. When mutant Mib2-GFPs with mutations in the RING finger domain (Mut1, Mut2, and Mut3) were co-transfected with XD-myc in HeLa cells, none of these mutants were able to promote endocytosis of XD-myc (Fig. 4C, d and d″, e and e″, and f and f″). As expected, endocytosis of XD-Δicd was undetectable in the co-transfection of Mib2-GFP and XD-Δicd, which does not interact with Mib2. Thus, both the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mib2 and the intracellular domain of XD are required for Delta endocytosis. Mib2 Rescues the Neurogenic and Vasculogenic Phenotypes of Zebrafish mibta52b Mutants—Because Mib2 has biochemical similarities to Mib1, such as ligand binding, the ubiquitin ligase activity, and the endocytic activity for Delta, we tested the possibility that Mib2 may rescue the defects in neurogenesis and vasculogenesis of the zebrafish mib1 mutant, mibta52b. The zebrafish mibta52b mutants exhibit massive neurogenesis, such as increased number of huC (early neuronal cell marker) expressing cells in neuroepithelium. Zebrafish embryos from mibta52b heterozygote intercrosses were injected in one side at the two-cell stage with mRNA encoding zebrafish Mib1 (positive control) or mouse Mib2, and their effects on neurogenesis were assayed by examining huC expression at the three-somite stage. The ectopic overexpression of zebrafish mib1 reversed the massive huC expression in mibta52b mutants compared with its non-injected side (Fig. 5A, left panel). Interestingly, when mouse mib2 mRNA was ectopically overexpressed in the mibta52b mutants, huC expression was also dramatically reduced as compared with that of the non-injected side (Fig. 5A, right panel). Enlarged views revealed a lower density of huC-expressing cells in the mib2 mRNA-injected side in the mibta52b mutants, suggesting that Mib2 is able to generate Notch signaling to inhibit the neuronal fate in the neuroepithelium (Fig. 5A, a and b) (11Itoh M.

https://openalex.org/W2131898220,"SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is a member of the ubiquitin family of proteins. SUMO targets include proteins involved in numerous roles including nuclear transport and transcriptional regulation. The previous finding that mutant ataxin-1[82Q] disrupted promyelocytic leukemia (PML) oncogenic domains prompted us to determine whether ataxin-1 disrupts another component of PML oncogenic domains, Sp100 (100-kDa Speckled protein). Similar to the PML protein, mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed Sp100 to mutant ataxin-1[82Q] nuclear inclusions. Based on the ability of PML and Sp100 to be covalently modified by SUMO, we investigated the ability of ataxin-1 to be SUMOylated. SUMO-1 was found to covalently modify the polyglutamine repeat protein ataxin-1. There was a decrease in ataxin-1 SUMOylation in the presence of the expanded polyglutamine tract, ataxin-1[82Q]. The phospho-mutant, ataxin-1[82Q]-S776A, restored SUMO levels to those of wild-type ataxin-1[30Q]. SUMOylation of ataxin-1 was dependent on a functional nuclear localization signal. Ataxin-1 SUMOylation was mapped to at least five lysine residues. Lys16, Lys194 preceding the polyglutamine tract, Lys610/Lys697 in the C-terminal ataxin high mobility group domain, and Lys746 all contribute to ataxin-1 SUMOylation.

Protein modification by small polypeptides is an important mechanism for tightly controlling protein events. Ubiquitin is one such attachment, and it is clear that ubiquitylation of proteins regulates more than their cellular metabolism. The ubiquitin-like modifiers are a group of proteins having homology to ubiquitin. These proteins modify their target proteins in an enzymatic pathway similar to ubiquitin conjugation. SUMO 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifiers; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; Sp100, 100-kDa Speckled protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HMG, high mobility group; AXH, ataxin HMG domain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; POD, PML oncogenic domain; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. (small ubiquitin-like modifiers) is a member of this family of proteins, and SUMO targets include proteins involved in subcellular trafficking and gene regulation (1Pichler A. Melchior F.

In some cases such as IκBα, SUMOylation functions as an antagonist to ubiquitylation, generating proteins resistant to degradation (3Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). SUMO targets include diverse substrates such as promyelocytic leukemia (PML), 100-kDa Speckled protein (Sp100), RanGAP1, histone deacetylase 4, and p53 (4Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J.

The list of proteins targeted by SUMO is rapidly increasing, and this modification has now been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases (12Ueda H. Goto J. Hashida H. Lin X. Oyanagi K.

SUMO was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using PML as bait. SUMO has been given numerous other names including PML-interacting protein (PIC1), Sentrin, and GAP-modifying protein 1 but now is commonly referred to as SUMO (5Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are three SUMO genes, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. The SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 genes share ∼50% identity to SUMO-1. Unlike SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 contain an internal SUMO consensus sequence and are capable of forming poly-SUMO chains (14Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). There is some sequence homology between ubiquitin and SUMO (18%), but structurally they adopt nearly identical structures (15Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO conjugation occurs via covalent modification of target lysine residues (15Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Functionally, SUMOylation mimics ubiquitylation in a parallel but non-overlapping E1/E2/E3 enzyme cascade (16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). To date, only a single E1 heterodimer complex (Uba2/Aos1) and a single E2-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) have been described for SUMO (16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Three classes of E3-conjugating enzymes have been reported for SUMOylation: 1) the PIAS (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STATs) of which p53 is a substrate; 2) the nucleoporin RanBP2, a member of the nuclear pore complex; and 3) the polycomb group protein Pc2 (1Pichler A. Melchior F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease that results in atrophy of cerebellar Purkinje cells (19Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). SCA1 is caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat tract in the SCA1 gene, resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine tract within the protein (19Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Accumulation of mutant ataxin-1[82Q] into nuclear inclusions is a hallmark of disease. Ataxin-1 contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS), and mutation of this NLS results in cytoplasmic localization of ataxin-1 and a reduction in disease pathology (20Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed PML oncogenic domains (PODs) to large mutant ataxin-1[82Q] foci or nuclear inclusions (21Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The effect of this redistribution is unknown; however, the cellular distribution of PODs in relationship to nuclear organization is tightly regulated (22Weis K. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Jansen J. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Dejean A. Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 23Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A.

Szostecki C. Calvo F. Chomienne C. Degos L. Puvion E. de Thé H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The presence of PML is critical for the proper formation of PODs (25Maul G.G. Negorev D. Bell P. Ishov A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). SUMO modification of PML is required for the recruitment of other proteins into the PODs, suggesting a dynamic balance between PML SUMOylation and protein localization to PODs (16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 26Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). PML and PODs are thought to have a role in transcription (both as co-activators and co-repressors), translation, DNA repair/DNA replication, mRNA transport/stability, and proteasome-dependent degradation (27Borden K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have focused on PML and its involvement with PODs, the first protein isolated from PODs was Sp100 (5Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 28Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Will H. Semin. Liver Dis. 1997; 17: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sp100 does not interact directly with PML (4Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Sp100 is SUMOylated, although SUMOylation is not essential for POD formation or nuclear localization, suggesting that Sp100 SUMOylation is involved in mediating other events. Sp100 contains a high mobility group (HMG-1) domain and has been shown to interact with members of the heterochromatin family (HP1) that function as transcriptional co-repressors. The SUMOylation site of Sp100 overlaps with the HP1 binding domain, and SUMOylation could regulate the interaction of Sp100 with HP1 (4Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 29Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Sitterlin D. Transy C. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7316-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to PML and Sp100, SUMOylation has been described for RanGAP1 where SUMOylation targets RanGAP1 to the nuclear pore complex. As a result of a SUMO-1 E3 ligase residing at the nuclear pore, RanBP2, it has been hypothesized that a large number of proteins are SUMOylated at the nuclear pore (1Pichler A. Melchior F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Besides regulating subnuclear localization, SUMOylation is hypothesized to regulate import/export efficiency. Here we show that ataxin-1 is SUMOylated and that SUMOylation is dependent on the length of the polyglutamine tract, the ability of ataxin-1 to be phosphorylated at serine 776, and the integrity of the NLS of ataxin-1. The dependence of ataxin-1 on phosphorylation and nuclear localization is reminiscent of other nuclear body proteins, namely PML, Sp100, and histone deacetylase 4, where SUMOylation controls their nucleocytoplasmic trafficking as well as their ability to function as transcriptional regulators. Expression Constructs—Plasmids for pCDNA1Amp-ataxin-1[30Q] and [82Q] have been described previously (21Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The plasmid for pCDNA-ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 has also been described (30Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T. Tousey S.K. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. Neuron. 2003; 38: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCDNA1Amp-ataxin-1[82Q]-K772T and ataxin-1[82Q]-Δ77 were as described previously (20Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The pCDNA1Amp-ataxin-1[30Q]-K772T was constructed by digesting pCDNA1Amp-ataxin-1[82Q]-K772T with Nar1 and Age1 to cut out the fragment containing 772T. This fragment was then cloned into pCDNA1Amp-ataxin-1[30Q]. The pCNDA1.1Amp-ataxin-1[30Q] expression construct was used as a template for QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) to make the lysine to arginine mutations in the SUMO-1 consensus sites. Primer pairs are listed Supplemental Table I. To construct the multiple lysine to arginine mutations in ataxin-1[30Q], the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. The ataxin-1[30Q]-K16R mutant was used as the template. The sequences of the primers used are the same as in Supplemental Table I, but they were 5′-phosphorylated and only the sense strand was used in the mutagenesis reaction. The pCDNA3-HA-SUMO-1 plasmid and pCDNA3-HA plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. Serena Kwek (9Kwek S.S. Derry J. Tyner A.L. Shen Z. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—COS-1 cells were plated the day before transfection at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm plate. The following day, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in SDS-containing buffer (one part SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol) plus three parts of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton-X-100) containing 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), phosphatase inhibitors cocktails I and II (Sigma)) (3Desterro J.M.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After scraping in a 60-mm plate, lysis buffer plus cells were diluted 10 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus protease/phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were collected into 1.5-ml tubes, incubated on ice for 15 min, and passaged 10 times with a 21-gauge needle followed by passage through a 25-gauge needle four times. Extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were quantified by Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations, 500 μg of cell lysate, 50 μl of protein A (Amersham Biosciences), and 2 μl of 11NQ (residues 164–197) or 11750 (last 269 residues of ataxin-1) were incubated with rocking overnight at 4 °C (21Skinner P.J.

Alternately, cells were washed as described above and then harvested using denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors as described above) directly in a 60-mm plate. After the addition of denaturing buffer, the cells were lysed with rocking at 4 °C for 15 min (31Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Extracts were sheared and centrifuged as described above. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 500 μg of cell lysate, 50 μl of protein A, and 2 μl of anti-ataxin-1 antibody 11750 with rocking overnight at 4 °C (4Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H.

The following day, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 s at 12,000 rpm and washed four times with denaturing buffer. The beads were heated for 10 min at 70 °C in SDS-loading dye (4 times, 30 μl, Invitrogen) plus sample reducing agent (3 μl, Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitations were electrophoresed through 4–12% Bis-Tris gels using MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-SUMO-1 antibody (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or with anti-HA antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Total ataxin-1 protein levels (10–15 μg) were electrophoresed as described above; however, membranes were probed for 1 h with anti-ataxin-1 antibody (11750, 1:2500) at room temperature followed by detection with Western lighting chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence—COS-1 cells were plated onto coverslips at 2 × 105 density in a 6-well plate. The following day, they were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus. 48 h post-transfection, cells were immunostained as previously described (21Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To visualize endogenous Sp100, rabbit anti-Sp100 antibody (1:200) (provided by Jacob Seeler, Pasteur Institut) (29Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Sitterlin D. Transy C. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7316-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) followed by rabbit anti-Cy3 (1:200) (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used. Endogenous SUMO-1 was visualized with anti-SUMO-1 antibody (10 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The different forms of ataxin-1 were visualized with anti-ataxin-1 (antibody 11750, 1:200) followed by rabbit Alexa 488 (1:200, Molecular Probes) or mouse FLAG M2 (Sigma) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (100 ng/ml, Sigma) to visualize the nucleus for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted onto slides, and analysis was performed using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). Ataxin-1 Disrupts Sp100 Localization—Previously, it was shown that mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed PODs to large mutant ataxin-1[82Q]nuclear inclusions (21Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). PODs are a large arsenal of SUMOylated proteins involved in diverse functions in the cell (16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Besides PML, Sp100 is another important member of PODs, although it does not interact with PML (25Maul G.G. Negorev D. Bell P. Ishov A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed PML, we sought to determine whether ataxin-1 could also redistribute Sp100 (4Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we overexpressed wild-type ataxin-1[30Q], mutant ataxin-1[82Q], the phospho-mutant, ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 (30Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T. Tousey S.K.

Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Immunostaining 48 h post-transfection demonstrated that, similar to PML, mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed endogenous Sp100 to mutant ataxin-1 inclusions (Fig. 1, g–i). Endogenous Sp100 exhibited diffuse nuclear staining with additional dot-like staining in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1, red fluorescence). Wild-type ataxin-1[30Q], either as diffuse nuclear staining or nuclear inclusions, showed very little, if any, co-localization with Sp100 (Fig. 1, a–f). Ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 (Fig. 1, m–o) also did not show localization with Sp100, even in the presence of ataxin-1 inclusion bodies (m–o). However, Sp100 was redistributed to the nucleolus in the presence of wild-type ataxin-1[30Q] and ataxin-1[82Q]-A776, as demonstrated by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (data not shown). Strikingly, expanded ataxin-1 with a mutation rendering the NLS non-functional sequestered Sp100 to cytoplasmic ataxin-1 inclusions (Fig. 1, j–l). Ataxin-1 Co-localization with SUMO-1—Nuclear localization of PML and Sp100 is integral for covalent modification by SUMO. As a first step in assessing the SUMOylation status of ataxin-1, ataxin-1 co-localization with SUMO-1 was determined. Immunofluorescence studies using cells overexpressing wild-type ataxin-1[30Q] or mutant ataxin-1[82Q] were carried out using anti-ataxin-1 antibody 11750 and anti-SUMO-1 antibody. In COS-1 cells, endogenous SUMO-1 showed diffuse nuclear staining (data not shown). In the presence of wild-type ataxin-1[30Q], SUMO-1 co-localized with ataxin-1 (Fig. 2, a–c). In COS-1 cells overexpressing mutant ataxin-1[82Q], SUMO-1 staining was at the periphery or juxtaposed on the outside of mutant ataxin-1 inclusions (Fig. 2, e–g). It is possible that this pattern reflects inefficient SUMO-1 antibody penetration within the mutant ataxin-1[82Q] nuclear inclusions. SUMO-1 conjugation is regulated by phosphorylation, and ataxin-1 is phosphorylated. Therefore, the ataxin-1 construct that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 776, ataxin-1[82Q]-A776, was utilized (7Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In the presence of ataxin-1[82Q]-A776, there was SUMO-1 co-localization (Fig. 2, i–k). To date, the majority of SUMO-1 targets described have been nuclear proteins and, as such, SUMO-1 modification has been suggested to be a predominantly nuclear process. Ataxin-1 has two possible nuclear localization signals, Lys16 and Lys772, the latter of which has been shown to be a functional NLS. To investigate nuclear transport on ataxin-1 co-localization with SUMO-1, the NLS mutants, ataxin-1[30Q]-K772T and ataxin-1[82Q]-K772T, were used (8Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Both ataxin-1[30Q]-K772T and ataxin-1[82Q]-K772T were predominantly cytoplasmic in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2, m–t), but the protein retained the ability to form inclusions (Fig. 2, m–t). There was no evidence of co-localization of SUMO-1 with cytoplasmic ataxin-1[30Q]-K772T or ataxin-1[82]-K772T (Fig. 2, m–t), suggesting that nuclear localization of ataxin-1 is important for co-localization with SUMO-1. SUMOylation of Ataxin-1 in Vivo—Sequence analyses of SUMO-1 target proteins led to identification of a loose consensus sequence for SUMOylation in which a target lysine is modified, namely ψ-K-X-D/E, where ψ is a hydrophobic residue and D/E represent an acidic residue (35Lieberman A.P. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The examination of the sequence of ataxin-1 revealed seventeen possible SUMOylation sites (Fig. 3A and Table I). The putative SUMO-1 consensus sequences are depicted in relation to previously characterized regions within ataxin-1 (Fig. 3A). Twelve of the 17 sites are clustered near the C terminus of ataxin-1. Intriguingly one of the predicted SUMOylation sites in the N terminus is at the start of the polyglutamine stretch. Within the C terminus of ataxin-1, there is a region with high homology to the HMG-box transcription factor HBP1 (heterochromatin-binding protein 1) and Sp100-HMG that is designated the AXH domain (ataxin HMG domain) (Fig. 3A) (36Chen Y.W.

Therefore, our data suggest that S. solfataricus has co-opted this bacterial regulatory system to generate a rudimentary form of chromatin regulation. The process of packaging genomic DNA into cells presents problems in accessing the genetic material. In eukaryotic cells, the fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome composed of roughly 150 base pairs of DNA wrapped around two copies of each of four histone proteins (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). The covalent modification of histones is a major feature of eukaryotic gene regulation, DNA repair, and DNA replication (2Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). More specifically, tails that extend from the central histone fold act as the primary sites for a range of modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and acetylation (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar). The reversible acetylation of lysine residues has been particularly well studied, and a range of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases has been identified. Distinct histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases have defined substrate preferences, and the combinatorial modification of histone tails has been proposed to form a “histone code” (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although some Archaea also possess histones (4Sandman K. Krzycki J.A. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5788-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), they do not possess the tail domains and no evidence has been found for post-translational modification of archaeal histones (5Forbes A.J.

Furthermore, members of the Crenarchaeal kingdom of Archaea, such as Sulfolobus solfataricus, do not possess histones (6She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J.

A. 2001; 98: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The best characterized Sulfolobus chromatin proteins are the Sul7d family and Alba (reviewed in Ref. 7White M.F. Bell S.D. Trends Genet. 2003; 18: 621-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sul7d proteins are differentially monomethylated on specific lysine residues (8Edmondson S.P. Shriver J.W. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the consequences of this modification remain unclear and the identity of the enzyme responsible for methylation is currently unknown. More recently, Alba (formerly known as Sso10b (9Lurz R. Grote M. Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Dobrinski B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Forterre P. Confalonieri F. Knapp S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 669-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) was found to be acetylated on lysine 16 (11Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), lowering the affinity of Alba for DNA. A Sulfolobus homolog of the conserved Sir2 NAD-dependent deacetylase was found to interact with, and deacetylate, Alba (11Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The Sir2 proteins (or sirtuins) form a family of broadly conserved deacetylases found in all three domains of life (12Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 13Blander G. Guarente L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). They have been demonstrated to deacetylate a range of substrates including histones, p53, and tubulin in eukaryotes (13Blander G. Guarente L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In the bacterium Salmonella enterica, a sirtuin, CobB, deacetylates and regulates acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) 1The abbreviations used are: ACS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; ssPat, S. solfataricus Pat; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; mut, mutated; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation.

The enzyme responsible for acetylating ACS, Pat, has recently been identified (15Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that a Sulfolobus homolog of Pat specifically acetylates Alba on lysine 16 and lowers its DNA binding affinity. These results indicate that the Sir2/Pat pairing has been conserved in prokaryotic evolution. Furthermore, our results suggest that Sulfolobus has co-opted these bacterial metabolic regulators to generate a rudimentary form of chromatin modification system. Identification of ssPat—The sequence of the final 95 amino acid residues of S. enterica Pat was used to perform a Blast search (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) of the S. solfataricus P2 genome sequence. Cloning and Purification of ssPat—The SSO2813 open reading frame was amplified using the PCR with oligonucleotides Pat5, 5′-GGGATCCCATATGAATGACCAGATAAAGATAAG-3′, and Pat3, 5′-GAATTCTCGAGTGGGGCGGAGAAAGTTGCTAG-3′. The PCR introduced NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined and in boldface) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the open reading frame. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET30a linearized with the same enzymes. The identity of the resultant pET30-Pat plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pET30-Pat expresses ssPat with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Rosetta cells (Novagen) were transformed with pET30-Pat and plated, and a 50-ml overnight culture grown of which 20 ml was used the following morning to inoculate 1 liter of fresh L broth was supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Cells were grown shaking at 37 °C until A600 nm = 0.6, and then the expression of ssPat was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl (2× TBS), and lysed in an Emul-soFlex-C5 cell cracker (Glen Creston, Stanmore, United Kingdom). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was heated to 75 °C for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation. The heat-stable ssPat remained soluble and was purified by passage over a 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. Samples were applied in 2× TBS, washed sequentially with 25 ml of 2× TBS and then with 15 ml of 2× TBS with 15 mm imidazole followed by elution in 2× TBS + 500 mm imidazole. Positive fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed overnight against 1000 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. One volume of dialysate was diluted next with 2.3 volumes of water and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min. ssPat remained soluble and was applied to a HiTrap Q XL column equilibrated in 3 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 45 mm NaCl. The column was developed with a 20-column volume linear gradient to 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl. ssPat eluted as a sharp peak at roughly 800 mm NaCl. The peak sample was dialyzed against 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl and stored at 4 °C. The ssPat-mut was purified by the same procedure. Acetylation Assays—Acetylation assays containing the indicated amounts of ssPat and Alba, purified as described previously (17Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J.M. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with 1 μl (1.85 kBq) of [14C,C1]acetyl-CoA (2.11 GBq/mmol) were performed in a 10-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE-loading buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide gels. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, gels were destained, dried, and exposed to a storage phosphorimaging screen between 8 and 15 h. For acetylation of Alba for use in EMSA and mass spectrometry, the reaction volume was scaled up to 100 μl containing 5 μg of Alba and 1 μg of Pat. After mixing, two 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn and unlabeled acetyl-CoA was added to one aliquot to a final concentration of 100 μm. Both reactions, with and without acetyl-CoA, were incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. Stoichiometry of Acetylation—Acetylation reactions were set up containing [14C,C1]acetyl-CoA and 23 pmol of Alba in the presence or absence of 500 ng of Pat. Alba was quantified by measuring the A280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient 1280 cm–1 m–1. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 60 °C and then terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE-loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. Following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the Alba band was excised from the gel, crushed, and placed in scintillation fluid. Background levels were obtained from a blank lane that lacked Alba in the reaction. The value obtained from scintillation counting was corrected for background and compared with a standard curve of counts from [14C,C1]acetyl-CoA. This revealed that 20 pmol of acetyl-CoA had been incorporated. Mass Spectrometry—The Alba gel band was excised from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel, washed, and in-gel-digested with chymotrypsin overnight at 25 °C, essentially as described (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). A portion of the extracted chymotryptic peptides mixture was desalted and concentrated using a Gel-loader tip filled with Poros oligo R3 sorbent (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The bound peptides were eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid directly into a nanoelectrospray capillary and then introduced into a Q-STAR hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). The MS survey scan for peptides from m/z 450 to 1000 was measured. Selected ions were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with nitrogen in the collision cell, and the spectra of fragment ions produced were recorded in the time-of-flight mass analyzer. EMSA—The indicated amounts of proteins were incubated in 20 μlof 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl for 10 min at 60 °C with a 20-base pair duplex DNA or RNA oligonucleotide prior to separation on a 8% polyacrylamide gel running in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA. The DNA oligonucleotide was prepared by annealing 5′-GATTTGTGACTTTGGTTACA-3′ with its complement 5′-TGTAACCAAAGTCACAAATC-3′ and the RNA duplex by annealing 5′-GAUUUGUGACUUUGGUUACA-3′ with 5′-UGUAACCAAAGUCACAAAUC-3′. Both DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. ChIP—The ChIP experiments were performed as described previously (19Robinson N.P. Dionne I. Lundgren M. Marsh V.L. Bernander R. Bell S.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) using antisera raised by immunization of sheep with recombinant Alba. ChIPs contained 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The control ChIP additionally contained 20 μg of pure recombinant Alba as competitor. The antiserum was a kind gift from Malcolm White (St. Andrews University). DNA recovered from immune or preimmune precipitates was amplified using oligonucleotide primers specific for the genomic regions indicated in Fig. 1B. Sequences of the oligonucleotides are available on request. Nucleic Acid Association of Alba—Three O.5-ml aliquots of midlogarithmic S. solfataricus culture were pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 2 min and then resuspended in 200 μl of Bugbuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagen). One of these aliquots was supplemented with 10 mm Mgcl2 and treated with 200 units of RNasin® RNase inhibitor (Promega) and 100 units of DNase 1 (Roche Applied Science). A second aliquot was supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and treated with 5 μg of RNase A (Mp Biomedicals UK). The third aliquot remained untreated. All three aliquots were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were withdrawn, and the pellets were resuspended in an equal volume. 10 μl of each of these samples were loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel and visualized via Western blotting using antisera previously raised against recombinant Alba by sheep immunization (a kind gift of Malcolm White). Although initially characterized as an abundant chromatin protein in Sulfolobus species, recent work has indicated that Alba also possesses RNA binding activity. Furthermore, UV-cross-linking studies revealed that Alba can associate with RNA in vivo (20Guo R. Xue H. Huang L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although a number of laboratories have demonstrated that Alba possesses DNA binding activity in vitro, we wished to determine whether Alba was associated with chromosomal DNA in vivo. To this end, we employed the chromatin fractionation technique described by Matsunaga et al. (21Matsunaga F. Forterre P. Ishino Y. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11152-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1A, Alba is associated with the insoluble chromatin-containing fraction. Treatment of the pellet fraction with DNase I solubilized a significant proportion of Alba. Interestingly, the treatment of the pellet with RNase A also liberated Alba. Thus, these data indicate that Alba is associated with both DNA and RNA in vivo. We were concerned that the association of Alba with DNA in the chromatin pellet observed in Fig. 1A may have arisen during preparation of the material. To take a snap shot of the location of Alba in living cells, we treated mid-logarithmic cells with formaldehyde to introduce protein-DNA cross-links and then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti-Alba antibody. To confirm the specificity of the immunoprecipitation, we performed a control ChIP in which an excess of pure recombinant Alba was added as competitor. We then tested for co-precipitation of DNA from several loci around the S. solfataricus genome by PCR amplification (Fig. 1B). As can be seen in Fig. 1C, DNA corresponding to the eight randomly chosen regions was co-immunoprecipitated with Alba and significantly reduced levels of DNA were immunoprecipitated in the presence of the competitor. Taken together with Fig. 1A, these data strongly support a role for Alba as a bona fide chromatin protein in vivo. Identification of ssPat as an Alba Acetyltransferase—The C-terminal 95 residues of the predicted protein product of S. enterica pat show homology to the Gcn5 acetyltransferase superfamily.

This search revealed that the 160 amino acid open reading frame encoded by the SSO2813 gene is homologous to the C-terminal Gcn5 acetyltransferase homology region of S. enterica Pat (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Fig. 1). The predicted polypeptide sequence of the product of the SSO2813 gene (hereafter referred to as ssPat) possesses regions with high sequence homology to the domains A and B′ of the Gcn5 acetyltransferase superfamily. In particular, the domain A region involved in acetyl-CoA binding is readily identifiable. In S. enetrica, Pat and Sir2 work antagonistically to regulate ACS (15Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated a functional interaction between S. solfataricus Sir2 and the chromatin protein Alba. For this reason, we speculated that ssPat might have a role in acetylating Alba. To test this possibility, recombinant ssPat was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged protein and purified (Fig. 2B). ssPat was tested for its ability to use [14C,C1]acetyl-CoA to acetylate recombinant Alba. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, ssPat acetylates Alba. Interestingly, only very low levels of auto-acetylation by ssPat were observed upon prolonged exposure of the gel (data not shown), indicating a degree of substrate selectivity by the enzyme (see below). Note that a low level of ssPat-independent acetylation of Alba is detected. This is probably due to the intrinsic instability of acetyl-CoA at elevated temperatures and was never >20% of the level of acetylation detected in the presence of ssPat. Because S. solfataricus is a hyperthermophile, we examined the optimal temperature for the acetylation reaction. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, the reaction is optimal at temperatures between 70 and 90 °C, in agreement with the optimal growth temperatures of Sulfolobus, making it unlikely that acetylation is due to a contaminating protein from E. coli. We next prepared a derivative of ssPat (ssPat-mut) in which key conserved residues involved in binding acetyl-CoA have been mutated to alanine (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 2A). Mutations of analogous residues in the yeast histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 significantly reduced but did not abrogate its enzymatic activity (22Wang L. Liu L.D. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, ssPat-mut was found to have substantially reduced activity compared with wild type (Fig. 3, B–D). Thus, it appears that ssPat is capable of acetylating Alba. We measured the stoichiometry of acetylation of Alba by ssPat and found that 88% (±5%) Alba molecules possessed an acetyl group. The non-enzymatic thermal-mediated acetylation of Alba was 18% (±3%). Specificity of ssPat for Alba Lysine 16—Alba isolated from S. solfataricus cells is acetylated on lysine 16 (11Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next wished to test whether ssPat displayed selectivity in the residue(s) of Alba it acetylated. Thus, we prepared two mutant derivatives of Alba (Alba K16E and Alba K17E) and tested these in [14C,C1]acetyl-CoA acetylation assays (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, whereas wild-type Alba and Alba K17E were acetylated to similar levels by ssPat, acetylation of Alba K16E was greatly reduced, indicating the importance of this residue for acetylation of Alba by Pat. To determine whether Lys-16 is the site of acetylation by Pat, we performed an acetylation reaction with non-radiolabeled acetyl-CoA and isolated the resultant acetylated Alba by gel electrophoresis. Alba was in-gel-digested with chymotrypsin and analyzed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A doubly charged ion at m/z 554.3 corresponding to Alba 14IGKKPVMoNY22 (Mo is an oxidized methionine) incorporating a single acetyl group of 42 daltons was detected. This ion was selected and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with nitrogen, and fragment ion spectra were recorded. Peaks within the fragmentation series were identified with reference to the known peptide sequence of this chymotryptic fragment of Alba. As can be seen in the Fig. 4B, lower panel, the boxed b3 and y7 ions have a mass of 42 greater than the corresponding ions in the mock-treated sample. This indicates the presence of an acetyl group on lysine 16. Subsequent ions in the series (b4–8) and y8 all show a mass increased by 42 daltons in the acetylated sample. Thus, the tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the peptide and reveals that the residue in Alba acetylated by Pat was Lys-16 of Alba (Fig. 4B). ssPat-mediated Acetylation of Alba Lowers Its Nucleic Acid Binding Affinity—Acetylated Alba purified from S. solfataricus cells was initially observed to have a substantially (at least 10-fold) lower binding affinity for DNA than recombinant protein. More recent studies have suggested that the effect may not be as dramatic as first reported, with acetylated Alba having an ∼3-fold reduced affinity for DNA. 2C. Jelinska and M. F. White, personal communication. In agreement with this more conservative estimate, treatment of acetylated Alba with the Sir2 deacetylase only stimulated DNA binding by ∼3-fold, as measured by the effect of Alba on in vitro transcription assays (11Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we wished to test the effect on DNA binding activity of preincubation of recombinant, non-acetylated Alba with ssPat in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. Accordingly, Alba and ssPat were mixed in a 100-μl reaction, and two 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn. Acetyl-CoA was added to one of these aliquots to a final concentration of 100 μm. Both reactions, with and without acetyl-CoA, were incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, Alba from the two reactions was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As can be seen from the Fig. 5, left panel, Alba treated with acetyl-CoA and ssPat shows a 2-fold reduced affinity for DNA in the EMSA compared with Alba incubated with ssPat alone. Thus, ssPat-mediated acetylation of Alba reduces its DNA binding affinity. Recent work has suggested that, in addition to binding DNA, in vivo Alba can interact with RNA (Fig. 1) (20Guo R. Xue H. Huang L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We prepared a double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide and used this in EMSA with Alba as above. In agreement with the result observed with DNA, we see an ∼2-fold reduction in the affinity of acetylated Alba for the double-stranded RNA (Fig. 5, right panel). Archaea possess machineries for DNA replication and transcription that are closely related to the analogous machineries of eukaryotes and distinct from those of bacteria (23Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in gross morphology, cellular organization, and genome size and structure, archaeal cells resemble bacteria. In eukaryotes, the dynamic modulation of the packaging of DNA by covalent modification of histones in the nucleus plays an active role in DNA-based processes (2Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In bacteria, whereas nucleoid proteins play architectural roles in processes such as DNA replication and transcription (25Adhya S. Geanacopoulos M. Lewis D.E.A. Roy S. Aki T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-10Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), there is, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence of regulatory covalent modification of these proteins. Although histones are present in a significant subset of Archaea, they lack the N- and C-terminal tails that are the principal sites of modification in eukaryotic histones (26Reeve J.N. Bailey K.A. Li W.T. Marc F. Sandman K. Soares D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and are not covalently modified (5Forbes A.J. Patrie S.M. Taylor G.K. Kim Y.B. Jiang L.H. Kelleher N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2678-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Even in very early diverging eukaryotes such as trypanosomes, histones possess tails and are covalently modified (27Alsford S. Horn D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the origins of these complex regulatory pathways and the evolutionary source of the participating enzymes remain unclear. The Alba protein was initially identified as an abundant DNA-binding protein in Sulfolobus extracts (9Lurz R. Grote M. Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Dobrinski B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Forterre P. Confalonieri F. Knapp S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 669-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a finding verified by several groups (11Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and was proposed to be a major chromatin protein. Recently, this view was challenged by the observation of Guo et al. (20Guo R. Xue H. Huang L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that, following UV treatment of Sulfolobus cells, little or no Alba was DNA bound and rather appeared to be primarily associated with RNA (20Guo R. Xue H. Huang L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the dose of UV used in that study was high, resulting in fragmentation of nucleic acids. Additionally, it has been observed that the cellular response of Sulfolobus to UV damage involves the recruitment of reverse gyrase to chromatin (32Napoli A. Valenti A. Salerno V. Nadal M. Garnier F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33192-33198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This combination of DNA damage, cold shock during the 20-min irradiation, and possible topological alterations due to reverse gyrase recruitment may have reduced the levels of Alba bound to DNA. The findings of Guo et al. (20Guo R. Xue H. Huang L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) differ markedly from our observations that, in bulk chromatin fractionation, a large proportion of Alba is DNA-bound and more importantly that formaldehyde treatment of cells leads to the covalent attachment of Alba to all of the genomic loci tested (Fig. 1). Taken together, our data strongly support the proposal that Alba is a chromatin protein. Therefore, we have uncovered evidence for chromatin regulation by reversible acetylation in the archaeon, S. solfataricus, a crenarchaeote that lacks histones. Moreover, our data give a hint as to the derivation of eukaryotic-like chromatin regulation of non-histone proteins. Our previous work revealed that the chromatin protein, Alba, was acetylated in vivo on Lys-16 and deacetylated by Sir2 (11Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Our current work establishes that the Pat acetyltransferase specifically acetylates Alba on Lys-16. Remarkably, studies by Starai et al. (14Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and Starai and Escalante-Semerena (15Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have revealed that the Sir2/Pat partnership is functionally conserved in the bacterium S. enterica where these enzymes regulate the modification and activity of acetyl-CoA synthetase. The lysine residue in ACS that is modified lies in the sequence motif P(X4)GK. In Alba, Lys-16 is also preceded by a glycine in the motif 8PSNVVLIGK16. It is possible that Gly-Lys preceded by a proline is a conserved recognition site for the Pat/Sir2 acetylation/deacetylation system. The observation that Pat is conserved in Archaea that lack Alba (Supplemental Fig. 1) suggests a further role for Pat in processes other than Alba modification, and we anticipate that this is most likely ACS regulation. This leads us to speculate that S. solfataricus has co-opted a general regulatory switch present in many bacteria and archaea to generate a rudimentary form of chromatin regulation. Our data suggest that the apparatus for regulation of chromatin by reversible acetylation may pre-date the acquisition of histone N- and C-terminal tails by eukaryotes. In this light, it is of great interest to note that many non-histone proteins are known to be acetylated in eukaryotes, including a number of non-histone chromatin proteins (33Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar).

P450s play an important role in steroid hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism, xenobiotic detoxification, and steroid biosynthesis (2Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995Crossref Google Scholar). Some bacterial P450s participate in the biosynthesis of pharmacologically important molecules. For example, cytochrome P450eryF (P450eryF, CYP107A) hydroxylates 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-DEB) to erythronolide B at the C-6 atom as one step in erythromycin A production in Saccaropolyspora ertherea (3Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shafiee A. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6204-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Electrons provided from NAD(P)H via cytochrome P450 reductase or an iron-sulfur protein are required to reduce the iron-linked O2 molecule to the peroxide level, whereas protons are needed to protonate the distal O2 oxygen atom to promote heterolysis of the O–O bond. Much of what we know regarding the proton shuttle system in P450s derives from studies with P450cam (5Katagiri M. Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gerber N.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 8742-8743Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thr252 and Asp251 are critical residues in an H-bonded network that enables water protons to be delivered to the iron-linked O2 molecule (6Gerber N.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 8742-8743Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Imai M. Shimada H.

Stayton P.S. Poulos T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 20: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). P450eryF is unusual in that alanine (Ala245) replaces the threonine found in most other P450s. However, the substrate 5-OH group is located close to the oxygen binding site, suggesting that the substrate 5-OH replaces the missing threonine OH group (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Another unique feature of P450eryF is that a water molecule is located between the substrate and Ala245 and is in position to donate a proton to an iron-linked O2 molecule. This proton supply mechanism is consistent with mutagenic (11Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and computational studies (12Guallar V. Harris D.L. Batista V.S. Miller W.H. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2002; 91: 568-585PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an important lesson from P450cam is that the H-bonded network and water structure changes significantly in the O2 complex (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Therefore, developing detailed mechanistic schemes based on P450 structures in the Fe3+ state may be of limited value. In addition to the possibility of similar structural changes in P450eryF, the “catalytic” water in P450eryF is only 3.6 Å from the ferric iron so this water must reposition in the O2 complex. To further probe the potentially unique features of the P450eryF proton relay system, we solved the structure of the WT O2·P450eryF at 1.7 Å. We also solved the structure of oxy-complexes of two mutants, A245T and A245S, that have significantly reduced activity (11Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the O2·P450eryF complexes, together with the O2-P450cam structure, provide important insights on the differences and similarities in P450 O2 activation mechanisms. Crystallization—WT and mutants P450eryF were expressed and purified as reported earlier (16Cupp-Vickery J.R. Li H. Poulos T.L. Proteins. 1994; 20: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The natural substrate 6-DEB was from KOSAN Bioscience (Hayward, CA). Crystallization of P450eryF followed published procedures (16Cupp-Vickery J.R. Li H. Poulos T.L. Proteins. 1994; 20: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 1 μl of mother liquor consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.3 m sodium acetate, and 30–35% polyethylene glycol 4000 was overlaid over 1 μl of a WT protein drop without 6-DEB in the sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization tray (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Fine needle clusters that formed in a few days were crushed into microcrystals and used for microseeding. Microseeding was carried out 24 h after setting up crystallization sitting drops consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.28 m sodium acetate, 22% polyethylene glycol 4000, and the protein solution containing 0.3 mm 6-DEB. Single crystals formed within a few days. The ferric (Fe3+) substrate-bound WT crystals belong to space group P2121 21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 53.9 Å, b = 78.64 Å, and c = 97.21Å (Table I).

Oxidized crystals were transferred into cryobuffer (mother liquor with 20% glycerol) and then reduced with 10 mm sodium dithionite in a glove box (COY, Grass Lake, MI) with the dioxygen concentration kept <15 ppm. A clear color change from dark brown to bright red was apparent within 2 min. The crystals were kept in the dithionite solution for another 20 min. After reduction, crystals were washed thoroughly in deoxygenated cryobuffer for 10 min in the glove box. Reduced crystals then were soaked in the oxygen-saturated cryobuffer under atmospheric condition at –10 °C. The crystal was quickly scooped up in a nylon loop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen in preparation for data collection. Data Collection and Processing—All of the data were collected at the Stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory (SSRL) beamline 9-2 using a Quantum-315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). The wavelength used was 0.92 Å, and the beam was attenuated to 50% by using an aluminum filter to reduce photo-induced reduction of the dioxygen complex. Crystals were maintained at 100 K in a cryostream. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Model Building and Refinement—For the WT O2·P450eryF complex, rigid body refinement using CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) and the ferric WT P450eryF structure was used as an initial model (Protein Data Bank code 1JIO). After a single cycle of energy minimization and B-factor refinement, both 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc electron density maps showed the presence of dioxygen coordinated to the iron atom. The dioxygen molecule then was added to the model, and the refinement continued. Bond angles and distances for the dioxygen-iron interactions were weakly restrained. The Fe–O bond was restrained to 1.9 Å using a force constant of 4.0 kcal/mol/Å2, whereas the Fe–O–O bond angle was retrained to 130° with a force constant of 35 kcal/mol/rad2. Water molecules were added by using the water-pick program of CNS with the threshold of 5.0 σ. After another cycle of refinement, several water molecules were added manually around the substrate. The graphic program O (19Jones A.T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) was used for the model building. The same procedure was used for the mutant-oxy structures. Cavity volume calculations were done using VOIDOO (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Active Site Structure of WT O2·P450eryF—The simulated-annealing omit maps for the O2-WT complex clearly show dioxygen coordinated to the heme iron (Fig. 1). The Fe–O bond and Fe–O–O angle were refined to 1.81 Å and 128°, respectively. These values are very close to those determined from the P450cam-oxy crystal structure, 1.81 Å and 131° (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). These Fe–O bond distances also agree well with the 1.80-Å distance determined from the early extended x-ray absorption fine structure work on oxy-P450cam (21Dawson J.H. Kau L-S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Sono M. Eble K.S. Bruce G.S. Hager L.P. Hodgson K.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 8114-8116Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The distal oxygen atom is sandwiched between and is nearly equidistance from the Ala241 and Ala245 C atoms. The Ala241β carbonyl O atom is 3.3 Å from the distal O atom. The C-6 atom of the substrate, which is the hydroxylation site, is 3.2 Å from the proximal oxygen atom. The substrate C-5 OH forms a 2.7-Å H-bond with the distal oxygen atom. These steric and H-bond interactions force the dioxygen ligand to point toward the I-helix cleft between Ala241 and Ala245. Fig. 2 shows a superposition of O2·P450eryF and oxidized P450eryF. Although the substrate slightly rotates about C-13, O2 binding does not change the substrate-heme distances significantly, probably because of restrictions imposed by the H-bond between 5-OH and O2. This is different than in P450cam where diatomic ligand binding, CO and O2, displaces the substrate by ∼1 Å further from the heme (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A.

From the crystallographic analysis of the ferric enzyme, water molecule 519, which hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl of Ala241 and the substrate 5-OH group, was proposed to be the direct proton donor to the dioxygen ligand (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This view was supported by the A245S and A245T mutant structures that show a much higher mobility of water 519 and exhibit 16 and <1% wild-type activities, respectively (11Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the distal oxygen atom of O2 is only 0.7 Å from water 519 in the ferric enzyme. Thus, it might be anticipated that water 519 moves into a position for direct H-bond donation to the distal oxygen atom, similar to what is observed in P450cam (Fig. 3) (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for the presence of water 519. Although there is a small cavity near the O2 molecule, this cavity is much smaller than in P450cam (77 versus 206 Å3) and is too small to accommodate a water molecule. Therefore, the water molecule previously assumed to be the proton donor has been expelled from the active site, leaving no water directly H-bonded to the distal oxygen as in P450cam. In P450cam, there is a substantial change in the conformation of the I-helix and the H-bonded water network that provides a continuous H-bonded link among the distal dioxygen O atom, water molecules, and key active site groups such as Thr252 (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, there is little change in the I-helix or local H-bonded network in P450eryF. The H-bond network found in ferric P450eryF involving Glu360, Ser246, Ala241 carbonyl, and waters 53 and 63 (Fig. 1) remains intact in the O2-complex with the exception that Wat519 has been expelled. We next probed the functional relevance of this hydrogen bond network by solving the structures of mutant-O2 complexes that have reduced enzyme activity. Active Site Structures of A245S and A245T Mutant O2·P450eryF—The A245S and A245T mutants have substantially decreased enzyme activities, 16 and <1%, respectively (11Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The O2-complex structures were solved to see whether the mutations resulted in perturbations in the local H-bonded network that could be related to the loss in activity. Even though Ala245 has been replaced by residues of quite a different size and polarity at a critical location in the active site, the overall ligand geometry remains unchanged (Figs. 4 and 5). The similar conformation suggests that the other groups interacting with the ligand, the substrate, and Ala241 are the key determinants for the dioxygen ligand conformation. As in the WT structure, the mutants maintain the same substrate 5-OH-O2 H-bond and the Cβ atom of Ala241 forms one wall of the O2 cavity, both of which force the ligand to point toward the I-helix.Fig. 5Active site structure of O2·A245T mutant.A, the active site structure of O2-WT (green sticks) is over-laid on the O2·A245T (orange sticks). B, the Fo – Fc simulated-annealing omit map contoured at 4.0 σ. The dioxygen ligand and water 53 are omitted from map calculation. The color code is the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the activity is decreased by 84% by the A245S mutation, the active site structure including water is essentially unchanged with the exception that the OH group of Ser245 points toward the I-helix cleft to make new H-bonds with water 63 and the carbonyl group of the Ala241 (Fig. 4). A possible source of the decrease in activity in the A245S mutant is a disruption in the strict H-bond donor/acceptor relationship in the proton transfer system because of the new H-bonds formed with the mutant Ser245 side chain. In the O2·A245T complex (Fig. 5), the larger threonine side chain results in larger and more functionally relevant structural changes. The 5-OH group of the substrate makes van der Waals contact with the Cγ atom of Thr245, pushing Thr245 toward the I-helix cleft (Fig. 5C). As a result, the γ-OH of Thr245 occupies a similar position as water 63 in the ferric state and thus displaces water 63 from the active site. The Oγ atom of Thr245 is too far (4 Å) from the Oγ atom of Ser246 to make an H-bond. Therefore, the H-bond network is indeed disrupted at this site in this mutant (Fig. 5A). Thr245 also contacts the distal O2 O atom (Fig. 5C). These interactions and especially the disruption of the water H-bonded network by the displacement of water 63 probably disrupts efficient proton transfer to dioxygen, which explains the extremely low activity of the A245T mutant. Also of interest is a comparison between the A245T mutant and P450cam (Fig. 6). In P450cam-oxy complex, Thr252 moves closer to the O2 ligand and donates an H-bond to the distal O2 O atom. This movement of Thr252 away from the I-helix and the associated change in the I-helix conformation allow additional waters to move into the I-helix groove and thus complete the H-bonded network to the dioxygen. However, Thr245 in P450eryF cannot adopt the Thr252-like conformation because of steric interactions with the 5-OH group of the substrate. Thus, Thr245 does not form an H-bond with the ligand to assist with dioxygen activation and instead inhibits the dioxygen activation process. To accommodate the larger substrate and to make the substrate 5-OH group available for the dioxygen activation, it appears that P450eryF evolved to replace the threonine with alanine. Ortiz de Montellano and co-workers (24Xiang H. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35999-36006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have reported that A245T has higher activity than WT in testosterone hydroxylation. A possible cause of higher activity is that testosterone does not clash with Thr245, placing the threonine side chain in a similar position as P450cam, and recovers water 63. These plausible structural changes would enable proton supply through the WT-like hydrogen bond network and Thr245-assisted O2 activation. Dioxygen Activation by P450eryF—The only direct H-bond donor to dioxygen in P450eryF is the substrate 5-OH. The 5-OH group is critical, because conversion of the 5-OH group to a carbonyl eliminates enzyme activity (11Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has generally been assumed that the 5-OH group replaces the I-helix threonine found in most other P450s, and as the O2-P450cam structure shows (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), Thr252 is in position to donate an H-bond to the distal oxygen atom, similar to the substrate 5-OH in P450eryF. However, the similar roles of Thr252 and the P450eryf substrate 5-OH group came into question when Kimata et al. (25Kimata Y. Shimada H. Hirose T. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported that the substitution of the Oγ proton with methyl group (Thr to O-Me Thr) retains significant hydroxylation activity, suggesting that the Oγ proton is not directly involved in catalysis. Although both P450cam and P450eryF have similar solvent H-bonded networks involving the I-helix, P450cam but not P450eryF has a water directly H-bonded to the distal oxygen. Although water 519 appeared to be an ideal candidate for the direct proton donor to dioxygen based on the Fe3+ structure, once dioxygen binds the cavity, housing water 519 is simply too small to accommodate a water molecule and hence water 519 is expelled from the active site. Although both P450cam and P450eryF deliver protons from bulk solvent to dioxygen via an ordered network of H-bonds, the precise nature of the proton delivery network is substantially different, primarily because P450eryF uses the substrate itself as a proton donor and, unlike P450cam, water appears not to be a direct proton donor to dioxygen. A possible proton delivery scheme is outlined in Fig. 7. The crystal structure shows that water 63 is too far to H-bond to dioxygen but it might be possible to transfer a proton via the carbonyl group of the Ala241, which is 3.3 and 2.6 Å from the distal oxygen atom and water 53, respectively. However, it is important to note that the species that accepts protons is not the oxy-complex, Fe(III)—O–O–, but rather the peroxy complex that forms after the second electron transfer step, Fe(III)—O–O2–. A water situated between water 63 and dioxygen would form a direct water-dioxygen H-bond as in P450cam. The one caveat in this view is that the space between dioxygen and water 63 is too small (∼77 Å3), compared with ∼206 Å3 in P450cam, to accommodate water. Hence, if water does bind here, there must be some rearrangement in the active site once the peroxy intermediate forms. In the absence of any information supporting such a change in structure, we propose the mechanism shown in Fig. 7. In this scheme, one proton is delivered from water 63 via the Ala245 carbonyl. The most probable other proton source is the substrate 5-OH, because the 5-OH is the only direct H-bond partner for O2 and the 5-OH proton is essential for the catalytic activity. The proton abstraction from 5-OH by O2 transiently forms a substrate alkoxide, which is stabilized by the H-bond with the leaving water molecule. The energetic feasibility of forming an alkoxide is supported by density functional calculations that show that the iron-linked peroxy dianion has a higher proton affinity than the substrate alkoxide (14Harris D.L. J. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 91: 568-585PubMed Google Scholar). After O–O bond fission, a leaving water molecule completes an H-bonded network that provides a proton to the substrate alkoxide via Glu360. The Fe(V)–O intermediate or its electronic equivalent next hydroxylates the C-6 atom to complete the catalytic event. One final problem is the ultimate source of protons, which for both P450cam and P450eryF is assumed to be bulk solvent. In both structures, there is no continuous H-bonded connection between the active site and bulk solvent. However, when the concerted motion of side chains and water is taken into account, the proton delivery pathway in P450cam does connect to the molecular surface (26Taraphder S. Hummer G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 3931-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, dynamics may well play a critical role in enabling bulk solvent protons to be delivered to the internal H-bonded network. The ferric P450eryF structure suggested that a well ordered active site water molecule H-bonded to a substrate OH group serves as a direct proton donor to the iron-linked dioxygen (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although ferric P450cam has no homologous water molecule, the O2-P450cam structure does have a water molecule H-bonded to the Thr252 OH group capable of donating protons to dioxygen (15Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Therefore, the previous picture of O2 activation mechanisms for these two P450s shares common features: a catalytic water molecule H-bonded to a substrate or side chain OH group capable of donating protons to dioxygen. In forming the O2·P450eryF complex, however, the water molecule that makes an H-bond to the substrate is expelled from the active site, leaving no water capable of serving as a direct proton donor to dioxygen. Instead the substrate 5-OH is the only direct H-bond donor to the iron-linked dioxygen and most probably serves as a direct proton donor. In addition, the hydrogen bond network, water 63-Glu360-Ser246-water 53-Ala241 carbonyl in the I-helix cleft, is proposed as the proton transfer pathway. Thus, it appears that the details of the proton shuttle machinery differ substantially in these two P450s. These results illustrate the limited picture on the structural underpinnings of catalysis that can be derived from resting state structures while emphasizing the importance of structural studies on critical intermediates."

This causes the star to evolve back into a cool giant, whereupon it experiences renewed mass ejection before reheating. A reignition event of this kind was observed in 1996 in V4334 Sgr (Sakurai's object). Its temperature decrease was 100 times the predicted rate. To understand its unexpectedly fast evolution, we have developed a model in which convective mixing is strongly suppressed under the influence of flash burning. The model predicts equally rapid reheating of the star. Radio emission from freshly ionized matter now shows that this reheating has begun. Such events may be an important source of carbon and carbonaceous dust in the Galaxy."

Expression of the MRP3 gene is increased during pathological states associated with elevated bile acid concentrations indicating a role for this transporter in adaptive and homeostatic bile acid metabolism. Analysis of Mrp3 mRNA levels in various mouse tissues with known relevance and/or exposure to bile acids revealed the highest levels of basal expression in the colon followed in order by the liver, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and kidney. Functional analysis of a murine Mrp3 promoter reporter construct revealed vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), and the cholestatic secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). Using a series of deletion constructs combined with sequence analysis, a candidate VDR response element (VDRE) was identified between -1028 and -1014 bp of the Mrp3 promoter. Activation of the Mrp3 promoter in response to VD3, RA, or LCA, as well as binding of VDR/RXR heterodimers, was attenuated substantially by mutation of this VDRE. Treatment of mice with VD3 or LCA demonstrated in vivo modulation of the Mrp3 gene in colon but not in the liver. Reduction of endogenous VDR expression in colon adenocarcinoma MCA-38 cells by siRNA transfection was associated with reduced constitutive and inducible expression of the Mrp3 gene. These data support a regulatory role for the VDR in the protection of colon cells from bile acid toxicity through regulation of the Mrp3 expression."

The importance of these sequence motifs is revealed by the cloning, expression, and mutagenesis of three hydralysin isoforms that strongly differ in their hemolytic and paralytic activities.

Cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydrae) are an evolutionarily ancient group of sessile, soft-bodied animals that rely heavily on offensive and defensive allomones for capture of prey and protection from predators. As such, they have developed a highly complex and versatile array of protein and polypeptide toxins (neurotoxins, cytolysins, and phospholipases) aimed to paralyze the prey and prepare it for digestion (1Sher D. Knebel A. Bsor T. Nesher N. Tal T. Morgenstern D. Cohen E. Fishman Y. Zlotkin E. Toxicon. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).

Such toxins can cause toxic systemic effects, such as paralysis and pain, and are probably involved in the life threatening stings of the Portuguese Man-O-War (Physalia physalis) and of box jellyfish (4Nagai H.

Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hln is unique in that, unlike other cnidarian toxins, it is not found in the stinging cells (nematocytes) involved in prey capture. Hln was shown to exhibit a cell type-selective cytolytic activity, but no proteolytic or phospholipase activity. The possibility that Hln acts as a pore former was suggested by the existence of a low level of sequence similarity with aerolysin and several other bacterial PFTs (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).With this background, in the present study we have shown that hydralysins comprise a novel family of highly diverse cnidarian PFTs and have functionally characterized this family. Although Hlns differ from the previously characterized groups of cnidarian cytolytic toxins, they reveal structural and functional similarities with known bacterial and fungal toxins. Using sequence alignment and site-directed mutagenesis of Hln isoforms, we characterized a specific pore-forming sequence motif shared by a diverse group of proteins from animals, plants, and bacteria.MATERIALS AND METHODSTest Animals—Green hydrae (C. viridissima) were bred in glass trays in “M” medium as described (12Lenhoff H.M. Lenhoff H.M. Hydra: Research Methods. Plenum Press, New York1983: 29-34Google Scholar) at 20 °C and fed newly hatched larvae of Artemia salina. For toxicity assays we employed laboratory-bred blowfly larvae (Sarcophaga faculata) (13Eitan M. Fowler E. Herrmann R. Duval A. Pelhate M. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5941-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed at the Qtof Laboratory Interdepartmental Equipment Unit, The Hebrew University Medical School. Hln samples were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels as described below and the Coomassie-stained bands excised. Reduction, alkylation, and trypsinization steps were carried out in the gel (14Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). After extraction of the peptides from the gel with 60% CH3CN 1% CHOOH and evaporation to dryness, the samples with the peptide mixtures were redissolved in 1% CHOOH and solid phase-extracted with a C18 resin-filled tip. Nanospray setup (15Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar) was employed as a mode of injection of the samples (in 50% CH3CN 1% CHOOH) into the QtofII MS system (Micromass, England) for both mass and MS/MS measurements. Data analysis, including amino acid sequence assignments, was performed using the Biolynx package (Micromass).Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Hln Isoforms—Hln-2 and Hln-3 were cloned directly into the expression vector pHIS-parallel-2 (a kind gift from Dr. P. Sheffield, University of Virginia) using the primers 5′-ACT TCT CAC ATA TGG GTA AAG AGC TTC TA A CCT TTA GTG-3′ and 5′-CAA GAA AGG AAT TCT TAC AAA GGC TCA CTT GG T CCG A-3′, which include the restriction sites for the enzymes NdeI and EcoRI, respectively (underlined). The plasmids were sequenced at the Genome Center, Hebrew University. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW 1.82 at EBI (16Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar), and the phylogenetic tree was drawn using Multalin version 5.4.1 at prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html (17Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4263) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction from protein sequences of Hlns was performed using all the algorithms available in the ExPASy web server (except AGADIR, which is dedicated to peptides) (www.expasy.org/tools). To search for proteins homologous to Hln, we used PSI-BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nuc. Acid Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar), although other algorithms (BLAST, FASTA, Mpsearch, and scanPS) also detected several of the homologous proteins. The search was performed during February, 2005. The sequences were downloaded from the NCBI data base and aligned using MUSCLE (19Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29349) Google Scholar), edited using CINEMA (20Parry-Smith D.J. Payne A.W. Michie A.D. Attwood T.K. Gene. 1998; 221: GC57-GC63Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to better match the PSI-BLAST output, and finally colored using CLUSTAL X (21Thompson J. Gibson T. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35195) Google Scholar) with the default color settings.

Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the SMART cDNA kit (Clontech). PCR was performed using the isoform-specific upper primers 5′-CAG AGG TGA CTC GTC AAT CGA (Hln-1), 5′-TCG AGG TGA CTC GCC GAT TAC (Hln-2), and 5′-CCG ATT ACT TTG ACG TTT GG-3′ (Hln-3) and the lower primer 5′-TTA CAA AGG CTC ACT TGG TCC GA-3′. The PCR program used was 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 32 rounds of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C (Hln-1 and Hln-2) or 65 °C (Hln-3) for 45 s and 72 °C for 1 min and ending with a 7-min extension at 72 °C, in a Crocodile II Thermal cycler (Appligene). The enzymes used were Biotools Taq (Biotools) for Hln-1 and Hln-2 and Bio-x-act Taq with the high specificity buffer (Bioline) for Hln-3. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.Mutagenesis—The double mutant rHln-2(Q28E,V140L) (in this report rHln-1 stands for the recombinantly expressed protein, whereas Hln-1 stands for the native one) was created by inserting the central portion (amino acids 42–147) of a clone similar to Hln-2, obtained during the initial characterization of Hln-1, into the pDEST14 expression vector containing Hln-1 (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using the restriction sites for BstEII and BamHI. The single and triple mutants rHln-2(G125E) and rHln-2(Q28E,V140L,G125E) were created from rHln-2 and the double mutant, respectively, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR was performed using the primer 5′-GTC AAG TGA GTT TGA AGT TGA AGG AGC TTT CAA AAT GGG-3′ and its antisense, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer with the addition of a primer extension stage according to Ref. 23Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar. The introduction of the planned mutations was verified by sequencing the expression plasmids.Expression of Recombinant Toxins—Hln isoforms and mutants were expressed in BL-21(DE3)-SI bacteria (Invitrogen) and purified at the Protein Purification Facility, Wolfson Center for Applied Structural Biology, Hebrew University, by anion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. The first separation was carried out on a Q-Sepharose FF 15 × 1.5-cm column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and eluted by a gradient of molarity of NaCl (0.5 m) in the same buffer in an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The active fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) and charged on a Sephacryl S-100 960 2.6-cm or a Superdex 75 prep 96 1.6-cm gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted in PBS. The single and triple mutants rHln-2(G125E) and rHln-2(Q28E,V140L,G125E) and native Hln (from hydrae sonicated in a Vibra-Cell sonicator (Sonics) for 2 s) were purified in essentially the same manner using Hi-Trap Q 5-ml or Hi-Trap Q HP 1-ml anion exchange columns followed by a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) on an high pressure liquid chromatography system (LKB or Jasco). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie.Far UV-CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 195–250 nm in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. Data were collected every 0.2 nm at 50 nm min–1. At least four scans were performed for each spectrum, and the baseline was subtracted. The CD spectra are presented as mean residue ellipticity weight, i.e. [θ] (degree × cm2 × dmol–1). The contents of secondary structure were estimated by data fitting using the SELCON3, CDSSTR, and CONTINLL programs in the CDPro software package (24Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar).Activity Assays—Toxicity was tested by injection to blowfly larvae as described previously (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Eitan M. Fowler E. Herrmann R. Duval A. Pelhate M. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5941-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the paralytic dose (PD50) determined from sampling and calculation according to Reed and Muench (25Reed L.J. Muench S. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493Google Scholar). Paralysis was defined as any locomotory disturbance that prevents the animal from moving and changing its location freely 1 min after injection. Hemolysis was assayed essentially according to Ref. 26Primor N. Zlotkin E. Toxicon. 1975; 13: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, using human type A+ erythrocytes. One hemolytic unit was defined as the amount of toxin causing 50% hemolysis in a standard assay. Cytolytic activity was assayed using the Cyto-Tox One membrane integrity assay kit (Promega). HEK293, JAR, and HeLa cells (generously provided by Prof. Joseph Orly, Hebrew University) were maintained as described previously (27Ben-Zimra M. Koler M. Orly J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1864-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were used 1 day after seeding to 24-well plates at ∼90% confluence. Hln in 300 μl of a 1:1 mixture of the cell-growth medium and PBS was added to the cells, which were incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min, 300 μl of assay buffer were added and the samples processed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer fitted with a 96-well plate reader (excitation 560 nm slit 10, emission 590 nm slit 5). Cytotoxicity assays using Trypan blue staining were performed as described previously (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Binding of Hln to Erythrocyte Membranes—To monitor Hln binding to membranes, human type A+ erythrocytes were washed in PBS as described, lysed with 5 mm phosphate buffer for 5 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in order to recover membranes. The lysis with 5 mm phosphate buffer was repeated until membrane pellet was colorless. Following incubation of membranes (from 20 μl of erythrocyte suspension) with the rHln isoforms (200 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C, the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, washed once with PBS, and subjected to Western blotting using anti-Hln antibodies (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was performed using a Cy-2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson) and visualized using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad 1024 scanhead connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 m microscope at the Confocal Microscopy Unit, Life Science Institute, Hebrew University).Osmotic Protection Assays—The functional size of the Hln pores was determined by performing hemolysis assays as described above in the presence of 30 mm of polyethylene glycols (PEGs; Fluka) of various molecular weights in PBS (28Kuga S. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 206: 449-461Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol.

Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An intriguing result obtained was that the recombinant and natively isolated Hlns migrate differently on SDS-PAGE gels, raising the possibility that the native toxin undergoes proteolytic cleavage as part of its maturation, similar to other known cytolytic toxins (30Tomita T. Mizumachi Y. Chong K. Ogawa K. Konishi N. Sugawara-Tomita N. Dohmae N. Hashimoto Y. Takio K. J. Biol.

To see whether, indeed, a fragment of the native protein is proteolytically removed, we subjected both recombinant and native Hln to tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Careful study of the mass spectra (Fig. 1A) and manual analysis of all data collected allowed for coverage of over 75% of the proteins, revealing that rather than being the result of proteolytic cleavage the native Hln in fact represents a second isoform, differing from the recombinantly expressed protein in eleven amino acid residues. We named this isoform Hln-2, the previously described one being Hln-1.Fig. 1Hydralysin belongs to a diverse family of proteins.A, mass spectra of recombinant Hln-1 (upper panel) and the native hydralysin (Hln-2) (lower panel). Note the prominent peptide (m/z = 760) found only in the recombinant protein, and the peptide m/z = 1040 found only in the native protein (marked by *); these correspond to amino acids 75–89, which contain most of the differences between the proteins.

D, hydrae express Hln-1, 2, and 3. Reverse transcription PCR was performed using primers that differentiate between Hln-1, 2, and 3, revealing that hydrae express all three isoforms.

Each lane contains concentrated fractions from several rounds of chromatography. rHln-1 and 2, purified recombinant isoforms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To verify the occurrence of more than one Hln isoform, we sequenced 14 different plasmids containing the cloned cDNA of Hln, several of them partial clones obtained during the initial cloning of the toxin (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and others that were cloned directly into an expression vector. Thirteen distinct sequences were obtained, which can be clustered into three main groups as shown in Fig. 1B. A comparison of the sequences of Hln-1, Hln-2, and Hln-3, as representatives of these groups, is presented in Fig. 1C, and the full alignment can be found in supplemental Fig. 1. The Hln-1 and Hln-2 groups differ mainly in a region found between amino acid residues 72–95, with eight amino acid substitutions, whereas Hln-3, in addition to several amino acid substitutions, differs from the two other groups in that amino acids 98–123 are missing.The diversity of different Hln cDNA sequences found raised the suspicion that these may have been caused by mutations inserted during the cloning process, rather than representing true isoforms. Several controls were performed to eliminate this possibility. First, PCR was performed using the same polymerase enzyme and PCR program on a specific plasmid and the PCR products subcloned and sequenced. In five such cases, no differences were observed between the PCR product and the original template, eliminating the possibility that the differences between the cDNA isoforms were due to mutations introduced by the DNA polymerase. Second, reverse transcription PCR was performed on hydra cDNA using PCR primers that differentiate between Hln-1, 2, and 3. As can be seen in Fig. 1D, all three isoforms are expressed by the hydrae. Finally, we were able to separate the native Hln into two fractions, with apparent molecular masses (as measured by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis) of 27 and 31 kDa, using anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1E). MS-MS analysis of the two native fractions revealed that the 27-kDa band is composed mainly of a protein identical in sequence to Hln-2, with a minor contaminant containing the amino acid substitution I80V corresponding to one of the sequences obtained from the cDNA clones (clone f6 in supplemental Fig. 1. The 31-kDa band contained an Hln isoform not represented in the cloned cDNA sequences but also belonging to the Hln-2 family (data not shown). Taken together, these data (MS-MS, sequencing of clones, reverse transcription PCR, and protein chromatography) show that Hlns are, in fact, a highly diverse family of toxins expressed by the green hydra.Two other species of hydra, Hydra vulgaris and Hydra magnipappilata, also express proteins belonging to the Hln family. We cloned three such cDNAs from H. vulgaris cDNA using the same primers as those used for the green hydra. The cDNA sequences of the Hln orthologues from H. vulgaris (Hv-Hln) were very similar, with two possible amino acid substitutions (Asn or Ser at position 105 and Thr or Ala at position 211). Another sequence was obtained from H. magnipappilata as part of the hydra Expressed Sequence Tag project (ace_4352.y, created by joining the partial sequences found in the GenBank™ as gi 47545809, gi 47547418, gi 47541336, and gi 47541099) (1Sher D. Knebel A. Bsor T. Nesher N. Tal T. Morgenstern D. Cohen E. Fishman Y. Zlotkin E. Toxicon. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Hln orthologues are therefore found not only in the green hydra but also in other hydra species.Hln Isoforms Differ in Their Biological Activities—Many venom systems are known to be composed of polypeptides that exhibit some degree of sequence microheterogeneity that provide the organism with a set of functionally diverse, although structurally similar, proteins (33Anderluh G. Krizaj I. Strukelj B. Gubensek F. Macek P. Pungercar J. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is especially well exemplified by the Cry family of PFTs from Bacillus thuringienesis, in which a wide array of similar proteins is combinatorially expressed by the bacteria in order to kill a specific type of host insect (34de Maagd R.A. Bravo A. Crickmore N. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The diversity of the cloned Hln sequences, the fact that almost all of the differences between the isoforms are found in the N terminus half of the protein, and the similarity of Hlns to bacterial PFTs, including several Cry toxins (see below), suggested that this sequence heterogeneity may provide diversity in the biological functions of the proteins. To test this, we recombinantly expressed Hln-1, 2, and 3 as representatives of the three subfamilies of Hln found in the green hydra and compared their activities. Hln-2 was recombinantly expressed and purified essentially in the same manner as recombinant Hln-1 (rHln-1) (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The first purification step, anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF, revealed significant differences between the isoforms in the NaCl concentration in which the proteins eluted, indicating variations in pI values (Table I). Conversely, gel filtration chromatography revealed that both isoforms are monomeric with apparent molecular masses of ∼27 kDa. The final purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), revealing also that the recombinant protein migrates as a 27-kDa protein, similar to the natively isolated Hln (11Zhang M. Fishman Y. Sher D. Zlotkin E.

For example, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genome (1Cole S.T. Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F.

Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar) GH5, GH6, GH12, and GH16. Indeed, many of the unfinished mycobacterial genomes (M. tuberculosis 210, Mycobacterium marinum M, Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155, and Mycobacterium avium 104) all possess similar ORFs, the functions of which are unknown. M. tuberculosis H37Rv ORF Rv0062 encodes a protein, hereafter called Cel6, that contains an N-terminal sequence of 88 residues featuring an extended basic region and features consistent with a signal peptide, and a catalytic domain comprising residues 89–380, assigned to glycoside hydrolase family GH6. Other characterized GH6 members display two activities, termed cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases, the former liberating the disaccharide cellobiose from crystalline cellulose, while the latter make random internal cuts on single β-1,4 glucan chains. Structurally, these two classes mainly differ in the size of the two extended loops forming the active site (3Rouvinen J. Bergfors T. Teeri T. Knowles J.K.C. Jones T.A.

Here we show that it is a functional cellulase that liberates a repertoire of cello-oligosaccharides from acid-swollen cellulose and barley β-glucan with an endo action. The x-ray crystal structure of this protein, solved in ligand-complexed forms (Fig. 1), reveals that Rv0062 encodes a functional, indeed typical, GH6 endoglucanase with a catalytic “–1” subsite (6Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) that promotes identical distortion of the substrate glucoside to that observed previously for homologs from plant cell wall-degrading bacteria and fungi (7Varrot A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Pell G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The observation that Cel6 displays the structure and biochemical properties of a “classical” GH6 endo-acting cellulase poses intriguing questions for its role in mammalian pathogenic mycobacteria. Bacterial Strains, DNA Manipulation, and Cloning—The Escherichia coli strains used in this study were XL2blue and Origami (DE3) (Novagen), and the plasmids employed were pET22b and pET16b (Novagen) (8Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). E. coli was cultured in Luria broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. The region of cel6 encoding residues 89–380 of Cel6 was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using Vent polymerase (BioLabs) and the primers: 5′-CATATGGCAAACCCGCTGGCCGGAAAGCCCT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTACTACTGGCCGGCGTTGTGGGCCA-3′ (NdeI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined). The amplified DNA was inserted into NdeI-BamHI-restricted pET22b and pET16 to generate pET22-cel6 (encodes native Cel6; Cel6-native) and pET16b-cel6 (encodes Cel6 with an N-terminal His-tag; His-Cel6), respectively. To express cel6, E. coli Origami (DE3) was transformed with the plasmids pET22-cel6 or pET16b-cel6. Protein Production and Purification—Cells were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 15 μg ml–1 kanamycin and tetracycline and 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin at 37 °C to an A595 of ∼0.6 before induction of Cel6 expression by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for a further 7 h. Cell-free extracts were prepared and His-Cel6 was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using a Ni2+-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) and a 5–500 mm imidazole gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, to elute the recombinant protein. Fractions containing Cel6 (as judged by SDS-PAGE) were concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator before further purification by gel filtration using a S75 16/26 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, using an fast protein liquid chromatography system. The eluted protein was concentrated using a 30,000 cut-off Filtron, at 4 °C, and washed into water (MilliQ) to a final concentration of 10 mg ml–1. Cel6-native was purified by anion exchange chromatography using a DEAE column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Cel6, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.4 m. After removal of insoluble material the protein solution was subjected to hydrophobic chromatography using a Phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and a 1.5 to 0 M ammonium sulfate gradient, in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, to elute the protein. Cel6-native was further purified by gel filtration as described for His-Cel6. Cel6 Assays—Purified Cel6 was assayed for activity against polysaccharides using the reducing sugar assay of Miller (9Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22353) Google Scholar). Enzyme reactions were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate/12 mm citrate (PC) buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mg ml–1 soluble polysaccharide or 4 mg ml–1 insoluble polysaccharide and 1 mg ml–1 bovine serum albumin. The reactions, which were incubated at 37 °C, were initiated by the addition of Cel6 to a final concentration of 500 nm. At regular intervals up to 20 min, 500-μl aliquots were removed and assayed for reducing sugar (9Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22353) Google Scholar), and the product profile was determined by high pressure anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) (10Hall J. Black G.W. Ferreira L.M. Millward-Sadler S.J. Ali B.R. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To evaluate the reaction products generated from cello-oligosaccharides, 3 μm Cel6 was incubated with 300 μm of the cognate oligosaccharide in PC buffer, and at regular intervals aliquots were removed, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPAEC. Crystallization and Structure Solution—All crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion with 1-μl drops containing a 50:50 (v/v) mix of the protein and the reservoir solution. The protein was incubated with 1 mm ligand for at least 30 min prior to crystallization. The complex of Cel6A-native with thiocellopentaose (SDP5) was crystallized using 12–14% (w/v) PEG 4000 and 200 mm lithium sulfate, as precipitant, in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5. Crystals with cellobio-derived isofagomine (ISOF) were obtained using 12–14% (w/v) PEG 4000 and 200 mm lithium sulfate, as precipitant, in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. Cryoprotection involved supplementing the growth conditions with 20% (v/v) glycerol or 30% PEG 400, respectively. Data for His-Cel6-SDP5 were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ID14–2 and beamline Cel6-ISOF in the home laboratory using a CuKα rotating-anode source operating at 50 kV and 100 mA, with Osmic mirrors and a MAR-research detector. Data were processed with MOSFLM from the CCP4 suite (11Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) or the HKL suite of programs (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). All further computing was performed using the CCP4 suite, unless otherwise stated. The structure of the His-Cel6-SDP5 was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates from the endoglucanase from Thermobifida fusca (Protein Data Bank code 1TML) as a search model. The program AMoRE (13Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) was used in conjunction with data in the resolution range 20–4 Å. This structure was subsequently used to solve the other Cel6 complexes. 5% of the observations was set aside for cross-validation analysis (14Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) and was used to monitor various refinement strategies with REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Manual corrections of the model were performed using the X-FIT routines of the program QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Water molecules were added in an automated manner using ARP (16Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and verified manually. The crystal structures of Cel6 with cellobiose (Protein Data Bank code 1UP0) and cellobiose-S-cellobiose (Protein Data Bank code 1UP3) were also solved at resolutions of 1.75 and 1.6 Å and deposited but are not discussed further. The Three-dimensional Structure of Cel6—Cel6 was crystallized in various ligand-bound forms, with non-hydrolyzable thiooligosaccharides and with a disaccharide inhibitor, cellobio-derived isofagomine (Fig. 1) and data collected between 1.9 and 1.1 Å resolution (Table I). The catalytic domain presents a distorted (α/β)8 barrel typical for family GH6 enzymes (3Rouvinen J. Bergfors T. Teeri T. Knowles J.K.C. Jones T.A. Science. 1990; 249: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 4Spezio M. Wilson D.B. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9906-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Varrot A. Schülein M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8884-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a) composed of eight β-strands, with seven involved in the β-barrel formation and eight α-helices. As predicted from sequence, the structure possesses the shortened C-terminal loop typical of endoglucanases, consistent with its biochemical properties (see below). In marked contrast to previous GH6 endoglucanase structures, however, the active-center loops of Cel6 enclose the ligand-binding cleft (Fig. 2a) rather then remaining “open.” Complexes with thio-oligosaccharides reveal binding in the aglycone (leaving group) subsites, termed +1 and +2, with sugars in the 4C1 (chair) conformation (data not shown). A “kink” at +2 may allow for the formation of a third “+3” subsite (and there is ample protein surface at the non-reducing end of the –2 site to accommodate binding of longer substrates). A strong indication that this mycobacterial enzyme is a functional β-glucanase is that the complex structures confirm that all the direct interactions of the “glycone” –2 and –1 subsites and aglycone +1 sites are invariant. The +2 subsite shows more divergence but still maintains its hydrophobic sugar-binding platform, Trp250.Table IRefinement and structure quality statistics for the M. tuberculosis Cel6 complex structuresSDP5ISOFResolution (Å)40-1.1 (1.16-1.10)20-1.9 (1.97-1.90)Rmerge0.075 (0.123)0.071 (0.206)Mean I/σI17.0 (7.9)14.6 (4.9)Completeness (%)99.7 (99.1)99.7 (95.1)Multiplicity5.1 (4.4)2.9 (2.8)Rcryst/Rfree11/1313/18Root mean square bond lengths (Å)0.0150.014Root mean square bond angles (°)1.761.53 Open table in a new tab Substrate Binding and Distortion at the Catalytic Center— Further evidence for the catalytic integrity of Cel6 comes from its complex with the cellobio-derived isofagomine. This is a disaccharide inhibitor in which a glucosyl moiety is β-1,4 linked to the inhibitor isofagomine (possessing a nitrogen group in place of the anomeric carbon (Fig. 1)). It is presumed to be a tight-binding inhibitor by virtue of the transition state-mimicking positive charge on the ring nitrogen of the compound as its conjugate acid (7Varrot A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Pell G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the Cel6 structure, two molecules of the inhibitor occupy the substrate-binding site from subsite –2 to –1 and +1 to +2 (Fig. 2b). In subsites –2, +1, and +2 the glucoside and isofagomine rings lie in relaxed 4C1 (chair) conformation, while in the “catalytic” –1 subsite the aza-sugar moiety is distorted to a conformation intermediate between OS2 (skew-boat) and 2,5B (boat) conformation, as observed previously for the cellobiohydrolase Cel6A from Humicola insolens (7Varrot A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Pell G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 2,5B is implicated as the transition state conformation during catalysis, as it maintains C5, O5, C1, and C2 co-planar, an essential prerequisite of an oxocarbonium-ion-like species. Notably, the active center of Cel6 possesses the constellation of aspartates required for transition state stabilization, distortion, and catalysis (3Rouvinen J. Bergfors T. Teeri T. Knowles J.K.C. Jones T.A. Science. 1990; 249: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 7Varrot A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Pell G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar): Asp168, Asp353, and the catalytic acid, Asp206, and all the usual substrate-binding residues that flank the active center (Fig. 3). The sole difference in the catalytic subsite of Cel6, compared with the previously published GH6 enzymes, is that a Ser residue implicated in stabilizing a solvent water in an unusual “Grotthus” inverting mechanism is replaced by Ala173. The putative attacking water, however, still resides “below” the anomeric carbon (Figs. 2b and 3). Catalytic Activity of Cel6 —Demonstration of the catalytic function of the recombinant enzyme is shown by its catalytic activity on both barley β-glucan and acid swollen cellulose. The enzyme hydrolyzes both substrates to release an array of different gluco-oligosaccharides, a product profile typical of endo-acting β-glucanases (Fig. 4). Reducing sugar analysis of the reaction products showed that Cel6 displayed turnover rates (moles of product per mole of enzyme per second) of 25 s–1 and 0.9 s–1 on β-glucan and acid-swollen cellulose, respectively. These are of the same order as observed for endo-acting GH6 cellulases from known saprophytic plant cell wall-degrading microorganisms that are typically in the range 1–10 s–1 on acid-swollen cellulose, for example. The enzyme displays no activity against a range of other polysaccharides including amylose, xylan, mannan, galactan, arabinan, pectin, laminarin, and a range of aryl glycosides including 4-nitrophenyl β-d-cellobioside. Cel6 is, however, also able to hydrolyze cellooligosaccharides; cellopentaose is converted into cellobiose and cellotriose; cellohexaose into cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose in a molar ratio of 1:4:1 (data not shown), while the enzyme displays no measurable activity against cellotetraose or cellotriose. Thus, at least five subsites in Cel6, as also predicted from the crystal structures of the enzyme-ligand complexes, make a highly significant contribution to catalysis. What are the implications for M. tuberculosis, a non-plant cell wall-degrading organism, possessing functional cellulases? That they are most likely important is underlined by the fact that all finished mycobacterial genomes, excluding Mycobacterium leprae (discussed below) together with M. tuberculosis 210; M. marinus, M. avium 104, and M. smegmatis str. MC2 155 possess a GH6 cellulase, at least one GH3 β-glucosidase candidate (the enzyme that is required for the subsequent degradation of cellulase-derived products), and potential β-glucanases from GH5 and GH16. M. smegmatis str. MC2 155 also possesses a candidate β-glucosidase from family GH1. It is interesting to note that the GH5 and GH16 enzymes form distinct “subfamilies” when compared with the other respective characterized family members and one cannot speculate on their function beyond saying that they will be retaining β-glycosidases with potential for transglycosylation. Despite possessing the enzymes responsible for cellulose degradation, it is, however, extremely unlikely that M. tuberculosis, or related mycobacterial strains, can utilize the plant cell wall as a significant nutrient as they lack the full repertoire of hydrolytic enzymes required to attack this composite structure. For example, no xyloglucanase, α-glucuronidase, or xylanase candidates are found in any of the mycobacterial genomes. That Cel6 possesses a signal peptide certainly points to an extracellular role. Equally important is the sole obligate parasite among mycobacteria, M. leprae, possesses none of the potential cellulase candidates on its genome. It is possible that these enzymes date from a prehistoric time when primitive mycobacteria were soil-based organisms, as M. bovis is still. Indeed Cel6 displays significant sequence identity (∼40%) with numerous Streptomyces GH6s indicating a strong evolutionary relationship among these enzymes (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the view that Streptomyces and Mycobacterium are related Actinomycetes. It is estimated that these bacteria diverged from a common ancestral organism around 80 million years ago. It is possible, therefore, that Cel6 is derived from the ancestral organism. The striking similarity between specific islands within the genomes of Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar) and M. tuberculosis, however, suggests that gene transfer has occurred between the organisms when the bacteria occupied soil niches, and these events could also have resulted in the acquisition of the cellulase gene by the Mycobacterium. Irrespective of the mechanism of Cel6 acquisition by M. tuberculosis, it remains difficult to provide definitive insight into its role in the human pathogen. It is possible that the gene is an evolutionary relic and there has not been sufficient evolutionary time for its removal. Yet, it is surely significant that while M. tuberculosis only contains β-glucanases and a cellulose-binding module, Streptomyces coelicolor A3 contains the complete and extensive repertoire of hydrolytic enzyme genes that encode proteins that attack all the major plant structural polysaccharides. Thus, the retention of a small number of cellulase genes within the genome of the Mycobacterium suggests that these genes do confer a selective advantage on the organism. Is it possible that there is a previously undescribed secondary host such as a rumen protozoon. Such a species would possess a rudimentary plant cell wall-degrading system, in which cellulose, or its degradation products, could be presented to the Mycobacterium. An alternative evolutionary rationale for the β-glucanase activity displayed by M. tuberculosis is that the bacterium encounters biofilms and that some of these exo-polysaccharides on which these tight microbial ecosystems form are β-glucans. While the chemical composition of most extracellular polysaccharides that are integral to biofilm formation is unknown, some, such as that made by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have recently been shown to consists of β-glycans (17Mah T.F. Pitts B. Pellock B. Walker G.C. Stewart P.S. O'Toole G.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent report has identified the regulon in the important human pathogen P. aeruginosa (18Goodman A.L. Kulasekara B. Rietsch A. Boyd D. Smith R.S. Lory S. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) that enables the bacterium to make this switch between a virulent, disease-causing state and a biofilm state in the mammalian host. Of interest in this context is the occurrence of a gene encoding a membrane-associated family 2 carbohydrate-binding module, CBM2, (CBM2s are known to bind to β-glucans such as cellulose and chitin, reviewed in Ref. 19Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar), yet another incongruous open reading frame in all completed, and four unfinished, mycobacterial genomes. We thank Hugues Driguez (CNRS, Grenoble, France) for the kind provision of thio-oligosaccharide ligands and the staff of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) for provision of data collection facilities."

Here, assessment of HuR levels in various vascular pathologies (intimal hyperplasia, atherosclerosis and neointimal proliferation, sclerosis of arterialized saphenous venous graft, and fibromuscular dysplasia) revealed a distinct increase in HuR expression and cytoplasmic abundance within the intima and neointima layers. On the basis of these observations, we postulated a role for HuR in promoting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. To test this hypothesis directly, we investigated the expression, subcellular localization, and proliferative influence of HuR in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs). Treatment of hVSMCs with platelet-derived growth factor increased HuR levels in the cytoplasm, thereby influencing the expression of metabolic, proliferative, and structural genes. Importantly, knockdown of HuR expression by using RNA interference caused a reduction of hVSMC proliferation, both basally and following platelet-derived growth factor treatment. We propose that HuR contributes to regulating hVSMC growth and homeostasis in pathologies associated with vascular smooth muscle proliferation.

In adult individuals, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; hVSMC, human vascular smooth muscle cell; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; SmBM, smooth muscle cell basal medium; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase. exert remarkable plasticity and can undergo profound phenotypic changes in response to environmental cues (1Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In pathological conditions, vascular injury can trigger phenotypic alterations such as proliferation, migration, and synthesis of extracellular matrix that contribute to the onset and progression of vascular diseases. The accumulation of VSMCs is central to many vascular pathologies including vein bypass failure, in-stent restenosis, transplant vasculopathy, and atherosclerosis (2Dzau V.J. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Sedding D.G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Underlying the proliferative phenotype of VSMCs in both physiological and pathological settings are critical changes in the gene expression patterns of the proliferating cells (3Boehm M. Nabel E.G. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 23: 555-565Google Scholar). Stimulation of VSMCs with growth-promoting factors such as angiotensin II or oxidized low density lipoprotein caused the increased expression of genes coding for ion transporters, extracellular matrix components, cell-cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, transcription factors, and cell cycle regulatory proteins (4Sukhanov S. Song Y.H. Delafontaine P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 306: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 5Campos A.H. Zhao Y. Pollman M.J. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar changes in gene expression patterns were observed when comparing healthy VSMCs and VSMCs isolated from various disease conditions, such as primary atherosclerosis and in-stent stenosis (6Zhang Q.J. Goddard M. Shanaha C. Shapiro L. Bennett M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 2030-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Alterations in gene expression programs are strongly influenced by transcriptional events, but the essential contribution of posttranscriptional events (such as mRNA processing, transport, turnover, and translation) is becoming increasingly recognized. In particular, regulated mRNA stability critically contributes to the implementation of gene expression patterns during the cellular response to mitogens, immunological triggers, stressful stimuli, and differentiation agents (7Fan J.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Indeed, a growing number of proteins central to the execution of such responses (p21, Hsp70, MnSOD, catalase, Cdc25, cyclin A, cyclin B1, c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myc, Egr-1, etc.) are encoded by labile mRNAs, which have tightly regulated half-lives. The best understood determinants of transcript stability are U-rich or A+U-rich elements (collectively termed AREs) generally present in the 3′-untranslated regions of labile mRNAs (9Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Several RNA-binding proteins have been reported to bind to AREs and cause transcript decay, including BRF1, AUF1, and KSRP (10Gherzi R. Lee K.Y. Briata P. Wegmuller D. Moroni C. Karin M. Chen C-Y.

Among the RNA-binding proteins that bind to AREs and instead promote transcript stabilization is HuR, a member of the Hu/ELAV protein family. HuR stabilizes many mRNAs, including those that encode growth factors, cell division proteins, and cytokines. The role of HuR during the response to immune factors and proliferative signals has been described in several cell systems (13Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M.

In two recent studies, HuR was found to regulate cell proliferation in a mouse model of skeletal muscle development and regeneration, purportedly through its influence on the expression of proteins governing cell growth and differentiation (18Figueroa A.

Here, we employed primary vascular smooth muscle cells from human aorta (hVSMCs) to investigate the involvement of HuR in the response of VSMCs to proliferative agents in culture. Our results highlight a critical role for HuR in cell proliferation following PDGF treatment and point to HuR as a likely contributing factor in vascular pathologies. Immunohistochemistry—Specimens of fibromuscular dysplasia, arterialized saphenous vein graft, atherosclerosis, neointimal hyperplasia, and control coronary and renal arteries were obtained from the pathology archives of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Anonymous hematoxylin and eosin slides were evaluated for vascular pathologies. Appropriate formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were cut to make slides for anti-HuR immunohistochemistry. Slides were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval, incubation with primary antibody, and detection with the LSAB2 system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). A monoclonal anti-HuR antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was used at 0.25 μg/ml. An institutional review board exemption was granted for this anonymous collection of human tissues. Immunofluorescence—hVSMCs seeded on coverslips were either stimulated with PDGF (10 ng/ml) for the times indicated or left untreated, then fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100. Following incubation in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20) for 16 h, coverslips were incubated for 1 h in either a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prepared in blocking buffer, washed with blocking buffer, incubated for 1 h with either a rhodamine Red-X-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) or a horse anti-mouse Texas Red IgG (1:200; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), and washed again with blocking buffer. Cell images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM-410 inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 63×/1.4 N.A. oil immersion lens. Images were processed by MetaMorph image analysis software version 4.6r6 (Universal Imaging Corp., Inc.). Cell Culture, Treatment, and Transfection—Human aortic smooth muscle cells were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, MD) and Cell Applications (San Diego, CA) and were cultured at 37 °C in smooth muscle cell basal medium (SmBM, Cambrex Bio Science) containing 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with insulin (100 ng/ml), human fibroblast growth factor (200 ng/ml), human epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (50 ng/ml) (complete SmBM). For growth inhibition, DMEM was supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% antibiotics, and 0.2% fetal bovine serum. For all experiments, hVSMCs were used from passages between 4 and 8. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI-38, Coriell Cell Repositories) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 1% minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics. Both cell types were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. PDGF-BB was from Calbiochem. For transfection, 106 hVSMCs were trypsinized and resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany), and the siRNA duplexes (10 μm, Qiagen) electroporated as advised by the manufacturer were as follows: HuR siRNA, AAGAGGCAATTACCAGTTTCA; control siRNA (targeting genes expressed in fungus (Ustilago maydis) and bacteria (Thermotoga maritima)), TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT. Immediately after transfection, VSMCs were seeded in 6-well plates for further experiments. Cell Proliferation—To monitor cell growth, 104 hVSMCs were plated into 24-well cluster plates and cultured in complete SmBM overnight. hVSMCs were then rendered quiescent by overnight culture in DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and then cultured for an additional 3 days in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml PDGF (PDGF was replenished 48 h after the beginning of treatment), whereupon cells in each treatment group were counted using a hemacytometer. To assess [3H]thymidine incorporation, 25,000 hVSMCs were plated/well and incubated for 24 h in complete SmBM. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and were either left without further treatment or treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for an additional 24 h. Following the addition of 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 16 h at 37 °C, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and maintained at 4 °C for 30 min in 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Following washes, the cell material was resuspended in 0.5 n NaOH and 0.5% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation (25Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H.

Microarray—RNA was isolated using the STAT-60 reagent and was reverse-transcribed in the presence of [α-33P]dCTP. The radiolabeled product was used to hybridize cDNA arrays (MGC arrays, 9,600 genes, www.grc.nia.nih.gov), employing previously reported methodologies (26Kawai T. Fan J. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6773-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All of the data were analyzed by using the Array Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA), normalized by Z score transformation, and used to calculate differences in signal intensities. The complete cDNA array dataset is available from the authors. Real-time PCR—RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the resulting material was used for PCR amplification using gene-specific primer pairs (supplemental material) and SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For real-time PCR, amplification conditions were 50 °C (2 min), 95 °C (10 min), and then 40 cycles at 95 °C (15 s) and 60 °C (1 min). Western Blotting—For Western blot analysis, whole-cell lysates were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing either HuR or β-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Following secondary antibody incubations, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Synthesis of Biotinylated Transcripts and Analysis of HuR Bound to Biotinylated RNA—For in vitro synthesis of biotinylated transcripts, genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR reactions. Whole-cell and cytoplasmic lysates were prepared according to previously described protocols (27López de Silanes I. Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). All 5′ oligonucleotides contained the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence; primers were used for the amplification of sequences 2063–2447 of SLC7A7 (NM_003982), 2Accession numbers in parentheses are from GenBank™. 2070–2669 of OSBPL2 (NM_144498), 682–1033 of SAT (NM_002970), 1706–2335 of CDK2 (NM_001798), 7072–7537 of CCNA2 (X68303), 518–1128 of CALM2 (NM_001743), 1095–1720 of RPA2 (NM_002946), 850–1017 of PSMA6 (NM_002791), 982–1181 of TAF9 (NM_003187) and 182–515 of PTMA coding region (negative control, NM_002823) (see supplemental material). PCR-amplified products were used as templates for the synthesis of corresponding biotinylated RNAs using T7 RNA polymerase and biotin-CTP. Biotin pull-down assays were carried out by incubating either whole-cell hVSMC lysates (25 μg) or WI-38 cytoplasmic fractions (12.5 μg) with purified biotinylated transcripts (1 μg/incubation) for 1 h at 25 °C. Complexes were isolated with paramagnetic streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway), and bound proteins in the pull-down material were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies recognizing either HuR or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After secondary antibody incubations, signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto Substrate, Pierce Biotechnology). HuR Expression Is Increased in Proliferative Vascular Pathologies—Given our previous findings that HuR promoted the proliferation of normal fibroblasts and cancer cells (13Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 14López de Silanes I. Fan J. Yang X. Potapova O. Zonderman A.B. Pizer E.S. Gorospe M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate whether HuR contributed to the proliferative phenotype underlying certain VSMC pathologies. Immunohistochemical staining of normal coronary samples showed low HuR expression in medial and intimal VSMCs, localizing primarily in the nuclei, with negligible cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1A). By contrast, samples from patients with intimal hyperplasia, neointimal proliferation in atherosclerotic plaque, and sclerosis of arterialized saphenous vein graft all showed an overall increase in HuR signal with both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1A). HuR signal was moderately increased in both subcellular compartments of intimal hyperplasia specimens, was stronger at the sites of neointimal proliferation in the atherosclerotic plaque, and was most prominent in the arterialized saphenous vein graft, wherein cytoplasmic HuR staining was particularly abundant (Fig. 1A). In normal renal VSMCs, HuR staining was low and predominantly nuclear. However, the hyperplastic intimal VSMCs present in a fibro-muscular dysplasia specimen showed elevated HuR staining in both subcellular compartments (Fig. 1A). As anticipated, more intense staining in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm was seen in two positive control samples: Grawitz (renal cell) carcinoma (a neoplastic focus) and the epithelium of the ureter (in which epithelial cells undergo relatively high turnover rates) (Fig. 1B). PDGF Treatment of Cultured hVSMCs Triggered a Marked Increase in Cytoplasmic HuR—The subcellular distribution of HuR in cultured hVSMCs was studied by confocal microscopy. In quiescent hVSMCs, HuR was predominantly nuclear at all times examined; the addition of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (hereafter PDGF), an inducer of VSMC proliferation and migration, caused a slight increase in nuclear HuR abundance by 1 h of treatment. By contrast, cytoplasmic HuR levels increased markedly following PDGF treatment, reaching peak levels by 6 h of treatment (Fig. 2). It is generally believed that increases in cytoplasmic HuR are largely due to the export of nuclear HuR (16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 28Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), but there was no concomitant nuclear signal reduction when the cytoplasmic HuR increased. This discrepancy is likely explained by the fact that HuR comprised 95% of the total cellular HuR, so the export of a small proportion of nuclear HuR was not readily detectable in the nucleus but caused a pronounced increase in cytoplasmic HuR as reported previously (13Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 29Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In control incubations, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (Fig. 2, hnRNP C1/C2) was found unchanged following PDGF treatment. The intensity of HuR fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm was quantified and represented numerically (Fig. 2, graphs). HuR Levels Influence Gene Expression Profiles in PDGF-stimulated hVSMCs—To assess the influence of HuR on gene expression patterns in hVSMCs, HuR levels were reduced by RNA interference. Western blot analysis revealed the effective reduction of HuR (only 10% remaining) in the HuR siRNA transfection group compared with the control transfection group (Fig. 3, Ctrl. siRNA). In each population, cells either were left untreated or were treated with PDGF for 8 h, where-upon RNA was extracted and used to hybridize cDNA microarrays (7Fan J. Yang X. Wang W. Wood W.H.

Biol. 2004; 24: 6773-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the genes differentially regulated by PDGF in the two transfection groups revealed the influence of HuR on the expression of several groups of genes, including those regulating cell proliferation, metabolism, organization of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, mitochondrial function, transcription, translation, and signal transduction (Table I). As anticipated, for some genes (e.g. FLNA, VAPB, TIMM17A), PDGF induced mRNA abundance (Z ratios ≥ 1.00, the significance value chosen for this analysis) in control populations, but this induction was significantly reduced in HuR knockdown populations (Z ratios ∼1.00 or lower than 1.00). The entire array dataset is available from the authors. These observations suggested that, following PDGF stimulation, HuR prevented the degradation of mRNA subsets in the cells, thereby enhancing their accumulation.Table IInfluence of HuR levels on gene expression profiles of hVSMC upon PDGF stimulation for 8 hGenes and classificationSymbolZ ratioGenBank™ accession no.Control siRNAHuR siRNAProliferation (15)v-myb-like 2MYBL21.250.92NM_002466Cyclin-dependent kinase 2CDK21.000.77NM_001798v-raf viral oncogene homolog 1ARAF11.441.27NM_001654Replication factor C (activator 1) 5RFC 51.100.57NM_007370Metabolism (22)Arginase, type IIARG21.270.54NM_001172Cationic amino acid transporter (y+) member 7SLC7A71.621.28NM_003982Spermidine/spermine acetyltransferaseSAT1.450.32NM_002970Oxysterol binding protein-like 2OSBPL21.050.48NM_144498Glutathione synthetaseGSS1.351.10NM_000178Procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancerPCOLCE1.080.23NM_002593Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase homolog 1DGAT 11.070.69NM_012079Ribophorin IIRPN21.261.00NM_002951Cytoskeleton and ECMaECM, extracellular matrix. organization (18)DecorinDCN1.030.17NM_001920Filamin A, α (actin binding protein 280)FLNA1.411.05NM_001456Tara-like proteinHRIHFB21221.451.10NM_007032VAMP-associated protein B and CVAPB1.340.88NM_004738Mitochondria (8)Translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 17ATIMM17A1.640.89NM_006335Solute carrier family 25, member 11SLC25A111.230.93NM_003562NADH dehydrogenase 1 β subcomplexNDUFB81.911.69NM_005004Ribosome and translation (22)Ribosomal protein S6RPS61.430.63NM_001010Ribosomal protein L13RPL131.270.53NM_033251Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 γ, 1EIF4G11.020.71NM_004953Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetaseQARS1.200.68NM_005051Ribosomal protein S14RPS141.371.11NM_005617Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-like 3EIF4EL31.461.27NM_004846Signal transduction (20)Calmodulin 2 (phosphorylase kinase, δ)CALM21.040.58NM_001743Homer homolog 2 (Drosophila)Homer-21.150.89NM_004839ADP-ribosylation factor 5ARF51.831.46NM_001662Guanine nucleotide binding protein β 2-like 1GNB2L11.211.00NM_006098Phospholipase C γ 2PLCG21.030.86NM_002661Transcription machinery and splicing (22)TAF9 TATA box binding protein-associated factorTAF91.070.56NM_003187Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 7SFRS71.000.58NM_006276Zinc finger protein 144 (Mel-18)ZNF1441.300.99NM_007144Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3STAT31.020.80NM_139276Achaete-scute complex-like 1 (Drosophila)ASCL 11.290.90NM_004316Miscellaneous (47)Nuclear RNA export factor 1NXF11.461.01NM_006362Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide GSNRPG1.140.87NM_003096Annexin A11ANXA 111.331.09NM_145869Proteasome subunit β type 4PSMB 41.320.77NM_002796a ECM, extracellular matrix. Open table in a new tab Initial verification of the array data was pursued by direct measurement of mRNA abundance using reverse transcription plus real-time PCR with gene-specific primers. Accordingly, the levels of mRNAs encoding SAT, CDK2, SLC7A7, and OSBLP2 were elevated in PDGF-treated hVSMCs but only under normal HuR levels (Fig. 3, Ctrl. siRNA); cells expressing reduced HuR (HuR siRNA) did not exhibit increased levels of these mRNAs and instead displayed a small reduction in the abundance of SAT and CDK2 mRNAs after PDGF treatment. The levels of positive control p21 mRNA (a PDGF-inducible gene that is also an HuR target (29Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 30Moon S.K. Jung S.Y. Choi Y.H. Lee Y.C. Kim C.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) increased only after PDGF treatment of the Ctrl. siRNA population but failed to do so in the HuR siRNA group (Fig. 4A); expression levels of the house-keeping gene GAPDH were not altered by the treatments (not shown). Subsequent experiments were aimed at directly assessing if the differentially regulated mRNAs were direct targets of HuR. To monitor the existence of such putative ribonucleoprotein interactions, the mRNAs of interest were synthesized as biotinylated transcripts in vitro (described under “Experimental Procedures”) and incubated with lysates prepared from hVSMCs to allow the formation of (HuR-biotinylated RNA) associations. The resulting complexes were pulled down using streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic beads (“Experimental Procedures”), and the presence of HuR was tested by Western blotting. As shown (Fig. 4B), the CDK2 3′-untranslated region RNA appeared to bind HuR very strongly, but CALM2, RPA2, SLC7A7, OSBLP2, PSMA6, and TAF9 were also found to associate with HuR; a transcript corresponding to the cyclin A 3′-untranslated region, previously reported to bind HuR (13Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control, whereas the coding region of prothymosin α, which does not bind HuR, was included as a negative control. We then sought to examine whether binding of HuR to these target transcripts was dependent on PDGF stimulation but were unable to use hVSMC because this cell system provides too few cells for analysis. Therefore, we employed an alternative system of primary mesenchymal cells, WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts. As seen with hVSMCs, PDGF treatment caused WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts to increase proliferation (31Phillips P.D. Kaji K. Cristofalo V.J. J. Gerontol. 1984; 39: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and elevated HuR presence in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C), whereas nuclear and overall HuR levels remained unchanged (not shown). Biotin pull-down using cytoplasmic lysates from WI-38 cells that were either left untreated (Fig. 4C, Unt.) or were treated with PDGF for 8 h showed that, upon PDGF stimulation, HuR association with all of the target transcripts was increased (Fig. 4D, PDGF lanes). HuR Silencing Led to Impaired Proliferation of hVSMCs in Response to PDGF—To examine the effect of HuR on hVSMC proliferation, cells expressing either normal or knockdown HuR levels were treated with PDGF, and the changes in cell number and DNA synthesis were studied. As shown, PDGF treatment triggered a marked increase in cell numbers in both transfection groups, but the increase was lower in the HuR knockdown population (Fig. 5A). Likewise, [3H]thymidine incorporation was higher after PDGF treatment, but in the HuR knockdown populations, the increase was attenuated (Fig. 5B). Together, these observations support the notion that HuR contributes to the proliferation of hVSMCs stimulated by PDGF. In this study, we present evidence that HuR contributes to the proliferation of hVSMCs in response to PDGF treatment. The starting point for"
https://openalex.org/W2076667246,"Recently a novel laminin γ3 chain was identified in mouse and human and shown to have the same modular structure as the laminin γ1 chain. We expressed two fragments of the γ3 chain in mammalian cells recombinantly. The first, domain VI/V, consisting of laminin N-terminal (domain VI) and four laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (domain V) and laminin N-terminal modules, was shown to be essential for self-assembly of laminins. The other was domain III3–5, which consists of three laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like modules and is predicted to bind to nidogens. The γ3 VI/V fragment was a poor inhibitor for laminin-1 polymerization as was the β2 VI/V fragment. The γ3 III3–5 fragment bound to nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 with lower affinity than the γ1 III3–5 fragment. These data suggested that laminins containing the γ3 chain may assemble networks independent of other laminins. Polyclonal antibodies raised against γ3 VI/V and γ3 III3–5 showed no cross-reaction with homologous fragments from the γ1 and γ2 chains of laminin and allowed the establishment of γ chain-specific radioimmunoassays and light and electron microscopic immunostaining of tissues. This demonstrated a 20–100-fold lower content of the γ3 chain compared with the γ1 chain in various tissue extracts of adult mice. The expression of γ3 chain was highly tissue-specific. In contrast to earlier assumptions, the antibodies against the γ3 chain showed light microscopic staining exclusively in basement membrane zones of adult and embryonic tissues, such as the brain, kidney, skin, muscle, and testis.

Ultrastructural immunogold staining localized the γ3 chain to basement membranes of these tissues. Basement membranes are specialized structures of the extracellular matrix with multiple functions (1Timpl R. Brown J.C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). As thin condensed matrices, they divide the cells of the parenchymal tissues from the interstitial matrix. Their main components are collagen type IV variants, laminins, nidogens, and perlecan (2Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Laminins constitute a family of heterotrimeric proteins (αβγ) which are mainly localized in basement membranes and are involved in cell matrix and various other protein interactions. Eleven different chains (α1–α5, β1–β3, γ1–γ3) have been identified and sequenced, and they assemble fifteen different isoforms, laminin-1–15 (3Sasaki T. Timpl R.

Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Most of these modules are also shared by several other extracellular proteins, such as the proteoglycans perlecan and agrin. A newly identified γ3 chain shares the same domain structure as the γ1 chain (8Koch M. Olsen P. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M-F. J.

The LN modules of laminin chains are essential for self-polymerization into large non-covalent networks, as shown for laminin-1 and laminin-2 (10Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cheng Y-S. Champliaud M.-F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This self-assembly is considered to be crucial for the integrity of basement membranes (12Yurchenco P.D. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 351-388Crossref Google Scholar). The γ3 chain is a component of four isoforms, laminin-12 (α2β1γ3), -13 (α3β2γ3), -14 (α4β2γ3), and -15 (α5β2γ3) (5Libby R.T. Champliaud M-F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6517-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Koch M. Olsen P. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). There are interesting theories that these laminins also participate in self-assembly and that they co-polymerize with other isoforms. Nidogen-1 is a ubiquitously expressed basement membrane protein consisting of three globular domains (G1–G3) connected by a link and a rod-like segment. It has been shown to bind several extracellular proteins through different domains and has been proposed to act as a connecting element for basement membrane assembly (1Timpl R. Brown J.C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 13Miosge N. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The G3 domain of nidogen-1 binds to a single laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) module of the γ1 chain with high affinity (14Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Pöschl E. Fox J.W. Block D. Mayer U. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and this binding is thought to be particularly important for basement membrane assembly. Nidogen-2 is another isoform and also binds several matrix proteins with affinities different from nidogen-1 (16Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Salmivirta K. Talts J.F. Olsson M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although the binding repertoire is largely overlapping. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates the crucial amino acids for the nidogen binding in the laminin γ1 LE module γ1 III4 (18Pöschl E. Mayer U. Stetefeld J. Baumgartner R. Holak T. Huber R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5154-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and subsequently these data are confirmed by the crystal structure of the complex between nidogen and laminin fragments (19Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J-H. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The γ3 chain contains a γ1-like nidogen binding motif with only a single conservative amino acid substitution (8Koch M. Olsen P. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Iivanainen A. Morita T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14107-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that γ3-containing laminins should be capable of associating with other basement membrane molecules through nidogens. The γ3 chain has been localized at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells of lung, oviduct, epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminiferous tubules, and it was reported that the γ3 chain is a non-basement membrane-associated laminin chain (8Koch M. Olsen P. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The laminin isoforms containing the γ3 chain are widely expressed in different compartments of the retina (5Libby R.T. Champliaud M-F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6517-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, we prepared recombinant fragments of the laminin γ3 chain and compared the binding properties with those of the γ1 and γ2 chains. These fragments allowed us to raise specific antibodies that are useful for quantitative analyses and examination of the distribution of the γ3 chain in tissues. We systematically localized the laminin γ1 and γ3 chains during mouse organogenesis from day 12 to day 18 and in adult organs at the light microscopic level as well as at the ultrastructural level and found it to be a true basement membrane component. In addition, we performed immunogold double labeling and showed a co-localization of the laminin γ3 chain and nidogen-1 in basement membranes in vivo. Mouse (20Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R.

Zimmermann K. Mann K. Reinhardt D. Timpl R. Nischt R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and mouse (17Salmivirta K. Talts J.F. Olsson M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and human nidogen-2 (16Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were obtained as recombinant products. Laminin-1 was purified from the mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (22Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The laminin-1 fragments E4 and P1 were purified as described previously (23Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The recombinant fragment γ1 III3–5 (14Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and γ2N, γ2 LE4–6, and β3 VI/V (24Sasaki T. Göhring W. Mann K. Brakebusch C. Yamada Y. Fässler R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have already been described. Other recombinant fragments of mouse laminin included β1 VI/V, β2 VI/V, and γ1 VI/V (Fig. 1), 2N. Gersdorff, E. Kohfeldt, T. Sasaki, R. Timpl, and N. Miosge, unpublished data. which were prepared by established procedures (25Garbe J.H.O. Göhring W. Mann K. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The templates used were mouse γ3 cDNA clone γ3_3pB provided by Prog. Dr. K. Tryggvasson for γ3 III3–5 and RNA from mouse testis for γ3 VI/V fragment. The sense and antisense primer for γ3 III3–5 were 5-′GTCAGCTAGCGCCCTGTCCGTGCCCTGG-3′ and 5-′GTCACTCGAGCTAGCTCTGGCAGCCCCTCCC-3′, respectively, and for γ3 VI/V, 5-′GTCAGCTAGCAGTGCAGAGCGGGG-3′ and 5-′GTCACTCGAGCTAGCTGCTGCAGCCCACTGG-3′, respectively. They were used for amplification by PCR. These primers introduced at the 5′ end a NheI site and at the 3′ end a stop codon followed by a XhoI site. A NheI/XhoI cDNA fragment for γ3 III3–5 as well as that for γ3 VI/V was inserted into the episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu containing the BM-40 signal peptide (26Kohfeldt E. Mauer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 217-221Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These vectors were used to transfect 293-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 cells, and serum-free medium was collected from these cells (26Kohfeldt E. Mauer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 217-221Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was passed over a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Most of fragment γ3 III3–5 did not bind to the column, whereas fragment γ3 VI/V was eluted at 0.1–0.2 m NaCl. They were further purified on a Superose 12 column (HR 16/50) equilibrated with 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Solid phase assays with laminin fragments immobilized on the plastic wells of microtitre plates and soluble nidogens followed published procedures (27Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Binding was detected by antibodies specific for each nidogen isoform. The radioligand inhibition assay with 125I-labeled laminin fragment P1 and recombinant nidogen-1 (14Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was also used. The laminin-1 polymerization inhibition assay as well as surface plasmon resonance assays (BIAcore 1000, Stevenage, Hertsfordshire, UK) were carried out as described previously (25Garbe J.H.O. Göhring W. Mann K. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunization of rabbits, affinity purification of antibodies, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay titration and inhibition radioimmunoassays were carried out using established protocols. Extraction of mouse tissue was performed with neutral buffer containing 10 mm EDTA followed by the same buffer containing detergents, and both buffers contained protease inhibitors (28Sasaki T. Wiedemann H. Matzner M. Chu M-L. Timpl R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Female New Mexico Research Institute (NMRI) mice were kept on a normal day/night cycle and received Altromin commercial food and water ad libitum. The day on which, at 11:00 a.m., a vaginal plug was detected after a mating period of 3 h, was designated as day 0 of gestation. On the respective days of gestation, beginning with day 12, pregnant mice were anesthetized with ether and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. After dissection of the uterine horns, the embryos (day 12) or fetuses (days 14, 16, and 18) were removed. Three embryos or fetuses of each developmental stage were investigated. For light microscopic analysis of adult tissues, the various organs from three different three-month-old NMRI mice were taken. Fixation and Preparation of Tissues—For light microscopy, all specimens were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. They were then dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol from 30 to 100% and embedded in paraffin (29Miosge N. Köther F. Heinemann S. Kohfeldt E. Herken R. Timpl R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Serial sections of 5 μm were cut with a Reichert's microtome. Every fifth section was stained with hematoxylin for topological orientation within the anatomical regions examined, and staging of the embryos or fetuses was achieved by comparison with the appropriate Theiler stages. For the ultrastructural approach, the tissue pieces were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol up to 70%, and embedded in the acrylic resin LR-Gold (London Resin Company, Reading, UK). Semithin (1-μm) and ultrathin (0.8-μm) sections were cut according to procedures previously described in detail (29Miosge N. Köther F. Heinemann S. Kohfeldt E. Herken R. Timpl R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Light Microscopic Immunohistochemistry—For the light microscopic immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and rinsed for 10 min in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 45 min in the dark. Each of the reaction steps was followed by rinsing for 10 min in PBS. The sections were pretreated for 5 min with 10 μg/ml protease XXIV (Sigma). The anti-laminin γ1 antibody, the anti-laminin γ3 III3–5 antibody, and the laminin γ3 VI/V antibody were used at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-nidogen-1 antibody was also used at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. The peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method followed the previously described procedures (29Miosge N. Köther F. Heinemann S. Kohfeldt E. Herken R. Timpl R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As negative controls, normal rabbit IgGs and the corresponding preimmune sera were used instead of the primary antibodies, at similar concentrations. No immunostaining was observed. Immunogold Histochemistry—For single labeling using immunogold histochemistry, the tissue sections were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the antibodies against laminin γ3 VI/V and laminin γ3 III3–5. The sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with the 16-nm gold-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:20 in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed with water and stained with uranyl acetate (10 min) and lead citrate (8 min). The sections were examined with a LEO 906E electron microscope. For double labeling, all sections were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then rinsed in PBS. Thereafter, anti-laminin γ3 antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS was applied for 1 h at 4 °C. After a rinse with PBS, the gold-coated (16-nm) goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:200 was applied for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were thoroughly rinsed with PBS. The gold-coated (8-nm) anti-nidogen-1 antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS was then incubated. Colloidal gold particles were prepared and coupled to the antibodies according to our standard protocols (13Miosge N. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All sections were finally rinsed with water and stained with uranyl acetate (10 min) and lead citrate (8 min). As the control for the double labeling experiments, we also applied a monoclonal anti-nidogen-1 antibody (JF4). This approach avoids possible cross-links between the two rabbit IgGs used in the double labeling described above and yielded identical results. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Previous recombinant studies with the LN module of the α1 (30Ettner N. Göhring W. Sasaki T. Mann K. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the β1 and γ1 chains 3T. Sasaki, unpublished data. have shown that this module does not represent an autonomous folding unit and requires the addition of several adjacent, rod-like LE modules from domain V to achieve efficient production in mammalian cells. Therefore, we prepared the LN module of the γ3 chain together with the complete domain V (four LE modules) (position 29–488), as already performed for the γ1 VI/V fragment. Domain γ3 III3–5 (three LE modules) corresponds to amino acid 766–927 of the laminin γ3 chain, a region homologous to the laminin γ1 chain exhibiting a high affinity binding site for nidogen-1. These fragments were produced in human 293-EBNA cells transfected with episomal expression vectors (26Kohfeldt E. Mauer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 217-221Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These cells secreted the recombinant fragments in sufficient amounts into serum-free culture media, which were used for purification by conventional chromatography. The purified fragments showed a single 55-kDa band for domain γ3 VI/V (Fig. 1, lane 1) and a 23-kDa band for domain γ3 III3–5 (Fig. 1, lane 5) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purity was also confirmed by a single N-terminal ADMGS(C)YDGV sequence for γ3 VI/V, in agreement with the presence of a typical signal peptide and an APLAP(C)P(C)PGQ sequence for γ3 III3–5, the first four residues being derived from the signal peptide cleavage region of the vector. Inhibition of Laminin-1 Polymerization—A major function of LN modules is the promotion of self-assembly of laminins into non-covalent quasihexagonal networks in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, as shown for laminin-1 (10Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently for α2 chain-containing laminins (11Cheng Y-S. Champliaud M.-F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In an earlier experiment, we developed a quantitative inhibition radioimmunoassay to study the interference of the different α chain fragments (25Garbe J.H.O. Göhring W. Mann K. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used this assay for the β and γ chain fragments. The assay was designed to allow the polymerization of 30–38% of laminin-1 (subsequently set to 100%), which was reduced to only a few percent in the presence of EDTA (Table I). The inhibitors were added in stoichiometric amounts (0.32 μm) or in five-fold molar excess (1.6 μm) prior to starting the polymerization. Lower activities for β3 VI/V and γ3 VI/V and distinctly low activity for β2 VI/V at both concentrations were observed (Table I). As a positive control, we used the laminin E4 fragment corresponding to β1 VI/V, which was used in previous inhibition studies (10Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and found activity approximately identical to that of recombinant β1 VI/V and γ1 VI/V. Surface plasmon resonance assays were used to examine the binding to immobilized laminin-1. This demonstrated a similar binding of γ1 VI/V (Kd = 0.245 μm) and β1 VI/V (Kd = 0.275 μm), and lower affinities were observed for β3 VI/V (Kd = 1.05 μm) and for γ3 VI/V (Kd = 1.75 μm). No binding was detected for β2 VI/V up to the highest concentration used (4 μm).Table IInhibition of laminin-1 polymerization by N-terminal (VI/V) fragments of laminin β and γ chainsInhibitors% Inhibition0.32 μm1.6 μmβ1 VI/V28 ± 370 ± 7Fragment E432 ± 1464 ± 19β2 VI/V0 ± 911 ± 20β3VI/V25 ± 439 ± 23γ1 VI/V40 ± 1076 ± 3γ3 VI/V10 ± 1530 ± 21EDTA85 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Binding to Nidogens—The mouse laminin γ1 chain fragment γ1 III3–5 was shown to bind to nidogen-1 with high affinity (14Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Most of the amino acids that interact with the nidogen G3 domain are conserved in human and mouse laminin γ3 chains (19Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J-H. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that the γ3 chain also binds to nidogens. We prepared the mouse laminin γ3 III3–5 fragment to compare the binding to nidogen isoforms with that of γ1 and γ2 chains. Solid phase assays were used to test the binding of nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 to immobilized γ1 III3–5 (Fig. 2A) and γ3 III3–5 (Fig. 2B). Both mouse nidogen isoforms bound better to γ1 III3–5, and the half-maximal binding for mouse nidogen-1, human nidogen-1, mouse nidogen-2, and human nidogen-2 were 0.2–0.3, 0.4–0.5, 1–2, and 3–4 nm, respectively. The concentrations of half-maximal binding to the γ3 III3–5 fragment were calculated, 0.8–1 nm for both types of nidogen-1 and 20–30 nm for both types of nidogen-2. No nidogen isoforms showed any binding to the γ2 LE4–6 fragment, the homologous region of laminin γ2 chain in the solid phase assay. The inhibitory activity of these γ chain fragments on the interaction between laminin fragment P1 and nidogen-1 was analyzed by radioligand inhibition assays (Fig. 3). The inhibitory activity of the γ1 III3–5 fragment was identical to the P1 fragment, and the concentration required for 50% inhibition (IC50) was found to be 0.08 nm. The IC50 of γ3 III3–5 was 20 nm and that of γ2 LE4–6 was >10 μm. Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed using III3–5 fragments as immobilized ligands. Nidogens showed high affinity binding to γ1 III3–5 but no binding was seen to γ3 III3–5 (data not shown).Fig. 3Radioligand inhibition assay of laminin-nidogen interaction by recombinant fragments from mouse laminin γ1, γ2, and γ3 chains. The test consisted of 125I-labeled laminin fragment P1 and recombinant nidogen-1. Inhibitors used were fragment P1 (○), the recombinant fragments γ1 III3–5 (▴), γ3 III3–5 (□), γ2 LE4–6 (▵), and reduced and alkylated γ3 III3–5 (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunological Assays—Rabbit antisera were prepared against recombinant γ3 VI/V and γ3 III3–5 fragments. These antisera had high titers against the antigen used for immunization and were only marginally cross-reactive with the fragments obtained from γ1 and γ2 chains by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown) and by inhibition radioimmunoassays (Fig. 4). Several tissues from laminin γ3 knock-out mice tested for both antibodies did not show any staining (data not shown). In inhibition radioimmunoassays, the half-maximal inhibitions were achieved at 0.1 nm for γ3 VI/V (Fig. 4A) and at 0.06 nm for γ3 III3–5 (Fig. 4B). A >1000-fold excess of homologous fragments obtained from other γ chains did not show inhibition. Some adult mouse tissues were extracted with EDTA and detergents and examined by this assay together with the γ1 VI/V assay. However, mouse tissues showed inhibitions in the γ3 VI/V assay but not in the γ3 III3–5 assay. Therefore, the amount of the γ3 chain was quantified by the γ3 VI/V assay. The much lower amounts of the γ3 chain (1–6% of the γ1 chain of laminin) were found in the tissue extracts examined (Table II).Table IIContents (pmol/g tissue) of laminin γ1 and γ3 chain determined by inhibition radioimmunoassays in extracts of adult mouse tissuesTissueAssay forγ1 VI/Vγ3 VI/VSkin422.6Lung1451.8Stomach1632.0Intestine1321.3Kidney692.1 Open table in a new tab Immunolocalization of Laminin γ1 and γ3 Chains during Embryonic Development and in Adult Tissues—From day 12 to day 18, and in adult mouse tissue, staining for the laminin γ1 chain was seen in almost all epithelial basement membrane zones in all consecutive stages of development, as already known for a long time (Table III). In the skin, for example, the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone exhibited staining, as did the basement membrane zones of hair follicles, but neither the fibroblasts nor the keratinocytes showed any staining (Fig. 5A). In all stages of kidney organogenesis, only basement membrane zones of the consecutive stages of glomeruli development (comma, S-shaped, early glomeruli) and those of the tubules were positive for the γ1 chain (Fig. 5B). In the small and large intestine, the epithelial cells were not stained, whereas the basement membrane zones underlying the developing epithelium were stained for the γ1 chain (Fig. 5C).Table IIILocalization of laminin γ1 and γ3 chains during mouse embryonic development and in adult tissuesOrgan anlage or developing organStages of development and type of γ chainE12E14E16E18Adu"

In their lifetime, patients carrying a mutated VHL gene are predisposed to multiple tumors in a number of organs, including the retina, cerebellum, spinal cord, adrenal gland, and kidney. Despite this phenotypic heterogeneity, VHL patients can be segregated based on their likelihood of developing pheochromocytoma. Type 1 VHL patients are at low risk for developing pheochromocytoma, but do develop clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Type 2 patients develop pheochromocytoma and are further subdivided. Type 2A patients have low risk for clear-cell RCC, and type 2B patients have high risk for clear-cell RCC. Type 1, 2A, and 2B patients develop the two cardinal features of VHL disease: retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastoma. However, type 2C patients exclusively develop pheochromocytoma (2Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Hum. Mol.

Polyubiquitin-tagged HIF-α is subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The VHL protein (pVHL) functions as the target recognition moiety of the VEC complex and specifically recognizes prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-α subunits (8Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J.

This post-translational modification of HIF-α requires oxoglutarate, iron, and oxygen (8Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Thus, ubiquitin-mediated destruction of HIF-α occurs selectively under normoxic conditions. Accordingly, biallelic inactivation of the VHL gene through mutation, deletion, or promoter silencing generally leads to the stabilization of HIF-α and thereby promotes the up-regulation of numerous HIF target genes, resulting in an inappropriate triggering of the hypoxic response under normal oxygen tension (4Maynard M.A. Ohh M. Am. J. Nephrol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, type 2C patient mutations do not affect the E3 function of pVHL, and hence, HIF regulation is normal; yet these patients nevertheless develop pheochromocytoma (3Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E.

Therefore, we hypothesized that another function of pVHL is essential for its tumor suppressor activity. The VHL gene produces two wild-type isoforms: a full-length 30-kDa form (pVHL30) and a shorter 19-kDa form (pVHL19) that is generated by alternative translational initiation at Met54 (11Iliopoulos O.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1529-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both pVHL30 and pVHL19 form an active VEC complex, and both proteins have been shown to suppress tumor formation independently in nude mouse xenograft assays (12Schoenfeld A. Davidowitz E.J. Burk R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8817-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Blankenship C. Naglich J.G. Whaley J.M. Seizinger B. Kley N.

However, analyzing known mutations in VHL patients revealed a number of disease-associated mutations in the acidic domain that would not affect the transcription and function of the pVHL19 isoform (VHL Mutations Database, available at www.umd.be:2020/). Hence, although the functional significance of the extra N-terminal acidic domain of pVHL30 remains unclear, this region in pVHL clearly contributes to its tumor suppressor function. Here, we show that pVHL30 is phosphorylated within the N-terminal acidic domain by casein kinase-2 (CK2). The phosphorylation status of pVHL30 did not affect E3 function. Ablation of CK2-specific phosphorylation sites or inhibition of CK2 activity increased affinity for fibronectin, yet resulted in decreased deposition of extracellular fibronectin. Interestingly, cells expressing phospho-defective pVHL delayed the onset of tumor formation in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse xenograft assay. Hence, CK2-mediated phosphorylation represents an HIF-independent tumor suppressor function of the acidic domain of pVHL. Cell Culture—Human kidney 293T cells and 786-O clear-cell RCC cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. 786-O subclones stably expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type pVHL30 (pVHL30(WT); 786-WT cells), HA-pVHL30(AAA) (pVHL30 triple mutant with Ser33, Ser38, and Ser43 mutated to alanines; 786-AAA cells), or empty plasmid (786-MOCK cells) were generated as described previously (15Lonergan K.M.

Plasmids—pVHL30 and pVHL19 were cloned into a pcDNA3 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing an N-terminal VSV or HA tag. The mammalian expression plasmid pRc-CMV-HA-pVHL(WT) was described previously (15Lonergan K.M. Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kamura T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and pRc-CMV-HA-pVHL(AAA) was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The S33A, S38A, and S43A substitutions were generated using primer sets 5′-CGGGGAGGAGGCGGGCGCCGAGGAG-3′/5′-CTCCTCGGCGCCCGCCTC CTCCCCG-3′, 5′-GCGCCGAGGAGGCCGGCCCGGAAGAG-3′/5′-CTCTTCCGG GCCGGCCTCCTCGGCGC-3′, and 5′-GGCCCGGAAGAGGCCGGCCCGGAGG-3′/5′-CCTCCGGGCCGGCCTCTTCCGGGCC-3′, respectively. The authenticity of all plasmids was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitations, protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and antibody were pre-coupled for 30 min and washed twice with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Samples were added to the pre-coupled beads, and binding was allowed to occur for 90 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed four times with 800 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Specific protein bands on Western blots were visualized using the various indicated antibodies. All primary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) was used at 1:20,000 dilution as a secondary antibody, after which enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was performed for detection. [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling—786-WT or 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to 80% confluency. Cells were washed once with phosphate-free medium (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA), followed by growth in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate and labeling for 4 h. Cells were transferred to ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with 500 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (0.1 mg/ml Na3VO4, 0.1 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mg/ml Na4P2O7). These lysates were then submitted to various immunoprecipitations. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant pVHL were in vitro transcribed and translated using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). 5 units of recombinant CK2α (Promega Corp.) with the recommended buffer and 1 μl of in vitro translated protein were mixed in a reaction volume of 50 μl with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. In vitro translated products were immunoprecipitated to increase the specificity of the signal. The CK2 inhibitors daidzein (Sigma) and 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (a kind gift from D. Shugar) were used at the indicated concentrations during the incubation with [γ-32P]ATP. Gel Filtration Assay—The gel filtration assay was done using a column containing a Bio-Gel A-1.5m (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4); 200 μl of crude cell lysate in Triton X-100 lysis buffer was run at 0.5 ml/min; and 0.5-ml samples were collected. The bed volume of the column used was 25 ml. Fractions were collected and subsequently submitted to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 50 μl of 1× sample buffer and used for Western blotting. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—An in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (6Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E. Pavletich N. Chau V. Kaelin W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Briefly, the [35S]methionine-labeled reticulocyte lysate HA-HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) translation product (4 μl) was incubated in 786-O RCC S100 extracts (100–150 μg) supplemented with 8 μg/μl ubiquitin (Sigma), 100 ng/μl ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem, Inc., Cambridge, MA), and an ATP-regenerating system (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.5 μg/μl creatine kinase) in a reaction volume of 20–30 μl for 1.5 h at 30 °C. Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling was performed as described previously (16Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

In brief, radioisotope labeling was performed by methionine starvation for 45 min, followed by growth in 5 ml of methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml of medium; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Fibronectin Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—A fibronectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (2Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 16Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

In brief, cells (2 × 103) were grown for 4 days in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) prior to cell removal with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. Complete removal of cells was visualized by phase microscopy. Plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °Cand subsequently incubated with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-fibronectin antibody in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Plates were washed three times with PBS, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.1 μg/ml) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS and developed with 1.0 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.2 m Tris buffer (Sigma). Reactions were stopped with 3 m NaOH, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a microplate reader. SCID Mouse Xenograft Assay—Multiple 786-O subclones expressing pVHL(WT), pVHL(AAA), or empty plasmid were grown to ∼90% confluence in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with a solution of 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA. Cells (2 × 106) in 50 μlof1× PBS were injected intramuscularly into the left hind legs of male SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.). Tumor growth was assessed and measured weekly by carefully passing the tumorbearing leg through a series of holes of decreasing diameter (0.5-mm decrements) in a plastic rod. The Acidic Domain of pVHL30 Is Phosphorylated by CK2—To determine whether the two naturally occurring pVHL isoforms are phosphorylated, 293T cells were transfected with VSV-tagged pVHL30 and pVHL19 and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-VSV antibody (Fig. 1A). Autoradiography of the immunoblot demonstrated that, although VSV-pVHL30 incorporated [32P]orthophosphate, VSV-pVHL19 did not (Fig. 1A). Computer-based scanning of full-length pVHL30 indicated multiple potential phosphorylation sites over the entire open reading frame and three predicted CK2 phosphorylation sites in the acidic domain at Ser33, Ser38, and Ser43 (data not shown). Thus, we generated the triple mutant pVHL30(AAA) with Ser-to-Ala substitutions at each of these positions and found that pVHL30(AAA) was no longer capable of incorporating [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that, in an overexpression system, pVHL30, but not pVHL19, is phosphorylated at one or more of the serine residues within the acidic domain. To determine the physiologic relevance of this finding, we metabolically labeled 293T cells with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-pVHL antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted (Fig. 1C). Autoradiography of this blot clearly showed a specific band at ∼30 kDa in the anti-pVHL immunoprecipitation, but not in the anti-HA control immunoprecipitation. From these data, we concluded that phosphorylation of pVHL30, as observed, occurs endogenously. To address directly whether CK2 is responsible for phosphorylation of pVHL30 at the predicted serine residues, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using in vitro translated VSV-pVHL30(WT) and HA-pVHL30(AAA) with or without recombinant CK2α, the catalytic subunit of CK2 (Fig. 2A). Autoradiography of the in vitro kinase assay clearly demonstrated that pVHL30(WT), but not pVHL30(AAA), was phosphorylated by CK2α (Fig. 2A). Casein was used as a positive control for the CK2-mediated in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2A). To determine the exact site(s) of pVHL30 phosphorylation, single and double Ser-to-Ala mutants were generated and analyzed using the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2B). All in vitro translated single Ser-to-Ala mutants were phosphorylated by recombinant CK2α. It should be noted, however, that pVHL30(S38A) had a noticeably weaker phosphorylation signal. All double Ser-to-Ala mutants showed significantly weaker phosphorylation profiles compared with their wild-type counterpart (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that all three serine residues can serve as CK2-mediated phosphorylation sites and that phosphorylation of any one site appears to be temporally and spatially independent of the phosphorylation status of the other two sites. During the course of these in vitro kinase assays, we observed that, even without adding exogenous CK2α, anti-pVHL30(WT) immunoprecipitates derived from 293T cells exhibited endogenous kinase activity capable of phosphorylating casein (data not shown). Likewise, immunoprecipitates of pVHL30(AAA), which themselves could not be phosphorylated (Figs. 1A and 2, A and B), were also capable of phosphorylating purified casein (data not shown). These data suggest that CK2 exists in a complex with pVHL30 irrespective of its phosphorylation status. To further verify that the pVHL30-associated kinase is CK2α, 786-O RCC subclones stably expressing HA-pVHL30(WT) (786-WT cells) were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-pVHL, anti-CK2α, or anti-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-μ (used as a negative control) antibody (Fig. 2C). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CK2α or anti-pVHL antibody, which showed that CK2α associated with pVHL30 (Fig. 2C). To determine whether this interaction occurs in the absence of overexpression, we performed immunoprecipitation using anti-CK2α, anti-pVHL, or anti-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-μ (used as a negative control) antibody; an in vitro kinase assay; SDS-PAGE; and visualization by autoradiography. Kinase activity was detected in immunoprecipitates of pVHL and CK2α, which showed phosphorylation of endogenous pVHL30 (Fig. 2D, first and second lanes). We also observed phosphorylated proteins comigrating with CK2α (Fig. 2D), suggesting autophosphorylation of CK2α. These results suggest that pVHL30 and CK2α interact under a physiologic condition. Furthermore, we performed a size gel filtration assay to separate endogenous multiprotein complexes from 293T lysate according to their size. After performing the gel filtration according to size, proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoblotted for pVHL and CK2α. In the fraction containing pVHL30, we did find CK2α (Fig. 2E), again supporting the notion that pVHL and CK2α are present in the same protein complex. We next examined the effects of the CK2-specific inhibitors daidzein and 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole on phosphorylation of pVHL30. To this end, anti-HA immunoprecipitates from 293T cells transfected with HA-pVHL30 were prepared and used in an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of 0, 10, 30, and 100 μm daidzein or 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (Fig. 2F). We observed dose-dependent inhibition of pVHL30 phosphorylation (Fig. 2F). Collectively, these results show that CK2α binds and phosphorylates pVHL30. VEC Complex Formation and Function Are Independent of pVHL30 Phosphorylation—To address whether the pVHL30-(AAA) mutant is capable of forming an E3 complex, we tested the ability of pVHL30(AAA) to bind to Cul2, a component of the VEC complex that acts as a scaffold. 786-WT, 786-AAA, or 786-MOCK cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Cul2 or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A). This assay showed that pVHL30(AAA) bound Cul2 similarly to pVHL30(WT). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of HA-pVHL30(AAA) from metabolically labeled 786-AAA cells coprecipitated elongin B, elongin C, and Cul2 (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that pVHL30(AAA) forms a VEC complex.Fig. 4Inhibition of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of pVHL30 increases binding to fibronectin.A, the indicated 786-O subclones were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

S100 extracts prepared from 786-MOCK cells lacking pVHL and supplemented with in vitro translated empty plasmid failed to support the ubiquitination of 35S-labeled HA-HIF-1α(ODD) (Fig. 3B, first lane). However, S100 extracts supplemented with increasing amounts of either in vitro translated HA-pVHL30(WT) (Fig. 3B, second and third lanes) or in vitro translated HA-pVHL30(AAA) (fourth fifth and lanes) ubiquitinated 35S-labeled HA-HIF-1α(ODD). As expected, S100 extracts made from 786-WT cells supported the ubiquitination of 35S-labeled HA-HIF-1α(ODD) (Fig. 3B, sixth lane). Furthermore, whole cell extract made from 786-AAA cells down-regulated the expression of the HIF target gene GLUT1 under normal oxygen tension similarly to 786-WT cells (Fig. 3C). Whole cell extract made from 786-MOCK cells showed overexpression of GLUT1 under normal oxygen tension. These results indicate that phosphorylation of pVHL30 by CK2 is not required for participation in the VEC complex to ubiquitinate HIF-α. Phosphorylation of pVHL30 Regulates Binding of Fibronectin and Secretion into Extracellular Space—Interestingly, HA-pVHL30(AAA) bound strikingly more fibronectin (∼3-fold, as measured by densitometry) compared with HA-pVHL30(WT) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the addition of increasing amounts of purified recombinant fibronectin during lysis of radiolabeled cells resulted in greater reduction of fibronectin bound to HA-pVHL30(WT) compared with HA-pVHL30(AAA) (Fig. 4, B and C). For example, whereas we observed no appreciable effect on HA-pVHL30(AAA) binding to fibronectin, HA-pVHL30(WT) binding to fibronectin was reduced by 40% upon the addition of 0.1 μg of purified fibronectin, as measured by densitometry (Fig. 4C). The addition of 1 μg of purified fibronectin almost completely competed against the binding of endogenous fibronectin to HA-pVHL30(WT), but negligibly affected the binding of endogenous fibronectin to non-phosphorylatable HA-pVHL30(AAA). Collectively, these data imply that dephosphorylation of pVHL30 enhances its ability to bind fibronectin or reduces its ability to release fibronectin. We next asked whether inhibition of CK2 activity would increase the binding of pVHL30(WT) to fibronectin. During metabolic labeling, 786-WT cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the CK2-specific inhibitor daidzein. Cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. As predicted, inhibition of CK2 by daidzein increased pVHL30(WT) binding to fibronectin (Fig. 4B). This effect was not due simply to increased expression of pVHL30(WT) in daidzein-treated cells, as noted by the relatively equal loading of de novo translated pVHL30(WT) (Fig. 4B). Treatment with staurosporine (a general inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases, excluding CK2) had a negligible effect on fibronectin binding (data not shown). These results suggest that specific inhibition of CK2 enhances pVHL30 binding to fibronectin. We then asked what effect pVHL30 binding to fibronectin has on subsequent deposition of fibronectin into the extracellular space. The relative amounts of fibronectin deposited by 786-MOCK, 786-WT, and 786-AAA cells grown on 96-well plates for 4 days were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-fibronectin antibody after the cells were removed by trypsin-free EDTA solution to preserve any fibronectin that was deposited on the plastic. As expected, 786-MOCK cells deposited significantly less fibronectin compared with 786-WT cells. However, the enhanced fibronectin binding by pVHL(AAA) resulted in less fibronectin deposition compared with 786-WT cells (Fig. 5A). Anti-fibronectin immunofluorescence by confocal microscopy demonstrated the expected fibronectin staining in the cytoplasm and along the cell periphery in 786-WT cells (Fig. 5B). However, 786-AAA cells showed excessive perinuclear fibronectin staining as well as punctate staining along the cell cortex (Fig. 5B). Concordantly, 786-AAA cells showed more intracellular fibronectin expression compared with 786-WT cells (Fig. 5C). 786-WT and 786-AAA cells showed similar de novo translation of fibronectin as measured by 35S metabolic labeling (data not shown). These data suggest that, although 786-AAA cells are capable of producing fibronectin, they are less capable of releasing fibronectin into the extracellular space, which would account for the increased intracellular accumulation of fibronectin. Phosphorylation of pVHL30 Is Required for Tumor Suppression in SCID Mice—To determine whether phosphorylation plays a role in tumor suppression, multiple 786-O subclones expressing pVHL(WT), pVHL(AAA), or empty plasmid were injected intramuscularly into the left hind legs of SCID mice. Tumor take and size were monitored and measured weekly (Fig. 6). After ∼3–4 weeks, the mice injected with 786-MOCK cells began to form tumors (15/15), as expected. The mice injected with 786-AAA cells began to develop tumors after 7–8 weeks (15/15), whereas the mice injected with multiple 786-WT subclones were tumor-free (0/14). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of pVHL30 within the first 53 amino acids have a direct role in tumor suppression. Not all VHL disease-causing mutations result in the dys-regulation of HIF activity (2Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Hum. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For example, type 2C-associated mutations such as L188V and K159E have been shown to have wild-type or “normal” E3 activity to target HIF-α subunits for oxygen-dependent polyubiquitination. However, every VHL disease-causing mutant tested to date has shown a failure to bind fibronectin, resulting in reduction of extracellular fibronectin matrix assembly (2Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 3Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that inhibition of pVHL phosphorylation, either by Ser-to-Ala substitutions or by treatment with CK2-specific inhibitors, resulted in markedly increased binding of pVHL30 to fibronectin while maintaining wild-type E3 function. However, this increased binding led to reduced fibronectin deposition into the extracellular space. The improper deposition of fibronectin into the extracellular space or interference with its proper function has been correlated with the development of dysplasia in Xenopus, and fibronectin has been shown to influence the malignant behavior of tumor cells in experimental mouse models (18Marsden M. DeSimone D.W. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3635-3647PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pasqualini R. Bourdoulous S. Koivunen E. Woods Jr., V.L. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that the tumor suppressor function of pVHL30 phosphorylation is related to the regulation of proper fibronectin deposition. The tumor suppressor function of pVHL that we have described here requires the N-terminal acidic domain and is independent of the regulation of HIF-α. Multiple studies on the role of stabilized HIF in tumorigenesis using the identical cell system that we have described here have been recently published. Collectively, these previous studies suggest that HIF-2α is the effector of tumorigenesis upon loss of functional pVHL. Kondo et al. (20Kondo K. Klco J. Nakamura E. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and Maranchie et al. (21Maranchie J.K. Vasselli J.R. Riss J. Bonifacino J.S. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 247-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) addressed whether overexpressed stabilized HIF can counteract tumor suppression by pVHL. Kondo et al. (22Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; (DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000083)PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that 786-O cells expressing stable HIF-2α are able to override pVHL-mediated tumor suppression. However, these previous studies did not address the more physiologically relevant question of whether the suppression of endogenous HIF-2α would be sufficient to abrogate tumor development in these patient-derived RCC cells (786-O RCC). Kondo et al. (22Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; (DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000083)PubMed Google Scholar) and Zimmer et al. (23Zimmer M. Doucette D. Siddiqui N. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar) did address this question using HIF-2α RNA interference; their data indeed support an oncogenic role for HIF-2α. However, these experimental data do not exclude further tumor suppressor functions for pVHL. The in vivo experiments described in these previous studies were terminated after 8–10 weeks, whereas our experiments demonstrated that this time point is only when 786-O cells deficient in CK2-mediated phosphorylation begin to form detectable tumors (Fig. 6). Moreover, tumor growth in the absence of HIF-2α is retarded, but not completely inhibited (22Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; (DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000083)PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings and our data, we propose that, although HIF-2α is an important regulator of tumor growth, it is not the only effector of tumorigenesis in pVHL-deficient cancers. These data led us to hypothesize that an additional tumor suppressor function is linked to phosphorylation of the acidic domain of pVHL. The regulation of fibronectin by pVHL is tightly linked to the development of VHL disease. It follows then that there are multiple levels of fibronectin regulation by pVHL30. First, pVHL30 positively regulates transcription of the gene encoding fibronectin (FN1) in an HIF-independent manner (24Bluyssen H.A.R. Lolkema M.P.J.C. van Beest M. Boone M. Snijckers C.M.J.T. Los M. Gebbink M.F.B.G. Braam B. Holstege F.C. Giles R.H. Voest E.E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Second, as shown here, phosphorylation of the N-terminal acidic domain of pVHL30 mediates the engagement and/or disengagement of fibronectin. Third, modification of pVHL30 by the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 is linked to fibronectin binding, and inhibition of pVHL30 neddylation prohibits fibronectin binding (18Marsden M. DeSimone D.W. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3635-3647PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fibronectin deposition by pVHL seems to be a highly regulated process and is unique to the pVHL30 isoform, as pVHL19 does not bind fibronectin (11Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11661-11666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have shown here that CK2 exists in a complex with pVHL30 and phosphorylates Ser33, Ser38, and Ser43 in the N-terminal acidic domain of pVHL30. CK2 is a heterotetrameric complex composed of two β and two α subunits (25Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The two β subunits have no kinase activity, but are thought to have a regulatory role enhancing the catalytic activity of the α subunits (25Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Differential gene expression profiling of chemically induced kidney carcinoma cells of Eker rats demonstrated overexpression of CK2β subunits, indicating that amplification of CK2α function may be involved in renal carcinogenesis (26Patel S.K. Ma N. Monks T.J. Lau S.S. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 38: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, human kidney tumors have been shown to express elevated levels of CK2α and CK2β (27Stalter G. Siemer S. Becht E. Ziegler M. Remberger K. Issinger O.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, CK2 localizes and binds to microtubules and has been shown to phosphorylate various microtubule-binding proteins (28Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Moreno F.J. Diaz-Nido J. Jimenez J.S. Avila J. Mol. Cell.

Brauch H. Acker T. Flamme I. Plate K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5435-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Recently, pVHL has been shown to associate with microtubules (32Hergovich A. Lisztwan J. Barry R. Ballschmieter P. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that pVHL30 and CK2 interact on microtubules. Taken together, our data present a novel tumor suppressor function for the acidic domain of pVHL, which might help to elucidate the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in VHL disease.

https://openalex.org/W2002019301,"To avoid the photodamage, cyanobacteria regulate the distribution of light energy absorbed by phycobilisome antenna either to photosystem II or to photosystem I (PSI) upon high light acclimation by the process so-called state transition. We found that an alternative PSI subunit, PsaK2 (sll0629 gene product), is involved in this process in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. An examination of the subunit composition of the purified PSI reaction center complexes revealed that PsaK2 subunit was absent in the PSI complexes under low light condition, but was incorporated into the complexes during acclimation to high light. The growth of the psaK2 mutant on solid medium was inhibited under high light condition. We determined the photosynthetic characteristics of the wild type strain and the two mutants, the psaK1 (ssr0390) mutant and the psaK2 mutant, using pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer. Non-photochemical quenching, which reflects the energy transfer from phycobilisome to PSI in cyanobacteria, was higher in high light grown cells than in low light grown cells, both in the wild type and the psaK1 mutant. However, this change of non-photochemical quenching during acclimation to high light was not observed in the psaK2 mutant. Thus, PsaK2 subunit is involved in the energy transfer from phycobilisome to PSI under high light condition. The role of PsaK2 in state transition under high light condition was also confirmed by chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra determined at 77 K. The results suggest that PsaK2-dependent state transition is essential for the growth of this cyanobacterium under high light condition.

The effective absorption of light energy is the first step in photosynthesis. All oxygenic photosynthetic organisms share common core antenna pigments of ∼40 chlorophyll a in PSII 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; PSI, photosystem I; qN, non-photochemical quenching; qP, photochemical quenching; Fm, the maximum level of fluorescence; Fo, the minimal level of fluorescence; Fs, the stable level of fluorescence; LHCII, light-harvesting complex II; LHCI, light-harvesting complex I; RpaC or rpaC, regulator of phycobilisome association; DCMU, dichlorophenyldimethylurea; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; PSI, photosystem I; qN, non-photochemical quenching; qP, photochemical quenching; Fm, the maximum level of fluorescence; Fo, the minimal level of fluorescence; Fs, the stable level of fluorescence; LHCII, light-harvesting complex II; LHCI, light-harvesting complex I; RpaC or rpaC, regulator of phycobilisome association; DCMU, dichlorophenyldimethylurea; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. and ∼100 chlorophyll a in PSI (1Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria have an additional light-harvesting system, phycobilisome, which is primarily associated with PSII (2Glazer A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 29-51Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 3Zilinskas B.A. Greenwald L.S. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 7-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, cyanobacteria use two kinds of antenna pigments with totally different absorption wavelengths. Because neither light quality nor light quantity is constant in natural environments, cyanobacteria have to distribute the light energy absorbed by antenna pigments to two photosystems in order to optimize the photosynthetic performance in response to changing light environments. When cells are exposed to illumination favoring either PSII or PSI, the distribution of light energy between two photosystems would be adjusted (4Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). When cells have been pre-illuminated with light mainly absorbed by phycobiliproteins (PSII light), the energy transfer to PSI increases, whereas the energy transfer to PSII decreases (state 2). Pre-illumination of cells with light mainly absorbed by chlorophyll a (PSI light) causes a reverse effect leading to the increase of energy transfer to PSII and the decrease of energy transfer to PSI (state 1) (5van Thor J.J. Mullineaux C.W. Matthijs H.C.P. Hellingwert K.J. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 430-443Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Distribution of light energy to two photosystems is regulated in response to the light regime not only in cyanobacteria but also in green algae and higher plants. This regulation of energy distribution between PSII and PSI has been generally called “state transition.” Since its discovery in 1969 (6Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 7Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), many research groups have been involved in the research of state transition in cyanobacteria, green algae, and higher plants. State transition is induced not only by the change in light quality but also by the change in light quantity. When exposed to excess light, cyanobacteria are able to change the distribution of light energy between two photosystems. Under normal light condition, the light energy absorbed by phycobilisome is preferentially transferred to PSII. On the contrary, under high light condition, the energy can be transferred not only to PSII but also to PSI (8Campbell D. Hurry V. Clarke A.K. Gustafsson P. Öquist G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 667-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the physiological significance may not be in the effective photosynthesis but in the avoidance from the photodamage. In the old days, phycobilisome was assumed to act as a light-harvesting antenna solely for PSII. However, energy transfer studies on the wild type (9Mullineaux C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 285-292Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and a PSII-deficient mutant (10Mullineaux C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 71-77Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 indicated that phycobilisome could interact with and efficiently transfer energy to PSI, depending on the growth condition of the cells. Phycobilisome was found to be able to move rapidly on thylakoid membranes (11Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones M.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The study using inhibitor of electron transport suggested that state transition was controlled by the redox state of the plastoquinone pool via cytochrome b6f complex (13Mao H.B. Li G.F. Ruan X. Wu Q.Y. Gong Y.D. Zhang X.F. Zhao N.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oxidation of plastoquinone induces state 1, whereas reduction induces state 2. As for proteinaceous factors, it was reported that ApcD and ApcF, phycobilisome core components, were involved in state transition (14Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 169-179Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). RpaC (regulator of phycobilisome association) was also shown to function in state transition (15Emlyn-Jones D. Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The rpaC gene was isolated by screening for mutants displaying no changes in fluorescence yield in response to changes in light quality. The deduced amino acid sequence of the rpaC gene has no recognizable sequence motifs. The rpaC mutant can perform state transition upon excitation of chlorophyll but not upon excitation of phycobilisome. At very low photon flux densities of yellow or white light, the growth of the rpaC mutant was slower than that of the wild type. However, actual function of this protein is unknown. Moreover, we have no information on the PSI-side component working for the cyanobacterial state transition. Upon acclimation of cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to high light, the expression of all of the PSI genes was simultaneously suppressed with only one exception of the psaK2 gene (16Hihara Y. Kamei A. Kanehisa M. Kaplan A. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The expression of psaK2 was eminently induced after the shift of cells to high light, implying that PsaK2 might be involved in high light acclimation. PsaK is a subunit of PSI complexes and localized on the outside edge of cyanobacterial PSI trimer (17Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains two unlinked psaK genes, psaK1 and psaK2. Cyanobacterial psaK seems to be the common ancestor of higher plants psaK/psaG (18Kjaerulff S. Andersen B. Nielsen V.S. Mϕller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial genomes contain one to three psaK genes, whereas only one psaK gene has been found in green algae and higher plants so far. Deduced amino acid sequences of the psaK1 and the psaK2 genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are notably different in length (86 amino acids for the PsaK1 protein and 128 amino acids for the PsaK2 protein) because of long N-terminal extension in PsaK2. The two gene products show 42% homology with each other. In the past studies, both the psaK1 and the psaK2 mutants were characterized but clear phenotype was not observed under normal growth condition (19Nakamoto H. Hasegawa M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Naithani S. Hou J.M. Chitnis P.R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 63: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the physiological role of PsaK2 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under high light condition. The results indicate that PsaK2 is involved in the energy transfer from phycobilisome to PSI under high light condition and that PsaK2-dependent state transition is essential for the growth of this cyanobacterium under high light condition. Growth of Cultures and Strains—Wild type and mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were grown in BG-11 medium (21Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplied with 10 mm TES. Liquid cultures were grown at 30 °C in 50-ml glass tubes and bubbled with air under continuous illumination provided by fluorescent lamps. Photon flux density at 20 and 200 μmol m–2 s–1 was regarded as low light and high light, respectively. The psaK1 mutant was constructed by the replacement of nucleotide sequence corresponding to positions 6–70 of amino acid of PsaK1 with the kanamycin-resistant cassette using two MscI sites in the psaK1 gene (19Nakamoto H. Hasegawa M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The psaK2 mutant was constructed by insertion of the kanamycin-resistant cassette into AgeI site in the psaK2 gene. The rpaC gene was disrupted by insertion of the spectinomycin-resistant cassette into StyI site in the rpaC gene. Mutants were usually maintained with kanamycin and/or spectinomycin at the final concentration of 20 μg ml–1. Analysis of Chlorophyll Fluorescence—Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured with a pulse-amplitude modulation chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM 101/102/103, Heinz Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) with a high sensitivity emitter-detector unit (ED-101US, Heinz Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) as described by Sonoike et al. (22Sonoike K. Hihara Y. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were dark-adapted for 5 min, and then the measuring light was turned on to obtain the minimal fluorescence level (Fo). The stable level of fluorescence (Fs) was determined during the exposure of cells to actinic light with defined photon flux density (KL 1500, Schott, Wiesbaden, Germany). The fluorescence level with fully reduced QA (Fm′) was obtained by applying multiple turnover flashes (XMT 103, Heinz Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) under actinic light. The far-red light from a photodiode (FR 102, Heinz Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) was applied just after turning off the actinic light to determine Fo′. The maximum fluorescence (Fm) was obtained by adding 10 μm DCMU to the sample under actinic light. Photochemical quenching (qP) and non-photochemical quenching (qN) were calculated as (Fm′ – Fs)/(Fm′ – Fo′) and 1 – [(Fm′ – Fo′)/(Fm – Fo)], respectively. Fluorescence Emission Spectra—Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K were recorded using a custom-made apparatus as described by Sonoike and Terashima (23Sonoike K. Terashima I. Planta. 1994; 194: 287-293Crossref Google Scholar). Cells acclimated to low or high light condition for 24 h were collected and concentrated by centrifugation. Cells were adjusted to a concentration of OD730 = 2.0 (high light-acclimated cells) or OD730 = 1.0 (low light-acclimated cells) with BG-11. State 1 conditions were achieved by illumination of cells with blue light (100 μmol m–2 s–1) in the presence of 10 μm DCMU for 2 min and subsequent freezing in liquid nitrogen under the same light condition. State 2 conditions were achieved by dark incubation of cells for more than 10 min and subsequent freezing in liquid nitrogen in the dark. Isolation of Thylakoid Membranes and Purification of PSI Complexes—Cyanobacterial cells of the wild type and the mutant strains were harvested and suspended in 0.4 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 (24Chitnis V.P.

Unbroken cells and debris were removed by low speed centrifugation at 4,700 × g. Thylakoid membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 45 min and resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, to stimulate trimerization of PSI complexes, thylakoid membranes were solubilized with β-dodecyl-maltoside for 15 min on ice. The ratio of chlorophyll to β-dodecyl-maltoside was 1:15. The solubilized thylakoid membranes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was layered on a 10–30% step gradient of sucrose in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 0.05% β-dodecyl-maltoside (25Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three distinct bands were resolved after ultracentrifugation at 140,000 × g for 4 h with an angle rotor (70T, Hitachi, Yokohama, Japan). The upper orange band contained carotenoid, the middle green band contained PSII complexes and monomers of PSI complexes, and the lower green band contained trimers of PSI complexes. The lower band was collected and subjected to non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (26Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15954) Google Scholar) to purify the trimer form of PSI complexes. The band of PSI trimer was cut out and homogenized in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. Gel fragments were removed by centrifugation at 1,350 × g for 10 min, and the purified PSI complexes in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation at 550,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. All of the centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. The purity of PSI was confirmed by the measurement of low temperature fluorescence emission spectra (data not shown). SDS-PAGE—Subunits of the purified PSI complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 16–22% acrylamide gel containing 7.5 m urea (27Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1233-1239Google Scholar). Before electrophoresis, the samples were treated with 5% lithium dodecyl sulfate and 60 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature. A sample equivalent to 1 μg of chlorophyll was loaded on each lane. Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined after extraction with 100% methanol (28Grimme L.H. Boardman N.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gel was stained using a Silver Stain Plus Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Although the psaK2 gene expression specifically increased during acclimation to high light (16Hihara Y. Kamei A. Kanehisa M. Kaplan A. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the amounts of PsaK1 and PsaK2 proteins in PSI complex of high light-acclimated cells were unknown. We purified PSI complex from the wild type cells grown under low (20 μmol m–2 s–1) and high light (200 μmol m–2 s–1) conditions and also from the psaK1 and the psaK2 mutant cells grown under high light condition. Proteins in the purified PSI complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1). PSI complex isolated from low light-acclimated wild type cells contained a considerable amount of PsaK1 with only a trace amount of PsaK2. High light treatment increased the amount of PsaK2 in PSI complexes. In PSI complexes from high light-acclimated psaK1 or psaK2 mutant, PsaK1 or PsaK2 subunit was missing, respectively, whereas the amount of the other subunits of PSI was not affected, in good agreement with a previous report (20Naithani S. Hou J.M. Chitnis P.R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 63: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We identified the protein band that increased under high light condition as PsaK2 subunit by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). To examine whether the failure to accumulate PsaK2 subunit in PSI affects the growth under high light condition, we examined the growth property of the wild type as well as the psaK1 and the psaK2 mutants. 10 μl of the liquid culture was spotted on an agar plate and grown under low or high light condition for 3 days. Minor differences in growth between the wild type and the two mutants were observed under low light condition (Fig. 2A). Under high light condition, the growth of the psaK2 mutant was considerably slower compared with that of the wild type and the psaK1 mutant (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the accumulation of PsaK2 in PSI is essential for the growth of this cyanobacterium under high light condition. We then determined the photosynthetic characteristics of the wild type and the psaK1 and the psaK2 mutants grown under low and high light conditions for 24 h using pulse-amplitude modulation chlorophyll fluorometer. The level of maximum fluorescence was lower under actinic light (Fm′) than under actinic light in the presence of DCMU (Fm) (Fig. 3). DCMU locks the cells in state 1, and the difference between Fm and Fm′ reflected the decrease in fluorescence intensity (non-photochemical quenching) due to state transition. The relative level of Fm′ to Fm is lower in high light-acclimated cells of wild type and the psaK1 mutant than in low light-acclimated cells (Fig. 3, compare A and B with D and E). However, in the case of the psaK2 mutant, the Fm′ level was not much different between low light-acclimated cells and high light-acclimated cells (Fig. 3, C and F). The result suggests that the high light acclimation induces state transition, and the process is impaired in the psaK2 mutant. The quantified values of the fluorescence measurements were shown in Table I. In low light-acclimated cells, we observed no significant differences between the wild type and the mutants in relation to non-photochemical quenching (qN) as well as photochemical quenching (qP) (Table I). However, in high light-acclimated cells, qN in the wild type and the psaK1 mutant was notably higher than that in the psaK2 mutant, although there was no significant difference in qP among three strains. Thus, the increase of non-photochemical quenching upon high light acclimation, which reflects state transition in cyanobacteria, was specifically suppressed in the psaK2 mutant.Table IFluorescence characteristics of the wild type, the psaK1 mutant, and the psaK2 mutant grown under low or high light condition for 24 hqPqNLow light conditionWT0.55 ± 0.020.24 ± 0.03ΔpsaK10.56 ± 0.060.25 ± 0.02ΔpsaK20.58 ± 0.050.21 ± 0.03High light conditionWT0.61 ± 0.030.37 ± 0.05ΔpsaK10.51 ± 0.090.35 ± 0.05ΔpsaK20.55 ± 0.050.22 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab Since the analysis of non-photochemical quenching suggested the role of PsaK2 in state transition, we examined the energy transfer from phycobilisome to two photosystems by monitoring 77-K emission spectra of chlorophyll fluorescence from cells either in state 1 or in state 2. When cells were excited with blue light (400–600 nm) absorbed by phycobilin and chlorophyll a, the fluorescence emission spectra for cells adapted to either state 1 or state 2 had emission peaks at 663, 685, 695, and 725 nm. The peak at 663 nm arises from phycobilisome. The peak at 685 nm arises from PSII and possibly from the terminal emitters of phycobilisome. The 695-nm peak arises from PSII, and the 725-nm peak arises from PSI. In the wild type and the psaK1 mutant grown under high light condition, relative intensity of PSI fluorescence was much greater in state 2 than in state 1 (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table II). This increase of PSI fluorescence in state 2 reflects the enhanced energy transfer from phycobilisome to PSI. In the psaK2 mutant, the relative intensity of PSI fluorescence in state 2 was very close to that in state 1 (Fig. 4C and Table II). These results indicate that the high light-acclimated cells of the psaK2 mutant is not able to perform state transition, supporting the conclusion drawn from the analysis of non-photochemical quenching (Table I). The relative intensity of PSI fluorescence was greater in the low light-acclimated cells than in the high light-acclimated cells (compare Figs. 4 and 5) because of the regulation of photosystem stoichiometry in acclimation to the changes in photon flux density (29Hihara Y. Sonoike K. Ikeuchi M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In low light-acclimated cells of the wild type, the psaK1, and the psaK2 mutants, the relative intensity of PSI fluorescence was greater in state 2 than in state 1, indicating that the psaK2 mutant as well as the wild type can perform state transition under low light condition (Fig. 5 and Table II). PsaK2-dependent state transition is apparently specific to high light condition.Table IIThe ratio of F725/F695 (fluorescence intensity at 725 nm/fluorescence intensity at 695 nm) of low or high light-acclimated cells in either state 1 or state 2 determined by the measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra at 77 KState 1State 2Low light conditionWT1.24 ± 0.152.05 ± 0.29ΔpsaK11.30 ± 0.052.13 ± 0.07ΔpsaK21.27 ± 0.071.98 ± 0.21High light conditionWT0.643 ± 0.0240.889 ± 0.118ΔpsaK10.647 ± 0.0860.859 ± 0.137ΔpsaK20.608 ± 0.1260.667 ± 0.061 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5Chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra of low light-acclimated cells determined at 77 K.

In high light-acclimated cells, the psaK2rpaC double mutant displayed the same phenotype as the psaK2 mutant (data not shown). In low light-acclimated cells, the double mutant can partially perform state transition (data not shown). Using BLAST search program, we searched two types of PsaK proteins (PsaK1-type and PsaK2-type) in databases to examine whether this mechanism of PsaK2-dependent state transition is conserved in other cyanobacteria. Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101 have two types of PsaK proteins as well as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Fig. 6). The black boxes in the figure show the amino acid residues conserved only in PsaK1-type or in PsaK2-type protein. These amino acid residues might be responsible for the specific function of each type of protein. When unrooted dendrogram is constructed by the neighbor joining method through the ClustalW program, it is evident that PsaK1-type proteins and PsaK2-type proteins form distinct clades (Fig. 7). In the case of Nostoc punctiforme and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, there is only one psaK gene in each genome, the PsaK1 type in the former and PsaK2 type in the latter. Marine-type cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus, had only one psaK gene that forms a distinct clade, which is closer to PsaK1-type one. One of psaK genes in Anabaena PCC 7120 is the PsaK1 type, but the other two genes are rather divergent and form the forth clade of cyanobacterial PsaK. PsaK and PsaG of chloroplasts seem to be equally distant from cyanobacterial PsaK as suggested previously (18Kjaerulff S. Andersen B. Nielsen V.S. Mϕller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 7Unrooted phylogenetic tree of cyanobacterial PsaK and PsaK/PsaG of chloroplasts.

In cyanobacteria, several components of phycobilisome, such as ApcD and ApcE, were reported to be involved in state transition (14Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 169-179Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Emlyn-Jones D. Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the factors on PSI side have not been reported. Here, we reported for the first time that PsaK2, a subunit of PSI, is a factor that regulates the energy transfer from phycobilisome to PSI under high light condition. Cyanobacterial PsaK subunit of PSI has weak homology with both PsaK and PsaG of higher plant PSI (18Kjaerulff S. Andersen B. Nielsen V.S. Mϕller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of higher plant PSI revealed that PsaK and PsaG are located on the outer edge of PSI complex and may serve for the association of light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) with core complex (30Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Because the place for PsaG is open in the crystal structure of cyanobacterial PSI (17Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar), it is tempting to assume that PsaK2 expressed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 occupies the place for PsaG in higher plants under high light condition. Although energy transfer studies imply that phycobilisome can interact with PSI and transfer energy efficiently to PSI, in structure terms we know little about the direct association of phycobilisome with thylakoid membrane or with reaction centers. PsaK2 might become a clue to the elucidation of the interaction of phycobilisome with PSI in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In higher plants and green algae, state transition is induced by the dissociation of LHCII from PSII complex. The redox state of the plastoquinone pool controls the activation of the thylakoid kinase responsible for phosphorylation of LHCII proteins (4Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The binding of LHCII to PSI requires PSI-H, PSI-I, PSI-L, or PSI-O (31Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 32Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Zhang S. Scheller H.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3180-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that the docking sites for LHCII in PSI might be PSI-H, PSI-I, and PSI-L. Although the absence of PSI-G or PSI-K also indirectly retards state transition to some extent (33Zhang S. Schller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3180-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2798-2803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the main function of these two subunits seems to be related to the binding of LHCI judging from the crystal structure of PSI (30Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Apparently, The PsaK/G proteins serving for state transition in cyanobacteria are recruited for the binding of LHCI in higher plants and PsaH protein is newly evolved for LHCII-type state transition of higher plants (31Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although SDS-PAGE analysis clearly showed the increase of PsaK2 subunit in PSI under high light condition, whether PsaK1 decreased under high light condition or not is unclear from the silver-stained gel presented in Fig. 1. At present, we could not deny the possibility that PsaK2 protein was incorporated to PSI complexes in place of PsaK1 protein. In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, high light induces the interchange between two forms (D1:1 and D1:2) of D1 protein, a reaction center subunit of PSII. D1:1 is predominant under low light condition, and D1:2 increases during acclimation to high light (36Clarke A.K. Campbell D. Gustafsson P. Öquist G. Planta. 1995; 197: 553-562Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutant defective in the gene encoding D1:2 is sensitive to photoinhibition because of the failure to exchange D1:1 for D1:2 (37Krupa Z. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Physiol. Plant. 1991; 82: 1-8Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A similar interchange of two PsaK subunits might be induced upon high light acclimation also in PSI. In any event, the incorporation of PsaK2 subunit into PSI complex is essential for the proper regulation of state transition under high light condition. The growth of the psaK2 mutant was severely suppressed under high light condition compared with the wild type and the psaK1 mutant (Fig. 2B). The result clearly indicates that state transition has the physiological importance under high light condition. It was reported that the mutant incapable of state transition under relatively low light condition could grow even under the light of specific quality such as yellow light, albeit at the reduced rate (15Emlyn-Jones D. Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The situation may be totally different for the high light condition, and the proper state transition mediated by PsaK2 is essential for the growth under high light condition. It must be noted that previously identified regulatory factors are all involved in the light quality-induced state transition. To our knowledge, PsaK2 is the only factor that regulates state transition under high light condition. Interestingly, no differences in state transition between the wild type and the psaK2 mutant were observed under low light condition (Fig. 5). This implies that at least two kinds of mechanisms for state transition might exist, such as light quality and light quantity or low light- and high light-dependent state transition. Under low light or biased light (PSII or PSI light) condition, RpaC-dependent state transition might enable the effective distribution of energy between PSII and PSI in order to perform photosynthesis as maximally as possible. Under high light condition, PsaK2-dependent state transition might allow cells to be protected against the photodamage. It seems that PsaK2-dependent state transition is the only mechanism of state transition under high light condition. On the other hand, the psaK2rpaC double mutant retained small but significant state transition under low light condition (data not shown). Thus, there must be the third mechanism of state transition under low light condition independent of psaK2 or rpaC. Although the rpaC mutant could not perform state transition upon phycobilisome excitation, the wild type and the mutant did show some kind of regulation of energy transfer from PSII to PSI under chlorophyll excitation (15Emlyn-Jones D. Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Small but significant state transition observed in the psaK2rpaC double mutant under low light condition may be ascribed to this chlorophyll-dependent state transition, because we used the actinic light absorbed by both phycobilin and chlorophyll a. The mechanism of state transition revealed in this study is not specific to Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, because at least two other cyanobacterial species also have both the psaK1-type and the psaK2-type genes in their genome (Fig. 6). Interestingly, Nostoc punctiforme has only the PsaK1-type gene and T. elongatus BP-1 has only the PsaK2-type gene in their genomes as far as we searched in CyanoBase. Marine cyanobacteria such as Prochlorococcus marinus or Synechococcus WH 8102 have unique psaK that is more or less similar to PsaK1 type (Fig. 7). The regulatory mechanism of state transition in these species must be examined in near future. We thank to Dr. H. Nakamoto (Saitama University) for the gift of plasmid designed for the destruction of psaK1 gene. We are grateful to Dr. Mitsuhiro Abe for technical advice in mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2042452740,"Cdc42, a Ras-related GTP-binding protein, has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, cell-cycle progression, and malignant transformation. We have shown previously that a Cdc42 mutant (Cdc42(F28L)), capable of spontaneously exchanging GDP for GTP (referred to as “fast-cycling”), transformed NIH 3T3 cells because of its ability to interfere with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Cbl interactions and EGFR down-regulation. To further examine the link between the hyperactivation of Cdc42 and its ability to alter EGFR signaling and thereby cause cellular transformation, we examined the effects of expressing different forms of the Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, intersectin-L, in fibroblasts. Full-length intersectin-L exhibited little ability to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Cdc42, whereas a truncated version that contained five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains (DH and PH domains, respectively), and a C2 domain (designated as SH3A-C2) showed modest guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, whereas a form containing just the DH, PH, and C2 domains (DH-C2) strongly activated Cdc42. However, DH-C2 showed little ability to stimulate growth in low serum or colony formation in soft agar, whereas SH3A-C2 gave rise to a much stronger stimulation of cell growth in low serum and was highly effective in stimulating colony formation. Moreover, although SH3A-C2 strongly transformed fibroblasts, it differed from the actions of the Cdc42(F28L) mutant, as SH3A-C2 showed little ability to alter EGFR levels or the lifetime of EGF-coupled signaling through ERK. Rather, we found that SH3A-C2 exhibited strong transforming activity through its ability to mediate cooperation between Ras and Cdc42.

Cdc42 is a Ras-related GTP-binding protein that functions in a wide range of cellular activities. Like other members of the Rho subfamily, Cdc42 was first implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeletal architecture. In particular, the microinjection of activated forms of Cdc42 caused filopodia formation and the generation of microspikes, whereas activated Rac1 stimulated the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffling, and activated RhoA promoted actin stress fibers (1Ridley A.J.

However, subsequently, a number of lines of evidence have also implicated Cdc42, as well as other Rho-family proteins, in the control of normal cell growth and, when aberrantly regulated, in tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of Cdc42, as well as Rac1 and RhoA, is essential for Ras-induced malignant transformation (14Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 15Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently obtained some important insights into the mechanistic basis by which fast-cycling mutants of Cdc42 transform fibroblasts (17Wu W.-J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, we discovered that cells expressing Cdc42(F28L) exhibited significantly higher levels of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) compared with control fibroblasts and showed a markedly extended lifetime for EGFR-coupled signaling. These observations demonstrated the ability of activated Cdc42 to negatively regulate the interactions of the EGFR with one of its binding partners, the adaptor protein c-Cbl. Various lines of evidence have shown that the degradation of EGFRs occurs via a cascade of ubiquitination enzymes that culminates in the E3 ligase activity catalyzed by c-Cbl (18Levkowitz G.

Activated forms of Cdc42, by associating with the p85Cool-1/β-Pix protein, a Cbl-binding partner, are able to sequester c-Cbl away from the EGFR. This prevents the EGFR from phosphorylating Cbl, which has been suggested to activate its E3 ligase activity (19Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Because the fast-cycling Cdc42(F28L) mutant is constitutively active, it is able to persistently inhibit EGFR-Cbl interactions, thereby leading to a significant reduction in receptor degradation. This, in turn, causes EGFRs to accumulate and exhibit sustained signaling, resulting in cellular transformation. These findings raised the question of whether the negative regulation of EGFR degradation was a general feature of Cdc42-mediated cell growth control and cellular transformation. We were especially interested in seeing whether activated Dbl family GEFs that were specific for Cdc42 led to the same effects on EGFR lifetime and signaling as the fast-cycling Cdc42(F28L) mutant. To address this question, we examined the cellular effects of different forms of intersectin-L, a Cdc42-specific GEF (22Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We thought that intersectin-L would be especially interesting to study in the context of possible effects on EGFR degradation because a shorter splice variant form of the protein, designated intersectin-S, has been implicated in endocytosis (23Hussain N.K. Yamabhai M. Ramjaun A.R. Guy A.M. Baranes D. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 22: 15671-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, the overexpression of intersectin-S has been shown to exhibit weak transforming activity, perhaps in part because of a disruption of the normal endocytosis of growth factor receptors and because of a reported ability to input into the Ras-signaling pathway via an interaction with the Ras-GEF, Sos (Son-of-sevenless) (24Mohney R.P. Das M. Bivona T.G. Hanes R. Adams A.G. Philips M.R. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47038-47045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, in an attempt to directly correlate the activation of Cdc42 by intersectin-L with cellular transformation, we have compared the abilities of different versions of intersectin-L to act as Cdc42-GEFs. However, unexpectedly, we found that the most potent transforming activity was induced by an intersectin-L construct that only moderately activated Cdc42, whereas a form of intersectin-L that more strongly activated Cdc42 was less effective in transforming fibroblasts. Maximal transformation by intersectin-L required its ability to activate both Cdc42 and Ras. Unlike the case for fast-cycling Cdc42(F28L), transformation by intersectin-L was not the result of significant changes in EGFR levels or signaling to ERK but, rather, required the combined effects of Ras and Cdc42 to signal to the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Overall, these results provide an interesting example of how Cdc42 can cooperate with Ras to elicit cellular transformation through signaling pathways that are distinct from those used by fast-cycling Cdc42 mutants. Reagents—EGF and the inhibitors for PI3K (LY294002), JNK (SP600125), and ERK (PD98059), were all purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibody to Sos1 and monoclonal antibody to H-Ras were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies to HA and Myc were obtained from Covance. Phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines—Mouse intersectin-L was a gift from Dr. Sean E. Egan (The University of Toronto), and the plasmid encoding HA-tagged Ras was obtained from Dr. John P. O'Bryan (National Institutes of Health). Myc-tagged SH3A-C2 and DH-C2 were generated by PCR using wild-type intersectin-L as a template. These two constructs were subcloned into the KpnI and NotI sites of pcDNA3 and into the SmalI and KpnI sites of the pJ4H mammalian expression vector for transient and stable expression, respectively. SH3A-C2(E1237A), which contains a single point mutation in the DH domain, and SH3A-C2(WS), which contains point mutations at the conserved tryptophan residues 777 and 1031 in the SH3A and SH3C domains, respectively, were produced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For selection of stable cell lines, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Neo, together with pJ4H-intersectin-L, pJ4H-SH3A-C2, pJ4H-DH-C2, pJ4H-SH3A-C2(WS), or pJ4H-SH3A-C2(E1237A). Transfected cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum and 700 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 10–14 days, G418-resistant colonies were selected. Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). COS-7 or HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, plasmid DNA was introduced into NIH 3T3, COS-7, or HEK 293 cells using the Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml of aprotinin. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, incubated with Myc antibody for 2 h, and then incubated with protein G beads for 1 h. The denatured samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Low Serum, Saturation Density, and Soft Agar Assays—For low serum assays, stable cell lines were plated at a density of 105 cells in 12-well dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. After 5 h, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 1% calf serum and then changed every other day for 6 days. At the indicated times, the cells were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer. For the saturation density assays, 105 cells were seeded in 12-well dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. The medium was changed every other day for 6 days, and then the cell density was determined by counting the cells, as described above, on day 6. For the soft agar assays, 104 cells stably expressing the different constructs were mixed with DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.3% agarose and plated on top of a solidified layer of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% agarose and 10% calf serum. Cells were fed weekly by adding 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.3% agarose. After 2 weeks, colonies larger than 50 μm were scored. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells were plated on dual chamber microscope slides (Nalge Nunc) in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum for 24 h and then transfected with 1 μg of plasmid encoding SH3A-C2 and SH3A-C2(E1237A) using Lipofectamine. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde plus 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Rhodamine phalloidin was used to detect actin, and Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was used to detect Myc-tagged SH3A-C2 and Myc-SH3A-C2(E1237A). [3H]GDP Dissociation Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged intersectin-L, SH3A-C2, SH3A-C2(E1237A), and DH-C2. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in mammalian cell lysis buffer. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and then incubated with protein G beads for 1 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated complex was incubated with 1 μg of Cdc42 preloaded with [3H]GDP in 140 μl of reaction buffer at room temperature, and aliquots (23 μl) were diluted into 1.5 ml of ice-cold termination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at various time points. The percent [3H]GDP remaining on the filters was detected by scintillation counting. Assaying the Cellular Activation of Cdc42 and Ras—To assay the cellular activation of Cdc42, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNAs encoding Myc-Cdc42, together with either Myc-tagged intersectin-L, SH3A-C2, or DH-C2. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in mammalian cell lysis buffer and incubated with 40 μg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PBD (for p21-binding domain from PAK). The GST-PBD was precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads, and the beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies. When assaying the cellular activation of Ras, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding HA-Ras together with different forms of Myc-SH3A-C2 or the vector control. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were starved overnight and then, in some cases, stimulated with EGF for 5 min. The cell lysates were incubated with 40 μg of recombinant GST-Raf-RBD (for Ras-binding domain). The GST-RBD was precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads, similar to GST-PBD, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Analysis of Akt, JNK, and ERK Activation—NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L), SH3A-C2, SH3A-C2(WS), SH3A-C2(E1237A), and vector control were seeded on 100 mm plates. Following an overnight incubation in serum-free media, cells were stimulated with EGF for 5 min or were untreated, and then the cell lysates were harvested. Equivalent amounts of protein (∼80 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, using phospho-Akt, phospho-JNK, or phospho-ERK antibodies. Comparisons of the Abilities of Different Forms of Intersectin-L to Activate Cdc42—It was reported previously that intersectin-L functions as a specific GEF for Cdc42 (22Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As a first step toward developing a correlation between the extent of Cdc42 activation and its ability to transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, we assayed the Cdc42-GEF activities of different forms of intersectin-L. In particular, the GEF activity of full-length intersectin-L, which contains two EH domains, five SH3 domains, DH and PH domains, and a C2 domain (Fig. 1, ITSN-L) was compared with those of a shorter version (SH3A-C2), which is composed of the five SH3 domains and everything downstream, and a still shorter form that simply contains the DH, PH, and C2 domains (DH-C2). These different intersectin-L constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells as Myc-tagged proteins, immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2A, bottom panel), and then assayed for their abilities to stimulate the exchange of [3H]GDP for GTPγSon Escherichia coli recombinant Cdc42, as monitored by the dissociation of [3H]GDP from the GTP-binding protein. The results presented in Fig. 2A (top panel) show that the DH-C2 construct exhibited the strongest GEF activity, whereas SH3A-C2 showed moderate activity, and full-length intersectin-L (designated Myc-Intersectin in Fig. 2A, top panel, and Myc-ITSN in Fig. 2A, bottom panel) was completely inactive. These results are consistent with the idea that full-length intersectin-L is susceptible to an autoinhibition, perhaps because the SH3 domains fold over and block access to the DH domain (25Zammanian J.L. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1624-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Intersectin-L constructs activate Cdc42.A, comparison of the GEF activities of SH3A-C2 and DH-C2 using an in vitro nucleotide exchange assay. Myc-tagged full-length intersectin-L (Myc-Intersectin, top panel; Myc-ITSN, bottom panel) and the other indicated Myc-tagged constructs were immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated protein was incubated with 1 μg of His-Cdc42 preloaded with [3H]GDP in an assay incubation containing excess GTPγS to monitor [3H]GDP-GTPγS exchange. The percentage of [3H]GDP remaining bound to Cdc42 was determined following filtration, using a scintillation counter. B, assays for detecting Cdc42 activation in cells. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNAs encoding GTPase-defective, Myc-tagged Cdc42(Q61L) or with the indicated Myc-tagged intersectin-L constructs together with Myc-tagged (wild-type) Cdc42. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-PBD and precipitated with agarose beads as described under “Materials and Methods.” Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody was performed to detect GTP-bound Cdc42 (top panel) that co-precipitated with GST-PBD (second panel). Total cell lysates were blotted with anti-Myc antibody to compare the relative expression of Cdc42 (third panel) and the different intersectin-L constructs (bottom panel). WCL, whole cell lysate. ITSN, full-length intersectin-L; IP, immunoprecipitate. C, actin cytoskeletal staining in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the indicated constructs. Actin was detected using rhodamine phalloidin (red), whereas the indicated intersectin-L constructs were detected using anti-Myc antibody (green).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined whether the different forms of intersectin-L showed the same relative abilities to activate Cdc42 in cells. We performed this examination using an assay that takes advantage of the binding of activated Cdc42 to the Cdc42 limit-binding domain from the Cdc42/Rac target, PAK3, fused to GST (GST-PBD). The different forms of Myc-tagged intersectin-L were expressed together with Myc-tagged Cdc42 in COS-7 cells, and the relative abilities of the intersectin-L constructs to promote the activation of Myc-Cdc42 were compared by incubating lysates from the different transfectants with GST-PBD followed by precipitation with glutathione-agarose. Fig. 2B (top panel) shows the results of the PBD assays, while the other panels show the amounts of GST-PBD used in the different experiments and the relative expression of Myc-Cdc42 and the different Myc-tagged intersectin-L constructs in whole cell lysates. Similar to the results obtained from the in vitro nucleotide exchange assays (Fig. 2A), the DH-C2 construct was the most effective at stimulating Cdc42 activation in cells. In fact, the extent of Cdc42 activation promoted by DH-C2 yielded a signal in the PBD assay that was comparable with the positive control obtained from cells expressing constitutively active, GTPase-defective Myc-Cdc42(Q61L). The SH3A-C2 construct gave rise to a weaker cellular activation of Cdc42, whereas full-length intersectin-L was again ineffective at activating Cdc42. When we compared the abilities of the different forms of intersectin-L to stimulate the formation of microspikes in NIH 3T3 cells, we were not able to distinguish between SH3A-C2 and DH-C2, as both constructs induced this phenotype in the majority of cells examined. Fig. 2C (upper left panel) shows a representative example for cells expressing SH3A-C2. Expression of full-length intersectin-L did not induce these cellular changes (not shown). This suggests that although Cdc42 is less effectively activated by SH3A-C2 compared with DH-C2, the SH3A-C2 construct is able to stimulate sufficient activation of the endogenous Cdc42, such that complete microspike formation is observed. For the case of the founding member of the Dbl family (i.e. oncogenic Dbl), it has been shown that changing glutamic acid 502 to an alanine yields a Dbl protein that is still capable of binding to Cdc42 but is unable to stimulate nucleotide exchange (26Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments indicate that glutamic acid 1237 within the DH domain of intersectin-L corresponds to glutamic acid 502 in oncogenic Dbl. When we changed glutamic acid 1237 in the intersectin-L proteins to alanine, we completely eliminated their ability to exhibit Cdc42-GEF activity. This is demonstrated for SH3A-C2 both in the in vitro nucleotide exchange assay (Fig. 2A) and when monitoring microspike formation (Fig. 2C, upper right panel). As expected (and as will be discussed further below), mutating conserved tryptophan residues to serines within the SH3 domains (e.g. SH3A and SH3C, designated SH3A-C2(WS)) had no effect on Cdc42-GEF activity (see Fig. 2A). Comparisons of the Abilities of Different Forms of Intersectin-L to Induce Cellular Transformation—Given the distinct capabilities exhibited by the different forms of intersectin-L to promote the activation of Cdc42, we were interested in whether they showed the same relative abilities to induce the transformation of fibroblasts. Cell lines stably expressing each of the intersectin-L constructs were generated and analyzed for their ability to grow under different conditions (Western blots of the different constructs are shown in Fig. 3A, lower panel; H and L denote different cell lines exhibiting higher or lower stable expression, respectively, of a particular construct). The upper panel in Fig. 3A shows the results of cell growth assays performed in low serum. As reported previously, NIH 3T3 cells expressing the constitutively active, fast-cycling Cdc42(F28L) mutant were extremely effective at growing in low serum (7Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas control fibroblasts were unable to grow under these conditions. Fig. 3B demonstrates the striking difference in morphology between cells expressing Cdc42(F28L) versus the vector control in low serum conditions. However, surprisingly, we found that cells expressing SH3A-C2 were significantly more effective in their ability to grow in low serum and exhibited a more pronounced transformed appearance compared with cells expressing DH-C2, despite the fact that the latter construct was much better at stimulating Cdc42 activation. Similar results were obtained when examining the relative ability of the intersectin-L constructs to enable fibroblasts to increase their saturation density and to form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3, C–E). In each case, SH3A-C2 elicited a stronger transforming phenotype than DH-C2, with the extent of transformation being dependent on the relative levels of expression of SH3A-C2. However, interestingly, SH3A-C2 was even more effective than the Cdc42(F28L) mutant in stimulating colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 3D). The latter assay has been regarded typically as the most reliable indicator of malignant transformation. Given that SH3A-C2 was only moderately effective at stimulating Cdc42 activation in cells (i.e. compared with DH-C2), this then raised the question of how it was able to potently transform fibroblasts. What Are the Downstream Signals Necessary for SH3A-C2-induced Cellular Transformation?—We had shown previously that an essential aspect of Cdc42(F28L)-induced cellular transformation is the sustained signaling by EGFRs because of activated Cdc42 interfering with EGFR-Cbl interactions (17Wu W.-J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, whereas the stable expression of Cdc42(F28L) in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in EGF-stimulated ERK activation that was still detected after 2 h (Fig. 4A, top panel), cells expressing SH3A-C2 showed the transient profile for EGF-stimulated ERK activation typical of control cells, such that the stimulation of ERK activity was no longer detectable within 15–30 min of treatment with the growth factor (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Moreover, although Cdc42(F28L)-induced cellular transformation, as assayed by the ability of fibroblasts to grow in low serum, was completely blocked by inhibiting ERK activation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, SH3A-C2-stimulated growth in low serum was unaffected by treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 4B). These results clearly demonstrated that transformation by SH3A-C2 proceeded through a mechanism di"

An about 12-base-pair stem, a T loop-like structure, and a 3′-trailer were considered to be the minimum requirements for recognition by the long form (tRNase ZL) of tRNase Z; tRNase ZL can recognize and cleave a micro-pre-tRNA or a hooker/target RNA complex that resembles a micro-pre-tRNA. We examined four hook RNAs containing systematically weakened T stems for directing target RNA cleavage by tRNase ZL. As expected, the cleavage efficiency decreased with the decrease in T stem stability, and to our surprise, even the hook RNA that forms no T stem-loop-directed slight cleavage of the target RNA, suggesting that the T stem-loop structure is important but dispensable for substrate recognition by tRNase ZL. To analyze the effect of the T loop on substrate recognition, we compared the cleavage reaction for a micro-pre-tRNA with that for a 12-base-pair double-stranded RNA, which is the same as the micro-pre-tRNA except for the lack of the T loop structure. The observed rate constant value for the double-stranded RNA was comparable with that for the micro-pre-tRNA, whereas the Kd value for the complex with the double-stranded RNA was much higher than that for the complex with the micro-pre-tRNA. These results suggest that the T loop structure is not indispensable for the recognition, although the interaction between the T loop and the enzyme exists. Cleavage assays for such double-stranded RNA substrates of various lengths suggested that tRNase ZL can recognize and cleave double-stranded RNA substrates that are longer than 5 base pairs and shorter than 20 base pairs.

These enzymes are responsible for the removal of 3′-trailers from pre-tRNAs (Fig. 1A), which are transcribed as larger forms. In vitro tRNA 3′-processing assays have shown that in most cases, the enzymes cleave pre-tRNAs immediately downstream of a discriminator nucleotide, onto which the CCA residues are added to produce mature tRNA in vivo, whereas in some cases, additional cleavages occur 1 nt upstream or 1 or 2 nt downstream (7Castano J.G.

As an exceptional case, tRNase Z from Thermotoga maritima cleaves pre-tRNAs containing the 74CCA76 sequence precisely after the A76 residue to create the mature CCA 3′-termini of tRNA molecules (5Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Bacterial and archaeal genomes contain a gene for the short form of tRNase Z only, whereas eukaryote genomes encode either only the long form or both the short and long forms (15Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half region of tRNase ZL has high similarity to the whole region of tRNase ZS (1Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y.

Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). These regions contain a well conserved histidine motif, which has been shown to be essential for the tRNase Z activity in the T. maritima enzyme (5Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The facts that tRNase ZL is ∼2-fold larger than tRNase ZS and that it has the extra N-terminal region that is dispensable for the RNA cleaving catalytic reaction suggest that the long form might have additional functions. Indeed, tRNase ZL can function as a four-base-recognizing RNA cutter (RNase 65) through a relatively stable complex between the enzyme and a 3′-truncated tRNA (Fig. 1B), although little is known about the physiological role and substrate of RNase 65 (16Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4696-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3642-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The long forms of tRNase Z show further versatility in substrate recognition (18Nashimoto M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 523-534PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nashimoto M. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). tRNase ZL can recognize and cleave a micro-pre-tRNA, a heptamer/target or hooker/target RNA complex that resembles a micro-pre-tRNA, as well as a pre-tRNA-like complex of 5′-half-tRNA and 3′-half-tRNA (Fig. 1, C-F). This property of tRNase ZL suggested that generally, the enzyme can cleave any RNA at any site with the aid of appropriate small guide RNA (sgRNA), and indeed, we have shown this by examining various RNA complexes in vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the efficacy of this specific RNA targeting method in the living cells by introducing sgRNAs either as their expression plasmids or as 2′-O-methyl RNAs (22Tamura M. Nashimoto C. Miyake N. Daikuhara Y. Ochi K. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4354-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In vitro tRNase ZL cleavage assays for various RNA substrates suggested that micro-pre-tRNAs or micro-pre-tRNA-like complexes are the smallest substrates (Fig. 1, D-F); that is, an about 12-base-pair stem, a T loop-like structure, and a 3′-trailer are the minimum requirements for tRNase ZL recognition (19Nashimoto M. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Nashimoto M.

Although we have shown that several double-stranded RNA substrates are recognized and cleaved by tRNase ZL, this has been attributed to the formation of alternative conformers that look like pre-tRNAs retaining the T loop-like structures (20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we further investigated whether or not the T loop structure is really needed for substrate recognition by tRNase ZL and elucidated that the T loop structure is not indispensable. We also showed that tRNase ZL can recognize and cleave double-stranded RNA substrates that are longer than 5 base pairs and shorter than 20 base pairs. In this report, we refer to double-stranded RNA containing a 3′-trailer as double-stranded RNA. Preparation of Various tRNase Z Proteins—Pig tRNase ZL was intensively fractionated from liver through several column chromatography procedures and further purified by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation as described before (3Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Nashimoto M. Nashimoto C. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Ochi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The recombinant human tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS were overexpressed from the pTYB11 expression plasmids (New England Biolabs) in Escherichia coli and purified with chitin beads as described previously (3Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The recombinant tRNase ZS from T. maritima were produced from the pQE expression plasmids (Qiagen) in E. coli and purified with nickel-agarose as described (5Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RNA Synthesis—The micro-pre-tRNA MPTR1, six target RNAs (“T-” series), and 28 sgRNAs were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) from the corresponding synthetic DNA templates. The sequences of these RNAs are as follows: MPTR1, 5′-GGGCCAGCCAGGUUCGACUCCUGGCUGGCUCGGUGUAUUU-3′; T-1, 5′-GAAUACGCAUGCUAGCACUGGCCCGGUGAAAGCUUGAUGU-3′; T-2, 5′-GAGAAUGCUGCCGGGCUCGCGGAUUU-3′; T-3, 5′-GAAUACGCAUGCUAGCAUGCUGCCGGUGAAAGCUUGAUGU-3′; T-4, 5′-GAAUACGUCAUGCUACAGUCCUGCCAGAACAUGCUGACCUAGGAUCGAU-3′; T-5, 5′-GGGCGAAUUGGGUACCGGGCCCCCCCUCGAGGUCGACGGUAUCGAUAAGCUUGAUAUCGAAUUCCUGCAGCCCGGGGGAUCCACUAGUUCUAGAGCGGCC-3′; T-6, 5′-GCCUGGCUGGCUCGGUGUAUUU-3′; T1Hep, 5′-GGGCCAG-3′; T1H0, 5′-GGGCCAGAACUGUUCGACUCCUGG-3′; T1H3, 5′-GGGCCAGAAAGGUUCGACUCCUGG-3′; T1H4, 5′-GGGCCAGACAGGUUCGACUCCUGG-3′; T1H5, 5′-GGGCCAGCCAGGUUCGACUCCUGG-3′; T2L5, 5′-GGCAG-3′; T2L6, 5′-GGCAGC-3′; T2L7, 5′-GGCAGCA-3′; T2L8, 5′-GGCAGCAU-3′; T2L9, 5′-GGCAGCAUU-3′; T2L10, 5′-GGCAGCAUUU-3′; T2L11, 5′-GGCAGCAUUUU-3′; T2L12, 5′-GGCAGCAUUUUC-3′; T3L11, 5′-GCUAGCAUGCG-3′; T3L12, 5′-GCUAGCAUGCGU-3′; T3L13, 5′-GCUAGCAUGCGUA-3′; T3L14, 5′-GCUAGCAUGCGUAU-3′; T3L16, 5′-GCUAGCAUGCGUAUUC-3′; T4L12, 5′-GUUCUGGCAGGA-3′; T4L-16, 5′-GUUCUGGCAGGACUGU-3′; T4L18, 5′-GUUCUGGCAGGACUGUAG-3′; T4L20, 5′-GUUCUGGCAGGACUGUAGCA-3′; T4L25, 5′-GUUCUGGCAGGACUGUAGCAUGACG-3′; T4L30, 5′-GUUCUGGCAGGACUGUAGCAUGACGUAUUC-3′; T5L1, 5′-GACCUCGAGGG-3′; T5L2, 5′-GAUAUCAAGCU-3′; T5L3, 5′-GUGGAUCCCCC-3′; T6L1, 5′-GGGCCAGCCAGG-3′. The transcription reactions were carried out under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Takara Shuzo), and the transcribed RNAs were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The RNA transcripts for MPTR1 and the six target RNAs were subsequently labeled with fluorescein according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences) (5Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the removal of the 5′-phosphates of the transcribed RNAs with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo), the RNAs were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo) and ATPγS. Then a single fluorescein moiety was appended onto the 5′-phosphorothioate site. The resulting fluorescein-labeled RNAs were gel-purified before assays. In Vitro RNA Cleavage Assays—The in vitro RNA cleavage assays for the fluorescein-labeled MPTR1 were performed with tRNase ZL in a mixture (6 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.3 mm MgCl2 (15Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The in vitro cleavage assays for the fluorescein-labeled target RNAs were carried out in the presence of the unlabeled sgRNAs using various tRNase Zs under the same conditions as above (15Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After resolution of the reaction products on a 10 or 20% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel, the gel was analyzed with a Typhoon 9210 (Amersham Biosciences). Gel-shift Analysis for Kd Determination—To determine the dissociation constant of the double-stranded RNA T6L1/T-6, the fluorescein-labeled T-6 (1.6 pmol) was incubated with the sgRNA T6L1 (4 pmol) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture (6 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.3 mm MgCl2. After incubation, the sample was mixed with the same volume of a loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, 50% glycerol) and electrophoresed on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with TBE buffer (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). After electrophoresis, the labeled RNAs were quantitated with the Typhoon 9210. Likewise, the dissociation constants of the tRNase ZL/substrate complexes were measured by the gel-shift assays (24Nashimoto M. Nashimoto C. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Ochi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The fluorescein-labeled micro-pre-tRNA MPTR1 or double-stranded RNA T6L1/T-6 (1.6 pmol) was incubated with various amounts of pig tRNase ZL in the above buffer at 4 °C for 10 min and analyzed in the same way as above. The T Stem/Loop Structure Is Important but Dispensable for Substrate Recognition by tRNase ZL—We have shown how important the T stem-loop structure is for substrate recognition by tRNase ZL by analyzing heptamer-directed cleavages of the 3′-half-tRNAsArg containing systematically weakened T stems (19Nashimoto M. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this analysis, we have observed that the cleavage efficiencies decrease with the decrease in the T stem stability, and we have not been able to detect any cleavage of the 3′-half-tRNAArg with no T stem. To corroborate these observations, we examined four hook RNAs, T1H5, T1H4, T1H3, T1H0, containing systematically weakened T stems for directing target RNA cleavage by tRNase ZL (Fig. 2A). This series of the T stems was the same as that used in the heptamer-directed RNA cleavage assays. As expected, the target RNA T-1 was most efficiently cleaved by tRNase ZL in the presence of T1H5, and the cleavage efficiency decreased with the decrease in the T stem stability (Fig. 2B). The cleavage took place after a nucleotide corresponding to the discriminator. To our surprise, even T1H0, which had no T stem, directed slight cleavage of the target RNA. Furthermore, tRNase ZL cut the target slightly in the presence of the RNA heptamer T1Hep corresponding to the 5′-portion of the acceptor stem. These results suggest that the T stem-loop structure is important but dispensable for substrate recognition by tRNase ZL. The discrepancy between this and previous results may be because of the difference in the assay conditions; this analysis was performed in the presence of 3.3 mm MgCl2 instead of 3.3 mm spermidine. We found that generally, spermidine is much less effective in supporting tRNase ZL cleavage reactions than Mg2+ (Supplemental Fig. 1). The T Loop Is Dispensable—We were curious about which portion of the T stem/loop is important for the tRNase ZL activity. A previous study has shown that several double-stranded RNA substrates are recognizable by tRNase ZL (20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this case, however, formation of alternative conformers that look like pre-tRNAs retaining the T loop-like structures appears to be required. On the other hand, it has been shown that micro-pre-tRNAs lacking distal base pairings of the T stem are not substrates (23Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the T stem may be more important for substrate recognition by tRNase ZL than the T loop. To address this issue more precisely, we compared the cleavage reaction for a micro-pre-tRNA with that for a 12-base-pair double-stranded RNA, which is the same as the micro-pre-tRNA except for the lack of the T loop structure (Fig. 3A). The micro-pre-tRNA MPTR1 was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase and 5′-end-labeled with fluorescein. Both strands of the double-stranded RNA were separately transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, and only the target RNA strand T-6 was 5′-end-labeled with fluorescein and annealed with the unlabeled sgRNA strand T6L1. Time course assays showed that there is no significant difference in cleavage efficiency between both substrates (Fig. 3B). Although pig tRNase ZL was used to compare these data with previous data, which have shown that the cleavage efficiency of the micro-pre-tRNA is comparable with that of a natural full-length pre-tRNA (23Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), similar results were also obtained using recombinant human tRNase ZL (data not shown). As expected, each cleavage occurred primarily after a nucleotide corresponding to the discriminator (Fig. 3B). The reason why a simple double-stranded RNA was not cleaved by tRNase ZL in the previous study (20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) would be because spermidine was used instead of Mg2+ as mentioned above. We tried to determine the kinetic parameters Km and kcat for the reaction of the double-stranded RNA, but reliable values were not obtained due to large standard deviations. Thus, we measured the observed rate constant kobs for each reaction under single turnover conditions instead of Km and kcat. First, we determined the dissociation constant of the double-stranded RNA by gel-shift analysis. Using this estimated Kd value (50 nm), we calculated an effective concentration of the double-stranded RNA substrate. The kobs value (0.013 min-1) for the double-stranded RNA T6L1/T-6 was comparable with the value (0.023 min-1) for the micro-pre-tRNA MPTR1 (Table I). Taken together, present and previous results suggest that the T loop structure is not indispensable for substrate recognition by tRNase ZL.Table IObserved rate constants and dissociation constants for tRNase ZLSubstratekobsaEach fluorescein-labeled substrate (1.6 pmol) was incubated with pig tRNase ZL (4.2 pmol) at 37 °C for 4 min.

The Kd value (420 nm) for the complex with the double-stranded RNA was 130-fold higher than that (3.2 nm) for the complex with the micro-pre-tRNA (Table I), indicating that the interaction between the T loop and the enzyme exists and helps make the enzyme/substrate complex. tRNase ZL Can Recognize and Cleave Double-stranded RNA Substrates That Are Longer than 5 Base Pairs and Shorter than 20 Base Pairs—To determine the minimum and maximum lengths of double-stranded RNA substrates that are recognizable and cleavable by tRNase ZL, we examined double-stranded RNA substrates of various lengths for tRNase ZL cleavage. The first series of the substrates was composed of the target T-2 and one of the eight sgRNAs T2L5-T2L12, which are complementary to T-2 (Fig. 4A). These substrates were assayed, and cleavage efficiencies were quantitated and plotted against the length of double-stranded RNA (Fig. 4, B and C). tRNase ZL cleaved the target T-2 with the aid of each sgRNA with the exception of T2L5, and the double-stranded RNA complexes with the longer sgRNAs were better substrates. In each case, the primary cleavage site was located after a nucleotide corresponding to the discriminator (Fig. 4B). In the second series, the target RNA T-3 was tested for tRNase ZL cleavage in the presence of the five sgRNAs T3L11, T3L12, T3L13, T3L14, and T3L16 (Fig. 5A). The cleavage efficiency increased with the increase in sgRNA length (Fig. 5, B and C). In the third set of substrates, 12-, 16-, 18-, 20-, 25-, and 30-base-pair RNAs were assayed using the target T-4 and the five sgRNAs, T4L12, T4L16, T4L18, T4L20, T4L25, and T4L30 (Fig. 6A). The 12-base-pair RNA substrate was cleaved relatively well, and the 16- and 18-base-pair substrates were barely cleaved (Fig. 6, B and C). The substrates longer than 18 base pairs were not substrates for tRNase ZL. In these series, cleavages occurred primarily after a nucleotide corresponding to the discriminator (Figs. 5B and 6B).Fig. 6The tRNase ZL reactions for T-4-containing double-stranded RNA substrates.A, secondary structures of the sgRNA/target RNA complexes T4L12-30/T-4. The last number of each sgRNA T4L12-30 denotes its nucleotide length, and its common and extended sequences are shown in capital and small red letters, respectively. An arrow indicates a cleavage site by tRNase ZL. B, pig tRNase ZL (2 pmol) was incubated with the fluorescein-labeled T-4 (2 pmol) in the absence or presence of 29 pmol of T4L12, T4L16, T4L18, T4L20, T4L25, or T4L30 at 52 °C for 15 min. The cleavage products were analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. The target and the primary 5′-cleavage product (5′ P) are indicated by a bar and an arrow, respectively. L denotes an alkaline ladder of the fluorescein-labeled T-4. Although a part of the ladder may not be viewed clearly, each band was visible from the original picture. The substrate band of the precise length among the 3′-heterogeneous transcript bands from the intrinsic property of T7 RNA polymerase was identified by comparison with a size standard. C, percentages of T-4 cleavages in the presence of the sgRNAs of various lengths are shown. Data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examination of another series of substrates composed of 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 15-, and 16-base-pair RNAs showed that the 12-base-pair RNA is the best substrate (Supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these results show that tRNase ZL can recognize and cleave double-stranded RNA substrates that are longer than 5 base pairs and shorter than 20 base pairs and that the enzyme is the most active for 12-16-base-pair RNAs. Simple Complementary RNA Molecules Can Be Used for Targeted RNA Cleavage by tRNase ZL—Because tRNase ZL can recognize and cleave long RNA targets of more than 300 nt in the presence of appropriate sgRNAs that form pre-tRNA-like complexes with the targets (20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we investigated whether a relatively long target can be cleaved with the aid of simple complementary RNA. A 100-nt RNA target, T-5, was assayed in the presence of the 11-nt sgRNAs T5L1, T5L2, and T5L3 for cleavage by tRNase ZL (Fig. 7A). The target was cleaved at the expected site in the presence of T5L1 or T5L3 (Fig. 7B). T5L2 guided cleavages at one expected site and at another unexpected site. The additional cleavage is most likely due to the presence of a partially complementary sequence to T5L2 in T-5. Indeed, the upstream sequence of the cleavage site was 82% complementary (Fig. 7A). These results suggest that simple complementary RNA can be used for targeted RNA cleavage by tRNase ZL, albeit with relatively low specificity. Double-stranded RNA Is Not a Substrate for the Short Form of tRNase Z—We examined whether the short form of tRNase Z can also recognize and cleave double-stranded RNA. The complex of the target T-2 with the sgRNA T2L12 (Fig. 8A) was tested for cleavage by tRNase ZSs from human and T. maritima. This 12-base-pair RNA was not cleaved at all by either tRNase ZS, whereas pig and human tRNase ZLs processed the substrate (Fig. 8B). The specific cleavages of the 8-base-pair RNA T2L8/T-2 and the 16-base-pair RNA T3L16/T-3 by T. maritima tRNase ZS were also not detected (Supplemental Fig. 3). These results suggest that double-stranded RNAs are not substrates for tRNase ZSs and that the N-terminal half of tRNase ZL may be required for recognition of double-stranded RNA. Consistently, tRNase ZSs cannot cleave the micro-pre-tRNA containing the T loop (15Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interaction of tRNase ZL with a Double-stranded RNA Substrate—Previously, we have shown that micro-pre-tRNAs or micro-pre-tRNA-like complexes, which consist of the T stem-loop and the acceptor stem plus a 3′-trailer, are the smallest substrates for tRNase ZL (19Nashimoto M. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Tamura M. Nashimoto C. Miyake N. Daikuhara Y. Ochi K. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4354-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this report, however, we found out that the T loop structure is important but not indispensable. Therefore, the genuine minimum substrate of tRNase ZL is considered to be composed of the T stem and the acceptor stem plus a 3′-trailer. The importance of the T loop structure for recognition is indicated by the much lower Kd value for the substrate with the T loop than for the substrate without the T loop. From the difference between these Kd values (Table I), we estimated the free energy ΔG for the enzyme/T loop interaction to be -2.7 kcal/mol. We guess that a couple of weak chemical bonds would be involved in this interaction. The double-stranded RNA substrates cleavable by tRNase ZL ranged from 6 to 18 base pairs, and the enzyme was the most active for 12-16-base-pair RNAs. The double-stranded RNA substrates less than 6 base pairs would be too small to stably bind to the enzyme, and those longer than 18 base pairs would be too long to fit the T stem end into the enzyme pocket. The double-stranded RNA substrates of 12-16 base pairs would be able to mimic micro-pre-tRNA most well especially at the end of the T stem. The reason why the 11-base-pair RNA substrate containing the 100-nt target strand was cleaved by tRNase ZL may be because the single strand RNA portion is floppy enough to avoid steric hindrance in the enzyme pocket, whereas the double-stranded RNA portion is too rigid to dodge the hindrance. Cleavage Site Selection in Double-stranded RNA Substrates—There exists a general rule for cleavage site selection by tRNase ZL with respect to full-length pre-tRNAs (11Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cleavage of pre-tRNAs containing a total of N base pairs (N < 12) in the acceptor stem and the T stem occurs after 12 - N and 13 - N nucleotides 3′ to the discriminator nucleotide, whereas cleavage of pre-tRNAs with a total of N base pairs (N ≥ 12) occurs after the discriminator. For example, the pre-tRNA R-ASD2 containing a total of 10 base pairs was cleaved after 2 and 3 nucleotides 3′ to the discriminator, and cleavage of the pre-tRNA R-ASA2 containing a total of 14 base pairs occurred after the discriminator (11Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This rule needs to be modified with respect to micro-pre-tRNAs containing a total of N base pairs (N < 12) (23Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cleavage occurs at multiple sites fluctuating between the discriminator nucleotide and 12 - N or 13 - N nucleotides 3′ to the discriminator. We have proposed a model to explain this difference, taking into account the presence of “bottom-half” tRNA (23Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Pre-tRNAs would be prevented from moving along the “top-half” tRNA binding domain on tRNase ZL due to the bottom-half tRNA constraints, whereas micro-pre-tRNAs would be able to slide along this domain. The cleavage site would change depending on the fashion of enzyme/substrate interaction. When the distal acceptor stem is located in the vicinity of the catalytic domain, the cleavage would occur after the discriminator nucleotide. On the other hand, when the T loop is arranged at its original binding domain, the cleavage would occur after 12 - N and 13 - N nucleotides 3′ to the discriminator. The present study showed that cleavages of the doublestranded RNA substrates occur primarily after the discriminator. This observation can be interpreted in the context of the above model; that is, the distal acceptor stem of doublestranded RNA would be preferentially arranged near the catalytic domain due to the lack of the T loop regardless of the N number. Cleavages of the RNA complexes T1H4/T-1 and T1H3/T-1, which contain the T loop but lack one or two proximal T stem base pairings, occur after the discriminator (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the previous observation that micro-pre-tRNAs containing proximal base pair disruptions behave like a substrate with 12 intact base pairs and that tRNase ZL can select the cleavage site in a fashion similar to that of their original micro-pre-tRNA (23Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An Extra Physiological Function of tRNase ZL?—The human genome contains both tRNase ZS and tRNase ZL genes, raising an interesting question of whether the short and long forms play different roles in the cells. One may be for nuclear tRNA processing, and the other may be for mitochondrial processing. Alternatively, tRNase ZL, which has the extra N-terminal region that is not essential for the RNA cleaving catalytic reaction, might have an additional role for some RNA metabolism. To elucidate their possible differential roles, we have recently investigated whether the long and short forms have different preferences for RNA substrates and have found that indeed tRNase ZL recognizes and cleaves a wider range of substrates than tRNase ZS and that this versatility is attributed to the N-terminal half domain of tRNase ZL (15Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in HeLa cells, tRNase ZL physically interacts with the γ-tubulin complex (25Korver W. Guevara C. Chen Y. Neuteboom S. Bookstein R. Tavtigian S. Lees E. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that tRNase ZL exists in cytoplasm as well as nuclei where the tRNA 3′-processing occurs. This ubiquity of tRNase ZL would extend its niches in cellular RNA metabolism. In this report, we demonstrated that tRNase ZL shows further versatility in substrate recognition; the enzyme can recognize and cleave double-stranded RNA substrates. Taken together, these observations support the notion that tRNase ZL may play extra roles in other cellular RNA metabolism. Although at present we do not have enough information to specify which other RNA metabolism tRNase ZL is involved in, tRNase ZL may work in the four different fashions as follows: (i) RNase 65 with the aid of 3′-truncated tRNAs (16Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4696-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3642-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), (ii) RNA cutters that recognize pre-tRNA-like complexes of targets with microRNAs (20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), (iii) 4-nt RNA cutters in the presence of hook RNAs (21Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and (iv) double-stranded RNA cutters with complementary sgRNAs. A huge number of microRNAs, the length of which is ∼21-23 nt, are found in mammalian cells (26Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28605) Google Scholar), and other small non-coding RNAs might also exist. These small RNA molecules could work as hook RNAs or complementary sgRNAs. Although human tRNase ZL is the product of the candidate prostate cancer gene ELAC2 (1Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. Farnham J.M. Frank D. Frye C. Ghaffari S. Gupte J.S. Hu R. Iliev D. Janecki T. Kort E.N. Laity K.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we have no information on how the mutations in the tRNase ZL gene can cause human prostate cancer. The tRNase ZL variants containing amino acid substitutions from such mutations show only trivial differences in both tRNA 3′-processing activity and RNase 65 activity (27Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Cancer Lett. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These trivial changes might be sufficient to alter the whole gene expression pattern in prostate cells to the cancerous state. Alternatively, activities of the other RNA cutters from tRNase ZL might be affected significantly by these mutations. Targeted Cleavage of Undesirable RNA by tRNase ZL with the Aid of 11-nt Complementary sgRNA—Mammalian tRNase ZL can cleave any RNA at any site under the direction of sgRNA in vitro (18Nashimoto M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 523-534PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nashimoto M. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Nashimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). sgRNAs can be as short as heptamers, which are much smaller than small interfering RNAs of ∼21 nt (19Nashimoto M. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Together with such flexibility in substrate recognition, the ubiquity and the constitutive expression of tRNase ZL have suggested that this enzyme can be utilized for specific cleavage of cellular RNAs by introducing appropriate sgRNAs into living cells. Indeed, the expression of exogenous and endogenous genes has been down-regulated by appropriate sgRNAs that were introduced into mammalian culture cells as expression plasmids or synthetic 2′-O-methyl RNAs (22Tamura M. Nashimoto C. Miyake N. Daikuhara Y. Ochi K. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4354-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The discovery that the 11-nt complementary sgRNA can direct tRNase ZL cleavage of the long RNA target may lead us to examine the efficacy of simple complementary sgRNA on down-regulation of cellular gene expressions. Although this type of sgRNA would also work in the cells, the present data suggest that its guiding efficiency and substrate specificity would be lower than those of sgRNA that can form complexes containing a T loop-like structure with target RNAs. Thus, we would prefer the latter type of sgRNA for destroying undesirable cellular RNAs. Download .pdf (.13 MB) Help with pdf files"

The synthetic prion peptide PrP106–126 shares many characteristics with PrPSc in that it shows PrPC-dependent neurotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, PrP106–126 in vitro neurotoxicity has been closely associated with the ability to form fibrils. Here, we studied the in vivo neurotoxicity of molecular variants of PrP106–126 toward retinal neurons using electroretinographic recordings in mice after intraocular injections of the peptides. We found that amidation and structure relaxation of PrP106–126 significantly reduced the neurotoxicity in vivo. This was also found in vitro in primary neuronal cultures from mouse and rat brain. Thioflavin T binding studies showed that amidation and structure relaxation significantly reduced the ability of PrP106–126 to attain fibrillar structures in physiological salt solutions. This study hence supports the assumption that the neurotoxic potential of PrP106–126 is closely related to its ability to attain secondary structure.

The etiology of the diseases can be sporadic, hereditary, or infective. According to the “protein-only” hypothesis (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), the basic infectious mechanism is thought to be a conformational change of the normal (cellular) prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic (scrapie) PrPSc catalyzed by PrPSc itself. Thus, presence of PrPC is a prerequisite for prion infection (2Brandner S. Raeber A. Sailer A. Blattler T. Fischer M. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13148-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).PrPC is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein constitutively expressed on the surface of primarily neuronal cells. It consists of two structurally different parts, namely a C-terminal, globular part mainly α-helical in nature and an unstructured, N-terminal part (3Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez G.F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 4Lopez G.F. Zahn R. Riek R. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8334-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Misfolding of PrPC into PrPSc occurs post-translationally and results in increased β-sheet content and a gain of protease resistance. The central region of PrPC linking the unstructured N-terminal part with the globular C-terminal domain is believed to play a pivotal role in these conformational changes (5Muramoto T. Scott M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15489-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The pathological hallmarks of the TSEs, which are mainly restricted to the central nervous system, include deposition of PrPSc, vacuolization of gray matter, neuronal death, and neuroinflammation manifested as astrogliosis and activation of microglia cells (9Prusiner S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 482-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Prusiner S.B. Prusiner S.B. Collinge J. Powell J. Anderton B. Prion Diseases of Humans and Animals. Ellis Horwood, London1992Google Scholar). Normally, PrPSc deposition and neuropathology are spatiotemporally correlated in vivo (11Armstrong R.A. Lantos P.L. Ironside J.W. Cairns N.J. J.

Beringue V. Peyrin J.M. Fournier J.G. Hauw J.J. Rossier J. Dormont D. Science. 1997; 275: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of TSE-associated cell death is poorly understood, although it seems that apoptosis is involved (reviewed by Hetz et al. (15Hetz C. Russelakis-Carneiro M. Maundrell K. Castilla J. Soto C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and Liberski et al. (16Liberski P.P. Sikorska B. Bratosiewicz-Wasik J. Gajdusek D.C. Brown P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2473-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). Up-regulation of pro-apoptotic markers has been found in postmortem brains from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients (17Puig B. Ferrer I. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 102: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and has additionally been found to precede the accumulation of PrPSc in scrapie-infected mice (18Jamieson E. Jeffrey M. Ironside J.W. Fraser J.R. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3567-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the neurotoxic entity in the TSEs is still debated. Cytotoxicity of purified PrPSc has been shown in PrPC-expressing neuroblastoma cells in vitro (15Hetz C. Russelakis-Carneiro M. Maundrell K. Castilla J. Soto C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar); however whether large aggregates or smaller oligomers of PrPSc are toxic is unknown (19Muller W.E. Ushijima H. Schroder H.C.

In contrast to other synthetic prion protein fragments that induce neuronal death independently of PrPC expression (23Chabry J. Ratsimanohatra C. Sponne I. Elena P.P. Vincent J.P. Pillot T. J.

Vincent J.P. Pillot T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 462-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which makes PrP106–126 a relevant model for PrPSc neurotoxicity. The in vivo neurotoxicity has been proposed to be linked to its aggregate-forming behavior and ability to form secondary structure in an aqueous environment (22Ettaiche M. Pichot R. Vincent J.P.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) have been found to be involved in this process. Also, another prion-derived peptide, PrP118–135, has been found to cause neuronal death via induction of apoptosis (23Chabry J. Ratsimanohatra C. Sponne I. Elena P.P. Vincent J.P. Pillot T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 462-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxicity of PrP118–135 is, however, independent of endogenous PrPC expression. The toxicity of PrP106–126 has been found to be enhanced by activation of microglia cells (27Peyrin J.M. Lasmezas C.I. Haik S. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Williams A. Richie D. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and astrocytes (25Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The neuroretina represents an easily accessible and fully integrated part of the central nervous system. Normally, there is a very low level of protease activity in the corpus vitreum of young, healthy animals (32Vaughan-Thomas A. Gilbert S.J. Duance V.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar), and injections of peptides can be made directly into the posterior chamber of the eye without causing damage to the eye. The neuronal cells of the retina express PrPC (33Giese A. Groschup M.H. Hess B. Kretzschmar H.A. Brain Pathol. 1995; 5: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Chishti M.A. Strome R. Carlson G.A. Westaway D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 234: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and are sensitive to PrP106–126 neurotoxicity, whereas the retinal neurons of PrP–/– mice are resistant to this effect (23Chabry J. Ratsimanohatra C. Sponne I. Elena P.P. Vincent J.P. Pillot T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 462-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Damage to retinal cells can be quantified with electroretinographic recordings.We recently showed that C-terminal amidation and structure relaxation of PrP106–126 significantly reduced the peptide's ability to form amyloid structure in water (35Heegaard P.M. Pedersen H.G. Flink J. Boas U. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Amidation of the C terminus has also been indicated by others to induce random coil structure in the peptide and to decrease its propensity to form amyloid fibrils (28Salmona M. Malesani P. De Gioia L. Gorla S. Bruschi M. Molinari A. Della V.F. Pedrotti B. Marrari M.A. Awan T. Bugiani O. Forloni G. Tagliavini F. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Here, we found that amidation and structure relaxation of the PrP106–126 significantly reduced the peptide's in vivo and in vitro neurotoxicity and reduced its ability to form amyloid fibrils in a physiological salt solution. This finding supports the view that the fibril-forming capability of PrP106–126 is pivotal for its PrPC-dependent neurotoxicity and increases the biological relevance of this peptide as a model for PrPSc-induced pathology.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Adult male C57 black wild-type mice aged 9–11 weeks, were purchased from Centre d'élevage Janvier (Le Genest St Isle, France) or from Harlan Scandinavia (Allerød, Denmark). PrP–/– mice named Zurich I (36Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H.P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar) were bred in the animal facilities at the Institute de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS. Wistar Hannover Galas rat pups were purchased from Taconic M&B, Ry, Denmark.Peptides—Peptides were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based synthesis using chlorotrityl resins for peptide acids and resins with the modified Rink linker for peptide amides (Novabiochem). After synthesis, cleavage by trifluoroacetic acid was performed, and the liberated peptides were analyzed by reverse phase (C5) high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (electrospray; Shimadzu LC20) and, if necessary, purified by preparative reverse phase chromatography on Lichrosorp C18 (Merck). The following peptides were used in this work: PrP106–126 (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG, human PrP106–126, expected Mr = 1912.3); PrP106–126-amide (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG-amide, expected Mr = 1911.3); scrambled control (LVGAHAGKMGANTAKAGAMVG, expected Mr = 1912.3); and RG2-amide (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGRGGRGG-amide, expected Mr = 2722).The RG2-amide sequence was designed based on the principles of peptide structure relaxation as shown by Due Larsen and Holm (37Due Larsen B. Holm A. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The peptides were dissolved in sterile PBS to a concentration of 1 mm and stored in aliquots at –20 °C until use. For intravitreal injections and for use in the primary mouse embryonal cortical neurons, the peptides were aged for 3 days at room temperature with slight agitation. When non-aged peptides were used for injections, they were kept on ice until use. For cellular experiments with rat cerebellar granular neurons, the peptides were aged for 2 days 37 °C at 2 mm in PBS.Thioflavin T (ThT) Assay for Amyloid Fibril Formation—A thioflavin T assay was performed as described by LeVine (38LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Peptides were dissolved to 1 mm in sterile PBS and allowed to incubate at room temperature with slight agitation in the presence of 20 μm thioflavin T (1 mm stock solution in water; Sigma T3516), reading the fluorescence each day at 485 nm using an excitation wavelength of 440 nm (with a Spectra Flour Plus microplate fluorometer from Tecan). Readings were normalized to the same gain setting to allow comparisons from sample to sample. When comparing different plates, values were further corrected for background (fluorescence of ThT in water).Intravitreal Injections—Anesthesia was performed with intraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Topical application of a local anesthetic (Novesine®) was performed in both eyes. Injections of a 1-μl solution were done unilaterally (in the left eye) with a 30-gauge needle introduced into the posterior chamber on the upper pole of the eye directed toward the center of the vitreous body. The injections were performed slowly (over at least 60 s) to allow diffusion of the peptide and to avoid any ocular hypertension and backflow. For electroretinography (ERG) experiments 5–10 animals were used for each treatment group, and for histological analyses 3–5 animals per group were used. For histological analysis of eyes at 15 days post injection (dpi), 3 mice with representative ERG values (close to the group mean) from each treatment group were selected. For histological analyses of retinas at 4 dpi, the mice were not subjected to ERG before they were killed.ERG Measurements and Statistical Evaluation of Effect—Full field electroretinograms were prepared under dim red light on overnight dark-adapted animals. Anesthesia was performed with a mixture of 2% isoflurane (Forene®, Abbott Laboratories) and oxygen. The pupils of anesthetized animals were dilated with Mydriaticum®. The animals were kept on a heating mat during anesthesia. A ring-shaped recording electrode was placed on the cornea of each eye, and a reference electrode was placed behind each ear. Zero electrodes were placed on the hind legs. Light stimulus (8 ms) was provided by a single flash (10 candelas/s·m2) in front of the animal. The ERGs were recorded using Win7000b (Metrovision, Pérenchies, France). The amplitude of the a-wave was measured from the baseline to the bottom of the a-wave; the b-wave amplitude was measured from the bottom of the a-wave to the peak of the b-wave (Fig. 1). The averaged responses represent the mean of two white flashes (8-ms duration) delivered 2 min apart. ERGs were recorded before and then 4, 7, and 14 days after intravitreal injections. Only animals with approximately similar pre-injection values for the left and right eye were selected for injections. To quantify the effect of the injections, the non-injected eye was used as an internal control, and the absolute values for the ERG a- and b-waves of the injected eye were normalized to the non-injected control eye for each animal. Relative/normalized values for the different peptide groups were compared with the relative/normalized values for the group injected with the scrambled control peptide by using an unpaired t test.Tissue Preparation—Mice used for ERG recordings were killed on day 15 after injection, and other groups were killed on day 4 after injection. All mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The eyes were enucleated and fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 24 h and then cryoprotected overnight in PBS containing 20% sucrose. The eyes were then embedded in TissueTek (Sakura) and frozen at –80 °C. Cryosections (10 μm) throughout the whole eye were cut on a cryostat. The sections were then dried for 1–2 h at 55 °C before they were stored at –80 °C until further use.TUNEL Test on Cryosections—A TUNEL test (Roche Applied Science in situ cell death detection kit, POD) was performed on frozen sections from animals 4 or 15 dpi according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. The sections were defrosted for 30 min at room temperature and then washed 2× 5 min in PBS. Blocking was performed in methanol with 3% H2O2 for 30 min, after which the slides were washed 2× 5 min in PBS. Permeabilization was performed in 4 °C double distilled water with 0.5% sodium citrate and 0.5% Triton X-100 followed by a short wash in PBS. A positive control was digested with DNase for 20 min at 37 °C. A TUNEL mixture was then added to all slides (except a negative control, which received only the label solution from the TUNEL kit). Incubation with the TUNEL mixture was performed in a humid atmosphere for 3 h at 37 °C. Washing was performed 3× 5 min in PBS at 37 °C, and a converter solution from the TUNEL kit was added to all slides. Incubation was performed for 30 min, and the slides were then washed 3× 5 min in PBS. DAB solution (one thawed DAB tablet, Sigma catalog number D5905, was dissolved in 15 ml of PBS; 12 μl of 30% H2O2 was added immediately before use) was added, and development was performed for 6 min. The reaction was stopped in distilled water. The slides were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols and mounted in xylol (Pertex). The slides were analyzed in a light microscope and photographed with a Leica DC300 digital camera.Primary Mouse Embryonal Cortical Neurons (ECNs) and Toxicity Assay—Primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from wild type C57 black embryos. Briefly, the embryos were dissected at embryonal day 13 or 14, and the brains were extracted and rinsed from meninges in 37 °C warm Dulbecco's PBS with 1% glucose. The PBS solution was replaced by Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) with the addition of l-glutamine, 10% inactivated fetal calf serum, B27 supplement, and penicillin/streptomycin. Gentle homogenization was performed with a Pasteur pipette, after which the cells were washed once. The cell concentration was adjusted to the appropriate concentration, and plating of 5 × 104 cells/well was performed on Nunc 96-well plates precoated overnight with poly-d-lysine. Incubation was performed at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After 30 min of incubation, the medium was changed. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by serum-free Neurobasal medium with a B27 supplement, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Peptides were added after 3–5 days of maturation and incubated for 12, 24, and 48 h. Viability was measured with an MTS assay (CellTiter96, AQueous One solution cell proliferation assay; Promega). A492 nm was measured on a spectrophotometer.Primary Rat Cerebellar Granular Neurons (CGNs) and Toxicity Assay—CGNs were isolated from 7–8 day-old Wistar Hannover Galas rat pups (Taconic M&B) as described by Patel & Kingsbury (39Patel A.J. Kingsbury A.E. Methods Neurosci. 1999; 18: 493-502Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cerebellar granules were isolated from pups after decapitation. The tissue was suspended in Krebs buffer and digested with trypsin before single cell suspensions were made in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 35 mm KCl, GlutaMAX-I supplement, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). The cell concentration was adjusted to the appropriate concentration, and plating of 8 × 104 cells/well was performed on 96-well plates precoated with poly-d-lysine (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The medium was changed to serum-free Neurobasal A with B27 (without antioxidants) and the same supplements as above. On day 6 the medium was replaced by fresh Neurobasal A (without phenol red) with the addition of B27 (without antioxidants), the same supplements as above, and peptides to a final concentration of 100 μm. Viability was measured day 15 using the WST-1 assay as described in the manufacturer's manual (cell proliferation reagent WST-1; Roche Applied Science). The cells were analyzed in light microscope and photographed with a Leica DC300 digital camera after 9 days of treatment.Caspase Induction—CGNs were isolated as described above and incubated for 6 days before peptides were added in serum-free Neurobasal A medium (without antioxidants, supplemented with 15 mm KCl and B27) in 96-well black microtiter plates (Optilux, BD Biosciences) precoated with poly-d-lysine. After incubation for 3 days, the induction of caspases was measured in a cell lysate described in the manufacturer's manual (homogenous caspases assay, Roche Applied Science). This assay measures mainly caspase-2, -3, and -7.Immunocytochemistry on CGN—CGN cultures were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 on eight-chamber Lab-Tek Permanox chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) precoated with poly-d-lysine. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4 (freshly prepared overnight with stirring), for 1 h at room temperature and washed with washing buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4) 3× 5 min with gentle agitation before incubating overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of the mouse monoclonal anti-PrP antibody SAF32 (Spi-Bio, Montigny le Bretonneaux, France) or mouse IgG2b (catalog number X0944, DAKO) diluted in PBS, pH 7.4, with 1.5% horse serum. After rinsing, the slides were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS, pH 7.4, with 1.5% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed, and incubated with ABC reagent for 30 min (antibodies and ABC-reagent Vectastain ABC kit from Vector Laboratories). After rinsing, slides were developed with a DAB solution (one thawed DAB tablet from Sigma was diluted in 15 ml PBS; 12 μl of H2O2 was added immediately before use) before rinsing in distilled water. Slides were mounted with Aquamount mounting media (BDH Laboratories, Poole, UK) under glass coverslips.RESULTSAmidation and Structure Relaxation of PrP106–126 Reduce Its Tendency to Form Amyloid Fibrils in PBS—We analyzed the fibrillation tendency (amyloidogenicity) of the peptides at 1 mm in PBS with the ThT assay where fluorescence was followed for 7 days (Fig. 2). Fibrillation of PrP106–126 in PBS peaked after 3 days of incubation, after which it started to decline. The PrP106–126-amide and the RG2-amide showed much lower fibrillation tendency compared with PrP106–126, although they both rose to levels significantly higher than the scrambled control peptide. The fibrillation of the RG2-amide proceeded slower than that of both PrP106–126 and PrP106–126-amide, peaking after 5 days of incubation as opposed to 3 days of incubation.Fig. 2Thioflavin T binding of peptide variants. Thioflavin T binding of the peptides dissolved in PBS (1 mm) was analyzed by fluorescence measurements daily for 7 days. Each data point represents the mean of duplicate or quadruplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fibrillar PrP106–126 Induces Long Term Changes in the Retina—To test the peptide variants for their in vivo neurotoxicity, we performed intravitreous injections of the 3-day-aged peptides and performed ERG recordings at 4, 7, and 14 dpi. All animals were injected in their left eye only (the right was left as non-injected or PBS-injected controls). No difference was observed between non-injected and PBS-injected eyes (data not shown). Both eyes were measured by ERG, and for each animal the absolute values of the ERG a- and b-waves, respectively, for the injected eye were normalized to the control eye values (the a-wave and b-wave amplitude values from the control eye was set to 100%). This was done to avoid time-to-time variation in the ERG"

The modulation is mediated by G protein βγ subunits. By using electrophysiological recordings and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we characterized the modulatory domains of the G protein β subunit on the recombinant P/Q-type channel and GIRK channel expressed in HEK293 cells and on native non-L-type Ca2+ currents of cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that Gβ2 subunit-derived deletion constructs and synthesized peptides can either induce or inhibit G protein modulation of the examined ion channels. In particular, the 25-amino acid peptide derived from the Gβ2 N terminus inhibits G protein modulation, whereas a 35-amino acid peptide derived from the Gβ2 C terminus induced modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and GIRK channels. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of the live action of these peptides revealed that the 25-amino acid peptide diminished the FRET signal between G protein β2γ3 subunits, indicating a reorientation between G protein β2γ3 subunits in the presence of the peptide. In contrast, the 35-amino acid peptide increased the FRET signal between GIRK1,2 channel subunits, similarly to the Gβγ-mediated FRET increase observed for this GIRK subunit combination. Circular dichroism spectra of the synthesized peptides suggest that the 25-amino acid peptide is structured. These results indicate that individual G protein β subunit domains can act as independent, separate modulatory domains to either induce or inhibit G protein modulation for several effector proteins.

Stephens G.J. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, little is known about the interaction of the G protein with the channel and how the G protein domains are involved in modulation. Earlier studies characterized single point mutations on the G protein β subunit, suggesting that the entire G protein surface rather than a single amino acid may determine specific effector functions (23Ford C.E.

In this study, we addressed whether we could identify specific G protein domains that either inhibited or induced G protein modulation of different channel (effector) proteins. By applying electrophysiological studies and FRET measurements, we identified two structural components of the G protein important for ion channel modulation. Peptides derived from the N terminus of Gβ2, including the G protein βγ interaction site, inhibit G protein modulation of GIRK and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The inhibitory effect is correlated with a change in the interaction between G protein β and γ subunits. In contrast, protein domains derived from the C terminus of Gβ2 induce G protein modulation of GIRK and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. This effect is correlated with an increase in FRET between GIRK channel subunits mediated by either the Gβγ complex or the modulatory peptide. Our data suggest that peptides derived from G protein β subunits can act as independent domains for G protein βγ effector protein such as ion channels. These peptides will thus provide useful tools for characterizing and manipulating G protein pathways in living cells. All G protein constructs were cloned into a new expression vector (pYFP-nuc/HA-C1). In this vector, YFP is under the control of a second and separate cytomegalovirus promoter and tagged with a nuclear localization signal, which allows the constitutive expression and transport of YFP to the nucleus as well as the expression of the nonfused protein or peptide of interest. Thus, cells with a nuclear targeted YFP contain the cDNA encoding for the peptide of interest. For constructing the pYFP-nuc/HA-C1 vector used for co-expression of the Gβ2-derived deletion constructs, two SV40 nuclear localization signals were added 3′ in-frame into the YFP coding sequence in pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) (pYFP-nuc). Then the cytomegalovirus promoter, polylinker region, and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signals were PCR-amplified from pcDNA3.1 and subcloned into the AflII site of the pYFP-nuc-C1. An HA tag polylinker was directly cloned into the Nhe-PmeI site of the amplified polylinker via blunt end cloning. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (tsA201 cells) were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated DNAs in each set of experiments with Quantum PrepR Cytofectene™ Transfection Reagent (Bio-Rad) and incubated for 24-36 h. For non-live cell FRET measurements cells were embedded in Fluoromount (133 mm Tris/HCl, 30% glycerol, 11% Mowiol, 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octaue). Human G protein β2 constructs (Gβ2-full-length; 1-100, 101-200, 201-340, 1-50, 51-100, 201-270, 270-340, 1-25, 26-50, 201-235, 236-270, 271-305, and 306-340) were PCR-amplified and subcloned in-frame into pYFP-nuc/HA-C1 for electrophysiological recordings and into pEYFP-C1 for localization within the cell. The cellular localization of the YFP-tagged Gβ constructs is shown in the supplemental Figs. 1-3. Other constructs, i.e. Gγ3 and GIRK1 and GIRK2, were either PCR-amplified or if restriction sites were suitable cloned into either pECFP-C1, pECFP-C2, pECFP-N1, pEYFP-C1, and pEYFP-N1 and as non-tagged versions into pcDNA3.1. All PCR-amplified products were verified by sequencing, and protein expression was verified by Western blot analysis after expression of the constructs in COS-7 cells. Western blots of transfected COS-7 cells (with Gβ constructs) were performed with a polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to standard procedures as described by Mark et al. (26Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Muscarinic AChR M2 (human) was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) and purchased from UMR cDNA resource center (Rolla, MO). Reverse transcription and PCR amplification were used to clone γ2 (stargazin) from rat brain RNA using the following oligonucleotide primers: sense, 5′atggggctgtttgatcgaaggtgttcaaatg3′; antisense, 5′tcatacgggcgtggtccggcggttggctgt3′. The nucleotide sequence was verified to the rat γ2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_053351) by cDNA sequencing. FRET measurements were performed by using a modified version of the 3-cube FRET method (27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) as described in Hümmer et al. (7Hümmer A. Delzeith O. Gomez S.R. Moreno R.L. Mark M.D. Herlitze S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49386-49400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, the average FRET signal (FRET ratio) was calculated using the following equation: FR = (FRETfluorescence - RD1 × CFPfluorescence)/(RA1 × (YFPfluorescence)), where the constants RD1 and RA1 were derived from the CFP and YFP constructs expressed alone in HEK293 cells. The average FRET signal was confirmed for each FRET pair by acceptor photobleaching. Here FRET samples were exposed 30 min to fluorescent light through the YFP filter cube (excitation, HQ 500/20; band pass filter 535/30; beam splitter JP4 PC 535/30), and the FRET efficiency (Eff) was calculated according to the increase in CFP emission: Eff = (1 - CFPfluorescence before/CFPfluorescence after) × 100%. In our experimental setting, we calculated that the YFP signal was reduced by 70% after 30 min of light exposure. CFP, FRET, and YFP pictures were analyzed with Volocity software (Improvision). For live cell FRET measurements, cells were incubated in extracellular solution containing (in mm) 172 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 4 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2 (pH 7.3). CFP, FRET, and YFP pictures were taken before and 30 min after peptide application. For calculation of the FRET ratio over the whole image, images were saved as TIFF files and processed with Igor software (WaveMetrics, Inc.). The FRET equation (FR = (FRETfluorescence - RD1 × CFPfluorescence)/(RA1 × (YFPfluorescence)) was applied to every pixel of the image for all three images. FR within these images was encoded by 256 gray values. These values were converted into color values, where the intensity of the color represents the FR value. For FR calculation, the gray scale value outside of the cell of interest was determined (typically under <33 gray scale values). This value was subtracted from the whole image. The FR image of Figs. 6 and 7 without background subtraction are shown in the supplemental Fig. 4.Fig. 7G protein β2 subunit-derived peptide, pep1-25, reduces the FRET signal between YFP-tagged G protein β2and CFP-tagged G protein γ3 subunit.A, distribution of YFP-tagged G protein β2 and CFP-tagged G protein γ3 subunits in HEK293 cells.

C, FRET ratio for the FRET pair CFP-Gγ3 + YFP-Gβ2 before and after application of G protein β2-derived peptides pep1-25 and pep271-305. CFP, FRET, and YFP pictures were taken before application of the peptide, and the average FR was calculated (see “Materials and Methods”). Peptides dissolved in the chariot transfection reagent were applied to the live cells in a 10 μm concentration. Cells exposed to the peptides were incubated for 30 min at room. After 30 min, CFP, FRET, and YFP pictures were taken again, and the average FR was calculated. The control FRET pairs CFP + YFP-Gβ2, CFP-Gγ3 + YFP, CFP-Gγ3 + YFP-(stargazin)γ2, and CFP-(stargazin)γ2 + YFP-Gβ2 were measured in fixed cells.

The arrow indicates that a high FR is detected on the outer edge of the cell and that the FR is larger before application of the pep1-25 peptide. In contrast, the * indicates a cell with YFP-Gβ2 expression but no or very little CFP-Gγ3 expression and therefore no change in the FR.

For CFP and YFP detection, the following filters were used: CFP, excitation, D436/10; emission, D470/30; YFP, excitation, HQ 500/20; band pass filter 535/30; beam splitter JP4 PC. All filters were obtained from Chroma. The following objectives were used: a 63× water corrected 1.2NA objective for fixed FRET samples and a 63× water corrected long distance 0.9 NA objective for live cell recordings. The synthesized peptides (pep1-25, pep271-305, and pep1-25scrambled) were dissolved in H2O and kept as 10 mm stock solution at -20 °C. From this stock solution further dilutions (100 μm) were prepared in the intracellular solutions used for GIRK, P/Q-type, and neuronal non-L-type channel recordings for the intracellular application of the peptides. The peptides have the following sequences: pep1-25, MSELEQLRQEAEQLRNQIRDARKAC; pep1-25scrambled, MRLQAEQRNCSLEIRLEQDKEQARA; and pep271-305, CGITSVAFSRSGRLLLAGYDDFNCNIWDAMKGDRA. For peptide transfection, the Chariot transfection reagent (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was used. According to the instructions manual of the manufacturer, 500 ng of peptide was mixed in the transfection reagent, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then added directly to the imaged cells in the recording chamber. Unless otherwise indicated, electrophysiological recordings were performed 20 min after chariot/peptide application, and FRET measurements were performed 30 min after chariot/peptide application. Peptides were dissolved in H2O. Peptide concentration were 29 μm for pep1-25 and 13 μm for pep271-305. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were measured on an Aviv instrument in a thermostatted 0.3-cm quartz cell (Helma). Measurements were carried out at 25 and 5 °C. A single scan was acquired at 0.5 nm intervals between 250 and 185 nm with an averaging time of 2 s. The signal of buffer without peptide was subtracted from each measurement. Molar ellipticity was calculated as [Θ] = CD signal in millidegree (peptide concentration M × cell length cm × number of residues). The helical content was estimated from the ellipticity at 222 nm using the procedure of Rohl and Baldwin (28Rohl C.A. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For P/Q-type channel recordings in HEK293 cells, Ca2+ channel subunits (α12.1, β1b, and α2δ) and the G protein subunit (Gβ2) or G protein β fragments were co-expressed in tsA201 cells, and Ca2+ channel-mediated Ba2+ currents were measured and analyzed as described previously (1Herlitze S.

The following bath pipette solutions were used: for external solution (mm), 100 Tris, 4 MgCl2, 10 BaCl2 with pH adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid; for internal solution (mm), 120 aspartic acid, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA and 2 Mg-ATP with pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. Endogenous G proteins were activated by adding 0.6 mm GTPγS to the internal solution. Tail currents (supplemental Table) were fitted with a single exponential using Igor software. PKC inhibitor peptide (Sigma) was dissolved in the intracellular recording solution at a concentration of 100 μm. 4α-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO as a 1 mm stock solution. 2 μl of this solution was added to 2 ml of the extracellular bathing solution 5 min prior to the experiment (final concentration 1 μm). For GIRK channel recordings in HEK293 cells, GIRK channel subunits (GIRK1 and GIRK2) were co-expressed with or without mAChR-M2 receptors in tsA201 cells, and GIRK channel-mediated K+ currents were elicited by 50-ms voltage ramps from -100 to +50 mV. The holding potential was 0 mV. ACh (Sigma) was dissolved in the external solution to a final concentration of 10 μm. The following solutions were used: for external solution (mm), 20 NaCl, 120 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3 (KOH); for internal solution (mm), 100 potassium aspartate, 40 KCl, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES-KOH, 5 NaCl, 2 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 0.01 GTP, pH 7.3 (KOH). For non-L-type channel recordings in cultured hippocampal neurons, Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Zivic Miller Inc.) were sacrificed at postnatal day 1, and hippocampal neurons were dissociated and cultured on coverslips according to a modified protocol from Bekkers et al. (31Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and described in Wittemann et al. (30Wittemann S. Mark M.D. Rettig J. Herlitze S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37807-37814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 10-14-Day-old neurons were used for Ca2+ channel recordings. The following solutions were used: for internal solution (mm), 120 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 20 TEACl-, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, 14 phosphocreatine (Tris), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na2GTP, 11 EGTA, pH 7.2, with methanesulfonic acid; for external solution (mm), 145 TEA, 10 HEPES, 10 CaCl2, 15 glucose, pH 7.4, with methanesulfonic acid. In addition, 1 μm TTX (Sigma) and 5 μm nimodipine (Sigma) were added to the external solution to block voltage-dependent Na+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels. All whole cell patch clamp recordings (32Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) were performed with an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA). Currents were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered with the internal 10-kHz three-pole Bessel filter (filter 1) in series with a 2.9-kHz 4-pole Bessel filter (filter 2) of the EPC9 amplifier. Series resistances were partially compensated between 70 and 90%. Leak and capacitative currents were subtracted by using hyperpolarizing pulses from -60 to -70 mV with the p/4 method. Statistical significance throughout the experiments was tested with ANOVA using Igor Software. Standard errors are mean ± S.E. G protein modulation of N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels is mediated by G protein βγ subunits (1Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) and most likely involves the direct binding of the G protein to the channel (16De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 18Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Co-expression of Gβ2 together with the P/Q- or N-type channel α1, β1b, and α2δ subunits results in channel modulation, i.e. a shift in the voltage dependence of activation, a more shallow activation curve, and prepulse facilitation (1Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Mark M.D. Wittemann S. Herlitze S. J. Physiol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9163-9170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we addressed whether deletion fragments of the G protein β subunit were able to either induce or block G protein modulation of the P/Q-type channels when co-expressed together in a heterologous expression system. We divided the human G protein β2 subunit consisting of 340 amino acids into three domains encoding amino acids 1-100, 101-200, and 201-340. We then further subdivided these protein domains into smaller fragments to identify small protein regions that can be synthesized and directly applied to ion channels (e.g. GIRK channels and neuronal Ca2+ channels) and to investigate the potential of these peptides in manipulating G protein-modulated effector proteins. The distribution of the YFP-tagged Gβ constructs in HEK293 cells is shown in the supplemental Figs. 1-3. We first investigated if G protein β2-derived constructs induce modulation of P/Q-type channels comparable with levels observed with the G protein β2 subunit alone (Fig. 1, A, middle trace, and B). G protein modulation was measured as prepulse facilitation, a characteristic of G protein-mediated voltage-dependent inhibition of the Cav2 channel family (9Elmslie K.S. Zhou W. Jones S.W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To investigate prepulse facilitation, we compared the peak current amplitude of currents elicited by the two test pulses throughout the experiments. The test pulses were separated by a depolarizing pulse to relief G protein modulation from the Ca2+ channel. As indicated in Fig. 1, A and B, prepulse facilitation of P/Q-type channels was observed in the presence of the Gβ-(201-340) but not in the presence of Gβ-(1-100) and Gβ-(101-200). Thus, the C terminus of the G protein β2 subunit induces P/Q-type channel modulation. We further divided the Gβ-(201-340) region into smaller constructs: the first is 70 amino acids long, and the second is 35 amino acids long. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 70-amino acid-long Gβ-(201-270) and Gβ-271-340 peptides both increased P/Q-type channel facilitation. Investigation of the 35-amino acid-long constructs on P/Q-type channel modulation revealed that only Gβ-(236-270), Gβ-(271-305), and Gβ-(305-340) induced significant modulation over background facilitation, whereas the Gβ-(201-235) had no effect. We next investigated whether the modulatory Gβ2-derived constructs induce a shift in the voltage dependence of activation, as would be predicted for the voltage-dependent G protein modulation of P/Q-type channels. In order to do so we analyzed the tail currents after the voltage pulse for the applied voltage pulse protocols. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1, C and D, an ~8-mV shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more depolarized potentials was observed for P/Q-type channels expressed with Gβ-(201-340), Gβ-(201-270), Gβ-(271-340), Gβ-(271-305), and Gβ-(305-340) in comparison to channels expressed without the Gβ fragments. In contrast, Gβ-(1-100), Gβ-(101-200), and Gβ-(201-235), which did not induce facilitation, also did not shift the voltage dependence of activation to more positive potentials. Gβ-(236-270) shifted P/Q-type channel activation slightly to more positive potentials. The data suggest that co-expression of the protein fragments derived from the C-terminal end of the G protein β2 subunits induce P/Q-type channel modulation comparable with the modulatory effects described for the full-length Gβ2 subunit. We next investigated whether the modulation of P/Q-type channels is reduced in the presence of G protein β fragments when endogenous G proteins are activated by GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 2B, we observed that the first 100 amino acids (Gβ-1-100) of the G protein β subunit decreased significantly G protein modulation when endogenous G proteins were activated by GTPγS, w"

Because in certain cell types mitochondria are responsible for detecting altered O2 levels we examined the role of mitochondrial oxidant production in the regulation of recombinant Ca2+ channel α1C subunits during CH and exposure to Aβ-(1–40). In wild-type (ρ+) HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant L-type α1C subunits, Ca2+ currents were enhanced by prolonged (24 h) exposure to either CH (6% O2) or Aβ-(1–40) (50 nm). By contrast the response to CH was absent in ρ0 cells in which the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) was depleted following long term treatment with ethidium bromide or in ρ+ cells cultured in the presence of 1 μm rotenone. CH was mimicked in ρ0 cells by the exogenous production of O2·¯. by xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Furthermore Aβ-(1–40) enhanced currents in ρ0 cells to a degree similar to that seen in cells with an intact ETC. The antioxidants ascorbate (200 μm) and Trolox (500 μm) ablated the effect of CH in ρ+ cells but were without effect on Aβ-(1–40)-mediated augmentation of Ca2+ current in ρ0 cells. Thus oxidant production in the mitochondrial ETC is a critical factor, acting upstream of amyloid β peptide production in the up-regulation of Ca2+ channels in response to CH.

Thus oxidant production in the mitochondrial ETC is a critical factor, acting upstream of amyloid β peptide production in the up-regulation of Ca2+ channels in response to CH. Acute regulation of ion channels by hypoxia is a fundamental mechanism by which tissue and cellular responses to this deleterious stimulus are initiated. Acute hypoxic regulation of various ion channel types either initiates or mediates control of a diverse range of cellular functions, including neurosecretion from chemosensory cells, neuronal excitability and the contraction/dilation of vascular smooth muscle (1Lopez-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Saenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). By contrast, responses of ion channels and other cellular proteins to chronic hypoxia (CH) 1The abbreviations used are: CH, chronic hypoxia; Aβ, amyloid β; AβP, amyloid β peptide; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ETC, electron transport chain; ROS, reactive oxygen species; pF, picofarads; X/XO, xanthine/xanthine oxidase. occur on a time scale of hours to days and are generally mediated by the altered expression of proteins following up-regulation of their encoding genes (2Schofield C.J.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, we recently demonstrated that augmentation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by CH can occur in a post-transcriptional manner due to the amyloid β peptide-mediated trafficking of poreforming α1C subunits toward, and/or their retention within, the plasma membrane (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore the response of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels to CH may also be mediated by the post-transcriptional trafficking of auxiliary (β) subunits to the plasma membrane (5Hartness M.E.

CH is thought to be a predisposing factor in a number of neurological disorders, and there is a body of evidence to support a link between hypoxic/ischemic episodes (such as those that occur during stroke and cardiac arrhythmias) and the prevalence of dementias such as Alzheimer disease (6Moroney J.T. Bagiella E. Desmond D.W. Paik M.C. Stern Y. Tatemichi T.K. Stroke. 1996; 27: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The most commonly described feature of Alzheimer disease is the build-up of fibrillar plaques composed largely of neurotoxic amyloid β peptides (AβPs). These short peptides are produced following the enzymatic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by the sequential action of β- and γ-secretases (7Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 8Vassar R. Citron M.

Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), and enhanced production of AβPs following ischemia may occur as a result of increased levels and/or activity of these enzymes (10Smith I.F. Boyle J.P. Green K.N. Pearson H.A. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Wen Y. Onyewuchi O. Yang S. Liu R. Simpkins J.W. Brain Res. 2004; 1009: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the neurodegenerative effects of AβPs have yet to be fully elucidated, they are thought to involve disrupted cellular Ca2+ homeostasis (12Mattson M.P. Chan S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 205-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Mattson M.P. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We recently proposed that the AβP-mediated trafficking of L-type Ca2+ channel α1C subunits during CH may contribute to Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and provide a link between ischemic episodes and dementias. Indeed we demonstrated that the effects of CH could be abolished by inhibition of either secretase required for AβP formation (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to investigate the mechanisms underlying CH and AβP-mediated regulation of the L-type channel. In particular we examined the role of oxidant production in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in the augmentation of recombinant Ca2+ currents by CH. We demonstrated that during CH altered mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production precede the production of AβPs and Ca2+ current enhancement and demonstrated a role for the ETC in CH-induced Ca2+ dyshomeostasis. Stable Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—Experiments were conducted in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel α1C subunit (14Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke R.J. Weghuis D.O. Klockner U. Wakamori M. Wang J-J. Melvin D. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6228-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The α1C subunit cDNA clone was a kind gift from Dr. Gyula Varadi (University of Cincinnati). After splitting the previous day and seeding at ∼60% confluency, wild-type HEK 293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of pCDNA3.1-α1C using ExGen 500 (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three days post-transfection, the medium was replaced with one containing 400 μg ml–1 G418 (Invitrogen). Selection was applied for 2 weeks after which time individual colonies could be visualized using an inverted microscope (Zeiss) and phase-contrast objectives. Colonies were picked and seeded in wells of a 96-well plate and allowed to reach confluency after which they were transferred to 35-mm dishes for further culture and examination of Ca2+ currents. G418 selection was continued throughout the cloning process and in all subsequent subculturing. Some of the current studies were carried out in the stable cell line described previously (15Fearon I.M. Palmer A.C. Balmforth A.J. Ball S.G. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Peers C. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Culture of HEK 293 Cells—Cells were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) containing 9% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Globepharm, Esher, Surrey, UK), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, gentamicin (50 mg liter–1), 10,000 units liter–1 penicillin G, 10 mg liter–1 streptomycin, 0.25 mg liter–1 amphotericin, and 400 mg liter–1 G418 (all Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. In studies examining chronic hypoxia, cells were placed in a humidified atmosphere of 6% O2, 5% CO2, 89% N2 or 2.5% O2, 5% CO2, 92.5% N2 after which time they were used in studies for no longer than 1 h following removal from the incubator. Creation of Mitochondria-depleted (ρ0) HEK 293 Cells—The mitochondrial DNA-depleted (ρ0 (16King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar)) cell line was generated from HEK 293 cells stably expressing the recombinant L-type Ca2+ channel α1C subunit. These cells were initially grown in minimum essential medium (see above) supplemented with 500 ng ml–1 EtBr, 1 mm pyruvate, and 50 μg ml–1 uridine. The concentration of EtBr was increased after the 1st and 2nd months to 1 and 2 μg ml–1, respectively, because at the lower concentration depletion of mtDNA was incomplete. mtDNA levels were examined monthly and compared with wild-type (ρ+) cells grown in media in the absence of EtBr, pyruvate, and uridine. mtDNA levels were examined as follows. DNA was harvested from the cells using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) and was analyzed and quantitated by spectrophotometry (260/280 nm). Equal amounts of DNA from ρ+ and ρ0 cells were subjected to quantitative PCR using the Brilliant SYBR green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), the Mx3000P QPCR machine (Stratagene), and human-specific primer pairs for mtDNA: upstream, 5′-CCT AGG GAT AAC AGC GCA AT-3′; and downstream, 5′-TAG AAG AGC GAT GGT GAG AG-3′; and for β-actin: upstream, 5′-TGG CCG GGA CCT GAC TGA CTA C-3′; and downstream, 5′-CGT GGC CAT CTC TTG CTC GAA G-3′ (31Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). mtDNA levels in ρ0 cells after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months of growth in EtBr were ∼60, 40, and 2% of wild-type levels, respectively. This was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis of a sample extracted from the PCR during the log phase (20 cycles; see Fig. 3B). Only ρ0 cells in which the mtDNA was reduced to 2% of control levels were used in experiments. Electrophysiology—Pieces of coverslip with attached cells were transferred to a continually perfused (∼2 ml min–1) recording chamber, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15148) Google Scholar) were made using patch pipettes of resistance 4–6 megaohms. Cells were perfused with a solution composed of 95 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 0.6 mm MgC12, 20 mm BaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 10 mm d-glucose, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), and patch electrodes were filled with a solution composed of 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mm MgC12, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm ATP (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Cells were voltage-clamped at –80 mV, and whole-cell currents were evoked by step depolarizing the membrane to various test potentials for 100 ms at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. All recordings were made at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Current traces were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and stored on a personal computer for later analysis. Capacitative transients were minimized by analogue means (residual transients have been truncated for illustrative purposes), and corrections for leak current were made off line by the appropriate scaling and subtraction of the average leak current evoked by small hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps (≤5 mV). Current amplitudes were measured at their peaks during each step depolarization. Current densities (pA/pF) were calculated by dividing evoked currents by the capacitance of the cell. In the insets to figures showing individual traces, currents were evoked in cells of similar size as judged by their capacitance. To minimize the effects of variation in Ca2+ currents, in all experiments current amplitudes following either drug or hypoxic treatments were compared with those obtained in control cells on the same experimental day. All analyses and voltage protocols were performed using an Axopatch 200B/Multiclamp 700A amplifier in combination with a Digidata 1200/1322A interface and pCLAMP 8.0/9.0 software (all Axon Instruments). Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemical studies cells were grown as above, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+, and subcultured on glass coverslips at a seeding density of 3 × 104 cells ml–1. After 2 days in culture cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4 in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were incubated (4 °C, overnight) in the presence of a monoclonal antibody (provided by Elan Pharmaceuticals) raised against Aβ-(1–5). Incubation was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% goat serum. Antibody binding was visualized using a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Ltd.) and examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Chemicals and Statistical Analyses—EtBr, pyruvate, uridine, ascorbic acid, xanthine, xanthine oxidase, rotenone, and Aβ-(1–40) were from Sigma. In all experiments, the unaggregated form of Aβ-(1–40) was used. The secretase inhibitors γ-VI, γ-X, BSI, and the antioxidant Trolox were obtained from Calbiochem. Results are expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical comparisons were made using unpaired Student's t tests as appropriate. We recently demonstrated that CH augments Ca2+ channel currents in HEK 293 cells stably expressing recombinant α1C subunits via a mechanism involving the production of AβPs (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that this effect was reproducible at lower levels of hypoxia (6% O2 for 24 h). At all activating test potentials, evoked currents (expressed as current densities following normalization for cell size) were larger in CH cells than in cells cultured in normoxia. For example, at a test potential of +10 mV, mean ± S.E. current densities were –7.8 ± 0.8 pA/pF (n = 20) in normoxia and –13.1 ± 2.5 pA/pF (n = 18) in CH (p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test; Fig. 1A). Similarly current densities were also significantly enhanced following incubation for 24 h in 50 nm Aβ-(1–40) to –11.8 ± 2.01 pA/pF (n = 10; p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test; Fig. 1B). The reproducibility of this effect in a cell line newly generated using a different expression vector/promoter than that used previously further emphasizes the lack of involvement of transcriptional regulation of the Ca2+ channel during CH. These effects of CH were dependent on AβP production because they were abolished by co-incubating cells in 100 nm BSI or 10 μm γ-VI, inhibitors of β- and γ-secretase, respectively (Fig. 1C). The Role of Antioxidant Production in Hypoxic Augmentation of L-type Ca2+ Currents—Hypoxic augmentation of native L-type Ca2+ channels in PC12 cells is prevented by antioxidants (18Green K.N. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 5: 1043-1051Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Green K.N. Boyle J.P. Peers C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To examine the role of ROS in hypoxic augmentation of recombinant Ca2+ currents we investigated the ability of two structurally unrelated antioxidants to interfere with hypoxic regulation of Ca2+ channel expression. Results presented in Fig. 2 strongly implicate the involvement of ROS in current augmentation in HEK 293 cells. Both antioxidants used in these studies (ascorbic acid or Trolox) fully prevented hypoxic augmentation of Ca2+ currents (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, for example, when depolarizing to a test potential of +20 mV, current densities in CH cells were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001; unpaired Student's t test) from –15.5 ± 1.1 pA/pF (n = 10) to –7.8 ± 0.9 pA/pF (n = 12) in CH cells treated with 200 μm ascorbic acid. Additionally when depolarizing to a test potential of + 20mV, current densities in CH cells were significantly decreased (p < 0.005; unpaired Student's t test) from –18.3 ± 2.4 pA/pF (n = 10) to –7.2 ± 1.3 pA/pF (n = 7) by 500 μm Trolox. Neither agent had an effect on current densities in control (normoxically incubated) cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, our data to date suggest that chronic hypoxia augmented L-type Ca2+ channel currents in HEK 293 cells via a mechanism that involved ROS production and required the formation of AβPs. Altered Mitochondrial Function Underlies Ca2+ Current Regulation during CH—Our data above clearly demonstrated a role for ROS in augmenting Ca2+ currents during CH, and both mitochondria (20Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3608) Google Scholar) and AβPs (21Hensley K. Carney J.M. Mattson M.P. Aksenova M. Harris M. Wu J.F. Floyd R.A. Butterfield D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) possess the ability to produce ROS in normoxia and hypoxia. To investigate the involvement of the mitochondrial ETC as source of ROS, we created a line of α1C subunit-expressing HEK 293 cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA and as such lacking a functional ETC (Refs. 16King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar and 22Waypa G.B. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar; Fig. 3, A and B). In these ρ0 cells, depolarization-evoked Ca2+ currents were moderately reduced in magnitude compared with those evoked in ρ+ cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, at +10 mV current densities were reduced from –7.8 ± 0.8 pA/pF (n = 20) in ρ+ cells to –6.5 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 30; p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test) in the mitochondria-depleted ρ0 line. This is suggestive of a role of the ETC in promoting basal channel activity and/or expression. To investigate the involvement of the ETC in responses to CH, we exposed ρ+ and ρ0 cells to hypoxia (6% O2) for 24 h. In contrast to the effect of CH on Ca2+ currents in wild-type (ρ+) cells (e.g. see Fig. 1A), exposure to CH for 24 h was without effect on Ca2+ currents in ρ0 cells (Fig. 3D). For example, at a test potential of +10 mV current densities were –6.5 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 30) in cells incubated in normoxia and –5.6 ± 0.7 pA/pF (n = 16) in cells incubated under chronically hypoxic conditions (p > 0.05, unpaired Student's t test). Thus, a functional ETC is requisite for transducing a chronically hypoxic stimulus into Ca2+ current enhancement. Because complex I of the mitochondrial ETC has been proposed to act as an O2 sensor in both the carotid body (23Wyatt C.N. Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the lung vasculature (22Waypa G.B. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), we examined Ca2+ current densities in ρ+ cells co-incubated with the complex I inhibitor rotenone during either normoxia or CH. Consistent with the ρ0 data, rotenone abolished the enhancement of Ca2+ currents caused by chronic hypoxia (Fig. 3E). For example, at a test potential of +10 mV, current densities were –9.2 ± 3.7 pA/pF (n = 11) in normoxic cells, –23.0 ± 3.7 pA/pF (n = 12) in chronically hypoxic cells, and –9.4 ± 3.1 pA/pF (n = 8) in cells incubated under chronically hypoxic conditions in the presence of 1 μm rotenone (Fig. 3F). This effect of rotenone was not due to a nonspecific action because 1 μm rotenone was without effect on Ca2+ current densities in cells incubated under normoxic conditions with the inhibitor (Fig. 3F). Oxidant Production Precedes AβP Production during CH— Ca2+ current augmentation during CH is dependent on the production of AβPs (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the above experiments in addition to our previous data (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were unable to discern whether AβP production is causative of (24Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) or a consequence of (25Smith M.A. Drew K.L. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Hirai K. Zhu X. Atwood C.S. Raina A.K. Rottkamp C.A. Sayre L.M. Friedland R.P. Perry G. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) mitochondrial dysfunction. To address this, we examined Ca2+ currents in ρ0 cells incubated overnight in 50 nm Aβ-(1–40). Similar to that observed in ρ+ cells, mean Ca2+ current densities were significantly increased following this intervention (Fig. 4A) such that at a test potential of +10 mV current densities were –6.5 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 30) in control cells and –9.3 ± 1.0 pA/pF (n = 12) following incubation in Aβ-(1–40) (p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test). Thus, because in ρ0 cells Ca2+ currents were augmented by Aβ-(1–40) but not by CH, altered mitochondrial function and ROS production lie upstream of AβP production and Ca2+ current augmentation. In support of this, 200 μm ascorbate was without effect on the Aβ-(1–40)-mediated augmentation of Ca2+ currents in ρ0 cells (Fig. 4B). Current densities at +10 mV were –6.6 ± 1.7 pA/pF (n = 7) under control conditions and –11.4 ± 1.3 pA/pF (n = 9) following exposure to 50 nm Aβ-(1–40) and 200 μm ascorbate (p > 0.05 when comparing currents in Aβ-(1–40)-treated cells in the absence and presence of ascorbate; unpaired Student's t test). Superoxide Production in the ETC Underlies AβP Production during CH—In ETC-deficient ρ0 cells, which lack the ability to produce ROS during hypoxia (26Schroedl C. McClintock D.S. Budinger G.R. Chandel N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L922-L931Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a 6-h incubation in the superoxide-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) system (100 μm/5 milliunits ml–1) mimicked the response to CH. At all activating test potentials, Ca2+ currents were increased in cells exposed to X/XO when compared with controls (Fig. 5A). At a test potential of +10 mV, this effect was statistically significant (p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test; Fig. 5B). The increase in Ca2+ current due to X/XO was mediated by enhanced production of AβPs because its effects were abolished by the γ-secretase inhibitors γ-VI (10 μm), γ-X (100 nm), and BSI (100 nm) (Fig. 5B). Furthermore the effect of X/XO was abolished by 400 μm ascorbate (Fig. 5B), indicating that its action was mediated by superoxide production and not by a nonspecific effect. Mean current densities in the presence of either secretase inhibitor or ascorbate were not significantly different from that of the control group (p > 0.05, unpaired Student's t test; Fig. 5B). Because the AβP-dependent effects of CH were reproduced in ρ0 cells by pharmacologically evoked ROS production, these data support the hypothesis that during CH oxidant production within the mitochondrial ETC precedes AβP-mediated augmentation of Ca2+ currents. To provide support for this hypothesis, we carried out immunocytochemical staining of HEK 293 cells using the 3D6 antibody raised against the five N-terminal amino acids of AβP that has been previously shown to selectively recognize AβP species and not secreted forms of the amyloid precursor protein (27Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Leiberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, unlike wild-type (ρ+) HEK 293 cells (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) CH caused no increase in the expression of AβPs in ρ0 cells. However, exogenous production of superoxide via the X/XO system enhanced the expression of AβPs in these cells (Fig. 5C, right). A characteristic feature of Alzheimer disease is neurodegeneration due to the build-up of AβPs subsequent to altered cleavage of precursors of these neurotoxic proteins (28Walter J. Kaether C. Steiner H. Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Wolfe M.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 233-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following ischemic episodes such as those that occur during stroke, enhanced activity of the β- and γ-secretases responsible for cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into toxic amyloid peptides (7Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 8Vassar R. Citron M. Neuron. 2000; 27: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) leads to their accumulation (10Smith I.F. Boyle J.P. Green K.N. Pearson H.A. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Wen Y. Onyewuchi O. Yang S. Liu R. Simpkins J.W. Brain Res. 2004; 1009: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Subsequently neurodegeneration may occur due to Ca2+-dependent processes and as a consequence of AβP-induced Ca2+ dyshomeostasis. In support of this, recent studies in neuronal PC12 cells have demonstrated that prolonged incubation under hypoxic conditions, an intervention designed to mimic ischemic stroke, enhances both voltage-dependent (L-type) and voltage-independent plasmalemmal Ca2+ entry pathways (19Green K.N. Boyle J.P. Peers C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Green K.N. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This enhancement was dependent on CH-induced elevation of AβP levels because the effects of CH on Ca2+ currents were mimicked by exogenously applied AβPs and abrogated by secretase inhibitors or a monoclonal antibody raised against AβP (19Green K.N. Boyle J.P. Peers C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Green K.N. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that the effect of CH on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry pathway could be mimicked in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the α1C subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of CH appeared to be due to a direct interaction of AβPs with the pore-forming subunit, and we extended this finding to demonstrate that Ca2+ current enhancement was due to AβP-mediated enhanced trafficking toward, or retention within, the plasma membrane (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, it has been shown previously that CH enhancement of Ca2+ currents was abrogated by antioxidants (18Green K.N. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 5: 1043-1051Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), giving evidence for the altered production of highly reactive oxidant molecules in mediating the effects of CH. In accordance with this, in the current studies we demonstrated that the enhancement of L-type Ca2+ currents by CH was abrogated by concomitant incubation with the antioxidants ascorbic acid or Trolox. This effect could not be attributed to a nonspecific effect of these agents because they were without effect on Ca2+ currents under normoxic conditions. Because ROS production due to inefficiencies in the mitochondrial ETC has been implicated in hypoxic signaling in numerous cell types (20Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3608) Google Scholar), we explored the hypothesis that mitochondrial ROS production mediates the effects of CH on the L-type channel. To do this, we examined the effects of CH in a line of HEK 293 cells that were depleted of mitochondrial DNA and as such exhibit no functional ETC and lack the ability to produce ROS during hypoxia (26Schroedl C. McClintock D.S. Budinger G.R. Chandel N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L922-L931Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In these cells, CH caused no change in Ca2+ current amplitudes, implicating a role of the ETC in chronic O2 sensing. Similar to acute hypoxia sensing in the carotid body, the location of the O2 sensor may reside within complex I of the mitochondrial ETC (23Wyatt C.N. Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) because the effects of CH were also ablated by the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Thus, the ETC provides a vital link between CH and enhanced Ca2+ currents that to our knowledge may provide the first demonstration that complex I acts as an O2 sensor to regulate ion channel activity during prolonged exposure to hypoxia. The fact that the effects of CH were abrogated by antioxidants suggests that regulation of complex I activity during chronic hypoxia enhances oxidant production, a suggestion in accordance with previous studies (22Waypa G.B. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Prior to the current study, the temporal contributions of AβPs and ROS to Ca2+ dyshomeostasis remained to be addressed. AβPs themselves are capable of producing ROS in vitro (21Hensley K. Carney J.M. Mattson M.P. Aksenova M. Harris M. Wu J.F. Floyd R.A. Butterfield D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), and a recent study demonstrated that AβPs are able to induce both mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS levels, although this may be cell type-specific because these effects of AβPs were observed in isolated astrocytes but not neurons (24Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is a large body of evidence to suggest that compromised mitochondrial function and the ensuing ROS production are responsible for elevating AβP levels as part of a physiological neuroprotective mechanism utilizing the antioxidant properties of AβPs (25Smith M.A. Drew K.L. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Hirai K. Zhu X. Atwood C.S. Raina A.K. Rottkamp C.A. Sayre L.M. Friedland R.P. Perry G. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we report that Aβ-(1–40) enhanced voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in HEK 293 cells that were depleted of a functional mitochondrial ETC. This is in stark contrast to the lack of effect of CH in these ρ0 cells. The most plausible explanation for this finding is that CH causes altered mitochondrial function, which is a trigger for AβP production and subsequently for the trafficking/membrane retention of α1C subunits (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, these data provide compelling evidence that, in terms of Ca2+ dyshomeostasis due to CH, altered mitochondrial function temporally precedes the enhanced production of AβPs. Our data utilizing rotenone as a specific inhibitor of complex I suggest a role for this ETC complex in chronic O2 sensing. Along with complex III (31Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), the ubisemiquinone site of mitochondrial complex I is a site of superoxide ( (O2·¯)) production (32Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To probe the role of O2·¯ production in mediating AβP production, we incubated ρ0 cells in the O2·¯-generating X/XO system (33Valencia A. Moran J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1112-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and examined Ca2+ current amplitudes. The ability of this system to mimic CH by enhancing Ca2+ currents supports a role for O2·¯ in hypoxic signal transduction. Given that the effects of CH were ablated by anti-AβP antibodies and secretase inhibitors (4Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Boyle J. Ball S.G. Varadi G. Peers C. FASEB J. 2004; 19: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), taken together these data suggest a role for (O2·¯) in promoting AβP production. In support of this proposal, we found that the effects of O2·¯ production (via X/XO) on Ca2+ currents were abolished by selective inhibitors of the AβP-producing β- and γ-secretases. Furthermore X/XO increased the intensity of immunocytochemical staining of ρ0 HEK 293 cells when using the AβP-specific 3D6 primary antibody (27Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Leiberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, AβP accumulation in mice genetically engineered to remove their ability to dismutate O2·¯ (34Li F. Calingasan N.Y. Yu F. Mauck W.M. Toidze M. Almeida C.G. Takahashi R.H. Carlson G.A. Flint Beal M. Lin M.T. Gouras G.K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 289: 1308-1312Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) supports this proposed role of O2·¯ in enhancing AβP production. In summary, our data support the proposal that during prolonged exposure to hypoxia, regulation of the mitochondrial ETC enhances O2·¯ production, which elevates AβP production and consequently alters cellular Ca2+ homeostasis by the trafficking/retention of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel α1C subunits. Interestingly the protein levels of two components of complex I have been reported to be reduced in the brains of Alzheimer patients (35Kim S.H. Vlkolinsky R. Cairns N. Fountoulakis M. Lubec G. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and thus ETC regulation may provide a causal link between hypoxic episodes such as those that occur during brain ischemia and the resultant Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and subsequent neurodegeneration, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer disease.

https://openalex.org/W2037460386,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinases. CDK2 acts as a checkpoint for the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. Despite a down-regulation of CDK2 activity in postmitotic cells, many cell types, including muscle cells, maintain abundant levels of CDK2 protein. This led us to hypothesize that CDK2 may have a function in postmitotic cells. We show here for the first time that CDK2 can be activated by neuregulin (NRG) in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In addition, this activity is required for expression of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) ϵ subunit. The switch from the fetal AChRγ subunit to the adult-type AChRϵ is required for synapse maturation and the neuromuscular junction. Inhibition of CDK2 activity with either the specific CDK2 inhibitory peptide Tat-LFG or by RNA interference abolished neuregulin-induced AChRϵ expression. Neuregulin-induced activation of CDK2 also depended on the ErbB receptor, MAPK, and PI3K, all of which have previously been shown to be required for AChRϵ expression. Neuregulin regulated CDK2 activity through coordinating phosphorylation of CDK2 on Thr-160, accumulation of CDK2 in the nucleus, and down-regulation of the CDK2 inhibitory protein p27 in the nucleus. In addition, we also observed a novel mechanism of regulation of CDK2 activity by a low molecular weight variant of cyclin E in response to NRG. These findings establish CDK2 as an intermediate molecule that integrates NRG-activated signals from both the MAPK and PI3K pathways to AChRϵ expression and reveal an undiscovered physiological role for CDK2 in postmitotic cells.

Of the 11 CDKs identified thus far (1Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.-L. Su L.-K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.-H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), six (CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK6, and CDK7) have known roles in the regulation of the cell cycle (2Vermeulen K.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Its activity is high in proliferating cells and virtually absent in quiescent cells. Interestingly, despite the loss of CDK2 activity, many cell types express high CDK2 protein levels following differentiation (9Ding Q.M. Ko T.C. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1193-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Watanabe Y. Watanabe T. Kitagawa M. Taya Y. Nakayama K. Motoyama N.

This led us to speculate that CDK2 may have a function in postmitotic cells, In proliferating myoblasts, CDK2 also negatively regulates myogenic processes. For example, CDK2 phosphorylates and inactivates the muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD (13Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbe J.C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and suppresses the expression of muscle-specific creatine kinase (14Guo K. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The decrease in CDK2 activity during myogenesis is associated with up-regulation of its inhibitor proteins, p21 and p27 (12Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and the level of CDK2 protein is similar in murine C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes (11Tedesco D. Baron L. Fischer-Fantuzzi L. Vesco C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2217-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, following differentiation of C2C12 cells, both cyclin A- and cyclin E-associated CDK2 kinase activities decrease, the former due to reduced complex formation and the latter due to increased p27 binding (16Chu C.Y. Lim R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1497: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Synapse maturation in differentiated muscle requires replacement of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) γ subunit with the AChRϵ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 17Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). This subunit switch is accompanied by a change in channel conductance and mean open time (18Gu Y. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 117-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to modification of channel properties, the AChRϵ subunit is required for receptor clustering and many of the other morphological and molecular changes characteristic of the mature synapse (17Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 19Missias A.C. Mudd J. Cunningham J.M. Steinbach J.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R.

Postsynaptic expression of the AChRϵ subunit requires neuregulin-β1 (NRG, also known as acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity (ARIA), heregulin-β, or neu-differentiation factor), a neural factor released from both motoneurons (21Usdin T.B.

Subsequently, the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (27Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways (28Altiok S. Batt D. Altiok N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32274-32278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) become activated, and both pathways have been reported to be required for AChRϵ induction (29Tansey M.G. Chu G.C. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that CDK5, a non-cell cycle-regulating CDK, associates with ErbB2 and ErbB3 and is required for NRG-induced ErbB phosphorylation, MAPK phosphorylation, and AChRϵ induction (30Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the downstream molecular events that couple these signaling pathways with AChRϵ gene expression. NRG increases CDK2 protein levels in SKBr3 breast cancer cells (31Le X.F. McWatters A. Wiener J. Wu J.Y. Mills G.B. Bast Jr., R.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 260-270PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the MAPK and/or PI3K pathways have been implicated in CDK2-mediated cell cycle control through regulation of p27 degradation and CDK2 phosphorylation (32Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 33Lents N.H. Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47469-47475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that CDK2 may be a downstream component in NRG signaling that integrates both the MAPK and PI3K pathways. In the present study, we showed that NRG activates CDK2 in differentiated C2C12 myotubes and that CDK2 is required for NRG-induced AChRϵ gene expression. We also demonstrated novel regulation of CDK2 by a cyclin E variant. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a physiological role for a cell cycle-regulating CDK in postmitotic, terminally differentiated cells. Materials—Recombinant neuregulin (rNRG-β1, catalog number 396-HB) was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The CDK2 inhibitory peptide Tat-LFG was synthesized by Synpep Corporation (Dublin, CA). AG1478, PD98059, and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Murine C2C12 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained as undifferentiated myoblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with 15 mm Hepes, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin + 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Differentiation into myotubes was performed by replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15 mm Hepes, 2% equine serum, and penicillin + streptomycin after cells reached confluence (27Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The differentiation medium was changed daily. Fully differentiated myotubes were observed by day 3–4 in differentiation medium. On day 3, the myotubes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h prior to use. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) according to the suggested protocol, with the addition of two extra acid phenol:chloroform extractions. RNA quantity and quality were assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Lab Chip Kit (Agilent, Foster City, CA). Five μg of total RNA was used in a 20-μl reverse transcriptase reaction (SuperScript™ First-Strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Parallel reactions without reverse transcriptase were performed to ensure that there was no amplification from genomic DNA. Real-time PCR and Data Analysis—Primers were designed using MacVector™ 7.0 software, and the specificity of primers was checked against GenBank™ using Blastn software. Primers were synthesized by Operon (Alemada, CA). Primer sequences are as follows: AChRϵ (GenBank™ accession number NM_009603) forward, 5′-GCGGAGCGAACTCGTGTTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACAGCAGCGGATTTCTGGGG-3′ 103-bp PCR product and GAPDH (negative control, GenBank™ accession number AB017801) forward, 5′-CCAAGGCTGTGGGCAAGGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCAGGTTTCTCCAGGCGG-3′ 119-bp product. Real-time PCR was performed in a Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) using the LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I dye intercalation assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with 0.25-μg RNA equivalent of cDNA, 0.5 μm each primer, and 1.65 mm MgCl2 in a final reaction volume of 25 μl. Fluorescence measurements were taken during the 72 °C extension step in each cycle. Melt curve analysis showed a single sharp peak for all samples, indicating single product formation. Parallel samples without reverse transcriptase showed no product formation. The purity and specificity of PCR products was verified by gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The primary curve method was used to calculate threshold cycle (Ct), defined as the cycle at which the fluorescence level reaches a predetermined threshold. The Ct was measured for each reaction and used to calculate the fold change of each experimental sample compared with the control sample according to the equation: fold change = 2–ΔCt, where ΔCt = (Ct)Experimental – (Ct)Control. Western Blot Analyses—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. For ErbB2 and phospo-ErbB2 analyses, 0.25% deoxycholate was added. Protein levels were quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (86Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Forty μg of total protein/sample was run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For most proteins, membranes were washed and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (either ECL Plus™ (Amersham Biosciences) or Femto Super Signal substrate, catalog number 34095 (Pierce). For cyclins A and E, we were unable to find both good monoclonal and good polyclonal antibodies; therefore, in the co-immunoprecipitation assays, horseradish peroxidase was conjugated directly to the primary antibody. For anti-cyclin E, the antibody was purified with NAb™ spin purification kits (catalog number 45200, Pierce), desalted with protein desalting spin columns (catalog number 89862, Pierce), and then conjugated with an EZ-Link™ Plus activated peroxidase kit (catalog number 31489, Pierce). For anti-cyclin A, carrier bovine serum albumin was first removed with the SwellGel Blue albumin removal kit (catalog number 89845, Pierce), and then the antibody was subjected to the same process as anti-cyclin E. Anti-phospho-CDKThr-160 (catalog number 2561), anti-MAPK (9102), anti-phospho-MAPK (9106), anti-Akt (9272), anti-phospho-Akt (9271), anti-ErbB2 (2242), anti-phospho-ErbB2 (2241), anti-c-Jun (9162), and anti-phospho-threonine (9381) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Anti-p27 (catalog number 610241), anti-cyclin D3 monoclonal (610279), anti-Rb (14051A), anti-PKCα (610107), and anti-CDK2 monoclonal antibodies (610145) were from BD Biosciences. Anti-CDK5 (J-3, sc-6247), anti-cyclin D3 polyclonal (sc-182), and anti-actin (sc-1616) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CDK1 antibody (catalog number ab18), anti-cyclin A (ab2948), and anti-cyclin E (ab7959) were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). CDK2 and Cyclin Immunoprecipitation Assays—C2C12 cells were harvested as described above, except the concentration of Nonidet P-40 was 0.1%. Lysates (800 μg of total protein) were incubated with 5 μg of anti-CDK2 (M2, sc-163, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 μg of anti-cyclin E, or 5 μg of anti-cyclin D3 antibodies and 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 6 h at 4 °C. For Western blot analysis, the beads were boiled with loading buffer, and then samples were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For kinase assays, the beads were washed twice each with lysis buffer and kinase reaction buffer and then incubated in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing Rb for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling in gel loading buffer. Total Rb and phospho-Rb levels were analyzed by Western blot (anti-phospho-threonine antibody (catalog number 9381) was from Cell Signaling). Kinase buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 150 ng of Rb-C fusion protein (catalog number 6022, Cell Signaling). Cell Fractionation—Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation of C2C12 myotubes was performed using the CellLytic™ Nuclear™ extraction kit (Sigma) with some modifications. Cells cultured in 150-mm plates were rinsed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and placed on ice for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 3300 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube (S1), and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer. The cell suspension was passed eight times through a 27-gauge needle, followed by centrifugation at 3300 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. This supernatant (S2) was combined with the S1, and this was termed the “cytosolic fraction.” The pellet was extracted with 140 μl of extraction buffer and vortexed at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant from this spin was termed the “nuclear fraction.” Both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to obtain pure fractions. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes for mouse CDK2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_016756) were designed and synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX) using the algorithm developed by Cenix BioScience (Dresden, Germany). The sequences are: CDK2 sense, 5′-GGUGUACCCAGUACUGCCAtt-3′; CDK2 antisense, 5′-UGGCAGUACUGGGUACACCtt-3′. “Scramble” siRNA with the sequences: sense, 5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCGtt-3′ and antisense, 5′-CGAAUCCUACAAAGCGCGCtt-3′ had no homology to any known mammalian sequence and was synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) for use as a negative control. C2C12 myoblasts were plated in 6-well plates 2 days prior to transfection and used at ∼30–40% confluence. Complexes were formed with ∼10–20 pmol of siRNA and TransIT TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, the cells were fully confluent, and differentiation was induced as described above. CDK2 Is Activated by NRG in Differentiated C2C12 Myotubes—As a first step in testing the possibility that CDK2 is involved in AChRϵ induction, we confirmed CDK2 expression in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. Undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts fused into multinucleated myotubes ∼72–96 h after switching to differentiation medium, at which time spontaneous contractions could be observed. C2C12 myoblasts expressed abundant CDK2 protein, and CDK2 protein levels in differentiated myotubes decreased only slightly, in agreement with previous reports (11Tedesco D. Baron L. Fischer-Fantuzzi L. Vesco C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2217-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We also characterized the expression of several other CDKs. In contrast to CDK2, CDK1 was abundantly expressed in C2C12 myoblasts, but its expression decreased to undetectable levels upon myotube formation. CDK5 levels were essentially unchanged or slightly up-regulated, in agreement with a previous report that CDK5 protein levels and kinase activity increase during muscle differentiation (34Lazaro J.B. Kitzmann M. Poul M.A. Vandromme M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then compared CDK2 activity in myoblasts and myotubes by measuring the ability of immunoprecipitated CDK2 to phosphorylate Rb in vitro (35Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H. Suzuki I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 36Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We observed that basal CDK2 activity was dramatically lowered in differentiated myotubes compared with undifferentiated myoblasts (Fig. 1B). The sustained level of CDK2 expression in myotubes led us to speculate that it might be involved in a postmitotic function. To test this possibility, we examined the response of CDK2 activity to treatment with NRG in differentiated myotubes. It has been shown that phosphorylation of CDK2 on Thr-160 is required for its activation (37Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Using an antibody specific for phospho-CDK2Thr-160, we demonstrated that NRG treatment of differentiated C2C12 myotubes caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in CDK2 phosphorylation without changing the total CDK2 protein level (Fig. 1C). CDK2 was then immunoprecipitated from differentiated myotubes that had been treated with 2 nm NRG, and its kinase activity was determined in the in vitro assay. Treatment with NRG greatly enhanced CDK2 kinase activity in differentiated myotubes (Fig. 1D). These findings demonstrated that CDK2 is activated by NRG in differentiated C2C12 myotubes and suggested that CDK2 is indeed involved in postmitotic functions. CDK2 Activity Is Required for NRG-induced Expression of AChRϵ —We next performed experiments to determine whether CDK2 is involved in NRG-induced AChRϵ expression. We first used a CDK2 inhibitor to determine whether blocking CDK2 activity prevented induction of AChRϵ. Tat-LFG is a short peptide that specifically inhibits cyclin A-, B-, and E-associated CDK activities (i.e. CDK1 and CDK2) (38Chen Y.N. Sharma S.K. Ramsey T.M. Jiang L. Martin M.S. Baker K. Adams P.D. Bair K.W. Kaelin W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The peptide serves as a docking site for cyclin/CDK complexes and blocks the phosphorylation of substrates by cyclin A/CDK2 or cyclin E/CDK2. We found that Tat-LFG effectively prevented CDK2 activation by NRG in differentiated C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2A). We then used real-time PCR to measure AChRϵ mRNA expression in response to NRG in the presence of Tat-LFG. NRG stimulated AChRϵ mRNA expression, and pretreatment of C2C12 myotubes with 60 μm Tat-LFG completely blocked the NRG-induced increase in AChRϵ mRNA (Fig. 2B). Treatment with the control peptide Tat had no effect on AChRϵ induction. Similar results were obtained with another slightly less potent inhibitory peptide, Tat-LDL (not shown). The absence of CDK1 in differentiated myotubes (Fig. 1A) makes it unlikely that the effect of Tat-LFG on AChRϵ expression is because of inhibition of cyclin A/CDK1 or cyclin B/CDK1 complexes. These results demonstrated that CDK2 activity is required for NRG-induced AChRϵ expression. To further confirm that CDK2 is involved in AChRϵ induction, we used RNA interference to specifically knock down expression of CDK2 protein. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with a siRNA duplex specific for CDK2 or with a control (scramble) siRNA that has no homology to any known mammalian sequence. Following the transfection, the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes proceeded normally. Western blotting and image analysis showed that transfection with CDK2 siRNA decreased CDK2 protein levels by ∼80% (Fig. 2C). NRG-induced AChRϵ expression was unaffected in cells transfected with scramble (control) siRNA and was almost completely blocked in cells transfected with CDK2 siRNA (Fig. 2D). This inhibitory effect on AChRϵ expression was specific for CDK2, as CDK5 protein levels were unaffected by CDK2 siRNA treatment. These results confirm that CDK2 activity is required for AChRϵ induction by NRG. NRG-induced CDK2 Activity Is Downstream of ErbB, MAPK, and PI3K—We next sought to determine the location of CDK2 in the NRG signaling pathway. NRG-ErbB signaling activates both the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways (39Marte B.M. Graus-Porta D. Jeschke M. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sepp-Lorenzino L. Eberhard I. Ma Z. Cho C. Serve H. Liu F. Rosen N. Lupu R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1679-1687PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hamburger A.W.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H2026-H2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that NRG-induced phosphorylation of ErbB receptors is necessary for subsequent MAPK and PI3K activation (30Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat.

Cancer. 2002; 100: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Additionally, both the MAPK and PI3K pathways are reported to be necessary for NRG-induced AChRϵ expression (29Tansey M.G. Chu G.C. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We found that blockade of either the MAPK pathway with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) or blockade of the PI3K pathway with LY294002 (40 μm) abolished NRG-induced AChRϵ expression (Fig. 3A). NRG-induced CDK2 kinase activity (Fig. 3, B and C) was similarly abolished by inhibition of ErbB receptors (with AG1478, Ref. 45Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) or by inhibition of the MAPK or PI3K pathways. The specificities of these drugs are well established, and we confirmed that the PI3K pathway remained activated when the MAPK pathway was blocked and vice versa (not shown). This demonstrates that CDK2 activation by NRG is dependent on both the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Furthermore, whereas inhibition of CDK2 prevented NRG-induced AChRϵ induction, neither treatment with Tat-LFG (Fig. 4A) nor CDK2 knockdown by siRNA (Fig. 4B) affected NRG-induced phosphorylation of ErbB2, MAPK, or Akt. Taken together, these data indicate that CDK2 is downstream of ErbB2, MAPK, and PI3K in the NRG signaling pathway.Fig. 4Inhibition of CDK2 has no effect on NRG-induced phosphorylation of ErbB2, MAPK, or PI3K. A, inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity with Tat-LFG did not block NRG-induced phosphorylation of ErbB2, MAPK, or Akt. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were pretreated with 60 μm Tat-LFG or vehicle for 1 h and then treated with 2"
https://openalex.org/W2057787049,"The chicken β-globin locus represents a well characterized system to study the role of both proximal and distal regulatory elements in a eukaryotic multigene domain. The function of the chicken β<sup>A</sup>/ϵ-intergenic enhancer and upstream regulatory elements 5′-HS1 and 5′-HS2 were studied using a gene targeting approach in chicken DT40 cells followed by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into human erythroleukemia cells (K562). These regulatory elements all repressed expression of the ρ- and β<sup>H</sup>-chicken globin genes in the chromosome transfer assay. No ρ- or β<sup>H</sup>-globin gene expression was detected in K562 cells containing the chicken chromosome without deletions, whereas ρ- and β<sup>H</sup>-mRNA was activated in K562 cells containing chicken chromosomes with deletions of the intergenic enhancers, 5′-HS1 and 5′-HS2. Transcriptional activation of the ρ- and β<sup>H</sup>-globin genes correlated with hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4, loss of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, and binding of RNA polymerase II to the gene promoters. Surprisingly, the status of CpG dinucleotide methylation at the promoters did not correlate with the transcriptional status of the genes. Our results using a chromosomal transfer assay demonstrate an identical silencing function for these regulatory elements, which suggests they function as part of a common silencing pathway or complex."
