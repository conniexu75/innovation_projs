https://openalex.org/W1508315241,"Light-dependent membrane potentials, ionic fluxes, and volume changes were measured in two kinds of Halobacterium halobium cell envelope vesicles: one containing bacteriorhodopsin and another halorhodopsin. Bacteriorhodopsin-containing vesicles extruded protons by a primary electrogenic mechanism and an energized volume decrease was observed. This was shown to be the consequences of sodium extrusion via proton/sodium antiport (which recirculated protons) and the accompanying passive chloride extrusion. Halorhodopsin-containing vesicles, in contrast, exhibited a volume increase during illumination, apparently caused by primary inward transport of chloride, and accompanied by passive cation (sodium or potassium, and proton) uptake. It was demonstrated that the chloride transport will occur against both electrical and concentration gradients across the vesicle membrane. Moreover, chloride was required on the vesicle exterior for the light-dependent generation of membrane potential, pH change, and swelling. These observations are inconsistent with an earlier proposal that halorhodopsin is an outward directed sodium pump, but suggest very strongly that it is an inward directed chloride pump. Quantitative arguments from the present work rule out a significant role of sodium in the functioning of halorhodopsin."

The circular dichroic spectrum taken in the 190-240 nm range for a zein protein mixture in methanol solution showed the zein secondary structure to be largely helical. The polar, hydrophobic, and turn characteristics of the zein residues, as well as the homologous repeat units in their primary sequences, suggested a structure with nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. Polar residues distributed along the helical surfaces allowed intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding such that the zein molecules could be arranged in planes. The proposed glutamine-rich turns located between the helices and at the cylindrical caps would favor side chain interactions resulting in stacking of the molecular planes. Physical properties observed for the zein proteins are explained by the model."

https://openalex.org/W1541352023,"We have identified the subunits of the insulin receptor using immunoprecipitation by antibodies to the insulin receptor after either biosynthetic or surface labeling of cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9). With this approach, we have found there are two major, Mr = 135,000 (alpha), Mr = 95,000 (beta) and one minor, Mr = 210,000 (gamma) subunit. Peptide mapping clearly demonstrates that the major peptides of the alpha and beta subunits are different, whereas similarities exist in the peptide fragments of the gamma subunit and the alpha and beta subunits after limited proteolysis. The gamma subunit, however, is not simply a disulfide heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits, since this subunit was not reduced by 100 mM dithiothreitol plus 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, or even under more potent denaturing conditions, such as 8 M guanidine-HCL and mercaptoethanol at pH 10.5. In nonreduced gels, free insulin receptor subunits are observed, as well as two higher molecular weight bands of Mr = 520,000 and 350,000. On reduction, the 520,000 band was composed primarily of Mr = 210,000 and 95,000 subunits, whereas the 350,000 band was composed primarily of Mr = 135,000 and 95,000 subunits. These data suggest that the two major subunits of the insulin receptor (alpha and beta) are distinct. In addition, there is a third component of the receptor identifiable of 210,000 which may be a proreceptor or some closely associated effector protein. Furthermore, it appears that in the native state several kinds of disulfide oligomers of these subunits exist. These findings suggest a complex model for insulin receptor synthesis and insertion into the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1597030361,"Bacterial endotoxin is a potent inducer of the serum amyloid protein (apo-SAA), a high density lipoprotein (HDL) apoprotein. In a study of the induction of apo-SAA and the structure of apo-SAA-rich lipoprotein particles in mice, we have observed that, following intraperitoneal administration of Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (50 micrograms), plasma apo-SAA levels rose from base-line levels of less than 1% to greater than 20% of the HDL protein content at 20 h postinjection. No changes in the relative content of other HDL apoproteins were noted; analysis of apo-SAA-rich HDL lipid content indicated a significant decrease (10%) in phospholipid content relative to that of control HDL. Two major apo-SAA isotypes, apo-SAA1 and apo-SAA2, were identified, having apparent molecular weights of 12,600 and 11,800, respectively, and isoelectric points of 6.35 and 6.20, respectively. Quantitative immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that essentially all of the apo-SAA was bound to lipoprotein particles containing apo-A-I. Apo-SAA was distributed among higher density HDL subfractions than were other HDL apoproteins following density gradient centrifugation, and subfractions having apo-SAA:apo-A-I molar ratios of greater than 2:1 were identified. These results indicate the formation of a subset of apo-SAA-rich HDL particles following apo-SAA induction by endotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W162671065,"Laminin, the glycoprotein of basement membranes, migrates as two components of 200 kilodaltons (kDa) (alpha subunit) and 400 kDa (beta subunit) after reduction on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have isolated the alpha subunit and studied its structure by electron microscopy and its function as an attachment factor for tumor cells. Using selective proteolysis of laminin by alpha-thrombin, the beta subunit was removed without any change in the quantity or size of the alpha subunit. Removal of the beta subunit caused a 35-40% decrease in the total mass of the laminin molecule. The alpha and beta subunits differed by 50-fold in the amount of reducing agent required for complete migration on polyacrylamide gels. By electron microscopy, the whole laminin molecule appeared as a cross with three identical short arms (37 nm) and one long arm (75 nm). The alpha subunit examined by electron microscopy was missing the long arm and had no change in the length of the three short arms. This subunit of laminin mediated the attachment of human squamous carcinoma cells to type IV collagen. Such attachment properties were lost after pepsin treatment which is known to remove the globular end regions of the short arms. We conclude that the beta subunit of laminin is embodied in the long arm of the molecule and that the alpha subunit consists of three similar chains of 200 kDa. The globular end regions of the laminin short arms are required for the attachment of tumor cells to type IV collagen."
https://openalex.org/W19129488,"Exposure of intact leucocytes to 0.25 m~ ~-[~~S]cystine dimethyl ester resulted in intralysosomal ester hydrolysis and free cystine accumulation in the isolated lysosome-rich granular fractions of normal, heterozygous, and cystinotic cells. Loaded normal and cystinotic granular fractions were incubated in 0.25 m~ sucrose, 10 m~ 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0, at 37 “C under conditions in which lysosomal integrity, assessed by latency ofhexosaminidase, was substantially preserved. Serial aliquots were washed and treated with 10 m~ N-ethylmaleimide, and [35S]cystine and [3SS]cysteine-N-ethyImaleimide were analyzed by high voltage electrophoresis. Half-times for [36S]cystine loss from loaded cystinotic granular fractions (80.8 min f 10.7 S.E., N = 12) were much slower than normal (26.1 f 1.4, N = 13), with heterozygous intermediate (43.5 f 3.1, N = 8) (all p < 0.01). In contrast, for [35S]cysteine disposal, mean cystinotic TIf2 was 18.3 min f 0.9, heterozygous 16.9 zk 0.5, and normal 14.1 * 0.7. The rate of disposal of t3H] tryptophan from cystinotic granular fractions loaded with ~-[~H]tryptophan methyl ester (mean TlIz = 28.9 min) did not differ from normal (mean TlIz = 25.6 min). Similarly, ~-[~I€Jmethionine exodus from cystinotic granular fractions (mean = 17.5 min) was indistinguishable from normal (mean Tr,z = 17.2 min). Loading with unlabeled cystine dimethyl ester and serial assay of granular fraction cystine verified that cystinotic granular fractions fail to dispose of cystine. Under appropriate conditions, loss of cystine from normal granular fractions was quantitatively accounted for by cystine recovered in the medium. We conclude that isolated cystinotic lysosomes demonstrate a pronounced, selective defect in the exodus of cystine, but not of the other amino acids examined."
https://openalex.org/W1571880088,"Nonmuscle, smooth muscle, and striated muscle tissue extracts contain several proteins, in addition to calmodulin, which bind fluphenazine affinity columns in a calcium-dependent manner. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis shows four proteins in red blood cell lysates with Mr = 22,000, 12,000, 9,000, and 8,000. Rat brain tissue contains an 11,000-dalton peptide, while chicken gizzard and rabbit longissimus dorsi muscles have a similar set of peptides (67,000, 35,000, 33,000, and 11,000 daltons). These proteins all interact independently with fluphenazine and, except for the 22,000-dalton protein from red blood cells, do not bind to calmodulin-Sepharose affinity columns. Binding requires the presence of micromolar calcium, and dissociation occurs only by chelation of calcium with EDTA or ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The muscle tissue proteins are present in ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid eluates from N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide- and phenothiazine-coupled Sepharose resins but are not bound to a Sepharose column without a coupled drug. These results suggest that the use of phenothiazines to indicate calmodulin action should be judiciously interpreted. These proteins may be functionally analogous to calmodulin in that they form a drug-binding site in a calcium-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1578118950,"The carbohydrate composition of fibrinogen and constituent S-carboxymethylated chains was determined. All the carbohydrate on the parent molecule could be accounted for on the B beta and gamma chains. The A alpha chain was found to be devoid of carbohydrate. Glycopeptides were prepared from fibrinogen, B beta, and gamma chains by pronase digestion and subsequent chromatography on Sephadex G-50. The 300-MHz 1H-NMR spectra of glycopeptides from all three sources were consistent with biantennary type oligosaccharide chains. The glycopeptides resulting from exoglycosidase digestions were examined with 300-MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy, and the changes in the signals caused by selective removal of sugar residues were studied. This technique enabled us to assign each anomeric proton to the corresponding monosaccharide unit independent of previous work. Our results indicate that fibrinogen glycopeptides are of the biantennary type, and are in complete agreement with the previously reported peak assignments (Vliegenthart, J. F. G., van Halbeek, H., and Dorland, L. (1981) Pure Appl. Chemn. 53, 45-77). Affinity chromatography of the glycopeptides on concanavalin A-Sepharose also showed that the glycopeptides from fibrinogen are greater than 95% biantennary oligosaccharide chains. Based on carbohydrate composition, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, sequential exoglycosidase digestion, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of derived partially methylated alditol acetates, we propose that fibrinogen contains four oligosaccharide chains of the structure shown below.

https://openalex.org/W1540273262,"A biphasic time course of the agonist-mediated loss of muscarinic cholinergic receptors has been demonstrated in cultured chick embryo heart cells by radioligand binding studies using the muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB). This agonist-mediated receptor loss was associated with decreased affinity of the receptor for agonist as judged by competitive binding of the agonist carbamylcholine with [3H]QNB to cell homogenates (Galper, J. B., and Smith, T. W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9571-9579). In the current studies the concentration dependence of agonist-mediated receptor loss was also found to be biphasic. The apparent shift of affinity following brief (15 min) agonist exposure coincided with the agonist-mediated loss of a subclass of high affinity receptors with an IC50 for carbamylcholine inhibition of [3H]QNB binding of 3.9 x 10(-7) M. Those receptors remaining constituted a subclass of low affinity receptors with IC50 = 8.2 x 10(-5) M. The data further suggest that an apparent decrease in agonist affinity after guanine nucleotide exposure represents conversion of high affinity receptors to a similar low affinity state, IC50 = 8.6 x 10(-5) M. The rapid loss of [3H]QNB binding sites in the presence of agonist did not require interaction of agonist with intact cells, but also occurred if cells were homogenized and then subjected to a brief (15 min) exposure to agonist. The slow loss over 3 h of [3H]QNB binding sites could only be demonstrated in intact cells incubated with agonist prior to homogenization. To probe further the later phase of agonist-mediated receptor loss, we developed new assay methods for determining muscarinic antagonist binding to intact cells. In control cells, binding of the hydrophobic antagonist [3H]QNB was quite similar in extent to binding of the more hydrophilic antagonist [3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]MS), with Kd values of 0.11 and 0.47 nM, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the binding of these two ligands was performed to determine whether they might distinguish between two states of the receptor. Both ligands bound to the receptor by a two step mechanism consistent with the formation of a low affinity complex followed by conversion to a high affinity complex. However, the ratio of reverse to forward rate constants of the second step of [3H]MS binding was roughly 100-fold greater than that for the more hydrophobic ligand [3H]QNB. Comparison of the time course of agonist-induced receptor loss as measured by binding of [3H]MS or [3H]QNB was consistent with muscarinic agonist mediation of a stepwise alteration in receptor configuration from a form that bound both [3H]MS and [3H]QNB to a form that bound only [3H]QNB and thence to a form that bound neither [3H]MS nor [3H]QNB. The relationship of such a sequential mechanism to agonist-induced changes in the relationship of the receptor to the cell membrane and agonist-induced endocytosis of the receptor is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1918688900,"Hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) of both the adw and ayw subtypes have been purified from four different sources. These antigens have been compared by comparison of the products of tryptic hydrolysis performed under conditions which do not disrupt the overall particle morphology of HBsAg. The resultant peptides were compared by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and high performance liquid chromatography followed by amino acid analysis and Edman degradation of the isolated peptides. The same techniques were also applied to HBsAg which had been labeled with tritium in the carbohydrate moiety of the glycoprotein gp-30. These studies demonstrate that residues 122-150 of the protein p-25 and glycoprotein gp-30 occupy an exposed region of the HBsAg lipoprotein particle and contain the major attachment site for carbohydrate in the case of gp-30. The two subtypes were found to differ at two specific positions in this region, suggesting that this is an antigenically important area of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2113301876,"beta-Bungarotoxin (beta-BuTx) is a presynaptically active snake venom phospholipase A2 which, in the chick, is cytotoxic for certain subclasses of central and peripheral neurons. In order to elucidate whether the toxin's specificity is due to the existence of specific neuronal binding sites, the binding of 125I-labeled beta-BuTx to synaptic membrane fractions of chick brain was investigated. These experiments defined a single class of saturable high affinity binding sites (KD = 0.47 +/- 0.14 nM, k+1 = 4.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, k-1 = 1.08 x 10(-4) s-1) whose pharmacological properties correlated with that of the cytotoxic action of beta-BuTx on cholinergic neurons in chick retina cultures. The density of 125I-beta-BuTx binding sites in synaptic membrane fractions was low (50 fmol/mg of protein). Also specific toxin binding occurred only to membrane fractions of chick organs known to contain beta-BuTx-sensitive cells or nerve endings, i.e. brain, retina, and muscle, but not liver and heart. The binding of 125I-beta-BuTx to synaptic membrane fractions was dependent on Ca2+; Co2+ and Sr2+, but not Mg2+, could replace Ca2+ in the binding reaction. The membrane binding site for 125I-beta-BuTx was sensitive to heat and high concentrations of pronase, and thus most likely is a protein."
https://openalex.org/W1528225178,"Two endo-beta-D-glucuronidases acting on heparin-related polysaccharides were investigated: a mouse mastocytoma enzyme previously implicated in the postbiosynthetic modification of the heparin proteoglycan and a human platelet-derived enzyme, capable of degrading heparan sulfate as well as heparin (with elimination of anticoagulant activity). The mastocytoma enzyme was found to depolymerize a heparin precursor polysaccharide containing both N- and O-sulfate groups to fragments somewhat smaller in molecular size than commercially available heparin. In contrast, another heparin precursor species, containing N- but no O-sulfate groups was resistant to degradation. Furthermore, incubation of the mastocytoma endoglucuronidase with a heparin octasaccharide having high affinity for antithrombin failed to cleave the beta-glucuronidic linkage in the antithrombin-binding region. Previous studies established that the platelet endoglucuronidase can degrade the exclusively N-sulfated as well as the N- and O-sulfated heparin precursor polysaccharides (Oldberg, A., Heldin, C.-H., Wasteson, A., Busch, C., and Hook, M. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5755-5762). This enzyme has now been found to attack also the beta-glucuronidic linkage in the antithrombin-binding region of the heparin molecule. The loss of bio-affinity resulting from cleavage of this linkage in the antithrombin-binding heparin octasaccharide was utilized to construct a sensitive, specific, and simple assay method for the platelet endoglucuronidase. It is concluded that the platelet endoglucuronidase has a lower degree of substrate specificity than has the mastocytoma enzyme, in reflection of the surmised functional roles of the two enzymes."

The sugar chains were released from the polypeptide portion of secretory component by hydrazinolysis as oligosaccharides and fractionated by paper electrophoresis and paper chromatography. The sugar chains of secretory component show an extraordinarily high multiplicity. By sequential exoglycosidase digestion in combination with methylation analysis, more than 40 structurally different sugar chains were found. They were all of biantennary complex type with either Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNac beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc or Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 6)GlcNAc as their core portions and the multiplicity is produced by variety of the two outer chain moieties. The structures of outer chains found are GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2, +/- NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2, Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2, GL beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4(+/- Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2, NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3 Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2, Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2, and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2."

https://openalex.org/W1535951790,"Calcium binding to the activated form of blood coagulation Factor V (Factor Va) has been studied by equilibrium dialysis. A single calcium-binding site was observed with a dissociation constant of 24 +/- 4.0 microM. Unlike Factor V, Factor Va consists of two subunits. Following separation and reconstitution of the isolated subunits, a single calcium-binding site with a similar dissociation constant (24 +/- 2.0 microM) was again observed. No calcium binding was detected to either isolated subunit of Factor Va. Recombination of the Factor Va subunits used in the above equilibrium binding studies resulted in reformation of the calcium-binding site. Gel filtration experiments indicated that occupancy of this site with Ca2+ was required to maintain high affinity association between the Factor Va subunits. These data indicate that the calcium-binding site is either formed or stabilized by subunit-subunit interaction and that occupancy of this single site is sufficient to stabilize the intersubunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1549018098,"The incorporation of fatty acid into myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) was studied by incubating brain slices from 17-day-old rats with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid. Myelin proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. As in vivo (Agrawal, H. C., Randle, C. L., and Agrawal, D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4588-4592) most of the radioactivity co-migrated with PLP, with radioactivity also appearing in the regions of the DM-20 and Wolfgram proteins. Treatment of myelin proteins or purified PLP with 1 M hydroxylamine released most of the radioactivity, indicating that [3H]palmitic acid was covalently bound by ester linkage to the proteins. Cleavage of PLP with methanolic NaOH and examination of the released fatty acids by thin layer chromatography showed radioactivity associated with the methyl esters of palmitate, stearate, and oleate (76, 23, and 1%, respectively). A linear increase in radioactivity from [3H]palmitic acid was observed in PLP in both myelin and myelin-like fractions, while appearance of [14C]glycine-labeled PLP showed a lag of 45-60 minutes. These results indicate that lipid is added to PLP in the myelin and myelin-like membranes, or immediately prior to the appearance of PLP in these fractions. For both precursors, the specific activity of PLP was greater in the myelin-like fraction than in myelin, indicating that the myelin-like fraction may contain a precursor pool of PLP for myelin."
https://openalex.org/W1586937157,"The suppression of proteolysis that normally accompanies cytoplasmic growth was investigated in livers of mice that had lost approximately 40% of their protein content during 48 h of starvation. The deficit was fully restored after 24 h of refeeding, and the net regain was linear between 12 and 24 h. Rates of protein breakdown were determined from (a) differences between synthesis and the net change in total liver protein, and (b) rates of valine release during 15-min in situ perfusions in the presence of cycloheximide. With appropriate correction for the turnover of a short lived pool, both procedures gave the same results; rates at 12 and 24 h of refeeding were decreased 90% over values in fed controls, an effect which accounted for 93% of protein regrowth. Measurements of degradable, intralysosomal protein revealed that sequestration of cytoplasmic protein by lysosomes was correspondingly decreased. Because the ratio of intracellular proteolysis to internalized protein was the same during refeeding as in earlier experiments where autophagy was the dominant process, the uptake of cytoplasmic proteins by lysosomes appears to be an obligatory step in proteolysis at all levels of regulation. The 20-fold range in rates of degradation exhibited by the mouse hepatocyte thus provides this cell with an unusual capability for regulating its protein content against relatively small changes in protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2155777532,"We show in this report that the inward and outward transport of cationic amino acids through the plasma membrane of cultured fibroblasts and HTC cells is mediated mostly by a single saturable transport system, here designated y+. The kinetic behavior of System y+ can be accounted for by the alternating generation of at least two conformational states, one on each side of the plasma membrane. No predictions are made as to the mechanism of these carrier oscillations. The saturable flux of cationic amino acids in both directions is strongly increased by the presence of competing substrates on the side of the membrane opposite to the measured flux. The kinetic parameters describing these interactions vary as predicted by the classical mobile carrier hypothesis. These observations support the homogeneity of mediated cationic amino acid transport. Our results do not exclude other small flux contributions by a minor, apparently passive nonsaturable migration in each direction. The mediated arginine influx is half-maximally saturated at an external substrate concentration 1/10 to 1/20 as high as the apparent intracellular concentration that half-maximally saturates efflux. The maximum flux through System y+ attained by raising the substrate concentration to a saturating level is about equal in the two directions. The test amino acids accumulate 5- to 20-fold into HTC cells and human skin fibroblasts, findings which are consistent with the kinetic asymmetry of System y+."
https://openalex.org/W1558059901,"The binding of O2 to reduced cytochrome P-450 is the initial step in the activation of oxygen; subsequent addition of a second electron leads to substrate hydroxylation. Without the second electron, the complex between reduced cytochrome and O2 (oxyferro) undergoes internal electron transfer to regenerate the oxidized enzyme and, presumably, superoxide. We have used 38% ethylene glycol and subzero temperatures to stabilize the oxyferro complex of cytochrome P-450scc and have examined the effect of cholesterol, and hydroxycholesterol intermediates in the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, on the complex. The binding of cholesterol or the intermediates 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, and 20 alpha, 22R-dihydroxycholesterol to the cytochrome perturbed the optical spectra of the oxyferro complex with Soret maximums varying from 416 to 423 nm. Activation energies for the autooxidation of each of these sterol-oxyferro complexes were similar (approximately 22 kcal/mol). The half-time for autooxidation of the oxyferro complex was increased 15-fold by cholesterol over substrate-free cytochrome, and the hydroxycholesterols caused a further 3-17-fold increase in the stability of the oxyferro complex over that observed for cholesterol, the stability increasing with the number of hydroxyl groups on the cholesterol side chain. This was observed in both 38% ethylene glyco at -17 degrees C and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles at 2 degrees C. The data indicate that the 1-electron-reduced-oxygenated complex of cytochrome P-450scc is kinetically stabilized by the binding of the reaction intermediates, preserving the complex for the arrival of the second electron."

https://openalex.org/W1531752053,"Current evidence suggests that distinct mechanisms exist to regulate precursor synthesis for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. We tested this is mouse L cells by asking whether nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs become labeled to equivalent specific activities when provided with an exogenous nucleic acid precursor. Cells were grown in [32P]orthophosphate-containing medium long enough to bring all pools to equivalent specific activities. [6-3H]Uridine was added to the medium as a general pyrimidine precursor. At intervals, cells were harvested and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA was isolated. After enzymatic hydrolysis of each DNA fraction to deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates, these were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and the 3H/32P ratio in each pyrimidine was determined as an index of the specific activity of DNA pyrimidine residues. The dTMP residues in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA reached roughly equal specific activities and at comparable rates. However, dCMP residues in mitochondrial DNA reached maximal specific activities more rapidly than those in nuclear DNA, and the maximal values attained were nearly twice those seen either with the nuclear DNA dCMP residues or in the dTMP residues from either DNA. This indicates that the pathways leading to dCTP synthesis are organized so that mitochondria can use exogenous precursors more effectively than can the nucleus. The nature of this compartmentation is not clear, but it evidently involves one or more steps beyond the divergence point between pathways to dCTP and dTTP."

The purified lectin was shown to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical gel column chromatography on Sephadex G-200. A glycoprotein containing mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and xylose (4:2:1:1), the lectin is a dimer composed of subunits of Mr = 29,000 and 27,000 with an aggregate Mr = 56,000. The GS IV lectin precipitate equally with blood group Leb fragment-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and H-active fragment (alpha-L-fucose-(1 leads to 2)-beta-D-Gal-(1 leads to 4)-[alpha-L-fucose-(1 leads to 3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc)-BSA conjugates but only poorly with a Lewis a fragment-BSA conjugate. Inhibition of precipitation with various mono- and oligosaccharides indicated that the lectin is specific for type 1 or 2 chains containing two alpha-L-fucosyl groups on C-2 of the D-galactosyl residue and C-3 or C-4 of the D-GlcNAc unit. One alpha-L-fucosyl residue on C-3 or C-4 of the D-GlcNAc residue of type 1 or 2 chains inhibited the reaction, although these oligosaccharides were less active than the oligosaccharides containing 2 alpha-L-fucosyl units.

https://openalex.org/W1591179454,"Recent experiments with membrane-restricted, photoactivatable probes indicated a preferential labeling of C9 within the assembled membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement, suggesting a direct role for C9 in the interaction of the MAC with membrane lipids. To further characterize the lipid-binding sites on C9, we have now used C9 that has been cleaved by alpha-thrombin. This enzyme cleaves C9 at one site but the newly generated peptides, C9a and C9b, respectively, remain noncovalently associated and the cleaved protein suffers no loss in hemolytic activity. When cleaved C9 was incorporated into the MAC during assembly on phospholipid vesicles and photolabeled, subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and fluorography revealed that only the larger fragment C9b, but not the smaller fragment C9a, became labeled. C9 attached alone to vesicles through heat aggregation in the absence of the precursor complex C5b-8 is also accessible to the hydrophobic photolabel. When cleaved C9 is used in the heat-induced assembly on vesicles and the polymerized C9 is photolabeled, the label associates again predominantly with C9b and not C9a. These results not only show that, within C9 polymers or within the assembled MAC, C9 possesses a two-domain structure, but also lend considerable support to the structure proposed for C9 by Biesecker et al. (Biesecker, G., Gerard, C., and Hugli, T. E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2584-2590) who classified C9a as hydrophilic and C9b as hydrophobic."
https://openalex.org/W1496533001,"A novel sulfoglycosphingolipid containing two sulfate ester groups was isolated from the lipid extract of rat kidney. The isolation procedure involved extraction of lipids with chloroform/methanol, alkaline methanolysis, and column chromatographies with DEAE-Sephacel and silica beads. By infrared spectroscopy, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, periodate oxidation, solvolysis, chromium trioxide oxidation, and methylation analysis of the native and partially degraded compounds, the structure of this glycolipid is proposed to be (HSO3-3)GalNAc beta 1-4(HSO3-3)Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer. The presence of a unique 3-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine structure was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The yield of this sulfoglycolipid was 11.2 nmol/g of tissue, which was about half of that of monosulfogangliotriaosylceramide from rat kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1512725854,"Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (ammonia) (EC 6.3.4.16) and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) are matrix enzymes synthesized outside the mitochondria in the form of larger precursors and are transported rapidly into mitochondria, in association with post-translational proteolytic processing to the mature enzymes. Treatment of isolated rat hepatocytes with 40 micrograms/ml of rhodamine 123, a laser dye which specifically stains mitochondria, resulted both in a strong inhibition of the processing of the enzyme precursors and in accumulation. Rhodamine 123 did not specifically inhibit the synthesis of the synthetase and the transcarbamylase precursors in a reticulocyte lysate cell-free system programmed with rat liver free polysomes. The dye strongly inhibited the uptake and processing of the ornithine transcarbamylase precursor by isolated rat liver mitochondria. When the mitochondria and the medium were separated by centrifugation, the unprocessed precursor was recovered almost exclusively in the medium. These results indicate that rhodamine 123 inhibits either the binding of the enzyme precursors to the mitochondria or their transport into the organelle."

Paramagnetic effects of the Mn2+- substituted enzyme on the longitudinal relaxation rates of the carbon-bound protons of S-(D-lactoyl)glutathione at four frequencies (60, 100, 250, and 360 MHz) yield distances from Mn2+ to these protons ranging from 7.8 to 12.0 A which increase in the order Cys(C,H) a Cys(CBHB) < lactoyl(CH3) -= Cys(CflH~) < Glu(C,Hz) - G1y(C,Hz) - Glu(CpHz). Model building studies indicate that these distances are inconsistent with direct coor- dination of any of the atoms of S-(D-lactoyl)glutathione by the enzyme-bound Mn2+. The distances do permit an intervening water ligand of the Mn2+ to hydrogen bond to the lactoyl-carbonyl group in a second sphere com- plex, but are too great for hydrogen bonding to the lactoyl-hydroxyl group. Paramagnetic effects of en- zyme-bound MnZ+ on the transverse relaxation rates of the protons of S-(mlactoy1)glutathione as a function of temperature and frequency yield an exchange rate for S-(D-lactoyl)glutathione (21.9 X lo4 s-l) which exceeds V,, (380 s-') by an order of magnitude indicating that the second sphere product complex detected by NMR dissociates rapidly enough to function in catalysis. The competitive inhibitor S-(pbromobenzy1)glutathione removes essentially all paramagnetic effects of Mnz+- glyoxalase I on the relaxation rates of S-(D- 1actoyl)glutathione in a manner which is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with competition at the active site. The presence of an underlying, functional, inner sphere complex is ruled out in two ways. First, from the maximal error in the longitudinal relaxation rates with the Mn2+-enzyme, it is estimated that an inner sphere complex of S-(D-lactoyl)glutathione would dissociate at a rate 5200 s-', which is 1.9 times slower than V,,,. Second, paramagnetic effects of Co2'-substi- tuted glutathione on the relaxation rates of S-(D-lac-"

https://openalex.org/W1572734449,"Adsorptive pinocytosis of lysosomal enzymes by human fibroblasts depends on phosphomannosyl recognition markers on the enzymes and on affinity receptors on the cell surface. To define the role of phosphorylated oligosaccharides in enzyme recognition, we studied the pinocytosis of [2-3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides purified from glycoproteins secreted by fibroblasts. Uptake of the oligosaccharides was inhibited 97% by 2 mM mannose-6-phosphate, 33% by 2 mM glucose 6-phosphate, and 5% or less by 2 mM alpha-methylmannoside, mannose, galactose, or L-fucose. The oligosaccharides were separated into neutral and five anionic species by chromatography on quaternary aminoethyl-Sephadex, characterized, and compared for susceptibility to pinocytosis. Treatment of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides with alkaline phosphatase before or after mild acid hydrolysis demonstrated that they contained one or two phosphates in phosphodiester linkage (covered) or phosphomonoester linkage (uncovered), or two phosphates, one in monoester linkage and one in diester linkage. Neutral oligosaccharides and those with one covered phosphate were not taken up by fibroblasts. Species with one uncovered phosphate or two covered phosphates showed low but detectable uptake. Oligosaccharides isolated as species with two uncovered phosphates, or those converted to this form by mild acid hydrolysis, were taken up 30-fold greater than the lower forms during a 12-h incubation. Thus, oligosaccharides with two uncovered phosphates were far better ligands for the phosphomannosyl receptor than other oligosaccharides on acid hydrolases secreted by fibroblasts and initial rates of of these oligosaccharides were comparable to those reported for several high uptake lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W201372337,"The nature of the proteoglycan antigen which accumulates in chick embryo chondrocytes that had been incubated in monensin was examined. Both the culture media and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibody which primarily is directed against core protein. Gel filtration and electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates showed that molecules corresponding to completed proteoglycan, core protein, and link protein were present in the immunoprecipitates. Monensin caused the cellular accumulation of core protein which was both underglycosylated and undersulfated. These results suggest that monensin affects early events of proteoglycan biosynthesis and that it may be useful for elucidating those events."
https://openalex.org/W1604541303,"The rate of proline transport increases significantly when human dermal fibroblasts are grown with 1.5 microM hydrocortisone. Fibroblasts derived from keloid tissue are significantly more stimulated than normal fibroblasts. An average increase of 41% is obtained with 8 normal strains, whereas uptake in 8 keloid-derived strains increases 210%. Similar results are obtained with the system A amino acid analogue 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, for which the uptake rate increases 87% and 329% in normal and keloid cells, respectively. The hydrocortisone-mediated increase in proline transport and the difference between keloid and normal fibroblasts are observed throughout the culture cycle and after depletion of amino acid pools. The uptake of nine other amino acids are differentially altered in normal and keloid cells. Competition experiments with 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid indicate that the greatest differences occur with amino acids that are transported preferentially by the A system. Inhibition of the hydrocortisone-mediated increase by progesterone and a lag period of approximately 3 h indicate that hydrocortisone is regulating proline transport by a cytosolic receptor mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1563431396,"Interaction of purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (LpL) with sonicated vesicles of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine in the gel phase is associated with an increase in the rate of the LpL-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate. There is a 6-fold increase in Vmax. Apolipoprotein C-II, the activator protein for LpL, inhibits the LpL-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate. With 0.5 mol % tri[14C]oleoylglycerol present in the dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles and in the presence of 20 mM Ca2+, the rate of p-nitrophenyl butyrate hydrolysis is decreased reciprocally compared to trioleoylglycerol hydrolysis and is dependent on apolipoprotein C-II. These results suggest that apolipoprotein C-II enhances the activity of LpL by increasing the affinity of the active site of LpL for triacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1568289572,"Human adipose tissue has been shown to contain exceptionally high concentrations of squalene. In the present experiments, it was shown that most of adipose tissue squalene is located in the fat cells. Of this squalene, 80% is located in the central neutral lipid droplet and 20% is bound to the microsomal membranes. Upon incubation of isolated fat cells with radiolabeled substrates, both the microsomal and the droplet squalene became labeled. The specific activity of microsomal squalene increased faster than that of droplet squalene. In addition, the microsomal squalene quickly equilibrated to a maximal specific activity, whereas the droplet squalene showed a steady increase in specific activity. These observations indicate rapid turnover of microsomal squalene and slow turnover of droplet squalene. Moreover, they reflect intracellular transfer of labeled squalene from microsomes to the lipid droplet. During a 3-hour incubation of fat cells with labeled substrates, 90% of the newly formed labeled squalene was transferred to the lipid droplet and only 10% was converted into cholesterol. The results demonstrate that adipocyte squalene can be segregated anatomically and functionally into two distinct pools: a small metabolically active pool in the microsomal membranes where squalene is synthesized and a large metabolically inactive pool in the fat droplet where squalene is stored. The intracellular transfer of de novo synthesized squalene into the fat droplet of fat cells is one mechanism of squalene accumulation in adipose tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1643741886,"Antibody to native bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan monomer was shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to react with the purified hyaluronic acid binding region of the monomer. Antibody was digested with pepsin to produce F(ab')2 and labeled with glutaraldehyde-activated ferritin. F(ab')2 and F(ab')2-ferritin were reduced and alkylated to render them monovalent (Fab'). Antibody Fab' binding to native proteoglycan monomer was studied by electron microscopy of monomer reacted with ferritin-labeled antibody Fab' spread in a cytochrome c film. Ferritin-labeled antibody Fab' bound primarily at one end of the proteoglycan monomer. This binding was partly inhibitable by unlabeled monovalent antibody Fab', demonstrating immunospecificity. The end of the monomer with bound ferritin sometimes appeared as the thin segment, previously observed to bind to hyaluronic acid. These observations indicate that the hyaluronic acid binding region is at only one end of each proteoglycan monomer and that ferritin-labeled antibody Fab' selectively attaches to this part of native proteoglycan monomers. This methodology should be useful for future structural studies of isolated proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1494889548,"Abstract An alpha-1,2-mannosidase has been solubilized and partially purified from rabbit liver microsomes (Forsee, W. T., and Schutzbach, J. S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6577-6582). The partially purified enzyme was activated by the addition of zwitterionic phospholipids but maximal activity was found to be relatively independent of acyl chain length or degree of unsaturation. Titration of the enzyme with increasing concentrations of water-soluble and long acyl chain phospholipids demonstrated that an ordered lipid structure of either micelles or bilayers was required for alpha-mannosidase activity. Mixed micelles of Triton X-100 and zwitterionic phospholipids also activated the enzyme. The concentration of phospholipid in the mixed micelles required for activation was dependent upon acyl chain length, but maximal activity was unaffected by this parameter. The addition of negatively charged phospholipids not only failed to activate the enzyme but also inhibited alpha-mannosidase activity in the presence of zwitterionic phospholipids. Inhibition by negatively charged phospholipids was pH dependent with maximal inhibition at pH values of 6.0 or lower. These results suggest that the activity of the alpha-1,2-mannosidase could be subject to modulation by the composition and structure of the microsomal membranes."

Viscosity-resolved correlation times obtained from direct measurement of the decay of fluorescence anisotropy show values of 4.15 +/- 0.23 and 9.13 +/- 0.46 ns for the liganded and unliganded derivatives, respectively, in 0.05 M tris buffer, pH 7.5 at 15 degrees C. Addition of 1 mM inositol hexaphosphate to the liganded and unliganded derivatives results in correlation times of 9.31 +/- 0.87 and 43.69 +/- 16.04 ns, respectively. Similar values of correlation times are obtained from Perrin plots. Considering that the correlation times expected for the single subunits, the dimers, and the tetramers of the system are approximately 10-15, 20-30, and above 40 ns, respectively, it can be concluded that the molecule of hemoglobin becomes increasingly rigid upon removal of ligands and addition of inositol hexaphosphate. These observations support the hypothesis of a functional relevance of the internal flexibility of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1597727770,"Tissue injury by radiolabeled amino acids may severely affect experimental results. In this report, 3H-, 14C-, and/or 35S-labeled proline, serine, lysine, and methionine at concentrations of 1 and 5 microCi/ml were shown to cause severe injury in organ cultures of embryonic rat lungs. This injury was evident by 6 h and was amplified by 4 days of culture. This injury was characterized with light and electron microscopy, with morphometric analysis of growth, and with quantitation of the total protein and DNA/lung. After 6 h with 5 microCi/ml of 14C- or 35S-amino-acid there were more signs of cell degeneration, and by 24 h the labeled lungs were smaller, showed more signs of cell degeneration and death, and contained 30 to 60% less new protein and DNA than control lungs. After 24 h with 5 microCi/ml of 14C- or 35S-amino-acid the total protein and DNA/lung began to decrease. This toxicity was directly proportional to the amount of intracellular decay of each isotope. With 14C- and 35S-amino-acids, lung growth slowed with approximately 100 disintegrations/cell/day (d/c/d), growth stopped with approximately 200 d/c/d, and atrophy occurred with approximately 300 d/c/d. Cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and bronchial branching continued through 4 days even though atrophy occurred with greater than 200 d/c/d. With 3H-amino-acids, growth slowed with approximately 200 d/c/d and stopped with approximately 400 d/c/d. However, no toxicity was evident with less than 60 d/c/d of 14C or 35S, or with less than 90 d/c/d of 3H. These data suggest that the amounts of intracellular decay of these weak beta-emitting isotopes should be strictly limited. Increasing amounts of tissue injury occurred with 14C or 35S at greater than 10,000 dpm/micrograms of DNA, and with 3H at greater than 20,000 dpm/micrograms of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1645589641,"Two amidases have been partially purified from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum; these act sequentially on the beta-hydroxymyristyl-amide groups present in the lipopolysaccharide derivative (4'-O-phosphoryl-N-beta-hydroxymyristyl-D-glucosaminyl)-beta-(1 leads to 6)-N-beta-hydroxymyristyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate (III). Amidase-I, which specifically removes the myristyl chain near the 1-phosphate of compound III (apparent Km, 3.7 microM), has been purified 110-fold from a lysate of D. discoideum NC4 cultivated on Escherichia coli. The partially purified enzyme contains no other amidase or phosphatase activities; however, an esterase activity can be detected. The second amidase has been purified about 12-fold from the extracellular fluid of D. discoideum AX3 cultured axenically. This amidase hydrolyzes the distal amide linkage in III (apparent Km, approximately 20 microM) only after prior deacylation of the first site by amidase-I. The preparation is free from phosphatases and glycosidases that can act on lipopolysaccharide. The differential expression of the amidases in D. discoideum and some of their kinetic properties have been described. The amidases should prove useful in structure-function studies of lipopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1490192357,"The substrate specificities of two fatty acyl amidases partially purified from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum have been studied. The amidase act on lipopolysaccharide derivatives, such as (4'-O-phosphoryl-N-beta-hydroxymyristyl-D-glucosaminyl)-beta-(1 leads to 6)-N-beta-hydroxymyristyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate (III) in a sequential manner. Amidase-I removes the beta-hydroxymyristyl residue present on the amino group adjacent to the 1-phosphate and the product formed is a substrate for amidase-II; the latter removes the remaining beta-hydroxymyristyl residue from the distal amino group. Compound III itself is resistant to amidase-II. Removal of the C-1 or C-4 phosphate groups does not influence recognition by the amidases or their sequential action. Both amidases are specific for long chain fatty amide linkages. Thus, a formyl group on the glucosamine amino group adjacent to the C-1 phosphate is not hydrolyzed by amidase-I; however, this substituent does not hinder the action of amidase-II on the distal fatty acyl amide. The presence of the beta-hydroxyl group in myristyl-amide residues is not required for hydrolysis. Further, while amidase-I requires disaccharide structures for its action, amidase-II acts on monosaccharides as well. Finally, the effects of a variety of substrate analogs and divalent ions on the activity of the enzymes are reported."
https://openalex.org/W1569554611,"Current studies on receptor-ligand interactions usually employ a step followed by extensive washing to remove free ligand. This procedure, by definition, removes reversibly bound ligand from the receptor; the equations used by most workers to analyze the data, however, require an equilibrium between free and bound ligand and are not applicable given the design of most binding assays. The assay, in fact, measures binding that is slowly reversible or irreversible. Assuming that ligand receptor interaction involves two stages with a reversible step followed by an event, the Ka for the reversible reaction may be obtained from the rate of the irreversible step. 125I-Choleragen binding to human fibroblasts was only slowly reversible at both 0 and 37 degrees C. The two-step model was, therefore, applied experimentally to determine the Ka for the reversible step in 125I-choleragen binding to human fibroblasts at 0 degrees C (Ka = 1.9 x 10(8) M-1) and at 37 degrees C (Ka = 3.6 x 10(8) M-1). As predicted by the two-step model for ligand binding, the addition of 50 micrograms/ml of unlabeled toxin enhanced the rate of release of radioactivity at 37 degrees C; the rate of radiolabel release remained low at 0 degrees C, even with unlabeled toxin present in the medium. The rate of release of previously incorporated 125I-toxin was accelerated by 50 micrograms/ml of toxin greater than 5 micrograms/ml of toxin. The two-step model for ligand binding appears to be applicable to the study of 125I-choleragen binding to fibroblasts and should be useful, in general, for the analysis of receptor-ligand interaction."
