https://openalex.org/W2141150979,"The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) was first described as a signal transducer for interleukin-1 (IL-1) and has later been implicated in signal transduction of other members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family. We now report the identification and characterization of a novel IRAK-like molecule. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed IRAK and IRAK-2, this new IRAK-like molecule is found mainly in cells of monomyeloic origin and is, therefore, designated IRAK-M. Although IRAK-M and IRAK-2 exhibit only a negligible autophosphorylation activity, they can reconstitute the IL-1 response in a 293 mutant cell line lacking IRAK. In addition, we show for the first time that members of the IRAK family are indispensable elements of lipopolysaccharide signal transduction. The discovery of IRAK-M adds another level of complexity to our understanding of signaling by members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W2127179996,"We showed before that in cardiac myocytes partial inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by nontoxic concentrations of ouabain causes hypertrophy and transcriptional regulations of growth-related marker genes through multiple Ca2+-dependent signal pathways many of which involve Ras and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases. The aim of this work was to explore the roles of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these ouabain-initiated pathways. Ouabain caused a rapid generation of ROS within the myocytes that was prevented by preexposure of cells to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or vitamin E. These antioxidants also blocked or attenuated the following actions of ouabain: inductions of the genes of skeletal α-actin and atrial natriuretic factor, repression of the gene of the α3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, activation of Ras-dependent protein synthesis, and activation of transcription factor NF-κB. Induction of c-fos and activation of AP-1 by ouabain were not sensitive to NAC. Ouabain-induced inhibition of active Rb+ uptake through Na+/K+-ATPase and the resulting rise in intracellular Ca2+ were also not prevented by NAC. A phorbol ester that also causes myocyte hypertrophy did not increase ROS generation, and its effects on marker genes and protein synthesis were not affected by NAC. We conclude the following: (a) ROS are essential second messengers within some but not all signal pathways that are activated by the effect of ouabain on Na+/K+-ATPase; (b) the ROS-dependent pathways are involved in ouabain-induced hypertrophy; (c) increased ROS generation is not a common response of the myocyte to all hypertrophic stimuli; and (d) it may be possible to dissociate the positive inotropic effect of ouabain from its growth-related effects by alteration of the redox state of the cardiac myocyte.

In the heart, partial inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by ouabain and related cardiac glycosides causes a modest increase in intracellular Na+, which in turn leads to significant increases in intracellular Ca2+ through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and in myocardial contractility through the effects of Ca2+ on contractile proteins (3Eisner D.A. Smith T.W. Fozzard H.A. Haber E. Jennigs R.B. Katz A.M. Morgan H.E. 2nd Ed. The Heart and Cardiovascular System. 1. Raven Press, New York1992: 863-902Google Scholar). This effect on cardiac contractility is the basis of the continued therapeutic use of these drugs in the management of congestive heart failure (4Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1993; 22: 107A-112ACrossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5The Digitalis Investigational Group N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that in cultured cardiac myocytes the same nontoxic concentrations of ouabain that cause partial inhibition of the sodium pump and increase intracellular Ca2+ also stimulate hypertrophic growth and transcriptionally regulate early- and late-response genes that are markers of cardiac hypertrophy (6Peng M.

Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3157-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This clearly indicated that the altered activity of cardiac Na+/K+-ATPase by cardiac glycoside drugs or by endogenous ouabain-like putative hormones (9Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1367-C1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) must be considered as a potential signal for cardiac hypertrophy and its transition to failure, along with other hormonal, mechanical, and pathological stimuli of hypertrophy (10Hefti M.A. Harder B.A. Eppenberger H.M. Schaub M.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2873-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). While exploring the mechanism of linkage between the plasma membrane sodium pump and four marker genes (c-fos and the genes of skACT,1 ANF, and the α3 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase), we also found that ouabain interaction with the pump initiates multiple signal transduction cascades and that many of these gene regulatory pathways involve activations of the GTP-binding protein Ras and p42/44 MAPKs (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). ROS, such as the superoxide radical, the hydroxyl radical, and H2O2, are continuously produced in most cells, and their levels are regulated by a number of enzymes and physiological antioxidants (12Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that excessive generation of ROS is associated with cell injury in a variety of pathological conditions including those of the cardiovascular system (12Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). More recently, there has been rapidly growing evidence indicating that ROS also have normal roles as second messengers within several signal pathways involved in the control of gene transcription (13Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 14Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 15Abe J.-I. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because Ras has been shown to be implicated in a number of such ROS-regulated pathways (15Abe J.-I. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and in view of our findings on the central role of Ras in ouabain-induced regulation of the growth-related genes of cardiac myocytes (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we were prompted to determine the possible involvement of ROS in these ouabain effects. Here we present the results of our initial studies showing that intracellular ROS are indeed essential mediators of the ouabain-induced hypertrophic phenotype and that antioxidants are capable of preventing the growth-related effects of ouabain in cultured cardiac myocytes. Chemicals of the highest purity available were obtained from Sigma. TRI reagent for RNA isolation was from Molecular Research Center, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Radionucleotides (32P-labeled, about 3000 Ci/mmol) and86Rb+ were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Phenylalanine and the ECL kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit polyclonal Anti-ACTIVE MAPK pAb and anti-p42/44 antibodies were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Fura-2 AM and CM-DCFH diacetate were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Optitran and Nytran membranes were obtained from Schleicher and Schuell. Neonatal ventricular myocytes were prepared and cultured as described in our previous work (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were isolated from ventricles of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and purified by centrifugation on Percoll gradients. Myocytes were then cultured in a medium containing 4 parts of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 1 part of Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2, medium was changed to one with the same composition as above but without the serum. All experiments were done after 48 h of further incubation under serum-free conditions. These cultures contain more than 95% myocytes as assessed by immunofluorescence staining with a myosin heavy chain antibody. Myocytes were cultured on glass coverslips. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured by fura-2 as we previously described (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded using an Attofluor imaging system (Atto Instruments) at an excitation wavelength of 340/380 nm and at an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Under each experimental condition time-averaged signals were obtained from about 40 single cells. Relative Ca2+concentration was calculated based on the fluorescence ratio and Ca2+ calibration curve (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To measure intracellular ROS production, cells were loaded with 10 μm CM-DCFH diacetate for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The coverslip was affixed to a culture chamber and perfused with the same culture medium without phenol red. During loading the acetate groups on CM-DCFH diacetate are removed by intracellular esterase, trapping the probe inside the myocytes. Several dihydrofluorescein derivatives have been used for measuring intracellular ROS generation (19Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 20Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). CM-DCFH was chosen because it exhibited better retention in cells than other derivatives. Production of ROS was measured by changes in fluorescence because oxidation of CM-DCFH produced fluorescent product CM-DCF in cardiac myocytes. Under each experimental condition about 15 single myocytes were imaged with an Attofluor imaging system (Atto Instruments), and CM-DCF fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Northern blot was done as described previously (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Huang L. Li H. Xie Z. J. Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3157-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Routinely, about 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to gel electrophoresis, transferred to a Nytran membrane, UV-immobilized, and hybridized to 32P-labeled probes. Autoradiograms obtained at −70 °C were scanned with a Bio-Rad densitometer. Multiple exposures were analyzed to assure that the signals are within the linear range of the film. The relative amount of RNA in each sample was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA to correct for differences in sample loading and transfer. Activation of p42/44 MAPKs in cultured myocytes was determined by Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against dually phosphorylated p42/44 MAPKs (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In brief, after cells were exposed to ouabain, reaction was terminated by the replacement of medium with 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For Western blot analysis, cell lysates (60 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to an Optitran membrane. The membranes were probed with Anti-ACTIVE MAPK pAb that detects p42/44 MAPKs only when they are activated by phosphorylation at Thr202 and Tyr204. To ensure equal loading and protein transfer, the same blots were stripped and probed with a polyclonal antibody recognizing both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p42/44 MAPKs. These membranes were developed with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody using the ECL method as instructed by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiograms were scanned with a Bio-Rad densitometer to quantitate MAPK signals. A CAT reporter gene under the control of three copies of the AP-1 cis-element (22Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar) was kindly provided to us by Dr. P. A. Baeuerle. Myocytes were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using a modified calcium phosphate method (23O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation, the transfected cells were subjected to ouabain and other treatments. Cell lysate was prepared and assayed for CAT as described previously (24Shen P. Xie Z. Li H. Sanchez E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All transfections were conducted in triplicate in 6.0-cm tissue culture dishes. Control experiments with Rous sarcoma virus·β-galactosidase reporter plasmid indicated that transfection efficiency varied less than 15% within a given experiment under our experimental conditions. This was done as described before (35Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z.-J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar) using an antibody against the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The adenovirus expressing the dominant-negative Ras was generated, amplified, and purified as described before (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An identical virus containing the β-galactosidase gene was used as virus control. Myocytes were transduced by the same experimental procedures used before (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under these conditions viral infection had no effect on cell viability (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis in these cultured myocytes was assayed by [3H]phenylalanine incorporation as we previously described (7Huang L. Li H. Xie Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in a 12-well plate, treated with ouabain and other agents as indicated for 44 h, and continued for an additional 4 h in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [3H]phenylalanine/well before total protein and phenylalanine incorporation were assayed as indicated (7Huang L. Li H. Xie Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The initial rate of ouabain-sensitive uptake of Rb+ through the Na+/K+-ATPase of the intact myocytes was measured with modification of our previously described procedures (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Monensin (20 μm) was added to the medium prior to the initiation of the Rb+ uptake assay to assure that the maximal capacity of active uptake was measured (25Stemmer P. Akera T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. To determine if ouabain increases ROS production in cardiac myocytes, cells were incubated with 10 μm CM-DCFH diacetate for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, washed with fresh medium, exposed to ouabain, and monitored for the production of the fluorescent CM-DCF. As shown in Fig. 1, ouabain caused dose- and time-dependent increases in fluorescence, indicating stimulated ROS production in these cultured myocytes. The highest ouabain concentration used was 100 μm to avoid loss of viable cells (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As expected, myocytes loaded with the fluorogenic probe also exhibited increased fluorescence when exposed to H2O2 (data not shown). The maximal fluorescence increase obtained with ouabain in experiments of Fig. 1 was about the same as that produced by the addition of 2 μmH2O2. Preincubation of myocytes with the antioxidant NAC (10 mm) suppressed the fluorescence increases induced by ouabain (Fig. 1) and by H2O2 (not shown). Preincubation with 0.5 mm α-tocopherol (vitamin E) had about the same effect as that of NAC shown in Fig. 1. The experiments shown in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 were done to assess the relation of the ouabain-induced generation of ROS to the regulations of the four genes that we had previously shown to be transcriptionally regulated by ouabain (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Huang L. Li H. Xie Z. J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The results showed that NAC blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, the ouabain-induced increases in skACT and ANF mRNAs (Figs. 2 and 3) and the ouabain-induced decrease in mRNA of the α3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig.4). Experiments depicted in Fig.5 showed that vitamin E and NAC similarly antagonized the effects of ouabain on skACT, ANF, and α3-subunit genes. In contrast to the antioxidant effects on these late-response genes, induction of the early-response gene c-fos by ouabain was not affected by either NAC (Fig.6) or vitamin E (not shown). The combined data of Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 clearly indicate that ouabain initiates ROS-dependent and ROS-independent gene regulatory pathways in these myocytes.Figure 5Comparison of NAC and vitamin E effects on ouabain-induced regulations of the genes of ANF , skACT , and α3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase. Cells were pretreated with 10 mm NAC or 0.5 mm vitamin E for 15 min, exposed to 100 μm ouabain for 12 h, and assayed for mRNAs as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative Northern blot of four different experiments is shown.Vit E, vitamin E; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Effects of NAC on ouabain-induced down-regulation of the gene of the α3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase.

Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In view of the lack of effect of NAC on the induction of c-fos by ouabain (Fig. 6) but the known activation of cardiac myocyte AP-1 by exogenous H2O2 (35Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z.-J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar), in the experiments shown in Fig. 7 we examined the effects of ouabain and NAC on myocytes that were transfected with a CAT gene construct containing three AP-1 elements. Ouabain-induced increase in CAT expression was also unaffected by NAC (Fig. 7), providing further support for the conclusion that some gene regulatory effects of ouabain are through ROS-independent pathways. NF-κB is another transcription factor that, along with AP-1, is regulated by the redox state in a variety of cell types (13Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 14Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 15Abe J.-I. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc.

Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) and is known to be activated by exogenous H2O2in cardiac myocytes (35Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z.-J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of myocytes to ouabain caused the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig.8), indicative of its activation. Preincubation of myocytes with NAC blocked this ouabain-induced translocation (Fig. 8), suggesting a role of intracellular ROS in ouabain-induced activation of NF-κB. In control experiments, the results of which are not shown, it was established that antioxidants, at the concentrations and for the durations used in the experiments shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, had no significant effects on myocyte viability as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We showed before that nontoxic concentrations of ouabain cause moderate hypertrophy of the myocytes as evidenced by ouabain-induced increases in total cell protein (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and in the rate of [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into cell proteins (7Huang L. Li H. Xie Z. J. Mol.

Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it was of interest to know if Ras was also involved in the effect of ouabain on protein synthesis. Experiments depicted in Fig. 9 showed that the adenoviral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative Ras blocked ouabain stimulation of [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into myocyte proteins. Experiments of Fig.10 showed that ouabain stimulation of the protein synthesis was also blocked by NAC. The combined data of Figs. 9 and 10 indicate that ouabain-induced hypertrophy, like ouabain-induced regulations of the late-response genes (skACT, ANF, and α3-subunit), involves both Ras and ROS. Interestingly, NAC also significantly decreased the [3H]phenylalanine incorporation in the absence of ouabain (Fig. 10), suggesting that basal levels of ROS may be important signals for the regulation of protein synthesis.Figure 10Effects of NAC on ouabain-induced and PMA-induced activations of protein synthesis. Myocytes exposed to the indicated concentrations of ouabain (Ou), PMA, and NAC were assayed for [3H]phenylalanine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are mean ± S.E. of three experiments. *, p < 0.05 against control; **, p < 0.05 against 10 mmNAC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PMA is a well established hypertrophic stimulus for the cultured neonatal myocytes (6Peng M.

Under the same conditions where ouabain-induced effects on ANF and α3-subunit genes were blocked by NAC, the antioxidant had no effect on PMA-induced effects on the same genes (Fig. 11). Stimulation of protein synthesis by PMA was also not blocked by NAC, in contrast to the antioxidant effect on ouabain-stimulated protein synthesis (Fig. 10). In experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1, the same concentrations of PMA used the experiments shown in Figs. 10 and 11 did not cause increased generation of ROS (data not shown). These results clearly show that increased production of ROS is not a common response of the cardiac myocytes to all hypertrophic stimuli. The antagonistic effects of antioxidants on ouabain-induced actions, as noted in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, occurred in experiments with durations of several hours. On the other hand, the rapid onset of the ouabain effect on the intracellular production of CM-DCF (Fig. 1) suggested that increased generation of ROS may represent an early event in ouabain-initiated signal transduction pathways. Because the maximal activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-p42/44 MAPK cascade occurs within 5–15 min after exposure to ouabain (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the effect of NAC on this rapid action of ouabain. Experiments depicted in Fig. 12 showed that ouabain activation of p42 MAPK was indeed attenuated by NAC. Because all of the hypertrophic and gene regulatory effects of ouabain are dependent on ouabain-induced inhibition of the sodium pump and the resulting rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ (6Peng M.

In experiments similar to those we have reported before (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), neither the maximal inhibitory effect of 1 mm ouabain nor the partial inhibitory effect of 100 μm ouabain on the initial rate of 86Rb+ uptake was prevented or reduced by preincubation of myocytes with 10 mm NAC for 15 min (data not shown). In agreement with our previous results (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), 100 μm ouabain increased intracellular Ca2+concentration from 89 ± 18 nm to 167 ± 24 nm. In myocytes that were pretreated with 10 mmNAC, 100 μm ouabain raised Ca2+ concentration from 104 ± 25 nm to 191 ± 34 nm. The fact that ROS are second messengers within a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways has been indicated by a large number of studies in cells other than cardiac myocytes (13Sen C.K.

The signaling roles of intracellularly generated ROS in cardiac myocytes have been suggested by previous studies when myocytes were subjected to hypoxia or hypoxia reoxygenation (21Vanden Hoek T.L.

Res. 1997; 80: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and when myocytes were exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α or angiotensin II, two stimuli that induce cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (29Nakamura K. Fushimi K. Kouchi H. Mihara K. Miyazaki M. Ohe T. Namba M. Circulation. 1998; 98: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Our findings presented here clearly establish the essential roles of ROS-regulated signaling pathways in ouabain-induced hypertrophy, and in transcriptional regulations of several growth-related genes of these cardiac myocytes by ouabain. However, our findings showing that PMA-induced hypertrophy does not involve ROS also establish that increased intracellular generation of ROS is not a requirement for the induction of myocyte hypertrophy per se. Clearly, the potential signaling roles of ROS need to be explored for each physiological and pharmacological stimulus of cardiac hypertrophy to allow the determination of how the various stimuli interact to cause pathological cardiac hypertrophy and to permit the assessment of the roles of ROS and antioxidants in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Of particular interest are our findings on the different roles of ROS in the ouabain-induced regulations of the four growth-related genes. Although the regulations of three genes (those of skACT, ANF, and the α3 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase) are dependent on ROS generated in response to ouabain, these ROS do not seem to be involved in the induction of c-fos by ouabain. A plausible explanation for this apparent pathway specificity is that within the complex network of multiple pathways activated by ouabain (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the target of the generated ROS is not a proximal component that is shared by all the pathways of the network. Alternatively, because there are two branches within the ouabain-activated pathways leading to the induction of c-fos (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it may be that repression of a ROS-regulated branch is accompanied by a compensatory change in the activity of a ROS-independent branch. The nature and the source of the ouabain-induced ROS remain to be determined. Although available data suggest that the fluorogenic compound used here for the detection of ROS is more sensitive to H2O2 and the hydroxyl radical than to the superoxide radical (21Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the insufficient selectivity of the probe and the interconversions of the generated ROS do not permit firm conclusions on the nature of the species that act as second messengers. In cells other than cardiac myocytes, mitochondria and NADH·NADPH oxidase complexes, which include Rac as a component, have been implicated as sources of signaling ROS (15Abe J.-I. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol.

Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, mitochondria seem to be the source of ROS involved in hypoxia-induced signaling (30Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The existence of a cytosolic NADH oxidase system responsible for the production of superoxide in cardiac myocytes has also been suggested (31Mohazzab-H K.M. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the presence of Rac in cardiac myocytes has been shown (32Kim K.-S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Kaikobad I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K.

Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because we have shown Ras activation to be involved in all ouabain-initiated pathways (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and because others have implicated a signal cascade involving Ras-Rac in the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (33Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.-S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suspect that a source of ouabain-induced ROS generation may indeed be a Ras-Rac-NAD(P)H oxidase cascade. Our studies on the relative roles of NAD(P)H complexes and mitochondria as sources of ouabain-induced ROS are in progress. In the ouabain-initiated signal pathways, as in most ROS-regulated pathways identified to date, the immediate targets of ROS effects are not known. Our data showing that ouabain-induced ROS production is antagonized by NAC and that ouabain-induced inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase and the resulting rise in intracellular Ca2+ persist in the presence of NAC clearly show that the generated ROS must affect the ouabain-initiated pathways beyond the point where increased intracellular Ca2+ affects all pathways (11Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One such potential target is Ras, because direct activation of Ras by ROS has been indicated by studies on cells other than myocytes (18Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). This, coupled with the likelihood of the Ras-Rac-oxidase cascade being the source of the generated ROS, suggests the possible existence of a signal amplification cycle within the ouabain-initiated and ROS-regulated pathways. AP-1 and NF-κB, the two transcription factors whose activations by ROS have been shown in a large number of studies (13Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 14Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 15Abe J.-I. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 34Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), should also be considered as potential downstream targets for any ROS-generating stimulus. Although we have shown before that AP-1 is indeed activated when cardiac myocytes are exposed to H2O2 (35Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z.-J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar), our present findings (Fig. 7) argue against a role of ouabain-generated ROS in ouabain-induced activation of AP-1. NF-κB of the cardiac myocytes, which is also activated by exogenous H2O2 (35Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z.-J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar), is indeed a target of ouabain-generated ROS (Fig. 8). The potential role of this transcription factor in the gene regulatory effects of ouabain needs further exploration. Perhaps the most intriguing of our present findings is that in the cultured myocytes it is possible to dissociate the effects of ouabain on growth and growth-related genes from the classical effect of the drug on the resting intracellular Ca2+. Because the latter is thought to be responsible for the effects of ouabain and related cardiac glycosides on cardiac contractility (3Eisner D.A. Smith T.W. Fozzard H.A. Haber E. Jennigs R.B. Katz A.M. Morgan H.E. 2nd Ed. The Heart and Cardiovascular System. 1. Raven Press, New York1992: 863-902Google Scholar), this raises the important question of whether or not the redox state of the myocyte or the intact heart can alter the effects of the cardiac glycosides on cardiac hypertrophy without affecting the positive inotropic effects of the drug. As discussed before (6Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), in the context of the use of these drugs in the management of heart failure, at this time it is not possible to say if the hypertrophic and the gene regulatory effects of the drugs will turn out to be among their beneficial or undesirable effects."

To determine whether STAT3 is a downstream effector of gp130 in the osteoclast support function of stromal/osteoblastic cells and whether the gp130/STAT3 pathway is utilized by other osteoclastogenic agents, we conditionally expressed dominant negative (dn)-STAT3 or dn-gp130 in a stromal/osteoblastic cell line (UAMS-32) that supports osteoclast formation. Expression of either dominant negative protein abolished osteoclast formation stimulated by IL-6 + soluble IL-6 receptor, oncostatin M, or IL-1 but not by parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Because previous studies suggested that IL-6-type cytokines may stimulate osteoclastogenesis by inducing expression of the tumor necrosis factor-related protein, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), we conditionally expressed RANKL in UAMS-32 cells and found that this was sufficient to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, dn-STAT3 blocked the ability of either IL-6 + soluble IL-6 receptor or oncostatin M to induce RANKL. These results establish that STAT3 is essential for gp130-mediated osteoclast formation and that the target of STAT3 during this process is induction of RANKL.

Med. 1995; 332: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts are derived from precursors originating in the bone marrow. The precursors of osteoblasts are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells, while the precursors of osteoclasts are hematopoietic cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (2Aubin J.E. Turksen K.

Moreover, hormones or cytokines that stimulate bone resorption such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3),1parathyroid hormone (PTH), members of the interleukin (IL)-6 family, or IL-1 stimulate osteoclast formation by activating discrete signaling pathways in stromal/osteoblastic cells (4Udagawa N.

The extent to which these pathways interact, or are dependent on one another, to stimulate osteoclast formation is largely unknown. The mechanistic basis of the dependence of osteoclastogenesis on mesenchymal cell differentiation has recently been established by the discovery of a membrane-bound member of the tumor necrosis factor family of cytokines, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is expressed in committed preosteoblastic cells (7Anderson D.M.

This interaction is necessary and, together with M-CSF, sufficient for osteoclast formation, since mice lacking RANKL are unable to make osteoclasts and since exogenously provided soluble RANKL and M-CSF stimulate osteoclastogenesis in the absence of stromal/osteoblastic cells (8Lacey D.L.

In addition, it has been demonstrated that many of the cytokines and hormones that stimulate osteoclast formation also stimulate the expression of RANKL in stromal/osteoblastic cells (9Yasuda H.

Members of the IL-6 cytokine family that are capable of stimulating osteoclast formation include IL-6, complexed with its soluble receptor (IL-6 + sIL-6R), IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), and to a lesser extent, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (11Tamura T.

Phosphorylated STATs in turn undergo homo- and heterodimerization, after which they translocate to the nucleus and activate cytokine-responsive gene transcription (16Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar). STAT3 is required for several of the cellular responses to gp130 activation, including differentiation of myeloid cells (17Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc.

However, other signaling molecules have also been implicated as downstream effectors of gp130 activation. Specifically, STAT1 and, in some cases, STAT5 are phosphorylated following gp130 activation (21Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H.

Gouilleux F. Neumann B. Groner B. Hocke G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, gp130 activation can cause activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (14Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β may also mediate some of the downstream effects of gp130 activation (24Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Finally, gp130 activation can lead to activation of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which acts as a positive regulator of ciliary neurotrophic factor-induced c-fos expression (25Servidei T. Aoki Y. Lewis S.E. Symes A. Fink J.S. Reeves S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6233-6241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the studies presented in this paper, we have investigated whether STAT3 is required for the osteoclastogenic effects of gp130-activating cytokines and/or other stimuli thought to depend on gp130 signaling. We present evidence that STAT3 is an essential downstream effector of the signaling of IL-6-type cytokines during osteoclastogenesis and that the ultimate target of STAT3 during this process is induction of RANKL. In addition, we provide evidence that IL-1 stimulates osteoclastogenesis via gp130-STAT3 activation, whereas 1,25(OH)2D3and PTH act independently of gp130 or STAT3. Nonadherent bone marrow cells were prepared by removing femurs from 30–90-day-old C57BL/6J mice and flushing the marrow cavity with minimum essential medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Marrow cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105cells/cm2 in the same medium and cultured for 48 h, after which nonadherent cells were collected and counted. Nonadherent bone marrow cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104cells/cm2 together with the UAMS-32 stromal/osteoblastic cell line at 5 × 103 cells/cm2 in minimum essential medium-α containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For co-cultures involving conditional expression of transduced genes, retrovirally transduced UAMS-32 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml doxycycline-HCl (Sigma) for 2 days before the addition of nonadherent bone marrow cells. In either case, osteoclast-inducing hormones or cytokines were added at the indicated concentrations, and the co-cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 days. On day 3, one-half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After 6 days, cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and in some cases, they were assayed for the presence of calcitonin receptor as described previously (26Girasole G. Jilka R.L. Passeri G. Boswell S. Boder G. Williams D.C. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The ability of the osteoclast-like cells to form resorption pits was determined by performing co-cultures on slices of devitalized bovine cortical bone (a kind gift of P. Osdoby). After culturing, the slices were stripped of cells with dilute bleach, and pits were visualized by reflected light microscopy. Retroviral vectors were derived from the LNL-6 vector provided by Dr. Dusty Miller (27Bender M.A. Palmer T.D. Gelinas R.E. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vector LEN was constructed by mutating the EcoRI site downstream of the extended packaging sequence to a BglII site by linker insertion, followed by removal of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene as a BglII–SalI fragment. ABglII–SalI cassette containing the internal ribosome entry site from the 5′-untranslated region of encephalomyocarditis virus fused to the neomycin phosphotransferase gene was then inserted (28Ghattas I.R. Sanes J.R. Majors J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5848-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The tTA expression vector, pLEN-tTA, was generated from LEN by the insertion of a 1190-bpBamHI–HindIII fragment containing the tTA coding region (derived from pRetro-Off; CLONTECH) immediately 5′ of the encephalomyocarditis virus-neomycin phosphotransferase cassette. The self-inactivating retroviral vector pSIN was derived from the retroviral vector LED by deletion of anXbaI–PvuII fragment from the 3′-long terminal repeat, which removes the 75-bp direct repeats containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer (29Saylors R.L. Wall D.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Majors J.E. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 50-92Google Scholar). In addition, the 1383-bpBglII–XhoI fragment was replaced with a 30-bp fragment containing XhoI and NotI sites. A 440-bpXhoI–NotI fragment containing the TetO-CMV promoter (TRE) was removed from the plasmid pRetro-On (CLONTECH) and inserted into the same sites of pSIN to make the vector pST. To generate the Tet-regulated dn-STAT3 expression vector, a 2.5-kilobase pairXhoI–BglII fragment containing the dn-STAT3-FLAG coding region was removed from pY705F-FLAG (a gift from M. Saunders) (31Kapetein A. Paillard V. Saunders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and inserted downstream of the TRE of pST to yield pST-dn-STAT3. To generate the Tet-regulated dn-gp130 expression vector, a 130-bp DNA fragment consisting of three sequential Myc epitopes followed by a stop codon was inserted into the ScaI site of pmgp130 (a gift from T. Kishimoto) (32Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar). This insertion resulted in truncation of murine gp130 at glutamic acid 756. A 2.4-kilobase pairSacI–MluI fragment containing the truncated, Myc-tagged gp130 coding sequence was inserted downstream of the TRE of pST to yield pST-dn-gp130. The murine RANKL coding sequence was amplified from total RNA, obtained from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated UAMS-32 cells, using primers generated from the published sequence (7Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of the amplified cDNA was verified using a model 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To generate the Tet-regulated RANKL expression vector, the full-length cDNA was inserted downstream of the TRE of pST to yield pST-RANKL. Plasmids harboring retroviral constructs (6.5 μg/6-cm dish) were transiently transfected into the Phoenix ampho packaging cell line (33Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Supernatants containing viral particles were collected between 48 and 72 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Subconfluent UAMS-32 cells were exposed to viral supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene for 6–12 h and then incubated in fresh culture medium for 12–24 h. The cells were then exposed to aliquots of the same supernatant two additional times before expansion. Infections with the Tet-regulated constructs were carried out in the presence of 100 ng/ml doxycycline. Immunoblots of extracts from confluent retrovirally transduced UAMS-32 cells, cultured in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h, were performed as described previously (34Lin S.C. Yamate T. Taguchi Y. Borba V.Z. Girasole G. O'Brien C.A. Bellido T. Abe E. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1980-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The following dilutions of antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (Sigma), 1:500; anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), 1:6700; anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:5000; anti-gp130 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 1:4000; and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:12,500. The intensity of the immunoreactive bands (scanned into a digital format) was quantified using image analysis software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Transient transfection of retrovirally transduced UAMS-32 cells, plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates, was performed using LipofectAMINE as described previously (35O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15003-15010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The promoter-reporter construct used in this assay, p4xAPRE (a gift from I. Matsumura), contained a firefly luciferase gene controlled by composite promoter consisting of four STAT-binding elements from the α2-macroglobulin promoter inserted upstream from a minimal Jun B promoter (19Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity resulting from co-transfection of the plasmid pSVβ-gal (Promega). Retrovirally transduced UAMS-32 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish and cultured for 2 days in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml doxycycline. Vehicle, 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−8m), IL-6 + sIL-6R (50 and 100 ng/ml, respectively), or OSM (25 ng/ml) were added to the cells, and incubations were continued for 24 h. Total RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA fractionation (15 μg/lane), transfer to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridization were performed using the NorthernMax kit (Ambion). The following probes were utilized in this study: a 900-bp polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to the coding region of murine RANKL (7Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar), a 3.9-kilobase pair cDNA fragment coding for murine M-CSF (a gift from M. Harrington) (36Ladner M.B. Martin G.A. Noble J.A. Wittman V.P. Warren M.K. McGrogan M. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6706-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and a 905-bp cDNA fragment coding for murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion). Each probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a commercial kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). In order to study the role of STAT3 in osteoclastogenesis, it was necessary to obtain a stromal/osteoblastic cell line that supports osteoclast formation in response to IL-6-type cytokines as well as other osteoclast-inductive agents. We previously reported the isolation of several spontaneously transformed murine bone marrow cell lines that exhibited phenotypic characteristics of stromal/osteoblastic cells, including expression of osteoblast-specific genes and the ability to form a mineralized matrix in vitro(37Gubrij I. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. O'Brien C.A. Bone. 1998; 23 (abstr.): S216Google Scholar). When co-cultured with nonadherent bone marrow cells, as a source of osteoclast precursors, several of these lines supported the formation of cells that were multinucleated and TRAP-positive, phenotypic characteristics of osteoclast-like cells (38Suda T. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 87-102Google Scholar). For the studies described here, we selected one of these lines, UAMS-32, based on its ability to support osteoclast-like cell formation in response to several osteoclastogenic agents (Fig.1 A). UAMS-32 cells supported osteoclast-like cell formation when treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, IL-6 + sIL-6R, OSM, IL-1, or PTH. The presence of calcitonin receptors as well as the ability to excavate resorption pits on devitalized bovine cortical bone (Fig. 1,B and C, respectively) confirmed that the multinucleated, TRAP-positive cells were, in fact, authentic osteoclasts. To determine whether STAT3 is a downstream effector of gp130 in the osteoclast support function of stromal/osteoblastic cells, we sought to express a form of this protein that would block the activity of endogenous STAT3 in UAMS-32 cells. For this purpose, we utilized a mutant STAT3 protein in which the tyrosine at position 705 was changed to phenylalanine (Y705F) (31Kapetein A. Paillard V. Saunders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This mutation was shown to block phosphorylation of endogenous STAT3 as well as transactivation of a reporter gene by STAT3 and therefore functions in a dominant negative manner (31Kapetein A. Paillard V. Saunders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The dn-STAT3 has been tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the FLAG epitope to allow specific detection of this protein (Fig.2). To determine if pathways initiated by gp130 activation mediate the effects of other osteoclast inducing agents, we constructed a dn-gp130. This protein contains a carboxyl-terminal truncation to glutamic acid 756, followed by a Myc tag, thus removing the STAT3 and SHP-2 binding sites from the gp130 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 2), and is similar to a previously reported dominant negative version of human gp130 (39Kumanogoh A. Marukawa S. Kumanogoh T. Hirota H. Yoshida K. Lee I.S. Yasui T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Initially, we attempted to stably transfect UAMS-32 cells with plasmid constructs constitutively expressing either dn-STAT3 or dn-gp130. However, in both cases we were unable to isolate any cell clones that expressed significant levels of the dominant negative proteins or that demonstrated reduced gp130 signaling (not shown). A possible explanation for this result is that at the extremely low cell densities required for cloning, some level of gp130 or STAT3 activation, via an autocrine pathway, may be required for viability or proliferation. In order to circumvent this problem, we expressed these dominant negative proteins in UAMS-32 cells in a conditional manner utilizing the tetracycline-regulated gene expression system (40Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). This was accomplished by first generating a pool of cells infected with a retroviral construct constitutively expressing the transactivator fusion protein, tTA (pLEN-tTA). This pool of cells was then infected with a second viral construct containing either dn-STAT3 or dn-gp130 cDNA under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter (pST-dn-STAT3 or pST-dn-gp130, respectively). Induction of dn-STAT3 in cells transduced with pST-dn-STAT3 was analyzed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibodies. The FLAG-tagged dn-STAT3 was undetectable in extracts of cells grown in the presence of the potent tetracycline derivative, doxycycline (Fig.3). However, when the cells were cultured in the absence of doxycycline, high level expression of dn-STAT3 was observed. Analysis of the same blot with an antibody that recognized both the wild type and the dominant negative STAT3, which have the same gel mobility, indicated a severalfold increase in band intensity in the absence of doxycycline, suggesting that the dominant negative STAT3 was present in excess of the wild type protein. Similar results were obtained with the cells expressing the Myc-tagged dn-gp130. Immunodetection with an antibody that recognized the wild type, but not the dominant negative, gp130 indicated that dn-gp130 expression did not effect wild type protein levels. To demonstrate that the dominant negative constructs were functional, each pool of infected cells was transiently transfected with a promoter-luciferase construct that is responsive to activated STAT3. In the absence of the dominant negative proteins, IL-6 + sIL-6R or OSM stimulated the activity of this promoter severalfold (Fig.4). However, induction of either dn-STAT3 (left panel) or dn-gp130 (right panel) blocked this stimulation. These results demonstrate that withdrawal of doxycycline from cultures of these transduced cells results in expression levels of either dn-STAT3 or dn-gp130 that are sufficient to decrease the magnitude of the intracellular signaling initiated by IL-6-type cytokine binding. To determine if gp130-mediated osteoclast support requires functional STAT3, we analyzed the ability of UAMS-32 cells conditionally expressing dn-STAT3 to support osteoclast formation in response to either IL-6 + sIL-6R or OSM, as well as other osteoclast-inducing agents (Fig.5, left panel). In the presence of doxycycline, treatment with IL-6 + sIL-6R or OSM resulted in significant levels of osteoclast formation. However, when the co-cultures were performed in the absence of doxycycline, resulting in dn-STAT3 expression, osteoclast formation in response to either IL-6 + sIL-6R or OSM was completely abolished. Strikingly, osteoclast formation in response to IL-1 was also eliminated by expression of dn-STAT3. Expression of dn-STAT3 had no effect on 1,25(OH)2D3- or PTH-induced osteoclast formation, indicating that dn-STAT3 did not have a generalized negative effect on cell viability but blocked only specific pathways leading to osteoclast support. Essentially the same results were obtained when UAMS-32 cells conditionally expressing dn-gp130 were analyzed in parallel (Fig. 5, right panel). Previous studies have demonstrated that osteotropic agents stimulate the production of RANKL and that, together wit"
https://openalex.org/W2097912624,"We have investigated the inhibition of the recently identified family C13 cysteine peptidase, pig legumain, by human cystatin C. The cystatin was seen to inhibit enzyme activity by stoichiometric 1:1 binding in competition with substrate. TheK i value for the interaction was 0.20 nm, i.e. cystatin C had an affinity for legumain similar to that for the papain-like family C1 cysteine peptidase, cathepsin B. However, cystatin C variants with alterations in the N-terminal region and the “second hairpin loop” that rendered the cystatin inactive against cathepsin B, still inhibited legumain with K i values 0.2–0.3 nm. Complexes between cystatin C and papain inhibited legumain activity against benzoyl-Asn-NHPhNO2 as efficiently as did cystatin C alone. Conversely, cystatin C inhibited papain activity against benzoyl-Arg-NHPhNO2 whether or not the cystatin had been incubated with legumain, strongly indicating that the cystatin inhibited the two enzymes with non-overlapping sites. A ternary complex between legumain, cystatin C, and papain was demonstrated by gel filtration supported by immunoblotting. Screening of a panel of cystatin superfamily members showed that type 1 inhibitors (cystatins A and B) and low M r kininogen (type 3) did not inhibit pig legumain. Of human type 2 cystatins, cystatin D was non-inhibitory, whereas cystatin E/M and cystatin F displayed strong (K i 0.0016 nm) and relatively weak (K i 10 nm) affinity for legumain, respectively. Sequence alignments and molecular modeling led to the suggestion that a loop located on the opposite side to the papain-binding surface, between the α-helix and the first strand of the main β-pleated sheet of the cystatin structure, could be involved in legumain binding. This was corroborated by analysis of a cystatin C variant with substitution of the Asn39 residue in this loop (N39K-cystatin C); this variant showed a slight reduction in affinity for cathepsin B (K i 1.5 nm) but ≫5,000-fold lower affinity for legumain (K i ≫1,000 nm) than wild-type cystatin C.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The cystatins constitute a superfamily of evolutionarily related proteins that are all composed of at least one 100–120-residue domain with conserved sequence motifs (2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The single-domain human members of this superfamily are of two major types. The type 1 cystatins (or stefins) A and B contain approximately 100 amino acid residues, lack disulfide bridges, and are synthesized without signal peptides. Cystatins of type 2 are secreted proteins of approximately 120 amino acid residues (M r13,000–14,000) and contain at least two characteristic intrachain disulfide bonds. The type 2 cystatins include the human cystatins C, D, S, SN, and SA, which are all products of genes located in the cystatin multigene locus on chromosome 20 (3Schnittger S. Rao V.V. Abrahamson M. Hansmann I. Genomics. 1993; 16: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two recently identified type 2 cystatins, cystatin E/M and cystatin F (also called leukocystatin), are also secreted low M r proteins but are more atypical in that they are glycoproteins and show only 30–35% sequence identity in alignments with the classical type 2 cystatins. They are, however, still functional inhibitors of family C1 cysteine peptidases (4Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J. Yu G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S.

The amino acid sequences of legumains show that they belong to a distinct family of cysteine endopeptidases (C13). Mammalian legumain is predominantly lysosomal in distribution (16Chen J.M.

Human legumain may have an important physiological function as a key enzyme in antigen presentation (18Manoury B. Hewitt E.C. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).It was recently reported that pig legumain is inhibited by human cystatin C and chicken cystatin with K i values below 5 nm (15Chen J.-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This finding was unexpected, since the cystatins are already known as potent inhibitors of the papain-like cysteine peptidases in the unrelated family C1. The legumain family members are believed to have a protein fold quite unlike that of papain, and to be much more closely related to the caspases and gingipain (19Chen J.-M. Rawlings N.D. Stevens R.A.W. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although the active site cysteine residue could seem to be a common factor, it is known not to be required for the interaction of papain with cystatins (20Björk I. Ylinenjarvi K. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present investigation was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of mammalian legumain by cystatins.DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present investigation was to study the mechanism of inhibition of mammalian legumain by cystatins, to clarify how the inhibitor structure can result in tight-binding inhibition of enzymes belonging to two entirely different enzyme families, namely the papain family (C1) and the legumain family (C13). The different arrangements of catalytic residues and different active site motifs show that the two families are evolutionarily unrelated, and that their peptidases have different protein folds (19Chen J.-M. Rawlings N.D. Stevens R.A.W. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, legumain is not inhibited by the general inhibitor of enzymes belonging to family C1, E-64 (15Chen J.-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which supports the theory that the general topography of the active site clefts of legumains are probably entirely different from those of family C1 enzymes. Our present SEC, electrophoretic and enzyme kinetic results show that cystatin C can inhibit mammalian legumain, as cystatins inhibit family C1 enzymes (52Nicklin M.J.H. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), by high affinity reversible binding (K i 0.20 nm), in a bimolecular reaction that is competitive with substrate, and with no detectable cleavage of the cystatin in the legumain complex. Despite these similarities, our present results demonstrate that the mechanisms of inhibition of legumain and family C1 endopeptidases must be completely different.From structural studies of several cystatins (8Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 9Abrahamson M. Ritonja A. Brown M.A. Grubb A.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), it is well known that the N-terminal segment together with the “first and second hairpin loops” in cystatins are responsible for the inhibition of the C1 enzymes (Fig. 5). Consequently, removal of the N-terminal segment or substitution of any of the conserved amino acids in the N-terminal segment or the hairpin loops by Gly/Ala residues abolishes or seriously affects the inhibition of papain-like enzymes (26Hall A. Håkansson K. Mason R.W. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5115-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 53Auerswald E.A. Genenger G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. Engh R.A. Fritz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Of four such variants analyzed in the present study, all displayed virtually unaltered binding of legumain. Dimeric cystatin C, which is completely inactive against papain-like enzymes and by NMR studies has been shown to be a result of intermolecular interactions between the papain-binding surfaces of two cystatin C molecules (47Ekiel I. Abrahamson M. Fulton D.B. Lindahl P. Storer A.C. Levadoux W. Lafrance M. Labelle S. Pomerleau Y. Groleau D. LeSauteur L. Gehring K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), still showed legumain inhibition. We believe that this, together with the enzyme kinetic results presented and the direct demonstration of a ternary complex by SEC, proves that the binding sites for papain and legumain on cystatin C likely are completely independent of each other.Where then is the legumain reactive site? Our investigation of a set of other mammalian cystatin superfamily members indicated that the capacity to inhibit legumain is a property of only some cystatins (Table II). Guided by this result and amino acid sequence comparisons, we propose that the side of cystatins directly opposite to the papain-binding surface is responsible for the legumain binding and inhibition. The loop segment connecting the main α-helix of the cystatin structure to the first long β-strand contains a conserved Asn residue (residue 39 in cystatin C) and seems quite conserved in sequence in those cystatins that show inhibitory activity: cystatins C, E/M, and F. An importance of the Asn39 residue was confirmed by construction of the N39K cystatin C variant, which was seen to lack legumain inhibitory activity. A correctly positioned Asn residue on the cystatin surface could possibly result in an initial substrate-like interaction between the inhibitor and legumain. Besides the requirement for an Asn residue in the P1 position, legumains have no clear preferences for residues in other subsites (17Dando P.M. Fortunato M. Smith L. Knight C.G. McKendrick J.E. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,54Abe Y. Shirane K. Yokosawa H. Matsushita H. Mitta M. Kato I. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3525-3529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are therefore few obvious structural possibilities for specific legumain inhibition besides interaction with the S1 pocket. Still, assuming that the “back-side loop” containing Asn39 interacts with the enzyme in a mode resembling substrate binding, it appeared from the inhibition data obtained that a loop segment preferentially containing polar amino acids is compatible with legumain interaction. The consensus sequence found in the three inhibitory cystatins is Ser(Thr)-Asn39-Asp(Ser)-Met(Ile). Strikingly, a Ser38-Asn39-Asp40 sequence is completely conserved in mouse, rat, and bovine cystatin C, as well as in chicken cystatin, which also inhibits pig legumain (15Chen J.-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The positively charged Lys residue in this segment, present in the non-inhibitory cystatins B and D, may be unfavorable for inhibition.The suggested binding loop must be able to adopt a conformation to allow legumain interaction, but at the same time not expose the Asn39-Xaa bond to cleavage. A different back-side loop conformation may be one reason why the type 1 cystatins studied, with a loop sequence largely containing the proposed consensus sequence for legumain inhibition, although being two residues smaller, do not show inhibitory activity (Fig. 6). In the case of the inhibitory cystatins, the loop might be partially restrained in cystatin F as Cys37 likely is involved in a disulfide bridge (5Ni J. Fernandez M.A. Danielsson L. Chillakuru R.A. Zhang J. Grubb A. Su J. Gentz R. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24797-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which can explain why cystatin F is a poorer inhibitor than cystatin C and E/M. The size and conformation of the loop could also be one reason why cystatin D does not inhibit legumain, because of an amino acid insertion in this loop (Fig. 4). For the type 3 cystatin studied, human L-kininogen, the lack of legumain-inhibitory activity may be due to steric reasons, as both legumain and kininogen are bulky molecules. Two of the three cystatin domains of kininogens are clearly able to inhibit papain-like peptidases (55Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which demonstrates that the papain-binding surfaces of these domains are exposed and accessible to protein interactions. Whether the kininogen structure is sufficiently flexible to also allow exposure of the back-side loops on the opposite sides of these domains is presently unclear, as a three-dimensional model for type 3 cystatins is unfortunately not yet available. For the individual kininogen domains, the sequence requirements for a legumain-binding back-side loop suggested above seem to be fulfilled for domain 3, but not for domain 2 of human kininogen. Clearly, more studies are needed to clarify whether perhaps some variants of low or high M r kininogens, resulting from proteolytic cleavages to release the kinin portion or individual cystatin domains of the protein, display legumain-inhibitory activity.Although our initial studies indicate that the back-side loop around Asn39 is important for the ability of some cystatins to efficiently inhibit legumain, other cystatin segments may also be involved in interactions with the enzyme, just as several segments are involved in the cystatin inhibition of papain. The very flexible loop between the second and third of the four main β-strands of the cystatin structure, from Thr74 to Asn82 (which is not present in type 1 cystatins) may prove essential to stabilize the enzyme-inhibitor interaction, given its close proximity to the Asn39 loop (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this segment contains a five-residue insertion in the most efficient legumain inhibitor we identified, cystatin E/M (4Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J. Yu G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). That this loop contains the primary binding site for legumain seems quite unlikely, however, as the loop sequence is relatively conserved between human cystatins C and D (Fig.4), of which only cystatin C shows legumain-inhibitory activity.In conclusion, our present results strongly indicate that the loop between the α-helix and the first strand of the main β-pleated sheet of the cystatin structure and its Asn39 residue, is part of a novel second reactive site of some cystatins. Cystatins carrying this site are sufficiently potent to be physiological inhibitors of mammalian legumain. Since legumain-like activity has very recently been shown to be crucial for cellular presentation of certain antigens to the immune system, but no efficient inhibitors to this activity are presently known (18Manoury B. Hewitt E.C. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), continued studies to elucidate and explore the mechanism of legumain inhibition by the novel cystatin site may prove valuable. The activities of cysteine peptidases of the papain family (C1) such as cathepsins B, H, L, S, and K in and around mammalian cells are regulated by reversible, tight-binding protein inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily (1Abrahamson M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The cystatins constitute a superfamily of evolutionarily related proteins that are all composed of at least one 100–120-residue domain with conserved sequence motifs (2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The single-domain human members of this superfamily are of two major types. The type 1 cystatins (or stefins) A and B contain approximately 100 amino acid residues, lack disulfide bridges, and are synthesized without signal peptides. Cystatins of type 2 are secreted proteins of approximately 120 amino acid residues (M r13,000–14,000) and contain at least two characteristic intrachain disulfide bonds. The type 2 cystatins include the human cystatins C, D, S, SN, and SA, which are all products of genes located in the cystatin multigene locus on chromosome 20 (3Schnittger S. Rao V.V. Abrahamson M. Hansmann I. Genomics. 1993; 16: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two recently identified type 2 cystatins, cystatin E/M and cystatin F (also called leukocystatin), are also secreted low M r proteins but are more atypical in that they are glycoproteins and show only 30–35% sequence identity in alignments with the classical type 2 cystatins. They are, however, still functional inhibitors of family C1 cysteine peptidases (4Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J. Yu G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S.

Abrahamson M. Fulton D.B. Lindahl P. Storer A.C. Levadoux W. Lafrance M. Labelle S. Pomerleau Y. Groleau D. LeSauteur L. Gehring K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), still showed legumain inhibition. We believe that this, together with the enzyme kinetic results presented and the direct demonstration of a ternary complex by SEC, proves that the binding sites for papain and legumain on cystatin C likely are completely independent of each other.Where then is the legumain reactive site? Our investigation of a set of other mammalian cystatin superfamily members indicated that the capacity to inhibit legumain is a property of only some cystatins (Table II). Guided by this result and amino acid sequence comparisons, we propose that the side of cystatins directly opposite to the papain-binding surface is responsible for the legumain binding and inhibition. The loop segment connecting the main α-helix of the cystatin structure to the first long β-strand contains a conserved Asn residue (residue 39 in cystatin C) and seems quite conserved in sequence in those cystatins that show inhibitory activity: cystatins C, E/M, and F. An importance of the Asn39 residue was confirmed by construction of the N39K cystatin C variant, which was seen to lack legumain inhibitory activity. A correctly positioned Asn residue on the cystatin surface could possibly result in an initial substrate-like interaction between the inhibitor and legumain. Besides the requirement for an Asn residue in the P1 position, legumains have no clear preferences for residues in other subsites (17Dando P.M. Fortunato M. Smith L. Knight C.G. McKendrick J.E. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,54Abe Y. Shirane K. Yokosawa H. Matsushita H. Mitta M. Kato I. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3525-3529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are therefore few obvious structural possibilities for specific legumain inhibition besides interaction with the S1 pocket. Still, assuming that the “back-side loop” containing Asn39 interacts with the enzyme in a mode resembling substrate binding, it appeared from the inhibition data obtained that a loop segment preferentially containing polar amino acids is compatible with legumain interaction. The consensus sequence found in the three inhibitory cystatins is Ser(Thr)-Asn39-Asp(Ser)-Met(Ile). Strikingly, a Ser38-Asn39-Asp40 sequence is completely conserved in mouse, rat, and bovine cystatin C, as well as in chicken cystatin, which also inhibits pig legumain (15Chen J.-M. Dando P.M.

The positively charged Lys residue in this segment, present in the non-inhibitory cystatins B and D, may be unfavorable for inhibition.The suggested binding loop must be able to adopt a conformation to allow legumain interaction, but at the same time not expose the Asn39-Xaa bond to cleavage. A different back-side loop conformation may be one reason why the type 1 cystatins studied, with a loop sequence largely containing the proposed consensus sequence for legumain inhibition, although being two residues smaller, do not show inhibitory activity (Fig. 6). In the case of the inhibitory cystatins, the loop might be partially restrained in cystatin F as Cys37 likely is involved in a disulfide bridge (5Ni J. Fernandez M.A. Danielsson L. Chillakuru R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24797-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which can explain why cystatin F is a poorer inhibitor than cystatin C and E/M. The size and conformation of the loop could also be one reason why cystatin D does not inhibit legumain, because of an amino acid insertion in this loop (Fig. 4). For the type 3 cystatin studied, human L-kininogen, the lack of legumain-inhibitory activity may be due to steric reasons, as both legumain and kininogen are bulky molecules. Two of the three cystatin domains of kininogens are clearly able to inhibit papain-like peptidases (55Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which demonstrates that the papain-binding surfaces of these domains are exposed and accessible to protein interactions. Whether the kininogen structure is sufficiently flexible to also allow exposure of the back-side loops on the opposite sides of these domains is presently unclear, as a three-dimensional model for type 3 cystatins is unfortunately not yet available. For the individual kininogen domains, the sequence requirements for a legumain-binding back-side loop suggested above seem to be fulfilled for domain 3, but not for domain 2 of human kininogen. Clearly, more studies are needed to clarify whether perhaps some variants of low or high M r kininogens, resulting from proteolytic cleavages to release the kinin portion or individual cystatin domains of the protein, display legumain-inhibitory activity.Although our initial studies indicate that the back-side loop around Asn39 is important for the ability of some cystatins to efficiently inhibit legumain, other cystatin segments may also be involved in interactions with the enzyme, just as several segments are involved in the cystatin inhibition of papain. The very flexible loop between the second and third of the four main β-strands of the cystatin structure, from Thr74 to Asn82 (which is not present in type 1 cystatins) may prove essential to stabilize the enzyme-inhibitor interaction, given its close proximity to the Asn39 loop (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this segment contains a five-residue insertion in the most efficient legumain inhibitor we identified, cystatin E/M (4Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J. Yu G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). That this loop contains the primary binding site for legumain seems quite unlikely, however, as the loop sequence is relatively conserved between human cystatins C and D (Fig.4), of which only cystatin C shows legumain-inhibitory activity.In conclusion, our present results strongly indicate that the loop between the α-helix and the first strand of the main β-pleated sheet of the cystatin structure and its Asn39 residue, is part of a novel second reactive site of some cystatins. Cystatins carrying this site are sufficiently potent to be physiological inhibitors of mammalian legumain. Since legumain-like activity has very recently been shown to be crucial for cellular presentation of certain antigens to the immune system, but no efficient inhibitors to this activity are presently known (18Manoury B. Hewitt E.C. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), continued studies to elucidate and explore the mechanism of legumain inhibition by the novel cystatin site may prove valuable. The aim of the present investigation was to study the mechanism of inhibition of mammalian legumain by cystatins, to clarify how the inhibitor structure can result in tight-binding inhibition of enzymes belonging to two entirely different enzyme families, namely the papain family (C1) and the legumain family (C13). The different arrangements of catalytic residues and different active site motifs show that the two families are evolutionarily unrelated, and that their peptidases have different protein folds (19Chen J.-M. Rawlings N.D. Stevens R.A.W. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, legumain is not inhibited by the general inhibitor of enzymes belonging to family C1, E-64 (15Chen J.-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which supports the theory that the general topography of the active site clefts of legumains are probably entirely different from those of family C1 enzymes. Our present SEC, electrophoretic and enzyme kinetic results show that cystatin C can inhibit mammalian legumain, as cystatins inhibit family C1 enzymes (52Nicklin M.J.H. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), by high affinity reversible binding (K i 0.20 nm), in a bimolecular reaction that is competitive with substrate, and with no detectable cleavage of the cystatin in the legumain complex. Despite these similarities, our present results demonstrate that the mechanisms of inhibition of legumain and family C1 endopeptidases must be completely different. From structural studies of several cystatins (8Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 9Abrahamson M. Ritonja A. Brown M.A. Grubb A. Machleidt W. Barrett A.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), it is well known that the N-terminal segment together with the “first and second hairpin loops” in cystatins are responsible for the inhibition of the C1 enzymes (Fig. 5). Consequently, removal of the N-terminal segment or substitution of any of the conserved amino acids in the N-terminal segment or the hairpin loops by Gly/Ala residues abolishes or seriously affects the inhibition of papain-like enzymes (26Hall A.

Recently, E-cadherins have been also implicated in a number of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation, cell recognition, and sorting during developmental morphogenesis, as well as in aggregation-dependent cell survival. As phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt play a critical role in survival pathways in response to both growth factors and extracellular stimuli, these observations prompted us to explore whether E-cadherins could affect intracellular molecules regulating the activity of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade. Using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as a model system, we show here that engagement of E-cadherins in homophylic calcium-dependent cell-cell interactions results in a rapid PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt and the subsequent translocation of Akt to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the activation of PI 3-kinase in response to cell-cell contact formation involves the phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase in tyrosine residues, and the concomitant recruitment of PI 3-kinase to E-cadherin-containing protein complexes. These findings indicate that E-cadherins can initiate outside-in signal transducing pathways that regulate the activity of PI 3-kinase and Akt, thus providing a novel molecular mechanism whereby the interaction among neighboring cells and their adhesion status may ultimately control the fate of epithelial cells.

Among them, cadherins and integrins play a major role, as they are able to recognize and interact with other cell adhesion receptors on neighboring cells or with proteins of the extracellular matrix, respectively (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar, 3Kemler R.

E-cadherins belong to the family of integral membrane glycoproteins promoting homophylic calcium-dependent cell-cell interactions and are well characterized adhesion receptors found within adherens-type junctions in epithelia. The extracellular domain of E-cadherins is able to mediate per se calcium-dependent homotypic interactions at sites of cell-cell contacts, while its highly conserved intracytoplasmic tail is involved in the strengthening of the homophylic adhesions by binding a set of related proteins called catenins which, in turn, link the complex to the actin cytoskeleton and elicit certain nuclear responses (4Ozawa M.

In contrast, the generation of signals at the level of adherens junctions as a consequence of E-cadherin engagement has been thus far poorly investigated, although newly available evidence suggest that E-cadherins may participate in transducing outside-in signals (16Bullions L.C. Levine A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Of interest, it has been reported recently that E-cadherins can mediate aggregation-dependent cell survival in a variety of experimental settings (17Kantak S.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar), these observations prompted us to investigate whether E-cadherins could affect the activity of signaling molecules controlling Akt function. In this study, we used an in vitro model for the disruption and subsequent re-formation of E-cadherin-dependent interactions in epithelial MDCK1 cells to explore the possibility that E-cadherin-mediated cellular aggregation could result in Akt activation. We provide evidence that engagement of E-cadherins in homophylic adhesion with neighboring cells promotes a remarkable PI 3-kinase-dependent increase in the state of activation of Akt and the rapid translocation of Akt to the nucleus. We also demonstrate that engagement of E-cadherins is necessary and sufficient for the induction of Akt activity upon adherens junction assembly, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate a physical association between PI 3-kinase and E-cadherin-containing multiprotein complexes in response to cell-cell contact formation, thus providing a likely mechanism for Akt activation. Overall, these findings indicate that E-cadherins may initiate outside-in signal transducing pathways, thus supporting an active role for E-cadherins in the control of key early post-aggregation events. An expression vector for hemagglutinin-(HA) tagged Akt (pCEFL-HA-Akt) has been reported elsewhere (22Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Antibodies to the extracellular domain of E-cadherin molecule (DECMA-1 clone, Sigma) were used for immunostaining and for antibody inhibition experiments. An anti-HA-specific monoclonal antibody (HA11, Babco, Richmond, CA) and a goat polyclonal anti-Akt antibody (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) were used to detect ectopic and endogenously expressed Akt, respectively. Antibodies against the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P), G410 clone) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Cappel Laboratories (Durham, NC). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments were performed as described previously (22Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were serum-starved overnight in the presence of 10 mm Hepes, and E-cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell contacts were disrupted by treatment with EGTA to a final concentration of 4 mm for 30–40 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, intercellular interactions were allowed to re-establish in the presence of fresh, calcium-containing medium (final concentration CaCl2 ∼1.8 mm) (24Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At different time points after calcium restoration, cells were harvested, lysed on ice, and assayed for Akt activity in immunocomplex kinase reactions, using histone 2B as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (22Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Comparable immunoprecipitation and loading of wild-type and epitope-tagged Akt kinase were determined by immunoblotting membranes with anti-Akt and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. For measurement of PI 3-kinase activity, whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. The PI 3-kinase assay was subsequently performed as described previously (25Gutkind J.S. Lacal P.M. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3806-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by evaluating the ability of the immunoprecipitates to phosphorylate PI to yield phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). After thin layer chromatography,32P-labeled phospholipids were detected by autoradiography. In some experiments, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (50 nm, Sigma) was used. Autoradiograms were quantified on a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software. MDCK cells were grown on glass coverslips to confluence, washed with PBS, and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Rat anti-E-cadherin (1:1000) and mouse anti-HA (1:50) antibodies were used to detect E-cadherin and HA-tagged Akt, respectively. Following incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies (1:200) conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate or fluorescein isothiocyanate, respectively, the cells were washed, mounted in anti-fade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and examined under an UV microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) at a × 40 or × 63 magnification using the appropriate filters. Images were processed using Adobe photoshop. Using epithelial MDCK cells, we first evaluated whether adherens junction assembly could affect the state of activation of endogenous Akt. As epithelial cells require Ca2+ to form homophylic cell-cell adhesions, a simple method to study the adhesive properties of surface molecules involves the disruption of Ca2+-dependent homotypic boundaries among cells by EGTA-treatment and the re-establishment of cell-cell contacts by the subsequent restoration of Ca2+ ions (24Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Whereas control cells present a typical pattern of E-cadherin immunostaining at the level of cell-cell contacts (Fig.1 A, panel a), in cells treated with the calcium chelator, EGTA, E-cadherins appear to be diffusely distributed (Fig. 1 A, panel b). In this case, the loss of E-cadherins at the level of cell-cell contacts is most likely due to their redistribution throughout the cell surface rather than to the internalization of E-cadherins, as reported for other types of cadherins (26Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). After restoration of calcium, de novo formation of adherens junctions could be observed as early as 5–10 min (Fig. 1 A, panel c), and the process appeared to be almost complete after 30–40 min (Fig.1 A, panel d). To explore the possibility that E-cadherin engagement leads to Akt activation, MDCK cells were grown as long confluent cultures by maintaining cells in complete medium for at least 24–48 h after reaching confluence, to optimize cell-cell contacts as well as to minimize the influence of integrin-extracellular matrix interactions (27Kinch M.S. Petch L. Zhong C. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were then serum-starved for 18–24 h and cell-cell contacts disrupted by the treatment with EGTA (4 mm) for 30–40 min. Subsequently, adherens junctions were allowed to re-form in the presence of fresh calcium-containing medium, and, at the indicated time points, cells were lysed and assayed for Akt kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, under these experimental conditions, the reassembly of adherens junctions induced a remarkable elevation of Akt kinase activity. Kinetic studies demonstrated a rapid increase in Akt activity as early as 15 min after calcium restoration, with a peak at 30–40 min followed by a decrease over a 1-h time course. Stable expression of a HA-tagged Akt in transfected MDCK cells revealed to be a useful tool to enhance the detectability of Akt activation upon E-cadherin engagement. Kinetics of activation of ectopically expressed Akt (Fig. 1 B, panel b) was similar to that observed for the endogenous enzymatic activity (Fig. 1 B,panel a), thus suggesting that endogenous levels of E-cadherins and Akt are sufficient to sustain a potent Akt activity following adherens junction assembly under physiological conditions. Following activation by a PI 3-kinase-mediated pathway, Akt has been shown previously to translocate to the nucleus (28Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), where it participates in the regulation gene expression (29Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, we examined whether E-cadherin engagement could lead to a change in the subcellular distribution of an ectopically expressed Akt. Serum-starved cells stimulated with EGF (100 nm) for 5–10 min were used as a positive control (Fig. 1 C, panel d). Whereas Akt appeared to be diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of untreated and EGTA-treated cells (Fig. 1 C, panels a and b), respectively, calcium restoration caused a marked translocation of Akt to the nucleus (Fig. 1 C, panel c). To confirm that Akt activation is not due to the manipulation of calcium levels but to the ability of calcium restoration to mimic the physiological engagement of E-cadherins in cell-cell contacts, we took advantage of the availability of function-perturbing anti-E-cadherin antibodies, DECMA-1 clone, which have been described previously to be effective in blocking E-cadherin mediated adherens junction formation (30Vestweber D. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3393-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.2 (A and B, sixth lanes), pretreatment with anti-E-cadherin antibodies, that hinders the formation of adherens junctions, led to a dramatic suppression of Akt activity upon calcium restoration. This suggests that E-cadherin-dependent homophylic interactions among cells are strictly required for induction of Akt activity. In contrast, the presence of anti-E-cadherin antibodies did not affect EGF-induced Akt activation (Fig. 2, A and B, third lanes), thus establishing the specificity of the experimental approach and suggesting that E-cadherin-mediated Akt activation occurs through a growth factor-independent mechanism. Unexpectedly, during the course of dose-response experiments with blocking antibodies, we observed that high antibody dilutions caused a dramatic increase in the activity of Akt (Fig. 2, A and B, eighth lanes). Antibody immobilization experiments, using MDCK cells suspended in 4 mm EDTA and plated on cell culture dishes precoated with different antibody dilutions, confirmed these observations (data not shown). The most straightforward explanation for these seemingly conflicting results relies on the fact that in the presence of a vast excess of DECMA-1 antibodies the majority of the antibody-bound E-cadherins would be expected to remain in a monomeric, inactive form. However, at high antibody dilutions each molecule of antibody would be expected to bind two molecules of E-cadherin, thus causing lateral dimerization and clustering of E-cadherins, which can mimic E-cadherin activation by calcium-dependent homophylic interactions (31Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that E-cadherin engagement is necessary and sufficient for Akt activation in response to adherens junction assembly. The Akt/PKB kinase represents a downstream target of PI 3-kinase in a pathway critical for signaling cell survival in response to several stresses or growth factor deprivation (20Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 21Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 22Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We therefore used a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, to address the possible involvement of PI 3-kinase in the induction of Akt kinase activity by adherens junction assembly. As shown in Fig. 3, preincubation of cells with wortmannin (50 nm) for 30 min before addition of calcium completely abolished Akt activation, with Akt kinase levels falling even below the unstimulated background in wild-type as well as in stably transfected MDCK cells. These observations suggested that the functional activity of PI 3-kinase is required for the activation of Akt in response to E-cadherin engagement. Agonist activation of PI 3-kinase frequently involves the translocation of this enzyme to the plasma membrane where it can gain access to its lipid substrates (reviewed in Ref. 33Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, it was tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism may underlie the activation of Akt upon organization of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. In preliminary experiments we found that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase was tyrosine-phosphorylated as a function of time after calcium restoration, overlapping with the kinetics of Akt activation (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to evaluate directly the pattern of activation of PI 3-kinase after immunoprecipitation of MDCK cell lysates with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. Of interest, the profile of PI 3-kinase activity after calcium restoration mirrored that of Akt, as illustrated in Fig. 4 A. We next tested the possibility that Akt activation in response to E-cadherin engagement could involve the docking of PI 3-kinase to the adherens junction complex. As shown in Fig. 4 B, upon calcium restoration, PI 3-kinase was found to be associated to the E-cadherin immunoprecipitates in a time-dependent manner, as judged by Western blotting with specific anti-p85/PI 3-kinase antibodies. Taken together, overall results of this study indicate that one of the molecular events resulting from the E-cadherin-mediated cellular aggregation is the rapid activation of a PI 3-kinase/Akt cascade. Although the mechanism whereby E-cadherin engagement stimulates this biochemical route is not fully understood, it most likely involves a yet to be identified tyrosine kinase, which, when activated in response to E-cadherin mediated-cellular aggregation, might facilitate the recruitment of PI 3-kinase to E-cadherin-containing complexes at the level of the plasma membrane. Indeed, the recovery of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-E-cadherin antibodies, along with the kinetic pattern of PI 3-kinase activity detected in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates, strongly argue in favor of this hypothesis. As PI 3-kinases are known to play a central role in a number of cellular processes, including mitogenic signaling and cell survival, cytoskeletal remodeling, as well as metabolic control and vesicular trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 33Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), our present findings may have broad implications to the understanding of epithelial cell biology. In this scenario, E-cadherins might function as “relationship molecules” between the extracellular and the intracellular environment, initiating the transduction of intracellular signaling pathways stimulating the PI 3-kinase/Akt cascade. This might provide an interesting mechanism whereby the adhesion status of the cells may control the cell fate, including cell survival or death by apoptosis, as well as other critical events occurring during the stepwise organization of the epithelium."

Degenerate oligonucleotides based on amino-terminal sequence analysis of the purified protein were used to isolate the corresponding cDNA from a library generated from this cell line. Sk is a novel 266-amino acid protein that contains a signal peptide sequence and two cysteine-rich domains with no similarity to other known growth factors.

In vitro translation and endoglycosylase analysis indicated that this doublet, which was also observed in cells expressing the endogenous protein, arises from posttranslational modification. A search of the GenBankTM data base revealed a match of Sk with Dkk-1, which is a novel secreted protein required for head induction in amphibian embryos and a potent Wnt inhibitor.

In Xenopus embryonic development, Wnt signaling is involved in dorsoventral axial patterning both before and after the midblastula transition (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Wnts bind and act through the frizzled family of cell surface proteins, a large family of seven membrane-spanning domain receptors (3Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). A number of downstream components of Wnt signaling have been identified by a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. Wnts act through the cytoplasmic protein dishevelled to inhibit the activity of the serine threonine kinase glycogen synthetase kinase-3. Glycogen synthetase kinase-3 appears to bind through a bridging molecule, Axin, to the β-catenin/adenomatous polyposis coli complex and phosphorylate β-catenin, causing its rapid degradation. Wnt-induced inhibition of glycogen synthetase kinase-3 leads to β-catenin stabilization resulting in an increased level of the uncomplexed soluble form (4Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 5Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 6Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B.

The latter can interact with T-cell factor/LEF transcription factors and, after translocation to the nucleus, activate target genes (7Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D.

Moreover, in cell culture, several Wnt family members have been shown to induce altered morphology and increased saturation density of certain epithelial (9Brown A.M. Wildin R.S. Prendergast T.J.

Finally, genetic alterations affecting adenomatous polyposis coli or β-catenin levels, have been observed in human colon cancer (13Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B.

A. 1998; 95: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), indicating that aberrations of Wnt signaling pathways are critical to the development of these and possibly other human cancers. Recent studies in Xenopus embryos have identified several families of inhibitors of Wnt signaling. One, designated as frizzled-related protein (FRP)1 (16Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), has structural similarities to the frizzled family of Wnt receptors. Wnt interacts with frizzled to induce axis duplication following coinjection of earlyXenopus embryos (17He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H. Science. 1997; 275: 1652-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In contrast, FRP, also designated as Frzb (18Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S.H. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 19Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos Jr., M. Cell. 1997; 88: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), inhibits Wnt-induced axis duplication. FRP shares with frizzled a cysteine-rich domain, which has been shown to confer Wnt binding properties (3Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Thus, FRPs presumably act as Wnt antagonists at the level of receptor binding. The gene cerberus encodes for a secreted protein that is capable of inducing ectopic head formation in Xenopusembryos (20Bouwmeester T. Kim S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that this protein is a multivalent growth factor antagonist capable of binding Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein, and Wnt proteins, inhibiting their effects (21Piccolo S. Agius E. Leyns L. Bhattacharyya S. Grunz H. Bouwmeester T. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 1999; 397: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Another inhibitor was isolated by an expression cloning strategy for cDNAs able to complement in the formation of a complete secondary axis in Xenopus (22Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). A novel molecule, designated dickkopf-1 (dkk-1) (German for “big head, stubborn”) encoded by the isolated cDNA, contained a signal sequence as well as two cysteine-rich domains and was unrelated to any previous protein. Like FRP, Dkk-1 was shown to possess the ability to inhibit Wnt-induced axis duplication. Genetic analysis indicated further that Dkk-1 acts upstream of dishevelled to inhibit Wnt signaling (22Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). In the course of efforts to isolate novel epidermal growth factor-like ligands, we identified a human Dkk-1 homologue, which we have characterized in the present study with respect to its expression pattern and function as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling in mammalian cells. SK-LMS-1 cells were plated onto 175-cm2 T flasks and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Conditioned medium was then generated by two consecutive harvests in serum-free medium for 72 h, alternate by 4 days of culturing with serum containing medium. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to each harvest cycle. Approximately 5 liters of pooled conditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Corning) and concentrated 40 times by an Amicon ultrafiltration system, using membrane of 20-kDa molecular size cut-off. Purification steps were performed by means of a Bio-Rad Econo low pressure chromatography system. Aliquots from each step were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and tested for their capacity to induce erbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation as described previously (23Alimandi M. Romano A. Curia M.C. Muraro R. Fedi P. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar). Silver staining (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to monitor the level of purification through different steps. The concentrated material was directly loaded on a column of heparin-Sepharose (5 ml, HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed twice with PBS to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Elution was performed by a step gradient of NaCl (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, and 2 m) and 10-ml fractions were collected. The 1 m active fraction was diluted to adjust the NaCl concentration to 0.15 m, and applied to a cation exchange column (1 ml, HiTrap SP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were then eluted with a step gradient of NaCl (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1m), and 3-ml fractions were collected. The active 0.4m fraction was then subjected to separation using a Cu2+ chelating column (1 ml, HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Competitive elution was performed by a linear gradient of NH4Cl (from 0.4 to 1 m) in 0.02 mNa2PO4 at pH 7.4. Silver staining analysis of the active fractions revealed a 35-kDa doublet. Such samples were combined, quantitated, and subjected to microsequencing. Approximately 3 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon membrane and loaded into an Applied Biosystem gas-phase protein sequenator, equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer (model 120A, Applied Biosystems). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from SK-LMS-1 cells by oligo(dT) cellulose column chromatography (Collaborative Research, Type 3) and a cDNA library constructed as described previously (24Miki T. Fleming T.P. Crescenzi M. Molloy C.J. Blam S.B. Reynolds S.H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For isolation of the cDNA encoding the microsequenced protein, nested PCR amplifications were conducted on the cDNA library phages, using vector-specific primers upstream (BamHI-adapted) and degenerate primers corresponding to amino-terminal protein sequence downstream (EcoRI-adapted). In an attempt to reduce degeneracy of gene-specific primers, inosine (I) residues were incorporated. For the first PCR amplification, the oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCGATCATTTAGGTGACACACTATA-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCAC(G/A)GC(G/A)TCICCIGG(G/A)TG-3′ were used with the cDNA library as template. The following nested PCR was performed by using as template an aliquot of the first PCR reaction and 5′-GAATACGGATCCGTCGACGGC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCGGIAG(A/G)TT(C/T)TT(G/A/T)ATIGC(G/A)TT-3′ as primers. Southern blot hybridization was used to monitor specificity of the correct amplification product using the degenerate oligonucleotide 5′-GGIA(G/A)(G/A)TT(C/T)TTIATIGC(G/A)TTI(G/C)(A/T)(G/A)TT-3′ as a probe. Following cloning of the PCR product in the TA cloning vector (Stratagene), positive clones were identified by hybridization and subjected to sequence analysis by dideoxy chain-termination. A gene-specific insert was used as a probe for screening of the SK-LMS-1 cDNA library to isolate the entire coding sequence as described previously (26Kraus M.H. Aaronson S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Ten positive clones were isolated and classified into three groups based on the restriction pattern after digestion withNotI. The insert from one representative clone from each group was sequenced on both strands using the ABI373A automated DNA sequencer and the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Search for homology with known sequences was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology data base (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Alignments were generated with the Pile-up and Bestfit programs from the Wisconsin Package, Version 9.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). To generate antiserum to the protein, a SalI site was generated by PCR in frame with the coding sequence and subcloned in the pGEX-5X-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bacterially induced GST fusion protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electroelution. Immunization of rabbits was performed as described previously (27Kraus M.H. Fedi P. Starks V. Muraro R. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2900-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) Total RNA was isolated by using RNAZol (Tel-Test, Inc.). RNA samples (25 μg) were separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, followed by hybridization with32P-labeled probe as described (26Kraus M.H. Aaronson S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a variety of adult and embryonic tissues were purchased from CLONTECH and hybridized following manufacturer's specifications. The human tumor cell lines SK-LMS-1, SK-OV3, and PA-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection analysis, the cDNA was subcloned in pCEV29, after removal by restriction digestion of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions using the restriction enzymes PleI and BsmI, respectively. The Wnt-2 HFc fusion protein construct has been previously described (11Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 per plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, cultures were transfected with 1 μg of each plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method, as described previously (29Fedi P. Pierce J.H. di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Marker selected cultures were obtained by addition to the growth medium of 750 μg/ml of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Calbiochem). Subconfluent cultures of 293T cells (11Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were subjected to transfection by the calcium phosphate method with 3 μg of plasmid DNA. Cultures were incubated with the precipitated DNA for 5–6 h and then washed in growth medium. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium, and conditioned medium was collected after an additional 24 hours. Aliquots (1 ml) of conditioned medium harvested from tumor cell lines or transfected cells, were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting analysis as described previously (27Kraus M.H. Fedi P. Starks V. Muraro R. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2900-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by addition of Gammabind G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and separated by SDS-PAGE (29Fedi P. Pierce J.H. di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodetection was then performed by use of 125I-labeled protein A. In vitrotranscription and translation was performed with a commercially available kit from Promega (TNTTM coupled reticulocyte lysate system). Briefly, 0.5 μg of cDNA was used for each reaction with or without the addition of canine pancreatic microsomal membrane (Promega), following the manufacturer's instruction. Translation products were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. 14C-labeled marker was used for molecular weight determination. For Wnt-2 HFc detection, 100 μg of total cell lysates from cultures solubilized in radioimmune precipitation buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. Specific signals were visualized by ECL analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation with horse peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-mouse HFc antibody (2.6 μg/ml; DAKO). One ml of conditioned medium from cultured SK-LMS-1 cells was immunoprecipitated using the rabbit antiserum as described previously. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 40 μl of PBS that contained 0.1% SDS. Samples were then boiled for 5 min, followed by addition of 100 μl of PBS and Nonidet P-40 (final 1%). N-GlycosydaseF (20 units, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and samples were incubated at overnight 37 °C The digested proteins were then separated on a 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with Sk antiserum. The GST-E-cadherin binding assay was performed as described previously (11Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterially expressed GST-E-cadherin was purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 0.1 or 1 mg of each cell lysate. The GST-E-cadherin/β-catenin complex bound to the beads was recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-β-catenin antisera (Transduction Laboratories). Detection was performed with 125I-labeled protein A. In the course of the purification of ligands for the erbB3 receptor, we identified a protein that appeared as a doublet of 35 kDa by silver staining analysis and co-eluted with Neuregulin. Microsequencing of the purified material revealed positive identification for both bands in a single run of several amino acids as follows: TLNSVLNSNAIKNLPPPLGGAAGHPGDAVXA (Xindicates inability to make an amino acid assignment). Comparison of the amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein with those in several data bases revealed no significant homology, suggesting that this might be a novel protein. Degenerate oligos were designed for isolation by PCR of a gene-specific insert that was used for the cloning of the full-length coding sequence from a SK-LMS-1 cDNA library. After three consecutive screening cycles, positive clones were classified into three groups based on their restriction digestion patterns. Sequence analysis of one clone (1.5 kb) demonstrated an open reading frame of 798 base pairs surrounded by 145 base pairs of 5′ noncoding sequence and 614 of 3′ noncoding sequence (Fig. 1 A). The 3′ noncoding region contains a polyadenylation signal, a mRNA instability motif as well as a poly(A) tail. Two consecutive ATGs, starting at nucleotides 146 and 149, were identified as initiation codons, fulfilling the consensus sequence for a translation initiation codon as defined by Kozak (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Two upstream in-frame stop codons were also identified. The open reading frame predicted a 266-amino acid protein with an approximately 26-kDa molecular mass and a isoelectric point of 9.67 determined by using the MacVector program (Eastman Kodak). The experimentally determined protein sequence began 32 residues downstream of the first identified methionine. Hydrophilicity analysis (31Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of the coding sequence revealed a hydrophobic region at the amino terminus, 31 amino acids upstream of the experimentally determined sequence, which likely functioned as signal peptide for protein secretion (Fig. 1 B). Several cysteine residues, clustered into two separate areas, were also identified in the amino acid sequence, consistent with the secreted nature of the protein. However, no similarity was detected with the epidermal growth factor-like family of growth factor or other known growth factors or secreted proteins. A potential site for N-linked glycosylation in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein was identified at position 256–258, suggesting posttranslational modification. Consistent with this possibility was the size of the isolated doublet, which was larger than the predicted molecular weight. The other clones (2.5 and 1.2 kb) contained the same coding sequence but differed in size from the 1.5-kb clone due to variations in their 3′-untranslated regions. The 2.5-kb clone also contained an unspliced intron. We performed Northern blot analysis to determine expression of Sk in different human tissues using the entire coding sequence as probe. In a panel of poly(A)+ mRNAs from fetal tissues, a strong 2-kb transcript was detected in kidney. A less intense band was present also in liver and brain but not in lung (Fig.2 A). In adult tissues, a similar size transcript was identified in placenta and prostate (Fig.2 B). Hybridization signals were also visible after longer exposure in colon and spleen. A lower level of expression of a higher molecular weight transcript was also detected both in embryonic and adult tissues. It is conceivable that these larger transcripts may represent signals from unprocessed mRNA. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that they may reflect cross-hybridization with transcripts of related proteins. A polyclonal antibody was generated against the full-length human Sk protein, produced as a GST fusion molecule in E. coli. Immunization was monitored by testing the capacity of antisera obtained from successive bleeds to recognize the GST fusion protein and the endogenous molecule in concentrated conditioned medium from SK-LMS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A,the antiserum specifically recognized a major species of approximately 35 kDa in conditioned medium of SK-LMS-1 cells. Moreover, the protein was also detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with the same antiserum (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the polyclonal antibody generated was capable of identifying the endogenous Sk protein in a native as well as denatured state. A less intense immunoreactive species migrating more slowly was detected under both conditions. In contrast, the same antiserum failed to detect a similar band in culture fluids of SK-OV-3 or PA-1 cells, which lacked any detectable Sk transcript (Fig. 3, B and C). To further confirm that the cDNA isolated encoded for the expected protein, we transfected 293 cells with the human Sk gene after removing its 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and subcloning in pCEV 29 vector (25Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was first performed in such cells to determine transfection efficiency. Fig.4 A shows that the levels of Sk transcripts in transfected 293 cells were much higher than present in SK-LMS-1 cells and appeared as two specific bands that migrated more slowly than the endogenous 2-kb transcript present in SK-LMS-1. To correlate RNA levels with protein expression, conditioned medium from transiently transfected cells was analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of Sk immunoreactive protein. As shown in Fig.4 B, immunoreactive bands in the conditioned medium of Sk transfected 293 cells showed similar sizes to two species identified in SK-LMS-1 medium, and were not present in mock transfectants. The stronger signal identified in 293 cells correlates well with the higher transcript levels shown by Northern analysis. Our findings that the doublet expressed in 293 cells was encoded by a single cDNA, strongly supported the possibility that post translational modification was responsible for these two immunoreactive species. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitrotranscription and translation analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 C,a single radiolabeled protein of approximately 35-kDa was observed in the absence of microsomal membranes. In their presence, an additional less intense band of slightly higher molecular weight became evident as well. These species resembled the appearance of the two immunoreactive bands in conditioned medium of SK-LMS-1 or 293 transfectants cells, consistent with the conclusion that Sk undergoes posttranslational modification. Because a potential site for N-linked glycosylation is present in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein we tested whether glycosylation was indeed responsible for the appearance of the doublet. Sk was immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium and subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation usingN-glycosidaseF, which releases all types of asparagine boundN-glycans, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This analysis (Fig. 4 D) revealed that after treatment, Sk appeared as a single major immunoreactive band of similar molecular weight to the lower species in the untreated control. These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation is responsible for the higher molecular weight species. Although our discovery of Sk was based on the co-elution with neuregulin during chromatographic purification, subsequent experiments with the recombinant protein, indicated that Sk was not a ligand for erbB molecules (data not shown), consistent with the absence of any similarity with epidermal growth factor-like proteins. Due to the novel features of the Sk protein, we continued to search the GenBankTM data base for related molecules in an effort to obtain insights into Sk biological function. In 1997, significant similarity was observed with a protein of unknown function identified in chicken (GenBankTM accession number 517093). A more recent report of a novel secreted protein from the Spemann organizer in amphibian embryos (22Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) was instrumental in identifying Sk function. Dickkopf-1 (dkk-1) was identified as a secreted protein that is required for head formation during Xenopous embryogenesis (22Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). By search of the expressed sequence tag-sequence data base, and a mouse cDNA library screening, it was further shown thatXenopous dkk-1 is a member of a new family of genes, composed of at least three members in humans, and present in different species (22Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-36"
https://openalex.org/W2095302288,"Several studies suggest, but do not prove directly, that muscarinic receptors may be able to form dimeric or oligomeric arrays. To address this issue in a more direct fashion, we designed a series of biochemical experiments using a modified version of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (referred to as m3′) as a model system. When membrane lysates prepared from m3′ receptor-expressing COS-7 cells were subjected to Western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions, several immunoreactive species were observed corresponding in size to putative receptor monomers, dimers, and oligomers. However, under reducing conditions, the monomeric receptor species represented the only detectable immunoreactive protein, consistent with the presence of disulfide-linked m3 receptor complexes. Similar results were obtained when native m3 muscarinic receptors present in rat brain membranes were analyzed. Control experiments carried out in the presence of high concentrations of the SH group alkylating agent,N-ethylmaleimide, suggested that disulfide bond formation did not occur artifactually during the preparation of cell lysates. The formation of m3′ receptor dimers/multimers was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation studies using differentially epitope-tagged m3′ receptor constructs. In addition, these studies showed that m3′ receptors were also able to form non-covalently associated receptor dimers and that m3′ receptor dimer formation was receptor subtype-specific. Immunological studies also demonstrated that m3′ receptor dimers/multimers were abundantly expressed on the cell surface. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that two conserved extracellular Cys residues (Cys-140 and Cys-220) play key roles in the formation of disulfide-linked m3′ receptor dimers. These results provide the first direct evidence for the existence of muscarinic receptor dimers and highlight the specificity and molecular diversity of G protein-coupled receptor dimerization/oligomerization.

These investigators also demonstrated that dimer formation occurred through non-covalent interactions and that receptor dimers were not formed artifactually during processing of samples for immunological studies. Moreover, dimer formation was shown to correlate well with the ability of the β2-adrenergic receptor to interact productively with G proteins (2Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P.

In addition, consistent with the notion that GPCR dimerization may be functionally relevant, a dimerization-defective mutant δ-opioid receptor lacked the ability to undergo agonist-dependent internalization (5Cvejic S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7361-7379Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggest that muscarinic receptors, like other GPCRs, may also be arranged in dimeric or oligomeric complexes. Potter et al. (11Potter L.T. Ballesteros L.A. Bichajian L.H. Ferrendelli C.A. Fisher A. Hanchett H.E. Zhang R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 211-221PubMed Google Scholar), for example, showed that the complex agonist binding properties of muscarinic receptors expressed in rabbit heart and rat brain stem were consistent with the presence of two agonist binding sites located on dimeric receptor molecules. Likewise, computer simulations of the binding properties of the agonist, [3H]oxotremorine-M, at m2 muscarinic receptors expressed in cultured cells or porcine atria were consistent with the existence of receptor dimers as well as monomers (12Hirschberg B.T. Schimerlik M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26127-26135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings were obtained in studies using purified muscarinic receptors (13Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that the complex binding properties of muscarinic agonists are due to different states of the receptor proteins themselves and are not caused by the association of receptors with different classes of G proteins. However, although the results of these studies are consistent with the presence of muscarinic receptor dimers (or multimers), they do not provide direct physical evidence that such receptor species actually exist. To examine potential intermolecular interactions between mutant muscarinic receptors, we previously generated two chimeric m3 muscarinic/α2-adrenergic receptors in which a region containing transmembrane domains (TM) VI and VII had been exchanged between the two wild-type receptors (15Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Whereas none of the two-hybrid receptors showed ligand binding activity when expressed alone, significant numbers of muscarinic and adrenergic binding sites were detected after coexpression of the two mutant receptors (15Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggested that the two chimeric proteins were able to interact functionally with each other, probably due to the ability of N- and C-terminal receptor regions (containing TM I-V and TM VI/VII, respectively) to adopt the proper transmembrane topology (16Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 17Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), even when present in the structural context of the mutant receptors. It remains unclear, however, whether such intermolecular interactions can also occur among wild-type muscarinic receptors. To demonstrate the existence of muscarinic receptor dimers or oligomers in a direct fashion, we used the rat m3 muscarinic receptor as a model system, employing a combined biochemical/molecular genetic approach. Initially, immunoblotting experiments were carried out under reducing and non-reducing conditions, using membrane lysates prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with a modified version of the m3 receptor (referred to as m3′; see Table I) as well as rat brain membranes expressing the native m3 muscarinic receptor. These studies strongly suggested that the m3 muscarinic receptor is capable of forming disulfide-linked dimers and oligomers. This finding was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments using two modified m3 receptor species that carried different epitope tags at their C termini. Moreover, additional experiments were carried out to investigate the receptor subtype specificity of m3 receptor dimerization and to verify that m3 receptor dimers preexisted in transfected cells prior to cell lysis.Table IStructure of mutant m3 muscarinic receptors investigated in this studyReceptorStructural modificationaSee Fig. 1 for further details.m3(wt)HA tagbThe HA epitope tag was introduced after the initiating methionine codon (see Fig. 1).m3′HA, tag, Δi3 (Ala-274 to Lys-469), N6Q/N15Q/N41Q/N48Q/N52Qm3′(6C → (A/S))C111S/C532A/C542A/C546S/C560S/C562S (remaining Cys residues: Cys-140, Cys-220, Cys-516, Cys-519)m′(4C → A)C140A/C220A/C516A/C519Am3′(C516A/C519A)C516A/C519Am3′(C140A/C220A)C140A/C220Am3′(C140A)C140Am3′(C220A)C220Am3′-V2The last 29 amino acids of the human V2 vasopressin receptor were attached to the C terminus of m3′m3′-RhThe last 9 amino acids of bovine rhodopsin were attached to the C terminus of m3′m3′(C140A/C220A)-V2The last 29 amino acids of the human V2 vasopressin receptor were attached to the C terminus of m3′(C140A/C220A)m3′(C140A/C220A)-RhThe last 9 amino acids of bovine rhodopsin were attached to the C terminus of m3′(C140A/C220A)a See Fig. 1 for further details.b The HA epitope tag was introduced after the initiating methionine codon (see Fig. 1). Open table in a new tab We also examined whether m3 receptor dimers were present on the cell surface or whether they were retained intracellularly. To address this question, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with a membrane-impermeable monoclonal antibody directed against an extracellular receptor epitope tag. Isolation and analysis of antibody-bound receptors via immunological techniques clearly demonstrated that m3 receptor dimers were abundantly expressed on the cell surface. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed to identify the Cys residue(s) involved in the formation of disulfide-linked m3 receptor dimers/oligomers. Mutant receptors were created in which specific Cys residues were replaced with either Ser or Ala and expressed in COS-7 cells. Subsequently, the expression pattern of the different mutant receptors was examined in immunoblotting studies under reducing and non-reducing conditions. These studies led to the identification of a conserved Cys pair (Cys-140/Cys-220) that is predicted to play a key role in in the formation of disulfide-linked m3′ receptor dimers. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, proteinase inhibitors, carbamoylcholine chloride (carbachol), acetylcholine chloride, and atropine sulfate were purchased from Sigma. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) was from Research Biochemicals Inc., andN-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS; 79 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. All enzymes used for molecular cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs. Other sources of reagents were 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm) were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. All other chemicals used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were purchased from Bio-Rad. All mutations were introduced into Rm3pcD-N-HA (also referred to as m3(wt); Table I), a mammalian expression plasmid coding for the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (19Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar) containing a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA; Ref. 20Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) after the initiating methionine codon (18Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The presence of the epitope tag had no significant effect on the ligand binding and G protein coupling properties of the wild-type m3 receptor (18Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by using standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis techniques (21Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar) or the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The five N-terminal Asn residues that are predicted to serve as targets for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-6, Asn-15, Asn-41, Asn-48, and Asn-52; Fig. 1) were simultaneously replaced, using a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure, with Gln residues. Moreover, the central portion (amino acids Ala-274 to Lys-469) of the third intracellular loop (i3) was deleted from the glycosylation-free mutant construct as described previously (22Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, the encoded receptor was referred to as m3′ (Table I). The construction and complete pharmacologic characterization of m3′-derived mutant receptors in which one or more Cys residues (shownboxed in Fig. 1) were replaced with Ala or Ser (Table I) will be described in detail elsewhere. 2F.-Y. Zeng, A. Soldner, and J. Wess, manuscript in preparation. The identity of all mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Two additional mutant m3′ receptors were created that contained different C-terminal epitope tags. In the m3′-Rh receptor, the last nine amino acids of bovine rhodopsin (TETSQVAPA) were added to the C terminus of m3′. The m3′-V2 receptor was modified in a similar fashion by addition of the last 29 amino acids of the human V2 vasopressin receptor (ARGRTPPSLGPQDESCTTASSSLAKDTSS). The m3′-Rh and m3′-V2 constructs were generated via a polymerase chain reaction strategy using the StuI and SacI restriction sites flanking the translation stop codon. In addition, the following wild-type receptor expression plasmids were used: human m1 muscarinic receptor in pcD (Hm1pcD; Ref. 19Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), human m2 muscarinic receptor in pcD (Hm2pcD; Ref. 19Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), and human V2 vasopressin receptor in pcD-PS (Ref. 23Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; note, however, that the construct used here lacked the HA epitope tag). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 24 h later, cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA/dish by using the LipofectAMINE™ Plus kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells to be used for radioligand binding studies were harvested about 70 h after transfections. Binding assays were carried out with membrane homogenates prepared from transfected cells essentially as described (24Dörje F. Wess J. Lambrecht G. Tacke R. Mutschler E. Brann M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 727-733PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out for 2–3 h at room temperature in a 0.25–0.5-ml volume. Binding buffer consisted of 25 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 5 mm MgCl2. Six to eight different concentrations (15–20,000 pm) of the radioligand, [3H]NMS, were used in saturation binding assays. For competition binding studies, seven different concentrations of the cold inhibitors, 4-DAMP, carbachol, and acetylcholine, were used. The [3H]NMS concentration used in these experiments was 200 pm, except for studies with the m3′(C140A/C220A) construct where an [3H]NMS concentration of 2 nm was employed. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm (m3′(C140A/C220A)) or 1 μm atropine (all other receptors). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve-fitting procedures, using the computer program LIGAND (saturation binding data; Ref. 25Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) or KALEIDAGRAPH (competition binding data; Synergy software), respectively. For PI assays, transfected COS-7 cells were transferred into 6-well plates (approximately 0.5 × 105 cells/well) about 24 h after transfections, and 3 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol was added to the growth medium. The next day (20–24 h later), the labeled cells were washed once with 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mmHEPES and then incubated for 20 min (at room temperature) with 1 ml of the same medium containing 10 mm LiCl. Cells were then incubated in the same medium with different concentrations of carbachol for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of the medium, reactions were terminated by addition of 0.75 ml of 20 mm formic acid, followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then neutralized with 0.25 ml of 60 mm ammonium hydroxide, and the inositol monophosphate fraction was isolated by anion exchange chromatography as described (26Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) and counted on a LKB liquid scintillation counter. Membranes were prepared from total rat brain as described previously (13Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting experiments, membranes were incubated with sample buffer (for composition, see below) at room temperature for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE. COS-7 cells were collected by centrifugation about 70 h after transfections. Cell pellets were incubated on ice for 20 min with 0.2% digitonin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). This step served to remove soluble as well as peripheral membrane proteins. Following centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were discarded, and cell pellets were treated with lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% digitonin, 0.5% deoxycholate, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (see above)) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell lysates were then centrifuged in a refrigerated Eppendorf 5417R microcentrifuge at maximal speed for 30 min. Supernatants containing solubilized receptors were used either directly for SDS-PAGE or stored at −80 °C. Membrane extracts prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with the m3′ receptor construct were subjected to affinity chromatography using 3-(2′-aminobenzylhydroxy)-tropane (ABT)-agarose (kindly provided by Dr. T. Haga, University of Tokyo, Japan), essentially as described by Haga and Haga (27Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7927-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, m3′ receptor-expressing COS-7 cells were first treated with 0.2% digitonin to remove peripheral membrane and soluble proteins, as described in the previous paragraph. Receptors were then solubilized in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 1% digitonin, 0.1% sodium cholate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Following centrifugation in a refrigerated Eppendorf 5417R microcentrifuge at maximal speed for 30 min, supernatants (100 μl, about 20 μg protein/μl) containing solubilized receptors were incubated with 20 μl of ABT-agarose gel suspension at 4 °C overnight (about 16 h). Nonspecifically bound proteins were washed out with 3 × 1 ml of buffer B (buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.1% digitonin). Specifically bound receptor proteins were eluted using 50 μl of buffer B containing 100 μm atropine. Eluted m3′ receptor proteins were subjected to Western blotting analysis using the anti-m3 antibody (see next paragraph). A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (Fig. 1). This antibody (referred to as anti-m3) was purified by affinity chromatography on a peptide column according to standard procedures and specifically recognized the m3 muscarinic receptor protein. 3F.-Y. Zeng and J. Wess, unpublished data. An affinity purified anti-V2 polyclonal antibody (raised in rabbits against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 29 amino acids of the human V2 vasopressin receptor) was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Goldsmith (National Institutes of Health). m1 and m2 muscarinic receptor-specific rabbit antisera were raised against i3 loop-glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins essentially as described by Levey et al. (28Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These antisera were used directly for Western blotting experiments. The 1D4 mouse monoclonal antibody (referred to as anti-Rh throughout this study) that specifically recognizes the C-terminal segment of bovine rhodopsin (29Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. Kevin Ridge (Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology). The 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody that specifically detects the HA epitope tag was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For immunoprecipitation studies, the anti-HA, anti-Rh, and anti-V2 antibodies were covalently conjugated to Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Membrane extracts prepared from transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with Sepharose 4B-conjugated antibodies under gentle rotating at 4 °C for at least 2 h. Incubations were carried out in PBS containing 0.5% digitonin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and proteinase inhibitors (see above). Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% digitonin, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer (see below), and directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. To eliminate non-covalent interactions among receptors, membrane extracts prepared from cells cotransfected with m3′ receptors containing different epitope tags were incubated with 1.5% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the SDS concentration was reduced to 0.1% by dilution of samples with PBS containing 0.5% BSA. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated sample buffer (composition: 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol (only if indicated), 4% SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, proteins were resolved on 8 or 12% (w/v) acrylamide slab gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm) as described (31Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5916) Google Scholar). In brief, membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS and incubated with primary antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% BSA (PBS-T/BSA). Bound antibody was then probed with a secondary antibody (1:3,000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS-T/BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing of blots with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with the m3′ receptor construct as described above. About 70 h after transfections, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with 3 ml of PBS containing 20 μg/ml of the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody and 0.5% BSA to label cell-surface m3′ receptors. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS and transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Cells were then treated with 100 μl of lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% digitonin, 0.5% deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors) at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation in a refrigerated Eppendorf 5417R microcentrifuge (maximal speed, 30 min), 10 μl of supernatant was subjected directly to non-reducing SDS-PAGE to examine total solubilized receptors. The remaining extract (90 μl) was incubated with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (15 μl) at 4 °C for 1 h to immunoprecipitate antibody-bound surface receptors. Supernatants containing receptors that did not bind anti-HA antibody were subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE (15 μl/well) to examine the expression of intracellular receptors. Immunoprecipitates (containing cell surface receptors) were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% digitonin, eluted with 30 μl of sample buffer (see above), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10 μl/well). After electrophoresis, receptor proteins were detected via Western blotting analysis using the anti-m3 antibody as described above. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a modified version of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (referred to as m3′). The m3′ receptor contained an N-terminal HA epitope tag and lacked all five potential N-glycosylation sites present in the N-terminal portion of the m3 receptor protein (N6Q, N15Q, N41Q, N48Q, and N52Q) as well as the central portion of the i3 loop (ΔAla-274 to Lys-469) (Fig. 1 and TableI).

Of these, the earliest factor expressed in the lens was c-Maf. The expression of c-Maf was most prominent in lens fiber cells and persisted throughout lens development. To examine the functional contribution of c-Maf to lens development, we isolated genomic clones encompassing the murine c-maf gene and carried out its targeted disruption. Insertion of the β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene into the c-maf locus allowed visualization of c-Maf accumulation in heterozygous mutant mice by staining for LacZ activity. Homozygous mutant embryos and newborns lacked normal lenses. Histological examination of these mice revealed defective differentiation of lens fiber cells. The expression of crystallin genes was severely impaired in the c-maf-null mutant mouse lens.

Subsequently at e10.5, the lens pit forms a lens vesicle, where embryonic ectodermal cells differentiate into primary lens fiber cells. By e13.0, the primary posterior lens fiber cells grow into the lumen to eventually fill the lens vesicle. The anterior cells of the vesicle become epithelial cells and constitute the lens germinal epithelium; secondary fiber cells then differentiate from the epithelial cells after this stage. This arrangement persists throughout the lifetime of the animal, as new lens fibers are continuously regenerated (3Piatigorsky J. Differentiation. 1981; 19: 134-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Differentiation of the lens involves biosynthesis of a group of fibrous lens-specific proteins called crystallins, which constitute 80–90% of the soluble protein of the lens (4Yasuda K. Okada T.S.

Development. 1991; 113: 539-550PubMed Google Scholar,12Matsuo I. Yasuda K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3701-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses of the core region of this enhancer revealed key interacting transcription factors (13Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14Murata T. Nitta M. Yasuda K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Of the ciselements identified in the enhancer, the αCE2 sequence, which shares high similarity with the Maf responsiveelement (MARE1(15Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), is crucial for its transcriptional activity. MARE-related consensus sequences have also been found in the regulatory regions of other lens-specific genes (12Matsuo I. Yasuda K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3701-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently a new transcription factor, L-Maf, which can interact with the αCE2 enhancer element, was isolated from chicken lens (13Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). L-Maf is a member of the large Maf oncoprotein/transcription factor family (16Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T.

The Maf family factors contain a basic leucine zipper domain and bind to MARE either as homodimers or as heterodimers with other basic leucine zipper transcription factors (19Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). L-Maf regulates the expression of multiple lens-specific genes, and its forced expression can convert primary chick embryonic neural retina cells in culture to a lens fiber cell fate, indicating that vertebrate lens induction and differentiation can be triggered by the ectopic expression of L-Maf (13Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Transcripts encoding other members of the Maf family in lens tissues have been identified (Ref.20Liu Q. Ji X. Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sakai M. Imaki J. Yoshida K. Ogata A. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kuboki Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S.

Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar), whereas c-Maf and MafB mRNAs were found in both embryonic and adult rat lens (21Sakai M. Imaki J. Yoshida K. Ogata A. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kuboki Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Yoshida K. Imaki J. Koyama Y. Harada T. Shinmei Y. Oishi C. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Matsuda A. Nishi S. Matsuda H. Sakai M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 2679-2683PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that each of these individual large Maf proteins might play distinct roles during lens development. Thus the vertebrate lens could provide an excellent model system for dissecting both the individual as well as complementary functional roles of large Maf family transcription factors. To elucidate the functional contributions of Maf family factors to lens development, we set out to identify the large Maf factors specifically expressed in the mouse lens. We found that three large Maf family proteins, c-Maf, MafB, and Nrl, are expressed in the embryonic and adult mouse lens. We therefore documented the expression profile of c-Maf and MafB mRNAs and also performed targeted disruption of thec-maf gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells to generatec-maf germ line mutant mice. Targeted mutation of thec-maf gene results in perinatal lethality in homozygous mutant animals, permitting us to examine the earliest stages of lens development in the embryo. These results demonstrate that c-Maf is essential for normal lens development and that its function cannot be complemented by other large Maf proteins. Total RNAs were prepared from the lenses of e12.5- e18.5 embryos and adult mice. Degenerate sense (5′-GAGGGATCCATGGA(A/G)TA(C/T)GTIAA(C/T)GA(C/T)TT(C/T)GA) and antisense (5′-GAGGAATTCGC(A/G)TAICCIC(G/T)(A/G)TT(C/T)TT) oligonucleotide primers containing engineered BamHI and EcoRI recognition sites (underlined), respectively, were synthesized. These primers correspond to peptide sequences MEYVNDFD and KNRGYA, respectively, which are conserved between c-Maf, MafB, Nrl, and L-Maf. Coupled reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed under the following conditions: annealing temperature of 50 °C and elongation temperature of 72 °C for 45 cycles. For whole mount in situhybridization analysis, e9.5-e11.5 embryos were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 2 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The embryos were then treated with proteinase K for at least 10 min (depending on the embryo stage). After postfixation, the embryos were prehybridized and then hybridized with RNA probes (23Herique D. Adam J. Myat A. Chitnis A. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Nature. 1995; 375: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The embryos were subsequently incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization signals were visualized using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as chromogen. For cellular resolution in situ analysis, e9.5-e11.5 embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Embryonic lens tissue was cut into 16–20-μm frozen sections.In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (24Osumi-Yamashita N. Kuratani S. Ninomiya Y. Aoki K. Iseki S. Chareonvit S. Doi H. Fujiwara M. Watanabe T. Eto K. Dev. Growth. Differ. 1997; 39: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the sections were processed for immunocytochemistry with anti-digoxigenin antibody, as described above. To generate RNA probes for in situ hybridization of whole mount and sectioned embryos, two ORF regions (−5 to 402 and 753 to 1127) of the c-maf gene were subcloned, and sense and antisense probes were synthesized using the T3 and T7 RNA polymerases with (digoxigenin)-UTP labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from P19 embryonic carcinoma cells following standard procedures (25Yamamoto M. Koyata H. Matsui C. Hiraga K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3317-3322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoretically separated, and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The genomic fragment corresponding to −5 to 402 of c-Maf was used as probe. An adapter oligomer-ligated cDNA library was constructed using poly(A)+ RNA from e12.5 embryos and Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Antisense primers complementary to the 5′-untranslated region were synthesized. Primer 1 (5′-TCCGCTGCGCGCTTTGCATAAGG-3′) and primer 2 (5′-CCGTGCAAAGTGCAAGACCGAGGTGC-3′) correspond to −433/−507 and −700/−725 with respect to the mRNA initiation site, respectively. Primer 2 was used in nested PCR. The resultant PCR fragments were subcloned into TA vector (Promega) and sequenced. c-maf genomic clones were isolated from a 129/SVJ genomic library (Stratagene) using a partial mouse c-Maf cDNA as probe. To construct the gene-targeting vector, both the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) and lacZ genes were inserted into thec-maf ORF region between the MscI andXhoI sites. The diphtheria toxin A (DT-A) gene (provided by Dr. M. Taketo, University of Tokyo) was inserted at the end of the 3′ short arm of the targeting vector for negative selection. Targeted ES cells were identified by PCR screening, as described previously (26Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 277-290Google Scholar). Independent clones, which had undergone homologous recombination at the c-maf locus, were isolated, and their genotypes were verified by Southern blot hybridization analyses using neo andc-maf probes. These clones were then injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Offspring were genotyped by PCR and Southern blotting. To distinguish between the wild type and gene-targetedc-maf alleles by PCR, c-maf sense (W5′: 5′-CTGCCGCTTCAAGACCCTCGACT-3′) and neo sense (N5′: 5′-CAGTCATAGCCGAATAGCCTCTCCACCCAA-3′) primers were used with a singlec-maf antisense primer (W3′: 5′-GGTCCCAGTCCCTCTATCTGTGCTCCTTCC-3′). The PCR profile used was 98 °C, 20 s and 68 °C, 5 min for 32 cycles in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2. Southern blot analysis was performed using genomic DNA digested with EcoRI andNcoI-XhoI restriction endonucleases. To detect the wild type and mutant alleles, the c-maf ORF region (c-Maf probe; for detecting the 1.0 kilobase pair band) and aneo gene fragment (neo probe; for 14.5 kilobase pairs) were used, respectively. For LacZ staining, cryo sections were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Embryos were fixed in ice-cold 10% neutral formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h, dehydrated with ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a 3-μm thickness. The sections were dewaxed and incubated for 20 min with anti-αA-, αB-, β-, and γ-crystallin monoclonal antibodies (27Sawada K. Agata K. Yoshiki A. Eguchi G. Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 37: 355-368PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were then incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and avidin-alkaline phosphatase. The heads of e16.5 embryos were dissected, and total RNA was extracted individually. After genotyping, 1 μg of the total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Super Script IITM reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer primers. Primer sets and PCR conditions were as described previously (28Nishiguchi S. Wood H. Kondoh H. Lovell-Badge R. Episkopou V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To identify the large Maf family members that are expressed in the mouse lens, we performed RT-PCR display analysis using degenerate oligonucleotides encoding amino acid sequences that were conserved among the large Maf factors. From both embryonic and adult lens cells, seven PCR products were observed (data not shown). All seven PCR bands were subcloned, and their sequences were determined by examining at least five independent clones corresponding to each band. From the sequence analysis, three of the bands were amplified from c-Maf cDNA, and interestingly, all three c-Maf amplicons were substantially smaller than predicted. We found that each of them was deleted in some portion of a GC-rich sequence present in the c-Maf coding sequence. We presume that this heterogeneity might be the result of an RT or PCR artifact because of deletions caused by formation of hairpin loops in this GC-rich sequence. Of the four remaining PCR bands, two were shown to encode MafB and Nrl. Although one of the remaining distinct bands was approximately the expected size for L-Maf, sequence analysis revealed that this band did not contain L-Maf or indeed any Maf-related product (15 independent clones were analyzed). Similarly, the sole remaining band also appeared to be an artifact unrelated to Maf sequence. Thus we were unable to isolate the mouse homologue of chicken L-Maf from lens RNA in this analysis. To determine the temporal and spatial expression profiles of the three large Maf factors we detected in the lens, we performed in situ hybridization analyses on both whole mount and thin-sectioned e9.0 to e14.5 mouse embryos. Two independent RNA probes were prepared from the 5′ and 3′ end regions of the c-Maf cDNA. From whole-mount in situ analysis, we found that c-Maf mRNA was expressed in the midline of the forebrain (Fig.1 A) and in the eye region (Fig. 1 B) of e9.0 embryos. In e10.0 to e10.5 embryos, c-Maf expression in the developing lens progressively intensified, whereas expression from the midline diminished with age. Embryos were also hybridized with sense probes, but we did not detect any substantial signals (data not shown). We performed this whole mount in situ analysis 4 times, and a total of 35 embryos were hybridized with the antisense probes, and 10 embryos were hybridized with the sense probes. The results were quite reproducible. In the thin section in situ analysis, c-Maf mRNAs were localized to the head ectoderm destined to become the lens vesicle in e10.0 embryos (Fig. 2 A). It is of interest to note that c-Maf mRNA was already present in the head ectoderm of e9.0 embryos, before the overlying ectoderm began to invaginate, and was also detected in the lens placode. By e10.5, the lens placode, which now strongly expressed c-Maf, had folded inward to form the vesicle (Fig. 2 B). At e11.5, c-Maf continued to be abundantly expressed in the lens. The expression was much stronger in the primary fiber cells (Fig. 2, C (arrow) andD, shows a sense probe control) than in epithelial cells and was also prominent in the neural tube (Fig. 2, E(arrowheads) and F, shows a sense probe control). The expression of MafB and Nrl was also examined by in situanalyses. MafB mRNA was found in lens epithelial cells in e10.5 to e14.5 embryos but not in the lens fiber cells (Fig. 2, G andH, and data not shown). On the other hand we found that Nrl mRNA was not expressed during the early stages of the lens development (Ref. 20Liu Q. Ji X. Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). In summary, these data show that c-Maf and MafB are expressed in the developing lens with distinct distribution profiles, suggesting that they may play important but distinct roles in lens differentiation. To enable the analysis of c-maf mutant mice, we screened a 129/SVJ mouse genomic DNA library using a mouse c-Maf cDNA probe. Of 16 clones recovered, 6 were found to encode the entire ORF of thec-maf gene. Restriction enzyme site mapping and sequence analysis indicated that the c-maf ORF is uninterrupted by introns (Fig. 3 A). To determine the transcription start site, we performed 5′-RACE analysis using e12.5 mouse embryonic RNA. Two cDNA species were recovered; one category of RACE clones was 144 base pairs longer than the second and extended the 5′ end of the known cDNA sequence (marked by an asterisk) by 15 base pairs (Fig.3 B). We therefore designated this site as the transcription initiation site. When compared with the genomic sequence, these RACE clones showed no evidence for a distinct first exon, again suggesting that the c-maf gene is composed of but a single exon. A MARE motif was identified at −47 to −38, immediately 3′ to the putative TATA box, in the proximal promoter region. We also performed Southern blot analysis on high molecular weight DNA, and restriction enzyme mapping showed only the expected genomic fragment sizes, suggesting that the uninterrupted locus we had cloned was not a pseudogene and that c-maf exists as a single copy gene in the mouse genome (data not shown). To disrupt c-mafin ES cells, a targeting construct was prepared to replace virtually the entire gene ORF with the lacZ and neo genes (Fig. 3 C). ES cells were electroporated with the targeting construct, and neomycin-resistant cells were selected in G418-containing medium. Of 360 G418-resistant clones screened, 11 clones had undergone homologous recombination at the c-maflocus. Five independent clones were injected into blastocysts, and male chimeras were generated that transmitted the c-maf mutation to their offspring. Genotyping of progeny was performed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization. Both methods clearly identified homologous recombinants in the c-maf locus (Fig. 3, D andE). Staged embryos and adult tissues from c-mafheterozygous mutant mice were stained for LacZ activity. LacZ expression was strongly detected in the lens, kidney, and brain (data not shown). In the developing lens, LacZ expression was first detected in the lens primordium of head ectoderm at e9.5 and was restricted to the lens vesicle by e10.5 (Fig. 4,A and B), which was in good agreement with thein situ hybridization results. By e12.5, LacZ expression was confined to the primary lens fiber cell (Fig. 4 C). Signal was also detected in optic nerve (Fig.4 C). LacZ expression was also extensive in the lens fiber cells of e14.5 embryos (Fig. 4 D). Importantly, the reporter gene was expressed exclusively in lens fiber cells, but not lens epithelial cells, in the adult (Fig. 4, E and F). Under higher magnification, LacZ staining in the adult lens was exclusive to secondary lens fiber cells (Fig. 4 F). These data correlate well with the results from the in situanalysis (above). The data suggested that c-Maf may play an important role in lens fiber cell development. c-maf heterozygous mutant mice, derived from two different ES cell clones and maintained in either C57BL/6J × 129/SV or ICR × 129/SV hybrid genetic backgrounds, were intercrossed. 106 embryos, newborns, and one-month-old mice were collected from 17 litters (Table I). Five c-mafhomozygous null mutant newborns were recovered. Although this was lower than the expected Mendelian ratio, it indicated that c-mafhomozygous mutants could complete gestation. However, no homozygous mutant mice were found among the 1-month postnatal group, indicating that the lack of c-maf resulted in complete postnatal lethality. The etiology of this peri- and postnatal lethality remains to be elucidated.Table IProgeny recovered from heterozygous c-maf mutant intercrossesStageLittersGenotypesTotal+/++/−−/−e12.523 (23%)8 (62%)2 (15%)13e16.524 (27%)7 (46%)4 (27%)15Newborn919 (38%)26 (52%)5 (10%)501 month412 (43%)16 (57%)0 (0%)28The c-maf mating are for two different ES clones, all bred into either the C57BL/6J or ICR background.

Open table in a new tab The c-maf mating are for two different ES clones, all bred into either the C57BL/6J or ICR background. Their embryos, newborns, and one-month-old mice were genotyped by the same PCR method as the ES cell line analysis. Examination of c-maf homozygous mutant newborn mice revealed that they lacked normal lens structures (Fig.5 A; B is a wild type control). From microscopic histological examination, we failed to detect normal elongation of the lens fiber cells in thec-maf (−/−) lens (Fig. 5 C), which were properly formed in wild type littermates (Fig. 5 D). To better define the time lens malformation in c-maf mutant animals was first apparent, we examined e11.5 and e16.5 embryos. The lens structure in e16.5 wild type embryos was visible after formaldehyde fixation, but in c-maf (−/−) embryos, no normal lens structure was evident (Fig. 5 E; Fshows a wild type littermate), and there was no elongation of lens fiber cells (Fig. 5 G, H shows wild type). However, in e11.5 embryos, the lens vesicle was beginning to form, indicating that lens development seems to progress normally despite the absence of the c-Maf protein (data not shown). In other eye structures, the retinal layer or pigment epithelium may be affected to some extent, but further analysis will be necessary to determine whether this is caused directly by c-Maf deficiency or as a secondary consequence of impaired lens formation (Fig. 5 G). One plausible explanation for the lens malformation inc-maf knockout mice is that c-Maf is necessary for the expression of crystallin genes during lens fiber cell development. To address this question, we examined the expression of crystallin genes using anti-mouse αA-, αB-, β-, and γ-crystallin monoclonal antibodies (27Sawada K. Agata K. Yoshiki A. Eguchi G. Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 37: 355-368PubMed Google Scholar). In the lens of c-maf mutant heterozygous newborns, these antibodies clearly detected the respective crystallins; the signals were specifically restricted to lens (Fig.6). In contrast, the anti-crystallin antibody staining was markedly reduced in the lens of c-Maf-null newborns. In the c-Maf-null newborns, there was a layer of primary lens fiber cells despite the absence of a typical lens structure. An important finding here is that the primary lens fiber cells were immunoreactive to the anti-αB- and β-crystallin antibodies (Fig. 6,B and C, arrows). Also, when higher concentration of anti-αA-crystallin antibody was employed, positive signals were detected (data not shown). Thus, although the α- and β-crystallin genes are under the positive regulation of c-Maf, they can be weakly transcribed without c-Maf. However, the expression of γ-crystallin, known to be specifically expressed in lens fiber cells, was not detected in the c-Maf-null mouse lens, even at the highest concentrations of antibody used (Fig. 6 D). Thus γ-crystallin gene transcription is under strict c-Maf regulatory control. Enucleated anti-crystallin immunoreactive cells were also found in the lens cavity of c-Maf-deficient newborns. These cells are strongly immunoreactive with the αB-crystallin antibody (arrowheadsin Fig. 6 B) and may represent primary lens fiber cells whose maturation was arrested by the c-Maf deficiency. To detect crystallin expression more sensitively, we also performed RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the heads of e16.5 embryos, and mRNA for each class of crystallin was amplified using specific PCR primer pairs (28Nishiguchi S. Wood H. Kondoh H. Lovell-Badge R. Episkopou V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of all crystallin genes was significantly reduced, and in particular, the expression of γ-crystallin mRNA apparently disappeared (Fig.7). In summary, these results thus demonstrate that c-Maf positively regulates the expression of crystallin genes during lens fiber cell differentiation. From the RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and LacZ staining analyses, we showed here that the c-Maf transcription factor is expressed specifically in lens fiber cells during embryonic lens development. This expression persists throughout gestation and continues into adulthood. Targeted disruption of c-mafresulted in a specific block in lens fiber cell differentiation, consequently leaving the lens cavity empty. These results demonstrate that c-Maf is required for proper lens development. In contrast to the c-maf-deficient mice, the Elo(eye lens obsolescence) mutant mouse suffers from inviability of central lens fiber cells. The affected and malformed central fiber cells necrosed and completely collapsed, leaving the lens vesicle partially open (29Oda S. Watanabe K. Fujisawa H. Kameyama Y. Exp. Eye Res. 1980; 31: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the Elo mutant mouse, there is a frameshift mutation in one of the crystallin genes, γE-crystallin (30Cartier M. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a MARE motif that is similar to the αCE2 element has also been found in the lens-specific regulatory region of each γ-crystallin gene (12Matsuo I. Yasuda K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3701-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Nishiguchi S. Wood H. Kondoh H. Lovell-Badge R. Episkopou V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), suggesting that γ-crystallin genes are the target genes of c-Maf. However, lens fiber cell differentiation in the c-maf-deficient mouse is arrested before central fiber cells are formed, thus precluding the possible observation of anElo phenotype in the c-maf mutants. The expression of γ-crystallins could not be detected by immunohistochemistry or by RT-PCR in c-Maf-deficient newborns or e16.5 mutant embryos, respectively, further supporting the notion that c-Maf is an important transcriptional regulator of the γ-crystallin genes. In addition, the expression of αA-, αB-, and β-crystallins were found to be down-regulated in the c-Maf-deficient mice. Similar observations were reported recently in the targeted disruptionsox-1 mutation (28Nishiguchi S. Wood H. Kondoh H. Lovell-Badge R. Episkopou V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although Sox-1 is indispensable for mouse lens fiber cell differentiation, crystallins are expressed in thesox-1 (−/−) lens. Careful comparison of thec-maf- and sox-1-deficient mouse lenses revealed that the c-maf deficit results in a more profound defect in crystallin gene expression than does the sox-1 deficiency. In addition, αA-and αB-crystallin gene-targeted mutations do not lead to a severe defect in lens formation (6Graw J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1331-1348PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raise the question as to whether the decrease or absence of crystallin gene expression is the main cause of lens malformation in the c-Maf-deficient mouse. From the analysis of crystallin gene expression presented here, it is probable that other lens-specific genes that are also under the regulatory influence of c-Maf and the consequent lack of this gene product(s) may be responsible for the differentiation block in lens fiber cells in c-Maf-deficient mice. Two other large Maf family factors, MafB and Nrl, are also expressed in the mouse lens (Ref. 20Liu Q. Ji X. Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar and this study), therefore prompting the question as to how Maf family transcription factors individually or cooperatively execute their roles during vertebrate lens formation. An important finding here is that MafB mRNA is expressed exclusively in lens epithelial cells, whereas Nrl is expressed widely in the lens but at a much later stage of lens development than c-Maf and MafB. Compared with the other two large Maf proteins, c-Maf is unique in that its expression is restricted to lens fiber cells after the formation of the lens structure. The complementary distribution of c-Maf and MafB in the lens fiber and epithelial cells, respectively, is intriguing and suggests that each large Maf factor has a unique role in vertebrate lens development. A natural MafB mouse mutant, kreisler (kr), has previously been described that lacks normal rhombomere formation and inner ear structure (31Cordes S.P. Barsh G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, no phenotype has been reported in the eyes or lens of the kr mouse. It was shown recently that thekr mutant mouse is not a MafB-null mutant, as MafB activity persists in many functional aspects (32Eichmann A. Grapin-Botton A. Kelly L. Graf T. Le Douarin N.M. Sieweke M. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of MafB in the differentiation and function of lens epithelial cells remains to be clarified. Another large Maf factor, L-Maf, was isolated from the chicken and was shown to be a key regulator of αA-crystallin gene transcription in the lens (13Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because MARE motifs are found in the regulatory regions of many lens-specific genes, Maf family transcription factor are probably required for multiple aspects of normal lens development. In the chicken, L-Maf appears to be the prime target of a lens induction signal emanating from the optic vesicle (13Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect a murine homologue of L-Maf in our experiments, the existence of four distinct large Maf factors has already been demonstrated inXenopus. 3K. Yasuda, unpublished observation. Therefore the existence of a murine L-Maf gene is plausible. The differential functional contributions of c-Maf, L-Maf, and other large Maf transcription factors to vertebrate lens formation are yet to be fully elucidated. We would like to thank Drs. K.

https://openalex.org/W2072608022,"Fatty acid β-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. Long chain fatty acids are also metabolized by the cytochrome P450 CYP4A ω-oxidation enzymes to toxic dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) that serve as substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation. Synthetic peroxisome proliferators interact with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) to transcriptionally activate genes that participate in peroxisomal, microsomal, and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Mice lacking PPARα (PPARα<sup>−/−</sup>) fail to respond to the inductive effects of peroxisome proliferators, whereas those lacking fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX<sup>−/−</sup>), the first enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation system, exhibit extensive microvesicular steatohepatitis, leading to hepatocellular regeneration and massive peroxisome proliferation, implying sustained activation of PPARα by natural ligands. We now report that mice nullizygous for both PPARα and AOX (PPARα<sup>−/−</sup> AOX<sup>−/−</sup>) failed to exhibit spontaneous peroxisome proliferation and induction of PPARα-regulated genes by biological ligands unmetabolized in the absence of AOX. In AOX<sup>−/−</sup> mice, the hyperactivity of PPARα enhances the severity of steatosis by inducing CYP4A family proteins that generate DCAs and since they are not metabolized in the absence of peroxisomal β-oxidation, they damage mitochondria leading to steatosis. Blunting of microvesicular steatosis, which is restricted to few liver cells in periportal regions in PPARα<sup>−/−</sup>AOX<sup>−/−</sup> mice, suggests a role for PPARα-induced genes, especially members of CYP4A family, in determining the severity of steatosis in livers with defective peroxisomal β-oxidation. In age-matched PPARα<sup>−/−</sup> mice, a decrease in constitutive mitochondrial β-oxidation with intact constitutive peroxisomal β-oxidation system contributes to large droplet fatty change that is restricted to centrilobular hepatocytes. These data define a critical role for both PPARα and AOX in hepatic lipid metabolism and in the pathogenesis of specific fatty liver phenotype."

Among the few alternative drugs available, artemisinin, an endoperoxide antimalarial drug, derived from an ancient Chinese herbal remedy, Qinghaosu, is the most promising (2Klayman D.L. Science. 1985; 228: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar, 3Hien T.T. White N.J. Lancet. 1993; 341: 603-608Abstract PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).

Srivastava V.K. Ind. J. Med. Res. 1996; 104: 284-287PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of action of these drugs. A two-step mechanism proposed recently by Meshnick et al.(5Meshnick S.R. Taylor T.E. Kamchonwongpaisan P. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 301-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests the heme-catalyzed cleavage of the endoperoxide bridge forms a free radical followed by specific and selective alkylation of some malarial proteins (6Yang Y.Z. Asawamahasakda W. Meshnick S.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, this does not explain the selective cytotoxic action of artemisinin on mature parasite stages (late stage trophozoites and schizonts) (7Geary T.G. Divo A.A. Jensen J.B. Am. J. Trop. Med.

The polymerized heme commonly referred to as “hemozoin” or “malaria pigment” accumulates in the form of a crystalline, insoluble, black-brown pigment (21Fitch C.D. Kanjananggulpan P. J. Biol.

The heme polymerization pathway is specific to the malarial parasite and offers a potential biochemical target for the design of antimalarials (25Pandey A.V. Chauhan V.S. Curr. Sci. 1998; 75: 911-918Google Scholar). An enzyme “heme polymerase” was initially described, which could promote hemozoin formation (26Slater A.F.G. Cerami A.

Recent studies have shown that artemisinin taken up by the malarial parasite growingin vitro was selectively concentrated in the parasite food vacuole and was associated with hemozoin (38Hong Y.L. Yang Y.Z. Meshnick S.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Artemisinin also interacts with heme, forming covalent adducts (38Hong Y.L. Yang Y.Z.

In this report, we describe the inhibition of hemoglobin breakdown and heme polymerization by artemisinin and one of its analogues α-/β-arteether. Our studies provide evidence that the antimalarial effect of artemisinin may at least partly be due to inhibition of malarial hemoglobin degradation pathway and heme detoxification system. [14C]Leucine was a kind gift from Prof. O. P. Shukla (Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India). Peptide substrate Z1-FR-AMC was purchased from Bachem. Artemisinin and α-/β-arteether were kindly provided by Dr. S. K. Puri. Bovine serum albumin standard solution was from Pierce, and Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden). Hemin, SDS, dithiothreitol, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, E-64, pepstatin A, LB media, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Male Swiss albino mice (obtained from the Division of Laboratory Animals, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India) weighing 15–20 g were infected with Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis by intraperitoneal passage of 1 × 107 infected erythrocytes. Parasitemia was monitored by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. Blood was collected at high levels of parasitemia (>60%) in sterile acid/citrate/dextrose. Animals were housed in the animal house at the Institute, and care was provided as per the guidelines laid down by ethics committee. Swiss albino mice were injected with phenylhydrazine (40 mg/kg body weight) to induce reticulocytes. Blood was collected 3 days post-phenylhydrazine injection. 50 μCi of [14C]leucine was added to this and incubated at 37 °C for 10 h in a conical flask rotating at 60 rpm. Erythrocytes were pelleted by centrifugation; leukocytes were removed, and hemoglobin was purified as described previously (12Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Blood from 30 mice infected with P. yoelii was pooled and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The plasma and buffy coat were removed, and the erythrocyte pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and passed through a CF-11 column to remove leukocytes. Food vacuole preparation was done as described previously (12Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Purified vacuoles were resuspended in acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 100 mm) and homogenized by a Polytron homogenizer at 6000 rpm. This vacuole extract was used for the protease assay. Proteolytic activity was measured using 14C-labeled bovine hemoglobin as a substrate. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 1.0 ml containing 50 μl of vacuolar lysate, 100 μg of hemoglobin, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of chilled 15% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-soluble fractions was monitored as a measure of proteolytic activity. Fluorimetric assay of cysteine protease was performed on an LS 50B spectrofluorimeter from Perkin-Elmer using Z-Phe-Arg-AMC as substrate as described previously (14Salas F. Fichmann J. Lee G.K. Scott M.D. Rosenthal P.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2120-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence of aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) released by proteolysis was used to monitor the activity. All assays using peptide substrates were performed at 25 °C in a continuous manner for 3 min total time. Artemisinin was incubated with hemoglobin to study the drug substrate interaction. Hemoglobin was extensively dialyzed after artemisinin exposure and checked by electrophoresis. The drug was incubated with infected erythrocytes for 0–6 h at 37 °C. After the incubation erythrocytes were washed with PBS, and parasites were collected by saponin lysis. Parasites were lysed by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 3 min and kept at −20 °C until further use. Electrophoresis was carried out according to standard protocols. Gels contained 15% acrylamide and were stained with Coomassie Blue for protein visualization. Bovine hemoglobin was used as a control. Hemozoin was purified from the erythrocytes of the mice infected with P. yoelii according to the method described earlier (24Pandey A.V. Tekwani B.L. Pandey V.C. Biomed. Res. 1995; 16: 115-120Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmid containing the gene encoding P. falciparumHRP II (PfHRP II) in a pET 3d vector (Novagen) was a kind gift from Dr. D. E. Goldberg (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3).E. coli cells containing the plasmid were grown at 37 °C until A 600 reached between 0.4 and 0.6 and were cooled to 30 °C, and PfHRP II expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Cells were allowed to grow for 8 h with shaking at 30 °C. Purification of PfHRP II was performed by metal chelate chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose followed by HPLC (Waters) on a reverse phase C18 μBondapak column. Heme polymerization activity was assayed using P. yoelii lysates or PfHRP II (40Sullivan D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 41Pandey A.V. Singh N. Tekwani B.L. Puri S.K. Chauhan V.S. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 20: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For preparing parasite lysate, plasma and buffy coat were removed from the infected blood, and the erythrocyte pellet was washed once with PBS and suspended in 4 volumes of PBS containing glucose (0.9% w/v). The lysate was prepared by freezing the suspension in liquid nitrogen. Frozen droplets of the lysate were stored in aliquots at −70 °C until further use. When required, an aliquot of the lysate was thawed and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 5.0) by brief sonication and used for heme polymerization assay. The assay mixture contained 50 μl of the parasite extract, 100 μm hemin as the substrate and acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 5.0) in a total volume of 1.0 ml. Two controls, one lacking the substrate and the other lacking the parasite extract, but containing only 100 μm hemin in the acetate buffer, were run simultaneously. Each assay was set up in triplicate and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (16 h for assays using PfHRP II) in a constantly shaking water bath. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and pellets were resuspended in Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing 2.5% SDS. The pellets were washed twice with same buffer and once with sodium bicarbonate buffer (100 mm, pH 9.0). The final pellet thus obtained was of polymerized heme (hemozoin). For quantitation of the hemozoin, the pellets were solubilized in 50 μl of 2 n NaOH, and spectra were recorded, using 2.5% SDS as solvent and blank, in the range of 360–700 nm on a Hitachi-557 double beam spectrophotometer. An extinction coefficient of 91,000m−1 cm−1 at 400 nm was used to quantitate the hemozoin in the form of heme as described previously (42Pandey A.V. Joshi S.K. Tekwani B.L. Chauhan V.S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In some experiments instead of parasite lysate, recombinant PfHRP II was used as a template for hemozoin formation. Interaction of drugs with malarial hemozoin was studied as described previously (43Pandey A.V. Tekwani B.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A suspension of fine crystals of purified hemozoin was prepared by sonication. Hemozoin was incubated in acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 100 mm, final volume 1.0 ml) for 4 h at 37 °C with the specified concentration of artemisinin or α-/β-arteether. Controls without the drug were also run simultaneously, and each assay was run in triplicate. At the end of the incubation period, the suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. The hemozoin pellets were washed once with ethanol to remove the drugs and once with alkaline bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm). The amount of hemozoin remaining was quantified as described previously (27Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The difference between amount of hemozoin in the incubation mixtures without and with the drug gave the amount of hemozoin breakdown due to the endoperoxide antimalarials. Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. To study the effect of artemisinin and its analogue arteether on the hemoglobin catabolic process of the malarial parasite, we used purified digestive vacuoles from P. yoelii as the source of proteolytic activity. We found that artemisinin inhibited the proteolytic activity of the digestive vacuole lysate in an in vitro assay, involving degradation of 14C-labeled hemoglobin (TableI). Around 70% of the proteolytic activity in malaria food vacuole is due to aspartic acid proteases (13Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerboker A. Muller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russel D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). After treatment of the vacuolar lysate with pepstatin A (a specific inhibitor of aspartic acid proteases), ∼71% inhibition of the proteolytic activity was observed. The remaining proteolytic activity (∼29%) in the reaction mixture could be inhibited by E-64 (a highly specific cysteine protease inhibitor). Artemisinin treatment also resulted in similar inhibition. Maximum inhibition caused by artemisinin was comparable to that achieved by E-64, suggesting the specific inhibition of cysteine protease by this drug. Addition of artemisinin in reaction mixture after E-64 treatment did not result in any significant addition into the inhibition of proteolysis as compared with E-64 alone. This indicated that the specific protease targets of both E-64 and artemisinin might be same. On the other hand, combination of either pepstatin A and E-64 or pepstatin A and artemisinin resulted in almost complete inhibition of the vacuolar proteolytic activity. This was expected as both aspartic and cysteine proteases would be blocked by these inhibitors. These results suggested that artemisinin may be involved in specific inhibition of malarial cysteine protease activity.Table IInhibition of P. yoelii vacuolar proteolytic activity by artemisinin using denatured hemoglobin as substrateSubstrate no.SampledpmInhibition%1Control1750 ± 3452Artemisinin1243 ± 19229 ± 113Arteether1195 ± 25332 ± 144E-641298 ± 21726 ± 125Heme1125 ± 30936 ± 186E-64 + artemisinin1147 ± 26635 ± 157Pepstatin A507 ± 19871 ± 118Pepstatin A + artemisinin93 ± 5995 ± 39Pepstatin A + E-6471 ± 6396 ± 4Concentration of inhibitors was as follows: artemisinin 200 μm, E-64 100 μm, pepstatin A 100 μm, heme 20 μm.

Assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inhibitors were incubated with enzyme for 1 h before addition of substrate. Values are mean ± S.D. of triplicate observations. We next investigated whether the observed inhibition could be due to the specific interaction of artemisinin with the parasite cysteine protease. For this a fluorogenic peptide substrate of malarial cysteine protease, Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, was used to study the mechanism of protease inhibition by artemisinin. In a continuous fluorometric assay when artemisinin was incubated with the parasite lysate for 1 h prior to the assay, significant decrease in the proteolytic cleavage of peptide substrate was observed indicating that the drug could be making some modifications in the enzyme (TableII). The inhibition was significantly higher when heme was included in the reaction mixture along with artemisinin. No change in the protease activity was observed when artemisinin was added just before the start.Table IIInhibition of P. yoelii cysteine protease activity by artemisininSubstrate no.SampleΔ Fluorescence intensity(arbitrary units)/min1Control35 ± 52Artemisinin (preincubated with enzyme)19 ± 33Artemisinin (added before start)34 ± 64Artemisinin + heme (preincubation with enzyme) (heme 0.001 mm)11 ± 55Heme (preincubated with enzyme) (heme 0.001 mm)32 ± 66E-640.07Pepstatin A34 ± 5Activity was measured by degradation of specific peptide for plasmodial cysteine protease.

Assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inhibitors were incubated with enzyme for 1 h before addition of substrate. To confirm whether artemisinin could inhibit the hemoglobin degradation inside the malarial parasite, artemisinin was incubated in vitro with P. yoelii-infected erythrocytes for 0–6 h, and the hemoglobin levels in the cell-free parasite preparations were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We observed that artemisinin-treated parasites showed a higher level of hemoglobin compared with the untreated parasites (Fig.1). These results suggest that degradation of hemoglobin in the digestive vacuole of the malarial parasite may have been inhibited by artemisinin treatment. When free heme is incubated with the particulate fraction of the cell-freeP. yoelii under conditions similar to that of the parasite food vacuole, a fraction of heme is polymerized, which can be identified as a product insoluble in SDS (2.5% w/v) and alkaline bicarbonate solution (41Pandey A.V. Singh N. Tekwani B.L. Puri S.K. Chauhan V.S. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 20: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, no such product was formed when heme alone (without any parasite extract) was processed in a similar manner (29Pandey A.V. Joshi R.M. Tekwani B.L. Singh R.L. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We found that the formation of hemozoin by P. yoelii extract is dependent on incubation time, amount of protein, and concentration of free heme (41Pandey A.V. Singh N. Tekwani B.L. Puri S.K. Chauhan V.S. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 20: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A similar pattern has been observed by earlier workers (26Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 27Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) for heme polymerization byP. falciparum and P. berghei. Recently, a histidine-rich protein (PfHRP II) from P. falciparum has been shown to catalyze polymerization of heme (40Sullivan D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We also used recombinant PfHRP II as a source of heme polymerization activity in one of the experiments to study the effect of artemisinin on hemozoin formation in vitro. Artemisinin as well as α-/β-arteether caused marked inhibition of heme polymerization mediated by the parasite lysate (Fig.2 A) as well as PfHRP II (Fig.2 B). Inhibition of hemozoin formation by α-/β-arteether (IC50 value 7.3 μm) was slightly higher than that by artemisinin (IC50 value 11.5 μm) (Fig. 2 A). The effect of increasing substrate (Fig.3 A) and inhibitor (Fig.3 B) concentration on inhibition of heme polymerization was also studied. Normally polymerization of heme in the presence of parasite extract or PfHRP II is a saturable reaction following a hyperbolic pattern (41Pandey A.V. Singh N. Tekwani B.L. Puri S.K. Chauhan V.S. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 20: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of heme polymerization by artemisinin was not affected by the presence of high concentrations of heme to any significant extent; following an initial fall in the percent inhibition between 5 and 10 μm, the inhibition potency of drug remained almost constant up to 200 μmheme (Fig. 3 A). The pattern of inhibition was qualitatively similar at 1 and 10 μm concentrations of artemisinin with the expected quantitative increase for higher drug concentration. AK i value of 12.0 μm was obtained for inhibition of P. yoelii-mediated heme polymerization by artemisinin, from the Dixon plot (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Inhibition of heme polymerase activity ofP. yoelii extracts by artemisinin at varying substrate concentrations (A) and varying concentration of the drug (B).

The incubation of purified hemozoin with artemisinin or α-/β-arteether under acidic conditions (acetate buffer, 100 mm, pH 5.0) resulted in the loss of hemozoin contents as compared with control, indicating that hemozoin may be disrupted as a result of its interaction with the endoperoxide. This hemozoin disruption increased with the increasing concentration of the drug (Fig.4). Interaction of hemozoin with the drug may result in breakdown of the hemozoin pigment which could then form a complex with the heme units (38Hong Y.L. Yang Y.Z. Meshnick S.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Earlier Meshnick et al. (5Meshnick S.R. Taylor T.E. Kamchonwongpaisan P. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 301-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a two-step mechanism for the antimalarial action of artemisinin and other related endoperoxides. In the first step, the endoperoxide bridge in artemisinin is cleaved by free heme or iron, leading to the generation of an unstable radical of the drug. This subsequently causes selective alkylation of malarial proteins, leading to death of the parasite. However, the transient source of free heme or iron proposed in this mechanism has n"

SUMO-1 modifications have been implicated in the targeting of proteins to the nuclear envelope and certain intranuclear structures and in converting proteins resistant to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In the present work, we find that Ubc9 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), a member of the steroid receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells, AR-dependent but not basal transcription is enhanced by the coexpression of Ubc9. The N-terminal half of the AR hinge region containing the C-terminal part of the bipartite nuclear localization signal is essential for the interaction with Ubc9. Deletion of this part of the nuclear localization signal, which does not completely prevent the transfer of AR to the nucleus, abolishes the AR-Ubc9 interaction and attenuates the transcriptional response to cotransfected Ubc9. The C93S substitution of Ubc9, which prevents SUMO-1 conjugation by abrogating the formation of a thiolester bond between SUMO-1 and Ubc9, does not influence the capability of Ubc9 to stimulate AR-dependent transactivation, implying that Ubc9 is able to act as an AR coregulator in a fashion independent of its ability to catalyze SUMO-1 conjugation.

AR DBD is important in the transrepression of AP-1 and NF-κB-activated genes (6Aarnisalo P. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In view of this, it has not been unexpected that several coactivator proteins interacting with the DBD and hinge regions of steroid receptors have been characterized over the last few years (9Jackson T.A.

Upon ligand binding, the conformation of the receptors changes; the receptors dissociate from chaperones (14Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol.

In nuclei, steroid receptors bind to specific hormone response elements and activate target genes or modulate and interfere with the activity of other transcription factors. The process of nuclear import is energy-dependent and guided by nuclear localization signals (NLS) (21Görlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In the case of AR and GR, the cognate ligands facilitate their nuclear transport. Steroid receptors carry a bipartite NLS that encompasses the last residues of the DBD and the N-terminal residues of the hinge region. In addition to NLS, also the activation function 1-containing region and ligand-binding domain modulate the intracellular localization of AR (23Georget V. Lobaccaro J.M. Terouanne B. Mangeat P.

Its homologues interact with proteins of diverse functions, including the GR. This latter interaction involves the GR DBD and is sensitive to mutations that abolish the ability of GR to repress AP-1 (26Göttlicher M. Heck S. Doucas V. Wade E. Kullmann M. Cato A.C.B. Evans R.M. Herrlich P. Steroids. 1996; 61: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The activity of another transcription factor, Ets-1, is enhanced by coexpressed Ubc9 (27Hahn S.L. Criqui P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Also c-Jun (26Göttlicher M. Heck S. Doucas V. Wade E. Kullmann M. Cato A.C.B. Evans R.M. Herrlich P. Steroids. 1996; 61: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and adenovirus E1A (28Hateboer G. Hijmans E.M. Nooij J.B.D. Schlenker S. Jentsch S. Bernards R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25906-25911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have been reported to interact with Ubc9, but similar to GR, functional consequences of these interactions have not been addressed. Likewise, initial attempts to characterize the region of Ubc9 that interacts with GR and c-Jun failed to identify a distinct interface (26Göttlicher M. Heck S. Doucas V. Wade E. Kullmann M. Cato A.C.B. Evans R.M. Herrlich P. Steroids. 1996; 61: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because of its homology to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ubc9 has been linked to ubiquitination of target proteins; for example, in vitro ubiquitination of activating transcription factor 2 is facilitated by the addition of purified human Ubc9 (29Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recent results have shown, however, that Ubc9 is not involved in ubiquitin conjugation, but rather in covalent linking of the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 (also known as PIC1, UBL1, GMP1, or Sentrin) to several target proteins (30Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 31Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the case of the mammalian Ran GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1, SUMO-1 conjugation acts as a targeting signal to the nuclear pore complex (34Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Geraçe L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 35Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J.

SUMO-1 has targeting functions also within the nucleus; for example, unmodified promyelocytic leukemia gene product resides in nucleoplasm, whereas the SUMO-1-modified form is localized to so-called promyelocytic leukemia gene product nuclear bodies (37Müller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Because the promyelocytic leukemia gene product nuclear bodies have been reported to contain CREB-binding protein and nascent RNA produced by the action of RNA polymerase II, they might be involved in transcriptional regulation (38LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R.L. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, conjugation of SUMO-1 is antagonistic to ubiquitination, in that SUMO-1 is linked to the same lysine of IκB as ubiquitin, and by blocking ubiquitination, SUMO-1 modification renders IκB resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation (39Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Our recent work has focused on the protein interaction partners of AR DBD and their role in AR-dependent transcriptional regulation (6Aarnisalo P. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Evans R.M. Herrlich P. Steroids. 1996; 61: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is highly homologous to AR DBD, it was pertinent to examine the influence of Ubc9 on the regulation of AR-dependent signaling. Protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma. Testosterone was purchased from Makor Chemicals, and32P-labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mouse monoclonal M2 anti-Flag antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-Lex antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Kodak, CLONTECH, andZymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. The polyclonal anti-AR antibodies were K183 and K333 (40Karvonen U. Kallio P.J. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol.

Yeast vectors pVP16, for expressing the transactivation domain of herpes simplex virus VP 16 protein, and pLexN-a, for expressing bacterial LexA protein with the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 large T antigen, were kind gifts from Dr. Stanley M. Hollenberg (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). LexN-a AR constructs were generated by inserting polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments coding for amino acids 554–644 of human AR (hAR) into the BamHI/SalI site of pLexN-a. Lex-WT1ZF encoding the zinc finger region (residues 312–419) of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene product WT1 fused to Lex DBD has been described earlier (10Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). pVP16-Ubc9, a yeast expression vector coding for amino acids 1–156 of mouse Ubc9, was isolated in an unrelated yeast two-hybrid screen. Inserts for the expression vectors Flag-Ubc9 and Flag-UbcC93S were generated by polymerase chain reaction and overlap polymerase chain reaction, respectively, and cloned into theHindIII/EcoRI site of pFlag-CMV-2. Mammalian two-hybrid plasmids pVP16, pVP16-CP, and pM were purchased from CLONTECH. Gal4-AR has been described previously (10Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vector pVP16-Ubc9 was generated by cloning a polymerase chain reaction-amplified insert into theBamHI/SalI site of pVP16. pG5-LUC reporter and pCMVβ (a β-galactosidase expression vector) were purchased from Promega and CLONTECH, respectively. The minimal reporter construct pARE2-TATA-LUC, with two androgen response elements (AREs) and a TATA-box-driving luciferase expression, has been described (10Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The hAR expression constructs GA (harboring two substitutions, R617G and K618A), Δ629–633, and GAΔ629–633, are pSG5-derivatives of mutants 28.3, 28.1, and 28.31, which were kindly provided by Dr. Albert O. Brinkmann (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). AR construct Δ574–627 has been described previously (41Palvimo J.J Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar) (termed Δ557–610). The LexN-a AR constructs were transformed together with plasmids encoding VP16 AD or VP16 AD fused to Ubc9 into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 (a gift from S. M. Hollenberg). The transformants were plated on a selective medium devoid of uracil, tryptophan, and leucine, and β-galactosidase activities were determined from three separate liquid yeast cultures according to the instructions of the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH). COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 units/ml of streptomycin and penicillin. For transient transfections, 3–3.5 × 104 cells were seeded on 12-well plates 24 h prior to transfections, and 4 h before the addition of DNA, the cells received fresh medium with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed by using FuGene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 18 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 100 nmtestosterone or vehicle. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, 5 × 104 COS-1 cells were seeded on 12-well plates. Two hundred ng of VP16, 200 ng of Gal4 fusion protein expression vectors, 200 ng of pG5-LUC, and 50 ng of pCMVβ were transfected by using FuGene. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (41Palvimo J.J Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For preparation of whole cell extracts, COS-1 cells were electroporated with 20 μg of DNA/10-cm dish as described (43Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). COS-1 cell extracts were prepared in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody was performed as described (6Aarnisalo P. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and the samples were resolved on 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blots of yeast cell extracts were performed as described previously (10Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells, seeded on glass coverslips on 6-well plates, were transfected with FuGene reagent with 150 or 400 ng of hAR expression vector, and the total DNA amount was filled to 1 μg with empty pSG5 DNA. Twenty-one hours after transfection, the cells received fresh stripped 2% fetal bovine serum and were cultured for an additional 26 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm testosterone. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100. AR protein was detected with polyclonal rabbit antiserum K183 (40Karvonen U. Kallio P.J. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15973-15979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) raised against full-length rat AR (1:200 dilution). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA) were used for visualization of the receptor protein by the use of a fluorescence microscope. Human AR DBD and hinge regions (amino acids 554–644, Fig.1 A) fused to LexN-a as a bait (LexNa-DBDH) was used to evaluate the interaction with Ubc9 cloned in-frame to VP16 activation domain in a yeast two-hybrid system. Strong activation of a β-galactosidase reporter was observed when both partners were present (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of amino acids 629–633 in the N-terminal part of the hinge region, containing the RKLKK motif of the bipartite AR NLS (Fig. 1 A), weakened the interaction significantly (Δ629–633). A double substitution in the DBD (R617G and K618A, termed GA), which destroys the N-terminal part of the NLS (Fig. 1 A), had a smaller effect on the interaction, but when combined with the Δ629–633 deletion (GAΔ629–633), it resulted in a further decrease in the reporter activity (Fig.1 B). These results are not explainable by differences in the amounts of Lex-AR DBD fusion proteins, as the expression levels of the mutant constructs were similar to each other and somewhat higher than that of wild-type AR DBD in yeast (Fig. 1 C). Because the vector encoding the Lex fusion proteins was LexN-a, which contains an NLS from the SV40 large T antigen, the inability of AR DBD/hinge mutants to enter the nucleus should not be responsible for the differences in their interaction with Ubc9. To confirm that the AR-Ubc9 interaction also occurs in mammalian cells, mammalian two-hybrid experiments with full-length AR in COS-1 cells were performed (Fig. 2). Cotransfection of a construct encoding rat AR amino acids 3–902 fused to Gal4 DBD (Gal4-AR) with an expression vector for VP16 AD or VP16-CP (VP16 AD-polyoma virus coat protein fusion) did not yield significant reporter gene activation in the presence or absence of testosterone. When the VP16-Ubc9 fusion protein was transfected with Gal4-AR, a weak reporter gene activation was observed. This was substantially augmented by the addition of testosterone, yielding a 5.5-fold increase over that with Gal4-AR and VP16-Ubc9 in the absence of hormone, or a 23-fold activation of the reporter in comparison to that with Gal4-AR and VP16-CP in the presence of hormone (Fig. 2). The association of AR and Ubc9 was further investigated by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). COS-1 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Ubc9 and AR expression vectors. Monoclonal anti-Flag antibody was first used to collect the protein complexes containing Flag-Ubc9, and the presence of wild-type or mutant AR proteins in these complexes was subsequently examined by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-AR antibody. Wild-type AR but not the GAΔ629–633 mutant associated with Flag-Ubc9 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5). The presence of Δ629–633 and GA mutations alone attenuated but did not abolish completely the interaction between AR and Ubc9 (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7), which was in line with the data from functional assays in yeast (cf. Fig.1 B). It was of interest to observe that the deletion of AR amino acids 574–627, which encompass the major part of AR DBD, did not influence the ability of the receptor to interact with Ubc9. To elucidate the role of the bipartite NLS in AR function, the properties of AR mutants GA, Δ629–633, and GAΔ629–633 were investigated (Fig.4). In transfected CV-1 cells, wild-type AR exhibited predominantly nuclear localization with occasional faint staining in the cytoplasm in the absence of androgen (Fig. 4,A and B). When both parts of the NLS were destroyed (GAΔ629–633) (C and D), AR resided in the cytoplasm in the absence of the androgen, but upon hormone exposure, it gained nuclear localization, although cytoplasmic staining with occasional granules remained even in the presence of testosterone. The mutants GA (E and F) and Δ629–633 (panels G and H) were mostly cytoplasmic in the absence of the ligand. They were able to enter the nucleus in the presence of testosterone but, in contrast to wild-type AR, residual cytoplasmic staining was observed in the presence of androgen. Thus, nuclear transport of the mutants is compromised but not totally abolished. The transactivation ability of the AR mutants was investigated in transiently transfected COS-1 cells (Fig.5 A). The minimal reporter construct pARE2-TATA-LUC was activated poorly, if at all, by the mutants GA and GAΔ629–633 (GA, 3-fold and GAΔ629–633, 1.2-fold versus a 35-fold activation by wild-type AR). Surprisingly, the mutant Δ629–633 was a 3–10-fold more potent activator of the reporter construct than wild-type AR (Fig.5 A). Expression levels of the mutant proteins were determined by immunoblotting, and significant differences were not observed (Fig. 5 B). When a reporter driven by the rat probasin promoter was examined under the same experimental conditions, the activity of Δ629–633 was 1.4–2.8-fold higher than that of wild-type AR. In contrast, the activities of the mutants GA and GAΔ629–633 on this promoter were minimal, with the latter exhibiting no activity and the former 15- 110 of the wild-type activity. 2H. Poukka, P. Aarnisalo, J. J. Palvimo, and O. A. Jänne, unpublished observations. To examine the influence of Ubc9 overexpression on AR-mediated transactivation, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for hAR and Ubc9 and the reporter construct pARE2-TATA-LUC. Coexpression of Ubc9 enhanced AR-dependent transactivation in a dose-dependent fashion, without affecting the reporter activity in the absence of androgen or AR (Fig.6). The increase in reporter gene activity was not because of increased cellular concentration of AR, because immunoblots (see Fig. 5 B) and whole cell ligand-binding assays2 did not reveal alterations in immunoreactive or biologically active AR protein content. Coexpression of Ubc9 did not increase the DNA binding of AR, because the amount of the receptor interacting with AREs in electrophoretic mobility shift assay remained constant.2 Intriguingly, introduction of the C93S substitution into the protein-coding sequence of Ubc9, which renders it incapable of SUMO-1 conjugation (29Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T.

This suggests that the SUMO-1-ligating activity of Ubc9 is not mandatory for the protein to activate AR function. Indeed, our attempts to detect a SUMO-1-modified AR protein have not yielded results to support the presence of such an AR form. In immunolocalization experiments, coexpression of Ubc9 did not influence AR localization. 3H. Poukka, U. Karvonen, J. J. Palvimo, and O. A. Jänne, unpublished observations. The hAR mutant Δ629–633 has full transactivation potential compared with wild-type AR in the context of the pARE2-TATA-LUC reporter (Figs.5 A and 6). However, the ability of coexpressed Ubc9 to activate the function of this AR form was clearly less than that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 6). The effect of other NLS mutations on Ubc9-mediated activation of AR function could not be investigated, as the transactivation ability of these mutants is almost negligible. In this study, we show that androgen receptor and Ubc9 interact. The interaction is readily detectable in a yeast two-hybrid system employing AR DBD and the first twenty amino acids of the hinge region, the domain of AR harboring the bipartite NLS. Substitutions in the C-terminal DBD and the N-terminal part of the hinge attenuate the interaction between AR and Ubc9. In the case of the Ubc9-hGR interaction, a receptor form carrying two mutations in the second zinc finger (C476W and R479Q) did not recognize Ubc9 (26Göttlicher M. Heck S. Doucas V. Wade E. Kullmann M. Cato A.C.B. Evans R.M. Herrlich P. Steroids. 1996; 61: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The AR-Ubc9 interaction observed in yeast could be verified in a mammalian two-hybrid system with full-length AR and it was enhanced by the presence of ligand, even though a weak interaction also occurred in the absence of androgen. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the interaction was again detectable and attenuated by the destruction of the bipartite NLS. Interestingly, a major part of AR DBD could be deleted without a significant effect on the interaction between AR and Ubc9, as the Δ574–627 mutant, which lacks the region between the tip of the first zinc finger and beginning of the hinge region as well as the N-terminal part of the NLS, was coimmunoprecipitated with Ubc9 as efficiently as wild-type AR. These results suggest that the AR-Ubc9 interaction is, at least in part, electrostatic, as residues 629–633 are positively charged and the Ubc9 crystal structure has revealed a strong electrostatic dipole with negative and positive surfaces on the opposite sides of the molecule (44Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21381-21387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the main function of AR is to regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion, we investigated the effect of Ubc9 coexpression on transcriptional activation by AR in transiently transfected cells. A dose-dependent increase in pARE2-TATA-LUC reporter activity was observed in cells exposed to testosterone, whereas in the absence of ligand, Ubc9 had no effect. Thus, Ubc9 does not enhance transcription in general, and in this sense, it should be viewed as an AR coregulator. In transfections with the Δ629–633 mutant, the response to Ubc9 was negligible, as expected on the basis of the interaction data from the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitations. To address the role of the SUMO-1-conjugating activity of Ubc9 in this event, we used the conjugation-defective mutant C93S that is unable to form thiolester linkage with SUMO-1. As this mutant behaved in a fashion very similar to wild-type Ubc9 in cotransfection experiments, it appears that activation of AR function is not related to SUMO-1 modifications of AR or other proteins. These coactivator-like properties of Ubc9 have been previously reported in the context of transcription factor Ets-1, in that Ubc9 enhanced transactivation by Ets-1, and also in this case, the activity was not abolished by the C93S substitution in Ubc9 (27Hahn S.L. Criqui P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The bipartite NLS of AR seems to be important for the interaction with and transcriptional enhancement by Ubc9, and SUMO-1 modifications catalyzed by Ubc9 have been shown to play multiple roles in cellular targeting of proteins. On the basis of this, it was tempting to assume that Ubc9 is involved in the regulation of AR localization. The transport of AR from cytoplasm to the nucleus is not well understood (24Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Zhou Z. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15973-15979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our experiments, mutations of both the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of NLS impair the access of AR to the nuclei of CV-1 cells but do not abolish it entirely, even when combined. Because an AR mutant devoid of the C-terminal part of NLS is incapable of interacting with Ubc9 but still able to enter the nucleus, the primary function of the AR-Ubc9 interaction is probably not related to the targeting of AR to the nucleus. In view of the fact that SUMO-1-conjugating activity of Ubc9 was not mandatory for the activation of AR-dependent transcription, it is unlikely that intranuclear targeting of AR by SUMO-1 modification to transcriptionally more active compartments would explain its ability to regulate AR function. Likewise, SUMO-1 modification of other proteins appears to be excluded as well. The role of the RKLKK sequence in the previously characterized AR NLS in the interaction and response to Ubc9 is evident. This raises the question of a presently unknown (unrelated to nuclear import) function for this region. The NLS consists of charged amino acids and is potentially available for interactions with nuclear proteins. Should some of these interactions repress AR-dependent transcription, then the binding of Ubc9 could mask this surface and prevent the repressor from influencing AR function. The hinge regions of AR and GR also participate in the targeting of the receptors to nuclear matrix (45Tang Y. Getzenberg R.H. Vietmeier B.N. Stallcup M.R. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1420-1431PubMed Google Scholar, 46Van Steensel B. Jenster G. Damm K. Brinkmann A.O. van Driel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As transiently transfected templates are not organized into a native chromatin structure, it is possible that transcription factors not bound to the nuclear matrix do, in fact, stimulate transcription from non-chromatin templates more efficiently than matrix-associated factors. Should Ubc9 indeed prevent putative matrix adaptor/targeting proteins from contacting AR, this would enhance AR-mediated transcription in transiently transfected cells. Likewise, substitutions in the hinge region that influence the potential matrix-targeting residues should generate an AR form that is more potent in transcriptional activation. Collectively, our results together with those on the modulation of Ets-1-mediated transcription by Ubc9 (27Hahn S.L. Criqui P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that Ubc9 has functions other than merely catalyzing SUMO-1 conjugation of different proteins.

Binding of NF-κB to three of five putative binding sites within the human TRAF1 promoter was found in electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies, and analysis of TRAF1 gene promoter luciferase constructs confirmed the functional importance of these elements. Moreover, triggering of TNF-R1, CD40, and the interleukin-1 receptor resulted in transcription of the TRAF1 gene, whereas receptors that are not activators or only poor activators of NF-κB in HeLa cells failed to show a significant TRAF1 induction. Because it has been shown that members of the TRAF family are involved in activation of NF-κB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by the interleukin-1 receptor and members of the TNF receptor superfamily, a role of TRAF1 in receptor cross-talk and/or feedback regulation of activated receptor signaling complexes can be suggested. In fact, we found that TNF-induced activation of JNK is prolonged in transfectants overexpressing TRAF1, whereas overexpression of a deletion mutant of TRAF1 in which the N-terminal part had been replaced by the green fluorescent protein interfered with TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK.

Hence, it seems that TRAF proteins serve as common adapter proteins that connect members of the TNF receptor superfamily and the IL-1-R to pathways leading to the activation of NF-κB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

For most of these molecules a role in regulation of NF-κB as well as JNK activation and apoptosis has been suggested. Interestingly, TRAF2 knockout mice, as well as mice overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2, are functional in TNF-dependent NF-κB activation but not in activation of JNK (31Lee S.Y.

To date, it is unclear whether the functionality of the TNF-initiated pathway leading to NF-κB activation in these mice is caused by compensatory effects of other TRAFs or reflects a dispensability of TRAF2 for TNF-induced NF-κB activation (31Lee S.Y.

Conversely, RIP knockout mice are fully deficient in NF-κB activation but exert a normal JNK response upon TNF treatment (33Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

The N-terminal region of most of the TRAF proteins contains a RING finger motif and an additional array of zinc finger structures that are arranged in two or three CART domains (34Regnier C.H.

TRAF1 is unique among the TRAF molecules in two aspects; first, it contains no RING finger motif, and second, the zinc finger structures of TRAF1 are not arranged in CART domains. TRAF1 mRNA levels are about tenfold increased in Epstein-Barr virus-positive cells compared with noninfected cells (15Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. Vanarsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E.

In accordance with these data, we can demonstrate that stimulation of the NF-κB inducing receptors TNF-R1, TNF-R2, CD40, TCR, and IL-1-R activates the transcription of TRAF1. Because overexpression of a deletion mutant of TRAF1 significantly reduces TNF-R1-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK, we propose that TRAF1 has a positive modulatory role in cytokine-induced gene induction. 293 human embryonic kidney cells were a generous gift from Dr. Gary J. Nabel (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant human TNF was purchased from Sigma or was a gift from I.-M. von Broen (Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany).

All other reagents were obtained from Sigma if not otherwise stated. A 1:1 mixture of purified recombinant Flag-tagged human TRAIL (10 μg/ml) and anti-Flag M2 antibody (20 μg/ml; Kodak International Biotechnologies) was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and diluted to the final concentrations indicated in the figure legends. A cDNA fragment comprising human TRAF1(185–408) with a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ NotI site was generated using proofreading polymerase chain reaction with the p-RSK-TRAF1 plasmid as template.

The TRAF1 promoter-reporter gene construct pGL3-T1p(−1 to −1404) was cloned by ligation of a 1.4-kilobase pair fragment of genomic TRAF1 into the blunted XhoI site of the pGL3 basic plasmid (Promega) immediately 5′ of the luciferase gene (numbering corresponds to bases of the TRAF1 promoter in GenBankTM accession numberY10284). pGL3-T1p(−1 to −424) was constructed by deletion of anNdeI/EcoRI fragment, blunt ending, and religation of pGL3-T1p(−1 to −1404). To generate pGL3-T1p(−1 to −31), the plasmid pGL3-T1p(−1 to −1404) was digested with SacI and religated. The pGL3-T1p(−1 to −202) and pGL3-T1p(−1 to −121) plasmids were cloned by polymerase chain reaction using sense 5′-GGG GTA CCA CTC CTA AAG CCT TCA GTC-3′ or sense 5′-GGG GTA CCA ACA AAG GGT AAT TCCTGC-3′ and antisense 5′-ATG CCA AGC TTA CTT AGA TC-3′ oligonucleotides and the TRAF1 promoter as template. Products were digested with KpnI and HindII and ligated into pGL3. Amplified products and cloning junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutations were introduced into pGL3-T1p(−1 to −1404) using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, two complementary primers comprising the mutated κB sites κB1, κB3, and κB5 of the human TRAF1 promoter (κB1-mut sense, 5′-GGA CTT GTC TCC AAC ACC CCT CGA GTT TCC ACC AGG AAG GTG AGC-3′; κB1-mut antisense, 5′-GCT CAC CTT CCT GGT GGA AAC TCG AGG GGT GTT GGA GAC AAG TCC-3′; κB3-mut sense, 5′-GCC TGC GAT TCT CAA CCAGCT CGA GTC TCA CTG TGC TTT CTG AGA G-3′; κB3-mut antisense, 5′-CTC TCA GAA AGC ACA GTG AGA CTC GAG CTG GTT GAG AAT CGC AGG C-3′; κB5-mut sense, 5′-CAG GGG ATT TTT ATC GCA ACA AAG CTC GAG TCC TGC TCC ATC CCT GCT G-3′; κB5-mut antisense, 5′-CAG CAG GGA TGG AGC AGG ACT CGA GCT TTG TTG CGA TAA AAA TCC CCT G-3′; mutated κB sites with introducedXhoI site are underlined) were extended during temperature cycling by means of Pfu DNA polymerase resulting in mutated plasmids containing staggered nicks. The products are then treated withDpnI, which selectively digests methylated (parental) and hemimethylated (semi-parental) plasmids. The nicked, mutation-containing plasmids were then transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue, and several clones were analyzed for the presence of the desired mutation. The introduced mutation creates an additional XhoI restriction site allowing the identification of mutant plasmids by restriction analysis. Finally, the mutants were controlled by sequence analysis. HeLa cells were maintained in Clicks/RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106/100-mm tissue culture dish. Stable TRAF1 transfectants were obtained by cotransfection of the TRAF1 expression construct p-RSK-TRAF1 encoding full-length human TRAF1 and pcDNA3.1 containing the neomycin resistance gene for G418 selection with SuperFect according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Stable clones were obtained after 2 weeks of selection, and individual drug-resistant colonies were isolated, expanded, and characterized. HeLa clones overexpressing GFP-TRAF1(185–408) were also generated by Superfect based transfection. Transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). 20 days post-transfection individual drug-resistant colonies were pooled, expanded, and enriched for high expression by three cycles of cell sorting using a FACStarplus (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared essentially as described by Dignam et al. (38Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) with some modifications (39Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.32m sucrose, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmDTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF, and nuclei were separated by centrifugation (2600 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 25%, and extracts were stored at −70 °C. Nuclei were washed once in 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in low salt buffer (0.02 KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 25% glycerol; 20 μl for 1 × 107 cells or 40 μl for 5 × 107 cells). After 5 min incubation the same volume of high salt buffer (0.8 KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mmDTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 25% glycerol) was added in four fractions. After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, 1.5 volumes of 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, and 25% glycerol were added. Nuclei were centrifuged (14000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), and aliquots of nuclear protein extracts were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Ref. 50Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar; Bio-Rad). The oligonucleotide probe used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay corresponded to the high affinity κB sequences found in the mouse κ light chain enhancer and in the human immunodeficiency virus promoter region. Two oligonucleotides were annealed to generate a double-stranded probe: sense 5′-AGC TTG GGG ACT TTC CAC TAG TAC G-3′ and antisense 5′-AAT TCG TAC TAG TGG AAA GTC CCCA-3′ (the binding sites are underlined). End labeling was accomplished by treatment with T4 kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified on push columns (Stratagene). Labeled double-stranded probe (80,000 cpm) was added to 6 μg of nuclear protein in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific competitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. DNA protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer. Gels were vacuum dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C with intensifying screens. To identify the binding properties of potential NF-κB/Rel-binding sites in the TRAF1 promoter region, competition experiments were performed by adding specific unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides to the reaction mixture in 20- or 100-fold molar excess. Oligonucleotides spanning putative κB sites of the TRAF1 promoter region were annealed to generate double-stranded competitors and shown in Fig. 1 A. Transfections for analysis of the TRAF1 promoter reporter constructs were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (39Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded 24 h before transfection (5 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well dishes. For transfection 10 μg of plasmid-DNA was mixed with 124 μm CaCl2 in a total volume of 300 μl. After 18 h, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated for 24 h with TNF (150 units). Cell extracts were prepared by the addition of 200 μl of cell lysis buffer and one freeze-thaw cycle (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). A portion of the extracts (10 μl) was added to luciferase substrate (50 μl). The luminescence was quantitated in the single photon mode using a Berthold luminometer. Background from the substrate solution and the counter was 90–100 relative light units. 293 cells transfected with the pGL3 basic construct alone usually revealed 200–500 light units, which were taken as basal activity. Transfections were performed in at least four independent experiments. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. For NF-κB reporter plasmid assays HeLa cells (0.8 × 105) were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates. The following day the cells were transfected using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) with a 3× NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid and a SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid to normalize the transfection efficiency. After additional 24 h, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using an LUMAT 9501 Luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Cells (8 × 106) were plated on a 150-mm Petri dish in 12 ml of Clicks/RPMI 1640 medium overnight at 37 °C. The next day the cells were treated with the reagent of interest, and subsequently RNA was isolated with RNA INSTAPURE (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Then the RNAs were tested for the presence of transcripts of xIAP, TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF4, NAIP, cIAP2, cIAP1, TRPM2, and TRAF3 using the hApo-5 Multi-Probe template set (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany). In this set L32 and GAPDH were included as internal controls. Probe synthesis, hybridization and RNase treatment were performed with the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay System (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (5%) and quantified by phosphorimaging. Jun kinase assays were performed upon immunoprecipitation of JNK1 using a rabbit antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GST-Jun was used as substrate in an in vitrokinase assay as described elsewhere (40Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Clark E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In a recent publication, we have described the molecular cloning of the promoter of the human TRAF1 gene (41Siemienski K. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify cis-acting sequences that regulate transcription of TRAF1, a series of reporter plasmids was constructed. Different 5′ deleted fragments of the putative TRAF1 promoter region were ligated immediately upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 basic plasmid (Fig.1 B). Transient transfections into HeLa cells were performed. Transfections of pGL3-T1p(−1 to −1404) and pGL3-T1p(−1 to −424) showed a significant basal activity which dropped by further deletion of 222 (pGL3-T1p(−1 to −202)) and 303 base pairs (pGL3-T1p(−1 to −121)), respectively. An additional deletion of 90 base pairs yielded the pGL3-T1p(−1 to −31) construct, which had almost completely lost its basal activity (Fig.1 C). Transcriptional activity of the pGL3-T1p(−1 to −1404) construct could be increased 4.8-fold by stimulation with TNF. The respective levels of induction by TNF decreased stepwise when transfecting the different 5′ deleted TRAF1 promoter constructs (Fig.1 D). Sequence analysis revealed five putative NF-κB/Rel consensus sites in the TRAF1 promoter region (Fig. 1, A andB). To get first insights in the functional importance of these κB elements, we tested whether NF-κB/Rel proteins bind to these sites. Hence, electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses were performed using unlabeled oligonucleotides encompassing the different putative NF-κB/Rel sites as competitors. The classical κB site of the murine κ light chain enhancer (IgκB) was used as probe and incubated with nuclear extracts from TNF stimulated 293 cells. NF-κB/Rel complexes bound to the IgκB site efficiently and were competed by addition of a 20- or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled IgκB oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 E). Binding specificity was controlled with the unrelated Sp1 site, which did not interfere with NF-κB/Rel binding. Similar to unlabeled IgκB, oligonucleotides containing the 1, 3, and 5 κB sites of the TRAF1 promoter region competed for NF-κB/Rel binding. In contrast, the 2 and 4 sites did not bind NF-κB/Rel with high affinity and are therefore not likely to be relevant for NF-κB/Rel-mediated transcription. To further substantiate the functional importance of the κB sites κB1, κB3, and κB5, we individually disrupted these sites in the TRAF1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis.

To examine the molecular basis of activity-dependent plasticity, we have used differential cloning techniques to identify genes that are rapidly induced in brain neurons by synaptic activity.

The extracellular domain of Arcadlin is most homologous to protocadherin-8; however, the cytoplasmic region is distinct from that of any cadherin family member. Arcadlin protein is expressed at the synapses and shows a homophilic binding activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, application of Arcadlin antibody reduces excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude and blocks long term potentiation in hippocampal slices. Its close homology with cadherins, its rapid inducibility by neural activity, and its involvement in synaptic transmission suggest that Arcadlin may play an important role in activity-induced synaptic reorganization underlying long term memory.

In contrast, long term memory can be distinguished from short term memory in that it requires new mRNA and protein synthesis (1Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). To analyze components of the gene expression program underlying long term memory in the vertebrate brain, we and others have employed differential cloning techniques to identify mRNAs that are rapidly induced by excitatory activity. In addition to transcription factors, this approach has identified a number of immediate early genes that encode enzymes that may directly modify cellular function, including tissue-plasminogen activator, cyclooxygenase-2, a novel small molecular weight G-protein, and a cytoskeleton-associated protein (2Qian Z.

These proteins presumably interact with neuronal proteins and indirectly affect long term changes in connections and the efficacy thereof. LTP1 provides a widely adopted mammalian model for activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy. The mechanisms contributing to long term changes in synaptic transmission are still contentious. Among many possibilities, one of the hypotheses that has been proposed is that neural activity could lead to modifications in synaptic structure and eventually changes in synaptic connectivity. In support of this idea, numerous morphological studies have provided evidence that neural activity such as kindling or electrical stimulation induces modifications in dendritic arborization, spine densities, or synaptic morphology (7Fifkova E. Van Harreveld A. J. Neurocytol. 1977; 6: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 8Lee K.S. Schottler F. Oliver M. Lynch G. J.

Adhesion molecules are known to be involved in many aspects of cell-cell interactions, including cell migration, axonal growth, pathfinding, sprouting, and regeneration (11Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 12Keynes R. Cook G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated that some adhesion molecules are expressed at the synapses and are involved in synaptic transmission. Kandel and colleagues (13Mayford M. Barzilai A. Keller F. Schacher S. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a cell adhesion molecule (apCAM) contributes to synaptic plasticity. In addition, studies using antibodies that interfere with the binding of L1 and the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) have shown that these molecules are required for LTP induction in the hippocampus (14Luthi A. Laurent J.P. Figurov A. Muller D. Schachner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 15Muller D. Wang C. Skibo G. Toni N. Cremer H. Calaora V. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z. Neuron. 1996; 17: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel cell adhesion molecule, Arcadlin, whose expression is tightly regulated by synaptic activity in brain neurons. As Arcadlin is a synaptic protein and binds to itself in a Ca2+-dependent manner, we have then asked whether blocking antibody affect synaptic transmission and LTP in hippocampal slices. A subtracted cDNA library was constructed as described (3Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). It was screened with 32P-labeled cDNA prepared by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from the hippocampus of control or seizure stimulated rats. Nearly full-length cDNAs and a genomic DNA clone of rat arcadlin were isolated by screening an unsubtracted, oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library and a rat genomic library, respectively. This procedure was performed as described previously (16Linzer D.I. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4271-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of total RNA/lane. The probe used for Northern analysis was 1.0-kilobase pair 3′-end fragment ofarcadlin cDNA. The cDNA fragment was labeled by the random priming technique using [α-32P]dCTP. Control and experimental tissues were frozen in the same tissue block to ensure identical conditions during tissue sectioning, subsequent storage, and in situhybridization. 35S- and digoxigenin-labeledarcadlin antisense riboprobes were prepared from an appropriately restricted plasmid containing the near full-length cDNA. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (17Saffen D.W. Cole A.J. Worley P.F. Christy B.A. Ryder K. Baraban J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7795-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Seizures were induced in adult male Wistar rats by maximal electro-convulsive seizure (MECS) using a constant-current signal generator (ECT Unit, UgoBasil, Italy) as described previously (18Cole A.J. Abu-Shakra S. Saffen D.W. Baraban J.M. Worley P.F. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1920-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For in vivo LTP studies, rats were implanted bilaterally with stimulating and recording electrodes in the perforant path and the hilus of the dentate gyrus as described previously (19Maru E. Ashida H. Tatsuno J. Brain Res. 1989; 478: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For in vitro LTP studies, hippocampal slices (500 μm) were prepared from rats (100–200 g) as described elsewhere (20Fujii S. Saito K. Miyakawa H. Ito K. Kato H. Brain Res. 1991; 555: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Two glass recording electrodes, one filled with Arcadlin IgGs (1, 15, 30 mg/ml) and the other with control IgG (30 mg/ml), were placed 1.0–1.6 mm apart in the molecular layer of the CA1 or dentate gyrus, and a bipolar stimulating electrode was fixed in the middle of the recording electrodes. The strength of the stimulus (duration, 200 μs) was adjusted to elicit a slope of field EPSP 40–60% of the maximum. The slice was left for more than 1 h to allow Arcadlin or control IgG to diffuse into neural tissues, observing response to a test stimulus given at 30-s intervals. 45 min after circulation of Ca2+-free solution, tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) was delivered to produce long term potentiation, and then the test stimulus was restored and the slope of field EPSP was recorded for 45 min. For evaluation, measured field EPSPs (f-EPSPs) were calculated as the ratio of the averaged responses after the end of Ca2+-free and after tetanus over the corresponding control values (b/a and c/b in Fig. 7 c) and expressed as percentage of change, respectively. The research protocol for rats used in this study was approved by the Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience for the animal experiments. Anti-Arcadlin rabbit polyclonal antisera were generated using either the extracellular (amino acids 31–730) or cytoplasmic (amino acids 774–972) region of Arcadlin as a glutathione S-transferase fusion. Both antisera detect a seizure-inducible 110-kDa protein in the hippocampus. For electrophysiological experiments, preimmune and antisera against EC domain were purified with Protein A-Sepharose. Cell adhesion experiments were carried out according to the method of Lemmon et al. (21Lemmon V. Farr K.L. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A nitrocellulose filter strip of 2 cm2 was dissolved in 4.8 ml of methanol and dried onto test dishes. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of test sample containing either 100 ng/ml BSA or the extracellular domain of Arcadlin were plated on the dried surface and incubated for 1 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The dishes were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Subconfluent monolayers of arcadlin transfectants or parent L929 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (−) (PBS(−)) and then treated with a solution containing 0.001% trypsin and 0.01 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected, dissociated by gentle pipetting, and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were kept on ice to inhibit aggregation. Aliquots of the cell suspension were placed on the test dishes with or without 1 mm Ca2+. To assess inhibition of adhesion by antibodies, the cell suspension was incubated with antibody at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml on ice for 30 min. Plated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, then washed four times with PBS(−), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Adhesion to the dishes was assayed by phase-contrast microscopy. Eight-week-old rats were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Whole brains were removed and placed in the fixative for 1 h and then into 15% sucrose for 12 h. Sections (50 μm) were cut using a sliding microtome, blocked, and permeabilized for 1 h in 1% milk and 5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Triton. Sections were incubated in primary antibody for 24 h, washed, and immunoperoxidase staining was performed with a Vectastain Elite ABC kit. Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 rat embryos as described (22Craig A.M. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Banker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12373-12377Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton, and stained with anti-Arcadlin antiserum and anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody. Arcadlin and synaptophysin were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, respectively. Differential and subtractive cloning techniques were used to identify mRNAs that were rapidly induced in the hippocampus by seizures. A novel cDNA corresponding to the 3′-noncoding region of an mRNA of about 4.5 kilobase was isolated. Nearly full-length cDNAs were then isolated by screening a seizure-stimulated rat hippocampal cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence encompassed the entire putative coding sequence that predicted a 972-amino acid protein (Fig. 1), with a calculated molecular mass of 103,749 Da, and a pI of 5.1. Hydropathy analysis (Kyte and Doolittle) identified an N-terminal hydrophobic domain, a single putative membrane-spanning segment, and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain. The predicted extracellular domain includes six subdomains with homology to cadherin repeats and is homologous (91%) to protocadherin-8 (Pcdh8) (Fig. 2), which also has six cadherin repeats (23Strehl S. Glatt K. Liu Q.M. Glatt H. Lalande M.A.D. Genomics. 1998; 53: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although arcadlinmay be a rat homologue of human pcdh8, the cytoplasmic region of Arcadlin lacks recognizable homology in the GenBank data base and is distinct from that of Pcdh8, because rat arcadlincDNAs lacked a 293-base pair exon coding the cytoplasmic region of Pcdh8 (Fig. 1). To ascertain whether arcadlin is a real splice variant of rat pcdh8, we tried to isolate apcdh8-type cDNA from the rat library; however, we failed to find any clone with this exon. All 62 clones we isolated from the rat library coded the identical cytoplasmic sequence to that of Arcadlin. Therefore, we may say that splicing of ratpcdh8/arcadlin pre-mRNA is different from that of human mRNA, resulting in the synthesis of Arcadlin form with a longer cytoplasmic domain.Figure 2Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of rat Arcadlin (r-Arcd) and human protocadherin 8 (h-Pcdh8).

In the hippocampus, the 4.5-kilobase message is induced within 30 min after MECS, peaks at 2 h, and remains elevated for as long as 8 h (Fig. 3, a and b). Rat presenilin-1 (PS1) mRNA was analyzed with the same blot as a control (Fig. 3,a and b). In situ analysis demonstrated arcadlin mRNA is dramatically increased in granule cells, and modestly induced in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus after MECS (Fig. 4a). The tetanic stimulus to the perforant pathway also inducedarcadlin in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (Fig.4 b), indicating that arcadlin induction occurs in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons during LTP. arcadlinmRNA is also expressed in structures during early development that subserved specific neuronal circuits, specifically the auditory, visual and limbic systems (Fig. 4, c–g). In the auditory circuit,arcadlin mRNA is prominently expressed in the inferior colliculus at embryonic day 17 (Fig. 4 c), and later in the medial geniculate and the auditory cortex at P0 (Fig. 4,d–g). At P0, arcadlin is also expressed in targets of retinal projections, such as the superior colliculus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (Fig.4, f and g). Furthermore, arcadlinmRNA is detected in selected structures of the limbic circuit, including the anterior limbic thalamic nuclei, the hippocampus, amygdala, and habenula (Fig. 4, d–f).Figure 4Physiological regulation and developmental expression of arcadlin mRNA. a, induction of arcadlin mRNA in the granule and pyramidal cells after MECS.

Cells were then tested for interaction with the extracellular domain of Arcadlin. Arcadlin was applied to nitrocellulose-coated dishes, and cell binding was examined by the method of Lemmon et al.(21Lemmon V. Farr K.L. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, the arcadlin-expressing cells (Fig. 5 d), but not the parental L cells (Fig.5 a), adhered to the Arcadlin-coated dishes. In the absence of Ca2+, arcadlin-expressing cells did not bind to the dishes (Fig. 5 c). Ca2+-dependent adhesion was blocked by preincubation of the coated dishes with Arcadlin antibody (Fig.5 f), but not with preimmune serum (Fig. 5 e). Neither the transfectants nor the parental cells adhered to the control dishes coated with BSA (Fig. 5 b). These data are consistent with functional studies of other cadherins and suggest that Arcadlin also possesses Ca2+-dependent homophilic binding activity. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that Arcadlin protein is expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex in adult rat brain (Fig. 6, a andc). Arcadlin immunostaining in the hippocampus markedly increased 4 h following a seizure with prominent staining of dendrites within the molecular layer (Fig. 6 b). Western blot with the same antibody showed an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa membrane protein is induced after a seizure (Fig. 6 d). We also examined Arcadlin immunostaining in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 6 e). Arcadlin is naturally expressed in hippocampal neurons and localized at both soma and synapses in association with the marker synaptophysin. These observations confirm that Arcadlin protein is dynamically regulated by neural activity and is localized at synapses. The Arcadlin antibody provides a tool to investigate the possible role of Arcadlin in the synaptic function of hippocampal neurons using the acute in vitro slice preparation. Arcadlin and control IgGs were infused into the dendritic regions of CA1 or dentate gyrus and f-EPSP was recorded. IgGs were purified with Protein A-Sepharose (Fig. 7 a), and they well diffused into the hippocampal tissue (Fig. 7 b). A comparison of the effect of Arcadlin and control IgG in the presence of Ca2+ indicated no obvious differences in f-EPSPs or LTPs induced by the tetanic stimulation (data not shown). Based on the premise that Arcadlin may be naturally present in a homophilic bound state in tissue, and therefore resistant to the blocking antibody, we examined the effect of administering the IgGs during a brief period of free Ca2+. As anticipated, synaptic responses in Ca2+-free medium were abolished. Upon restoration of Ca2+, evoked EPSPs in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus returned to near base-line level in slices that received control IgG but remained significantly reduced in slices treated the Arcadlin IgG (Fig. 7 c). Mean recoveries of EPSP were 91.8 ± 2.9% and 59.0 ± 9.3% (mean ± S.E., n = 7,p < 0.01; Fig. 7 d) with control and Arcadlin IgGs, respectively. Furthermore, tetanus failed to produce LTP in Arcadlin IgG-injected granule cells (Fig. 7 c,n = 5), while it induced LTP in 4 out of 5 slices in control IgG-treated regions (Fig. 7 c, n = 5). Magnitude of LTP recorded from CA1 was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner with Arcadlin IgG and significantly smaller than with control IgG (data not shown). The blocking effect of Arcadlin antibody on LTP is consistent with its partial block of EPSP and suggests that Arcadlin plays an important role in natural synaptic transmission. The cadherin superfamily is a large and extremely diverse group of calcium-dependent, membrane associated glycoproteins. Cadherins are involved in many aspects of cell-cell interactions, including axonal growth, pathfinding, and sprouting (24Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that some cadherins and catenin are localized in synaptic complexes and function as primary adhesive moieties between pre- and postsynaptic membranes (25Fannon D.R. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 26Uchida N. Honjo Y. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tang et al. demonstrated antibodies to N-cadherin or E-cadherin prevent LTP, suggesting that classical cadherins are involved in synaptic plasticity (27Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1165-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). More than 30 cadherins have been characterized, but so far no member of the family has been shown to be regulated by synaptic activity. We isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding a novel activity-regulated cadherin family member, termed Arcadlin.arcadlin mRNA is strongly induced in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex by non-epileptic,N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent synaptic stimuli in association with physiological synaptic enhancement. The alignment of the extracellular domain sequences of Arcadlin and Pcdh8 suggests possible common structural features of these domains, as is the case with classical cadherins. arcadlin may be a rat homologue of humanpcdh8; however, the cytoplasmic region of Arcadlin is clearly different from that of Pcdh8, because arcadlincDNA lacked the 293-base pair exon coding the cytoplasmic region of human Pcdh8. Then, we tried to isolate from the rat library apcdh8-type cDNA; however, we were not able to find any clone with this exon. Furthermore, as the antibody against the cytoplasmic region of Arcadlin recognizes an inducible 110-kDa protein (Fig. 6 d), it is clear that Arcadlin form really exists and is regulated in the rat brain. Therefore, splicing of ratpcdh8/arcadlin pre-mRNA may be distinct from that of human, resulting in the synthesis of Arcadlin form with a longer cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domains of classical cadherins play a key role in the cell-cell interaction through association with catenins. In addition, other adhesion molecules have been shown to participate in signal transduction pathways by interacting with activated receptors (28Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 29Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The distinct cytoplasmic region of Arcadlin suggests that it may be involved in different cell adhesion mechanisms and signal transduction pathways. Among other molecules induced in the hippocampus by seizures, Arc might be involved in the regulation of Arcadlin. As Arc protein is induced in a similar time course to that of Arcadlin after seizures and is associated with F-actin (6Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 433-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), Arc-actin complex might regulate the adhesive activity and signal transduction by interacting with the cytoplasmic region of Arcadlin. Based on this hypothesis, we are currently examining whether Arc can associate with the cytoplasmic region of Arcadlin. One important issue is whether or not Arcadlin functions as an adhesion molecule. Although protocadherin-1 and 2 show weak Ca2+-dependent homophilic binding activity, protocadherin-3, the third protocadherin member, did not show significant cell adhesion activity (30Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 31Sago H. Kitagawa M. Obata S. Mori N. Taketani S. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. Davidson M. St. John T. Suzuki S.T. Genomics. 1995; 29: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We first performed a cell aggregation assay to show the homophilic binding activity such as that seen with classical cadherin family members. Like other protocadherins, stable arcadlin transfectants did not form large aggregates in the culture medium. We therefore carried out a cell adhesion assay (Fig. 5). Stable arcadlin transfectants bound to the extracellular domain of Arcadlin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but not to a control protein, BSA. Antibodies to Arcadlin completely blocked this binding. Thus, the in vitro homophilic interaction of Arcadlin appears to be weaker than that of classical cadherins; however, Bradley et al. (32Bradley R.S. Espeseth A. Kintner C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 12: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar) recently showed thatXenopus NF-protocadherin can mediate cell-cell adhesion as strongly as classical cadherins in vivo. Considering the unique structural features and cell adhesion properties of Arcadlin, the cell adhesion mechanisms may be different from those of classical cadherins. It is also possible that Arcadlin may interact with different types of cell adhesion molecules, or even the possibility of a ligand/receptor-type interaction. We also investigated whether Arcadlin participates in synaptic transmission by treating hippocampal slices with Arcadlin antibodies. As they did not appear to affect LTP in the presence of Ca2+, we administered IgGs during a brief period of free Ca2+. Removal of Ca2+ results in a loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion (33Hyafil F. Babinet C. Jacob F. Cell. 1981; 26: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and a change in the structure of the cadherin extracellular domains from their native rodlike structure to a globular structure (34Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After free Ca2+ treatment, Arcadlin antibody attenuated basal synaptic transmission and completely inhibited LTP induction. Suppression of basal transmission might reflect an anti-adhesive effect of the blocking antibody on synapses; however, the induction of arcadlin mRNA during LTP and the complete inhibition of LTP by the antibody strongly suggests specific involvement of Arcadlin in LTP induction. In contrast to our findings, the recent paper from Schuman's laboratory (27Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1165-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) showed the block of LTP by the N- or E-cadherin antibodies without affecting natural synaptic transmission. They found an inhibition of LTP in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+; however, the elevation of extracellular Ca2+ to 5 mm abolished this inhibition. The argument is made that the Ca2+ level at the synapse decreases during periods of high frequency stimulation and that this destabilizes “nascent” interactions. While this notion is applicable to the case of Arcadlin, there are little data to support it so far. In the future, the generation of knock-out mice will help to clarify the specific involvement of adhesion molecules in LTP. Studies using antibodies or peptides that interfere with the binding of L1 and NCAM indicate that these molecules are also required for LTP induction (14Luthi A. Laurent J.P. Figurov A. Muller D. Schachner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 15Muller D. Wang C. Skibo G. Toni N. Cremer H. Calaora V. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z. Neuron. 1996; 17: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Moreover, NCAM expression is known to be regulated by synaptic activity; however, changes typically occur over the course of days in contrast to the 2–4-h kinetics of Arcadlin (35Schachner M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mechanism to order these inductive events is not clear yet, except that the immediate early gene transcription factor Zif268 regulates the expression of synapsin I gene (36Thiel G. Schoch S. Petersohn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While these transcription factors do not appear to bind to the promoter of NCAM gene, sequential induction of two kinds of adhesion molecules suggests that the rapid up-regulation of Arcadlin may selectively enhance synaptic contacts and provide a link between neural activity and subsequent actions of NCAM or constitutively expressed cadherins. Further studies of the molecular specificity of interaction, the subcellular targeting and possible signaling function of Arcadlin will be required to fully appreciate their role in the process of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.

GCAP-2 activates retinal guanylyl cyclases at low Ca2+ concentration (<100 nm) and inhibits them at high Ca2+ (>500 nm). The light-induced lowering of the Ca2+ level from ∼500 nm in the dark to ∼50 nm following illumination is known to play a key role in visual recovery and adaptation. We report here the three-dimensional structure of unmyristoylated GCAP-2 with three bound Ca2+ ions as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of recombinant, isotopically labeled protein. GCAP-2 contains four EF-hand motifs arranged in a compact tandem array like that seen previously in recoverin. The root mean square deviation of the main chain atoms in the EF-hand regions is 2.2 Å in comparing the Ca2+-bound structures of GCAP-2 and recoverin. EF-1, as in recoverin, does not bind calcium because it contains a disabling Cys-Pro sequence. GCAP-2 differs from recoverin in that the calcium ion binds to EF-4 in addition to EF-2 and EF-3. A prominent exposed patch of hydrophobic residues formed by EF-1 and EF-2 (Leu24, Trp27, Phe31, Phe45, Phe48, Phe49, Tyr81, Val82, Leu85, and Leu89) may serve as a target-binding site for the transmission of calcium signals to guanylyl cyclase.

The recoverin branch of the EF-hand superfamily includes neuronal Ca2+ sensors such as neurocalcin, frequenin, visinin, and hippocalcin (reviewed in Ref. 22Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is a homolog in yeast, 2K. Devlin, C. M. Churcher, B. G. Marrell, M. A. Rajandream, and S. V.

The members of this family have a myristoylated amino terminus and four EF-hands. They all contain a Cys-Pro sequence in EF-1 that prevents Ca2+ binding by this EF-hand. The three-dimensional structures of the myristoylated and unmyristoylated forms of recoverin in the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound states have been determined by x-ray crystallography (24Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (25Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T.

Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A striking feature of these structures is the large Ca2+-induced conformational change. The binding of Ca2+ to recoverin leads to the extrusion of its myristoyl group, which is highly sequestered in the Ca2+-free state, and to a large rotation of the two domains of the protein. The Ca2+-induced exposure of the myristoyl group, termed the calcium-myristoyl switch, enables recoverin to bind to membranes at high Ca2+ (27Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report here NMR spectroscopic studies of the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-bound form of GCAP-2 as a step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of regulation of photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases. Ideally, one would like to solve the structures of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound form of myristoylated GCAP-2, the physiologic species, but this is not yet feasible because of the low solubility of the myristoylated protein. We chose instead to solve the structure of Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated GCAP-2, which is soluble and gives clearly resolved NMR spectra. Moreover, the structure of the unmyristoylated form of GCAP-2 is likely to be biologically pertinent. Unmyristoylated GCAP-2 is nearly as effective as myristoylated GCAP-2 in activating guanylyl cyclase at low Ca2+ and inhibiting it at high Ca2+ (29Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B.

Hence, structural studies of unmyristoylated GCAP-2 should reveal the Ca2+-induced conformational changes underlying its regulation of cyclase. Unmyristoylated recombinant GCAP-2 protein uniformly labeled with nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS using pET11d vector (Novagen) grown in M9 minimal medium (containing15N-labeled NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose) according to previously published procedures (29Olshevskaya E.V.

In addition, anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed at pH 6.1 and at room temperature. GCAP-2 eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column (50-ml bed volume) using a salt gradient (0–0.5 m KCl over 60 min at flow rate, 2 ml min−1). Samples for NMR experiments were prepared by dissolving15N-labeled or 13C/15N-labeled GCAP-2 (1 mm) in 0.5 ml of a 95% H2O, 5%2H2O or 99% 2H2O solution containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm[2H10]dithiothreitol, 25 mm[2H28]octyl β-glucoside at pH 6.8. All NMR experiments were performed at 45 °C on a Varian UNITY-plus 500 or UNITY-600 spectrometer equipped with a four channel interface and a triple resonance probe with an actively shielded z gradient together with a pulse field gradient accessory. The 15N-1H HSQC spectra (Fig. 2) (and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence-J) were recorded on the uniformly 15N-labeled GCAP-2 sample (95% H2O, 5% 2H2O). The number of complex points and acquisition times were 256, 180 ms (15N (F1)) and 512, 64 ms (1H (F2)). The exchange rates of amide protons were measured as described previously (31Ames J.B.

The triple resonance spectra were analyzed as described previously (31Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10743-10753Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and provided a nearly complete sequence-specific assignment of the backbone resonances. The side chain resonances were assigned as described (30Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Kainosho M. Stryer L. Ikura M. J. Biomol.

Structure calculations from residues 2–190 were performed using the YASAP protocol (32Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M.

A total of 1791 interproton distance restraints (552 intraresidue, 455 sequential, 280 short range, and 350 long range) was obtained as described (30Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Kainosho M. Stryer L. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) by the analysis of 13C-edited (and15N-edited) nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC spectra (100 ms mixing time) recorded on13C/15N-labeled GCAP-2 (in 99%2H2O for 13C-edited experiments) or15N-labeled GCAP-2 (in 95% H2O for15N-edited) with the following number of complex points and acquisition times: 1H (F1) 128, 25.6 ms;13C (F2) 32 10.6 ms; 15N (F2) 32, 23.7 ms; 1H (F3) 416, 52 ms. In addition to the nuclear Overhauser effect-derived distance restraints, 18 distance restraints involving Ca2+ bound to loop residues 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 in EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4 (24Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 35Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); 136 distance restraints for 68 hydrogen bonds; and 216 dihedral angle restraints (114 φ and 102 ψ) were included in the structure calculation. 50 independent structures were calculated, and 22 of those with the lowest total energy were selected. The average total and experimental distance energies are 4083 and 65 kcal mol−1(calculated with the use of square-well potentials with a force constant of 50 kcal mol−1 Å2). None of the distance and angle restraints were violated by more than 0.40 Å and 4.0°. The average root mean square (RMS) deviations from an idealized geometry for bonds, angles, and impropers are 0.00731 Å, 2.04°, and 0.91°, respectively. Tryptophan fluorescence titrations (Fig. 3) were performed with 1 μmGCAP-2 in 2 ml of 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C. The free calcium concentration (30 nm to 2 μm) was set using an EGTA buffer system. The protein samples initially contained an equal molar ratio of total Ca2+ and EGTA (2 mm); the free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted by adding aliquots of 0.1 m EGTA. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated based on the total amount of Ca2+ and EGTA present using the computer algorithm by Brooks and Storey (37Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The calculated free Ca2+ concentrations agreed closely with measured Ca2+ concentrations using fluorescent indicator dyes fluo-3 and rhod-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) withK d of 0.4 and 1.0 μm, respectively (38Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Ca2+-binding curves (Fig. 3) were obtained by the equilibrium dialysis method using a Dispo-equilibrium Biodialyzer (Sialomed, Columbia, MD). The apparatus consisted of two fluid-containing chambers (protein and buffer chambers) separated by a thin dialysis membrane (molecular mass cutoff, 10 kDa). The protein chamber contained 100 μl of 50 μm GCAP-2 in the same buffer used in the fluorescence titration above plus the addition of 1 μm45Ca2+ (total radioactivity, 1.4 μCi). The buffer chamber contained 100 μl of buffer (excluding any GCAP-2) plus the addition of a known amount of cold Ca2+. The fluid in the two chambers was allowed to come to equilibrium after 12 h at 25 °C. Fifteen different dialysis experiments were performed at various cold Ca2+concentrations (0, 1, 2, 10, 20, 25, 35, 45, 65, 100, 125, 140, 150, 160, 170 μm). At equilibrium, the free Ca2+concentration is defined by Cafree2+=Catot2+rbrpEquation 1 where Ca tot2+ is the total Ca2+ concentration in the system, rbis the radioactivity (counts/min) of 45Ca2+measured from an aliquot of the buffer chamber, andrp is the radioactivity measured from an equal aliquot of the protein chamber. The concentration of Ca2+bound to protein is as follows. Cabound2+=Catot2+−Cafree2+Equation 2 The fractional saturation is then defined as Y=PboundPtot=(Cafree2+)α(Cafree2+)α+KdαEquation 3 where P tot is the total protein concentration in the system, P bound is the concentration of protein species bound by Ca2+, α is the Hill coefficient, and K d is the apparent dissociation constant. The structure of recombinant GCAP-2 uniformly labeled with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 was studied by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (15N-1H HSQC) NMR spectra, which serve as fingerprints of the conformation of main chain and side chain amide groups, were obtained. The HSQC spectra of unmyristoylated GCAP-2 are presented in Fig. 2. The Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated protein exhibits many sharp and well resolved peaks. In contrast, the Ca2+-free form exhibits broad and poorly resolved peaks, suggesting that Ca2+-free GCAP-2 may represent an unfolded, aggregated protein. However, circular dichroism studies (data not shown) indicate that Ca2+-free GCAP-2 is well folded with greater than 60% helical content. In addition, the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 sample used in the NMR study is biologically active and was shown to activate photoreceptor guanylate cyclase. Hence, Ca2+-free GCAP-2 in our study represents a well defined and folded protein. The observed broadening of the NMR peaks suggests that Ca2+-free GCAP-2 most likely forms a dimer or other multimeric species under the conditions of the NMR experiment. The HSQC spectrum of Ca2+-free myristoylated protein (data not shown) is similar to that of Ca2+-free unmyristoylated protein. The low solubility of the Ca2+-bound myristoylated protein prevented us from obtaining its HSQC spectrum. The striking Ca2+-induced spectral differences point to a large Ca2+-induced structural change in the unmyristoylated protein. The characteristic NMR peaks of the Ca2+-bound form saturate on addition of three molar equivalents of Ca2+ to the protein. Ca2+-binding measurements using equilibrium dialysis and tryptophan fluorescence titrations also showed that three Ca2+ bind to unmyristoylated GCAP-2 (Fig.3). The apparent affinity is 300 ± 40 nm, and the Hill coefficient is 2.1 ± 0.2. A stoichiometry of three Ca2+ bound to GCAP-2 is also supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies of the EF-hand motifs (16Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Substituting glutamine for glutamate at position 12 of the EF-hand loops (EF-2, EF-3, EF-4) prevents the binding of Ca2+ and produces a constitutively active form of GCAP-2. The strong and well resolved peaks observed in the HSQC spectrum of Ca2+-bound, unmyristoylated GCAP-2 (Fig. 2 B) suggested that it would be feasible to determine its three-dimensional structure. To elucidate the structure, resonances in the NMR spectrum were assigned to specific amino acid residues. Triple resonance experiments correlating 15N, 13C, and1H were performed to facilitate making assignments. Over 95% of the backbone resonances were assigned as indicated in Fig.2 B. These backbone assignments served as the basis for assigning about 80% of the side chain resonances. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments were analyzed to establish nearly 2000 proton-proton distance relationships (∼11 nuclear Overhauser effects/residue) throughout the protein. In addition, 216 dihedral angle restraints (φ and ψ) were deduced from J-coupling and chemical shift data. Finally, the three-dimensional structure was calculated by distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics. A superposition of 22 structures of Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated GCAP-2 consistent with the NMR data is shown in Fig.4, and their average is depicted as a ribbon diagram (Fig. 5 A) and a space-filling model (Fig. 5 B). The entire polypeptide chain has been traced except for the disordered region at the carboxyl terminus (residues 191–204). The structure near the amino terminus (residues 2–18) and the region between EF-3 and EF-4 (residues 132–144) are rather poorly defined (the RMS deviation of the main chain atoms is greater than 2 Å) because of a relatively small number of nuclear Overhauser effect contacts observed in these regions. Also, chemical shift data indicate a structurally disordered, random coil secondary structure in most of these regions.Figure 5Schematic ribbon representation (A) and space-filling model (B) of the energy-minimized average structure of unmyristoylated GCAP-2 with three Ca2+ bound. The side chain atoms of residues at the domain interface (Ala63, Ala67, Ile103, and Ile120) are shown in Aand the color scheme is as in Fig. 4. The figure was generated using Molscript (49Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3d (23Bacon D.J. Anderson W.F. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 219-220Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GCAP-2 is a compact protein (radius of gyration, 17 Å) made of two domains separated by a flexible linker (Fig. 5). Each domain contains a pair of EF-hands, the 29-residue helix-loop-helix motifs (highlighted in color in Fig. 1) found in calmodulin, troponin C, parvalbumin, recoverin, and other members of the superfamily (39Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The EF-hands are defined from the amino terminus: EF-1 (Ala22-Val51), EF-2 (Thr58-Leu87), EF-3 (Leu96-Lys126), and EF-4 (Glu147-Arg176). EF-1 and EF-2 interact intimately to form the NH2-terminal domain, and EF-3 and EF-4 form the COOH-terminal domain. The entering helix of EF-2 (residues 58–68) packs against the helices of EF-3 (residues 96–104 and 114–127) at the interface between the two domains forming a cleft. Two additional α-helices occur near the amino terminus (residues 7–13) and carboxyl terminus (residues 180–186). There are two pairs of short β-strands at the interfaces between pairs of EF-hands (β-strands are located at residues 39–41 (EF-1), 75–77 (EF-2), 111–113 (EF-3), and 164–166 (EF-4)). The linker between the domains is U-shaped, which positions the four EF-hands in a compact tandem array like that found in recoverin and unlike the dumbbell arrangement found in calmodulin (35Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and troponin C (40Herzberg O. James M.N. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Indeed, the overall folding of Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated GCAP-2 closely resembles that of Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated recoverin (24Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), Ca2+-bound myristoylated recoverin (25Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and the very recent crystal structure of Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated neurocalcin (36Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A superposition of the main chain structures of unmyristoylated, Ca2+-bound GCAP-2 (red), recoverin (blue), and neurocalcin (green) are shown in Fig. 6. The RMS deviation of the main chain atoms (in the EF-hand motifs) is 2.2 Å in comparing GCAP-2 to recoverin and 2.0 Å in comparing GCAP-2 to neurocalcin. Three Ca2+ are bound to GCAP-2, as anticipated on the basis of its amino acid sequence and site-directed mutagenesis. The structure of EF-3 is strikingly similar to that of EF-3 in Ca2+-bound recoverin and calmodulin. The RMS deviations of the 116 main chain atoms of EF-3 are 0.66 Å in comparing GCAP-2 with recoverin and 0.80 Å in comparing GCAP-2 with calmodulin. Likewise, the coordination of Ca2+ is virtually identical in all three. The interhelical angle or helix packing angle of EF-3 is 94° (GCAP-2), 95° (recoverin), and 96° (calmodulin). The structures of EF-1, EF-2, and EF-4 from GCAP-2 are somewhat different from the corresponding EF-hands of recoverin. The RMS deviations of the main chain atoms of these EF-hands are 1.9 Å (EF-1), 1.4 Å (EF-2), and 1.9 Å (EF-4) in comparing GCAP-2 with recoverin. The interhelical angles are 108° (EF-1), 109° (EF-2), and 98° (EF-4) for GCAP-2 compared with 115° (EF-2), 118° (EF-3), and 92° (EF-4) for Ca2+-bound recoverin. The four EF-hands of GCAP-2 assume the “open conformation” of Ca2+-occupied EF-hands seen in recoverin, calmodulin, and troponin C. The structures of the 12-residue Ca2+-binding loop of the EF-hands are depicted in Fig. 7. The loop of EF-1 is quite similar to that of recoverin and again shows why this motif does not bind Ca2+. EF-1 is distorted from a favorable Ca2+-binding geometry by Pro36 at the fourth position of the 12-residue loop. Also, the third residue in the loop (Cys35) is not suitable for ligating Ca2+. The bulky sulfhydryl group sterically blocks the entry of Ca2+. The EF-2 loop adopts a favorable structure for binding Ca2+, despite the tight turn centered at Asn74 (position 6 of the loop). Normally, a glycine residue is conserved at position 6 in most other EF-hands (Fig. 1). The loop of EF-3 is very typical of Ca2+-occupied EF-hands and closely resembles the EF-3 loop of recoverin and calmodulin. The EF-4 loop of GCAP-2 is quite different from that of recoverin. In recoverin, the second residue in the loop (Lys161) forms a salt bridge with residue 12 (Glu171) that disables Ca2+binding. In GCAP-2, the second residue of the EF-4 loop (Glu159) is negatively charged and cannot form a salt bridge that would impede Ca2+ binding. Furthermore, residues 1 and 3 of the EF-4 loop (Asp158 and Asn160) contain oxygen atoms in their side chains that can ligate Ca2+, in contrast with the corresponding residues of recoverin (Gly160 and Lys162). Thus, Ca2+ binds to EF-4 similarly to EF-2 and EF-3. GCAP-2 has a solvent-exposed, hydrophobic surface formed by residues from EF-1 and EF-2 (Fig. 8 A). The exposed patch of hydrophobic residues is formed by the clustering of several aromatic side chains (Trp27, Phe31, Phe45, Phe48, Phe49, and Tyr81) and several aliphatic residues (Leu24, Leu40, Ile76, Val82, Leu85, and Leu89) (Fig. 8 B). These exposed hydrophobic residues are highly conserved in members of the family (22Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Cr"

Such growth factors as NGF and interleukin-3 are presumed to promote cell survival as a consequence of the PI3K-mediated activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt, which in turn phosphorylates BAD (3Songyang Z.

Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). It is postulated that by binding to Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 BAD antagonizes their antiapoptotic activity. Upon inducing its phosphorylation, growth factors lead to the dissociation of BAD from Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and thereby promote cell survival by allowing the unhindered action of these proteins. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin enhanced the activation of caspase-3 that was induced by TNF or anti-Fas (8Fujita E. Kouroku Y. Miho Y. Tsukahara T. Ishiura S. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that TNF acts like other growth factors to promote the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-136. As a result, there is the translocation of BAD from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Moreover, the phosphorylation of BAD by TNF occurs by a PI3K-dependent pathway and is necessary to prevent the cytotoxicity of this cytokine. Inhibition of PI3K prevents both the phosphorylation of BAD and its translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol, effects that are accompanied by substantially enhanced cell killing by TNF. HeLa cells (ATCC-CC-1, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 25 cm2 polystyrene flasks (Corning Costar Corp., Oneonta, NY) with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose, without pyruvate) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, all incubated under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For transient transfections, HeLa cells were plated at one-third of confluency (3.0 × 104 cells/cm2) in 24-well plates. After overnight incubation, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine-Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies of 25–30% were routinely obtained, as assessed by β-galactosidase staining. For experiments, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ and 5 μg of either pCDNA, pCDNA3-myc-Δp85 (referred to as pCDNA-PI3K(−) (generously provided by Dr. Julian Downward, ICRF, London), pCDNA-Akt(+) or pCDNA-Akt(−) (generously provided by Dr. Morris J. Birnbaum and Dr. Randall N. Pittman, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Julian Downward, ICRF, London), or pCDNA-BclXL. After 4 h the cells were washed twice with PBS and placed in complete DMEM. After 48 h of further incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and placed in DMEM minus serum. After 30 min the cells were then treated with various reagents as described in the text. Experiments were performed 2 days after plating 1.0 × 105 cells in 500 μl of complete DMEM into 1.88 cm2 wells of a 24-well plate. By the second day the cells were growing exponentially and had achieved a density of 2.5–3.0 × 105 cells/well. Before treatment the cells were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, after which 500 μl of DMEM without serum were added. Cell viability was determined by the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue. 10 μl of a 0.5% solution of trypan blue were added to the wells. Both viable and nonviable cells were counted for each data point in a total of eight microscopic fields. Cell viability for transiently transfected cells was assessed by counting the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells in wells transfected with pCDNA-LacZ and either pCDNA, pCDNA-PI3K(−), pCDNA-Akt(−), pCDNA-Akt(+), or pCDNA-Bcl-XL as described above. The number of β-galactosidase-positive cells in untreated wells was then compared with the number in wells treated with either TNF alone, wortmannin alone, LY294002 alone, TNF plus wortmannin, or TNF plus LY294002. Cotransfection of 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ and 5 μg of the above outlined constructs gave similar transfection efficiencies (10–15%) and number of β-galactosidase-positive cells/well (2500–3000 cells/well) The assay is based on the ability of the active enzyme to cleave the chromophore pNA from the enzyme substrate DEVD-p-nitroanilide. Cell extracts were diluted 1:1 with 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). DEVD-p-nitroanilide was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance measurements were made in a 96-well plate reader at 405 nm. Cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks at 5.0 × 106 cells/flask. After treatment, the cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once in PBS and then resuspended in 3 volumes of isolation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin in 250 mm sucrose). After chilling on ice for 3 min, the cells were disrupted by 40 strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 2,500 × g at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondria were then pelleted by centifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and filtered through 0.2-μm and then 0.1-μm Ultrafree MC filters (Millipore) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to give cytosolic protein. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (25 μg of protein) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Phospho-BAD-136, phospho-BAD-112, and BAD were detected by rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (New England Biolabs). Secondary goat antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (1:2000) was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. At the end of the specified incubation time, cells (15–20 × 106/sample) were collected by centrifuging at 359 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing once with PBS, the cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer A. After 10 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.5%, and the suspension was centrifuged at 1330 × g for 15 min. The resultant nuclear pellet was suspended in 15 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice with vigorous stirring, the suspension was centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 10 min. Fifteen μl of the resultant supernatant was diluted with 75 μl of buffer C (20 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to obtain the final nuclear extract preparation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays for NFκB in nuclei was performed by using the gel shift assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture contained 2 μl of 5× gel shift binding buffer, 1 μl of 32P-labeled NFκB consensus oligonucleotide probe, 2 μl of water, and 5 μl of nuclear extract (1 μg of protein). Relative band densities were obtained by densitometric analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human recombinant TNF (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS and added for the times indicated to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Wortmannin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added at a 0.2% volume to a final concentration of 50 nm. LY294002 was dissolved in Me2SO and added at a 0.2% volume to a final concentration of 10 μm. Rapamycin was dissolved in Me2SO and added at a 0.2% volume to a final concentration of 50 nm. In all experiments the cells were pretreated for 30 min with wortmannin, LY294002, or rapamycin before the addition of TNF. Control experiments demonstrated that Me2SO at the concentration used was without measurable effect on the parameters examined. Protein synthesis was measured as the incorporation of [3H]leucine into an acid-insoluble precipitate as described previously (9Mizumoto K. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 890-895PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells maintained a basal level of phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-136 (Fig.1 a, left panel). Within 30 min of treatment with TNF, however, there was a marked increase in BAD phosphorylation (phospho-BAD-136), an effect that increased further to reach a maximum within 2 h (Fig.1 a, left panel). The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin totally inhibited the induction by TNF of BAD phosphorylation at Ser-136 (Fig. 1 a, right panel). In fact, there was a progressive decrease in the content of phospho-BAD-136 in the presence of both TNF and wortmannin over the 2 h time course of the experiment. Importantly, treatment of HeLa cells with either TNF alone or TNF together with wortmannin produced no change in the total content of BAD (Fig. 1 b, left and right panel, respectively). In addition, no staining was detected when an antibody was used against the Ser-112-phosphorylated form of BAD, either in control, TNF, or TNF and wortmannin-treated cells (data not shown). The HeLa cells were fractionated to assess simultaneously the content of BAD and phospho-BAD-136 in the cytosol and mitochondria. TNF induced a progressive increase in the level of phospho-BAD-136 in the cytosolic fraction over a 2-h time course (Fig.2 a, left panel). As opposed to the situation in whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 b), this change was mirrored in a concomitant increase in the total content of BAD in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2 b, left panel). Both of these effects were prevented by inhibition of PI3K (Fig. 2, a and b, right panel). With TNF alone, the mitochondria exhibited a marked decrease in the content of total BAD (Fig. 3, left panel) at the same time that the content of phospho-BAD-136 and total BAD increased in the cytosol. Again the decrease of mitochondrial-associated BAD induced by TNF was prevented by PI3K inhibition (Fig. 3, right panel). Neither the Ser-136 nor Ser-112 form of BAD was detected in the mitochondrial fraction of either TNF or TNF and wortmannin-treated cells. (data not shown).Figure 3The depletion of BAD associated with the mitochondria induced by TNF is prevented by wortmannin. HeLa cells (5.0 × 106) were either treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) alone or pretreated for 30 min with 50 nm wortmannin followed by the addition of TNF. At the times indicated, mitochondria were prepared, and the levels of BAD-P136 and BAD were determined by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TNF alone killed few HeLa cells over a 6-h time course (Fig.4 a, closed squares). As measured by trypan blue uptake, less than 9% of the cells were dead after 4 h, and after 6 h, only 11% of the cells had died. By contrast, cells pretreated for 30 min with 50 nm wortmannin and then exposed to TNF exhibited substantial cell killing (Fig. 4 a, closed circles). After 4 h, more than 40% of the cells were dead. Cell killing reached almost 70% after 6 h. Importantly, wortmannin alone (in the absence of TNF) had no effect on the viability of the HeLa cells after 6 h (Fig. 4 a, closed triangles). The resistance of cells to the cytotoxicity of TNF has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NFκB (10Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). The dependence of the killing produced by TNF on an inhibition of either transcription or translation is interpreted in turn as a consequence of the inhibition of the expression of factors induced by NFκB that promote cell survival. Accordingly, it was possible that wortmannin potentiates the cytotoxicity of TNF by similarly inhibiting the activation of NFκB. As shown in Fig. 5, within 30 min of exposure to TNF, activation of NFκB was readily detectable. Wortmannin alone did not activate NFκB, and a pretreatment with wortmannin followed by exposure to TNF did not inhibit the activation of NFκB (Fig. 5). As noted above, the cytotoxicity of TNF is enhanced upon inhibition of protein synthesis by such agents as cycloheximide. Table Idocuments that the incorporation of [3H]leucine was 98% of the control value after a 6-h exposure to wortmannin. By contrast, 1 μm of cycloheximide reduced the incorporation of [3H]leucine to 5% of the control value.Table IWortmannin does not inhibit protein synthesis in HeLa cellsTreatment (6 h)[3H]Leucine incorporation% of controlWortmannin 50 nm98 ± 7Cycloheximide 1 μm5 ± 2HeLa cells were treated either with wortmannin or cycloheximide.

The data represent the mean ±S.D. of the average of triplicate wells from three separate experiments. Like wortmannin, LY294002 is an inhibitor of PI3K (11Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TableII shows that 10 μm of LY294002 produced only minimal toxicity in the absence of TNF. However, like wortmannin, in the presence of TNF and LY294002, there was substantial cell killing with more than 90% of cells dead after 6 h. In the same study, TNF alone killed only 15% of the cells (TableII). Rapamycin is an inhibitor of p70S6 kinase, an enzyme that is a downstream target of Akt (12Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Unlike wortmannin and LY294002, however, rapamycin did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of TNF (14% dead cells after 6 h of treatment with rapamycin and TNF). This result suggests that p70S6 kinase is not responsible for exerting the antiapoptotic effect of Akt stimulation under the conditions of TNF treatment.Table IIInhibition of p70S6 kinase does not potentiate TNF-induced cytotoxicity% Dead CellsControlTNFRapamycin (50 nm)95 ± 791 ± 9LY294002 (10μm)93 ± 430 ± 8HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then washed 2× with PBS and placed in DMEM (− serum). Rapamycin or wortmannin were then added at the indicated concentrations either alone or followed 30 min later by TNF. Six h later cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then washed 2× with PBS and placed in DMEM (− serum). Rapamycin or wortmannin were then added at the indicated concentrations either alone or followed 30 min later by TNF. Six h later cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. To further confirm that the potentiation seen with wortmannin is a consequence of the inhibition of PI3K, the effect was determined of transiently transfecting HeLa cells with a PI3K dominant negative mutant, as well as with mutants of Akt that are either constitutively active or kinase-defective (dominant negative). HeLa cells were cotransfected with pCDNA-LacZ and either pCDNA, pCDNA-PI3K(−), pCDNA-Akt(+), or pCDNA-Akt(−). Cell death induced by TNF was measured by a reduction in the number of cells expressing β-galactosidase relative to that obtained in untreated transfected cultures. Cotransfection with pCDNA-LacZ and either the empty vector or one of the constructs gave similar transfection efficiencies and numbers of β-galactosidase-positive cells (data not shown), a result indicating that the constructs alone did not decrease cell viability. Transfection with a dominant negative inhibitor of PI3K resulted in only 37% of the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells after 6 h of exposure to TNF as compared with untreated control wells. By contrast, in cells cotransfected with the empty vector, treatment with TNF alone had little effect on the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells. Thus, transfection with a dominant negative mutant of PI3K potentiated like wortmannin the cytotoxicity of TNF. Similarly, a dominant negative inhibitor of Akt, the downstream target of PI3K, also potentiated the cytotoxicity of TNF, with only 31% of the cells staining positive for β-galactosidase as compared with untreated controls (Table III). By contrast, transfection with a constitutively active Akt mutant protected against the cytotoxicity induced by TNF in the presence of wortmannin. Cotransfection with pCDNA-LacZ and pCDNA-Akt(+) resulted in 86% of cells staining positive for β-galactosidase in the presence of TNF and wortmannin as compared with untreated wells. In cultures cotransfected with pCDNA-LacZ and pCDNA, only 27% of cells stained positive for β-galactosidase upon treatment with TNF and wortmannin as compared with the untreated wells. Thus expression of the constitutively active Akt is able to bypass the block at PI3K signaling brought about by wortmannin.Table IIIDominant negative inhibitors of PI3-kinase and Akt potentiate and constitutively active Akt inhibits TNF-induced cytotoxicityβ-Galactosidase-positive cellsTNFTNF + wortmannin% of controlpCDNA-LacZ+pCDNA98 ± 827 ± 5pCDNA-LacZ+PI3K(−)37 ± 928 ± 9pCDNA-LacZ+Akt(−)31 ± 827 ± 10pCDNA-LacZ+Akt(+)98 ± 786 ± 6HeLa cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ and 5 μg of one of the indicated constructs. 48 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with TNF alone or TNF and wortmannin for 6 h. Cells were then stained for β-galactosidase, and the number of blue cells was counted. Results are the mean ±S.D. from two experiments. Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ and 5 μg of one of the indicated constructs. 48 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with TNF alone or TNF and wortmannin for 6 h. Cells were then stained for β-galactosidase, and the number of blue cells was counted. Results are the mean ±S.D. from two experiments. It is hypothesized that the increased cytotoxicity of TNF upon inhibition of PI3K relates to the inhibition of BAD phosphorylation by Akt and its subsequent dissociation from antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL. It was of interest, therefore, to explore the effect of the overexpression of Bcl-XL in HeLa cells on the cytotoxicity of TNF in the presence of the PI3K inhibitors used above. TableIV shows the results of the transient transfection of HeLa cells with a Bcl-XL expression vector (pCDNA-BclXL). Treatment of cells cotransfected with pCDNA-LacZ and pCDNA with TNF in the presence of either wortmannin or LY294002 resulted in only 33 and 29%, respectively, of the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells as compared with untreated wells. By contrast, overexpression of Bcl-XLafforded significant protection against the cytotoxicity induced by TNF in the presence of either wortmannin or LY294002. In cultures cotransfected with pCDNA-LacZ and pCDNA-BclXL and treated with TNF and either wortmannin or LY294002, 85 and 81%, respectively, of the cells stained positive for β-galactosidase as compared with untreated wells.Table IVTNF-induced cytotoxicity by PI3-kinase inhibition is prevented by Bcl-XLβ-Galactosidase (+) cellsTNF + wortmanninTNF + LY294002% of controlpCDNA-LacZ+pCDNA33 ± 1229 ± 9pCDNA-LacZ+Bcl-XL85 ± 1381 ± 10HeLa cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ and 5 μg of pCDNA-Bcl-XL. 48 h post-transfection cells were either left untreated or treated with TNF and LY294002 or TNF and wortmannin for 6 h. Cells were then stained for β-galactosidase, and the number of blue cells was counted. Results are the mean ±S.D. from two experiments. Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ and 5 μg of pCDNA-Bcl-XL. 48 h post-transfection cells were either left untreated or treated with TNF and LY294002 or TNF and wortmannin for 6 h. Cells were then stained for β-galactosidase, and the number of blue cells was counted. Results are the mean ±S.D. from two experiments. The cytotoxicity data were mirrored by the activity of the apoptotic protease caspase-3. Treatment of HeLa cells with TNF alone resulted in a 1.5-fold increase over the control value in the activity of caspase-3 (Fig. 4 b, closed squares). By contrast, the combination of TNF and wortmannin produced a 12-fold increase in the activity of caspase-3 after 6 h (Fig.4 b, closed circles). Again, wortmannin alone (in the absence of TNF) had no effect on caspase-3 activity (Fig.4 b, closed triangles). We have shown that BAD is phosphorylated on Ser-136 in response to the treatment of HeLa cells with TNF. This phosphorylation is accompanied by the translocation of BAD from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Importantly, the phosphorylation and translocation of BAD occurs in the absence of any cell killing by TNF. In turn, inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin prevented both the phosphorylation and translocation of BAD, a result that was now reflected in substantial cell killing in response to TNF. Transient transfection with a PI3K dominant negative mutant or a dominant negative mutant of the serine-threonine kinase Akt, the downstream target of PI3K and the enzyme that phosphorylates BAD, similarly potentiated the cytotoxicity of TNF. By contrast, transfection with a constitutively active Akt mutant protected against the cytotoxicity of TNF in the presence of wortmannin. Phosphorylation of BAD prevents its interaction with the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Transfection with a Bcl-XL expression vector protected against the cytotoxicity of TNF in the presence of wortmannin. Two concerns, at least, are raised by these results. First, the mechanism of PI3K activation by TNF needs to be considered. Second, we need to address the mechanism by which BAD phosphorylation promotes cell survival or, alternatively, the mechanism by which inhibition of BAD phosphorylation promotes cell killing. The TNF superfamily of receptors includes, in addition to the two TNF receptors (TNF-R1 and TNF-R2), the Fas receptor (CD95), CD40, the lymphotoxin β-receptor, and nerve growth factor (13Ware C.F. VanArsdale S. VanArsdale T.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NGF and anti-CD40 have also been shown to activate PI3K (14Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Heldman K.A. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Durandy A. Hivorz C. Mazerolles F. Schiff C.

Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The exposure of PC-12 cells to NGF causes their differentiation (14Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Heldman K.A. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin or with a dominant negative mutant of PI3K inhibited the neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells that was induced by NGF, an effect that was accompanied by the death by apoptosis of the cells. In this regard, it is noteworthy that interleukin-2 and -3 and insulin-like growth factor-I promoted cell survival by a mechanism that depended on activation of PI3K (1Ahmed N.N. Grimes L.H.

Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative inhibitor of PI3K was able to potentiate TNF-induced cytotoxicity as did wortmannin or LY294002. In addition, the ability of a dominant negative inhibitor of Akt and constitutively active Akt to potentiate and inhibit TNF-induced cell killing, respectively, most likely means that it is Akt activation by PI3-kinase that is critical for inhibition of TNF-induced cytotoxicity and not PI3-kinase activity per se. The precise mechanism by which the cell surface receptors for any of these agents (TNF, NGF, interleukin-2) trigger the activation of PI3K is not fully understood. The increase in PI3K upon the activation of the CD40 receptor was independent of the activation of NF-κB and, thus, would not seem to depend on the action of Traf2 (15Durandy A. Hivorz C. Mazerolles F. Schiff C. Bernard F. Jouanguy E. Revy P. DiSanto J.P. Gauchat J.F. Bonnefoy J.Y. Casanova J.L. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2576-2584PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that PI3K may be activated by Ras (18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 19Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, there is at present little evidence of a connection between TNF and Ras. Thus, the mechanism of PI3K activation by TNF remains enigmatic and a focus of our current efforts. By contrast, a mechanism can be readily proposed by which the phosphorylation of BAD promotes the survival of cells exposed to TNF. We have shown previously that the cytotoxicity of TNF depends on induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) (21Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, we can rephrase our concern as the mechanism by which BAD phosphorylation prevents induction of the MPT in cells exposed to TNF. The overexpression of the proapoptotic protein Bax killed Jurkat cells as a consequence of induction of the MPT (22Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and purified Bax induced the MPT in isolated mitochondria in vitro. 2J. G. Pastorino and J. L. Farber, submitted for publication. Bax, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 are present constitutively in HeLa cells. 3M. Tafani and J. G. Pastorino, unpublished observations. Bax is located in the cytosol and upon the initiation of the apoptotic process, has been reported to translocate to the mitochondria (23Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 24Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that upon treatment with TNF the phosphorylation of BAD prevents its interaction with Bcl-XL or Bcl-2, thereby allowing these proteins to complex with Bax (Fig. 6). When Bax is bound to either Bcl-XL or Bcl-2, it would be incapable of inducing the MPT and, thus, of killing the cells. Conversely, when the phosphorylation of BAD is inhibited, the continued interaction of BAD with either Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 prevents the interaction of these proteins with Bax. Bax then moves to the mitochondria and induces the MPT, a result that causes the death of the cells. In this way, there is a kind of apoptotic thermostat that determines the fate of the cell. Cell survival or cell death is determined by the relative level of BAD phosphorylation and, hence, by the amount of Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 that is available at the mitochondria to bind and neutralize the proapoptotic protein Bax, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation of an apoptotic cascade."

We used rheological methods to assess the properties of suspensions of epidermal type I and type II keratin IFs and of vimentin, a type III IF polymer.

Repeated imposition of small deformations gives rise to a progressively stiffer gel for keratin but not vimentin IFs. The visco-elastic moduli of both gels show a weak dependence upon the frequency of the input shear stress and the concentration of the polymer, suggesting that both steric and nonsteric interactions between individual polymers contribute to the observed mechanical properties. In support of this, the length of individual polymers contributes only modestly to the properties of IF gels.

Bischoff R. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 538-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This novel cytoskeletal polymer was given the name “intermediate filaments” (IFs),1 a designation that reflects the notion that their diameter is intermediate between those of F-actin (6–8 nm) and microtubules (25 nm). Subsequent studies showed that a large collection of heterogeneous proteins are capable of self-polymerization into IFs. The superfamily of IF genes currently features >50 members classified into five major types (2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Type I-type IV IF proteins occur in the cytoplasm of specific cell types, whereas the type V lamin proteins are primary constituents of the nuclear lamina in all nucleated cell types. The signature common to all IF proteins is a tripartite domain structure in which nonhelical N-terminal (head) and C-terminal (tail) domains flank a 310–350-amino acid-long α-helical domain (2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 3Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev.

This central domain features heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues (a, b, c,d, e, f, and g, where a and d are generally nonpolar), which play an essential role during self-polymerization (2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 4Heins S. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The function of cytoplasmic IF proteins remained elusive for a number of years. Although their structural features, abundance, and intracellular organization suggested a mechanical role, the discovery of viable cell lines missing IF proteins altogether (6Venetianer A. Schiller D.L. Magin T. Franke W.W. Nature. 1983; 305: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Sarria A.J. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) along with the lack of obvious consequences when IF networks are disrupted in cultured cell lines (9Klymkowsky M.W. Nature. 1981; 291: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggested that cytoplasmic IF proteins are not essential for housekeeping functions. Direct evidence for a mechanical role was provided by the experimental disruption of IF networks in the context of cells and tissues in vivo. Indeed, targeted expression of dominant negative mutants that profoundly alter the organization of keratin IFs in the epidermis of transgenic mice was found to cause fragility syndromes whereby the cell population affected would rupture when subjected to relatively mild mechanical trauma (10Vassar R. Coulombe P.A. Degenstein L. Albers K. Fuchs E. Cell. 1991; 64: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 11Coulombe P.A. Hutton M.E. Vassar R. Fuchs E. J.

A. 1992; 89: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similar findings came out of subsequent studies involving the expression of mutated IF genes in mouse tissues other than skin (13Ku N.O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A formal confirmation of this function came from the introduction of null mutations for specific IF genes in mouse, starting with keratin ones (14Baribault H. Price J. Miyai K. Oshima R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1191-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Lloyd C. Yu Q.C. Cheng J. Turksen K. Degenstein L. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J.

Koteliansky V. Babinet C. Krieg T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies established that cytoplasmic IFs are a major determinant of cellular integrity, a role that is especially important in cell types subjected to frequent mechanical trauma such as epithelial sheets, muscle, and fibroblasts (see Ref. 20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar for a review). Largely as a result of the early mouse work reported above, mutations were discovered in patients suffering from a variety of skin fragility syndromes that are characterized by a dominant inheritance, an altered IF network at the ultrastructural level, and cell lysis upon trivial mechanical trauma (20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 21Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms in Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease.

The clinical manifestations of these various skin diseases are primarily determined by the identity of the keratin gene affected and the nature of the mutation altering its primary sequence (20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 21Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms in Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease.

Missense mutations were also found later on in patients suffering from inherited cell fragility syndromes involving epithelia other than skin (23Richard G. De L.V. Didona B. Bale S.J. Compton J.G.

Consistent with its primary role during self-assembly, the vast majority of mutations discovered in the human population so far affect amino acid residues located within the central α-helical domain (20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 21Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms in Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease.

Overall, the nature of these clinical phenotypes substantiate the experimental evidence for a mechanical role by IF networks. Conceptually, the molecular defect(s) responsible for these clinical disorders may reside within the IF backbone itself, in the organization of the filaments in the cytoplasm, or in some aspects of their regulation that pertains to their mechanical properties. Surprisingly, however, there are relatively few studies of the mechanical properties of IFs, and there are none that address the properties of keratins. Here we report on the micromechanical properties of keratin IF assemblies, which we studied using a strain-controlled cone-and-plate rheometer. Plasmids pET-K5 and pET-K14 (28Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), pET-K14·PNΔ150 (29Coulombe P.A. Chan Y.M. Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and pET-Vimentin (30McCormick M.B. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) to generate milligram amounts of the corresponding recombinant human proteins (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). After solubilization in urea-containing buffer, the proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Hi-Trap Q column followed by a Mono Q column (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (32Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Native human keratins were purified from human foreskin keratinocytes in primary culture as described (32Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein purity was routinely assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis chromatography and Coomassie Blue staining, and the material used for rheological studies was >99% pure. Assembly experiments and rheological studies (see below) were conducted at concentrations ranging from 200 to 1500 μg·ml−1 in a 1.6-ml sample volume. Recombinant vimentin was polymerized by serial dilution against three buffers as described (33Herrmann H. Hofmann I. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar): (a) 8 m urea, 5 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm β-ME, pH 8.5, at room temperature; (b) 5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-ME, pH 8.5, at 4 °C); and (c) 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-ME, 160 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Purified type I and type II keratins were mixed in a ∼45:55 molar ratio at a final concentration of 500 μg·ml−1 in 6 m urea buffer, incubated for 1 h, and fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on the Mono Q column. Collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and those containing type I-type II heterotypic complexes were pooled as described (28Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Assembly of recombinant and native keratin proteins was achieved by serial dialysis against the following two buffers at room temperature: (a) 9m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmβ-ME, pH 7.4, and (b) 5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-ME, pH 7.4. All assemblies were examined by negative staining and electron microscopy prior to their use for rheological studies. Polymerization efficiency was determined by subjecting the final assemblies (∼8–10 μg of proteins) to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (Airfuge, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining and quantitated by gel scanning densitometry (32Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Quantitative viscoelastic measurements (34Ferry J. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley and Sons, New York1980Google Scholar) were obtained using a strain-controlled 50-mm cone-and-plate Rheometrics ARES 100 rheometer (Rheometrics Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The temperature of the sample (1.5 ml) was fixed at 25 °C to within 0.1 °C, and the cone-and-plate tools were enclosed in a custom-made vapor trap to prevent buffer evaporation. The prepolymerized keratin solution was placed between the cone-and-plate tools and allowed to rest for 30 min prior to the recordings. The linear equilibrium values of the storage or elastic modulus G′ (ω) and loss or viscous modulusG“ (ω) of the IF polymer suspensions were measured by setting the amplitude of the oscillatory strain at γ = 1% and sweeping from low to high frequency ω. The strain-dependent viscoelastic moduli were measured by subjecting the polymers to three cycles of oscillatory deformation of increasing amplitude at 1 rad·s−1; G′ andG” were computed from the maximum magnitude of the measured stress and associated phase shift (35Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Käs J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Palmer A. Mason T.G. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In a separate assay we measured the time-dependent stress induced in suspension of keratin and vimentin IFs subjected to oscillatory shear deformation in real time. This last assay was repeated for increasing magnitudes of deformation. Polymer samples were routinely examined by electron microscopy and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at the conclusion of each rheological experiment to assess whether the size or concentration of the protein(s) had changed during the course of the experiment. The strategy applied for the characterization of the viscoelastic properties of epidermal keratin IFs was as follows. Purified recombinant proteins were used for most experiments given the large amounts of proteins required. We chose to work with the type II keratin 5 (K5), the type I keratin 14 (K14), and a mutated version of the latter, K14·PNΔ150, in which the N-terminal 150 amino acids of K14 have been deleted. Keratins are unique among IF proteins in that the polymerization process requires the involvement of type I and type II sequences in a 1:1 molar ratio (5Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We selected K5 and K14 because they are naturally co-expressed in the progenitor basal layer of stratified epithelia (37O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar), are relatively well characterized (28Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and are the main target genes in epidermolysis bullosa simplex, an inherited skin blistering disease (20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 21Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms in Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 259-285Google Scholar, 22McLean W.H.I. Lane E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We tested the short filaments produced by co-assembly of K5 and K14·PNΔ150 (29Coulombe P.A. Chan Y.M. Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to assess the contribution of individual polymer length to the viscoelastic moduli of keratin filament suspensions. We also examined the properties of an IF suspension reconstituted from native keratins purified from human foreskin keratinocytes in primary culture. As shown previously (32Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the keratin profile of such keratinocytes includes the type II K5 and K6 and the type I K14 and K17 along with small amounts of K16, another type I keratin. Finally, we assessed the behavior of vimentin, a type III IF protein (2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that can homopolymerize into filaments and whose viscoelastic properties have been characterized previously (38Janmey P.A. Euteneuer U. Traub P. Schliwa M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 39Leterrier J.F. Kas J. Hartwig J. Vegners R. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15687-15694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Rogers K.R. Eckelt A. Nimmrich V. Janssen K.-P. Schliwa M. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 136-150PubMed Google Scholar). The IF polymers tested were obtained by subjecting (a) purified type I-type II keratin heterotetramers (in Tris-buffered urea) or (b) vimentin protofilaments (in a Tris buffer at a basic pH) to polymerization in vitro. Representative examples of the samples used in our studies are shown in Fig.1. As reported (28Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), polymerization of recombinant K5 and K14 results in long and flexible filaments that, as judged by the imperfect criterium of negative staining and electron microscopy, appear to be well dispersed (Fig. 1 B). Quantitative measurements showed that these filaments have, on average, a 10.5-nm diameter and a 2.0-μm length. A similar outcome is seen when polymerizing purified native human epidermal keratins under identical conditions (data not shown). In both instances, ≈90–95% of the initial protein pool is found in the pellet fraction in a standard centrifugation assay, reflecting the suitability of the polymerization conditions. As previously reported (29Coulombe P.A. Chan Y.M. Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), polymerization of K5-K14·PNΔ150 heterotypic complexes results in narrow and exceptionally short polymers (≈6–8 nm wide; ≈ 70–80nm long) compared with K5-K14 (Fig. 1 C). Accordingly, this type of sample performs poorly in the standard pelleting assay (≈ 15–20%). Finally, the vimentin sample yields nice, well dispersed filaments (Fig. 1 D) that on average have a 10.5-nm diameter and a 5.0-μm length. Again, polymerization efficiency is high (>90%). In our hands vimentin IFs are consistently longer than wild-type keratin filaments under the buffer conditions used. Given that polymerization efficiency was comparable for both samples, we surmise that this phenomenon reflects differences in the competition between nucleation and elongation events during polymerization. Such differences do not significantly impact on the viscoelastic properties of IF polymers, as will be shown below. The viscoelastic response of a polymer subjected to a shear deformation is characterized by a storage or elastic modulus (G′) and a loss or viscous modulus (G“). For small deformations,G′ and G” represent the in-phase and out-of phase components, respectively, of the stress induced within the polymer by the imposed deformation, normalized by the magnitude of the deformation (34Ferry J. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley and Sons, New York1980Google Scholar). In the linear regime, which corresponds to the range of strains for which G′ and G“ are independent of the applied deformation, we find that at a 1 mg·ml−1 protein concentration the storage modulus G′ for wild-type keratin, mutant keratin, and vimentin IF polymer suspensions are similar and vary between 20 and 40 dyne·cm−2 depending on the experiment (Fig. 2). In all three cases, the storage modulus G′ is consistently larger than the loss modulus G” by nearly one order of magnitude, and accordingly the phase shift δ = arctan (G“/G′), which reflects the relative values of these two moduli, is small (δ ≈ 8–10 °). Given that phase shift values of 0 and 90 ° are characteristic of elastic solids (e.g. steel) and a viscous liquid (e.g. water), respectively, these data indicate that suspensions of keratin and vimentin IFs behave like visco-elastic solids. They further suggest that the length of individual filaments is not a major determinant of the mechanical properties of an IF polymer suspension, at least at a 1 mg·ml−1 protein concentration (Fig. 2). By comparison, suspensions of F-actin are intrinsically less solid-like than IFs, because they typically feature a phase shift δ of ≈25 ° when tested under similar conditions (41Xu J. Palmer A. Wirtz D. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 6486-6492Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 42Xu J. Schwarz W.H. Kas J. Janmey P.J. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2731-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The visco-elastic moduli of wild-type keratin and vimentin IF polymers are relatively independent of the frequency of shear over an extended range of frequencies (10−2 rad·s−1 < ω < 102 rad·s−1; Fig. 2). Moreover, stress relaxation experiments conducted over a period of 1000 s do not display a clear terminal regime that would reflect the final relaxation of the sheared polymers (data not shown). We also find that the viscoelastic modulus displayed by keratin and vimentin IF polymers is a weak function of concentration (see data for wild-type K5-K14 IFs in Fig. 2, inset), much weaker than that observed for F-actin and predicted by classical models of nonassociating polymers (36Palmer A. Mason T.G. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 43Witten T.A. J. Phys. France. 1988; 49: 1055-1063Crossref Google Scholar). The weak concentration dependence of the plateau modulus along with the large relaxation time are not consistent with the currently accepted models that describe the rheology of polymer solutions. 2The currently accepted models stipulate that the plateau modulus of an entangled solution of a flexible polymer (such as IFs) varies with concentration as G ≈ C2.25 (44Doi M. Edwards S.F. The Theory of Polymer Dynamics. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar), whereas the plateau modulus of semi-flexible and rigid polymers varies with concentration as G ≈ C1.4 (45Morse D.C. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 7030-7043Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and G ≈ C1 (44Doi M. Edwards S.F. The Theory of Polymer Dynamics. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). In these models steric interactions,i.e. topological constraints dues to entanglements between individual polymers, are the only mechanisms by which the relaxation of polymers in solution is impeded; all other possible nonsteric interactions are ignored. Collectively, these observations suggest that the motion of individual filaments is greatly restricted within the polymer suspension and that nonsteric interactions between polymers contribute to the plateau modulus observed. We next assessed the behavior of these IF polymers when subjected to small and large deformations. A deformation is considered to be large when the viscoelastic moduli of the polymer become a function of the deformation amplitude, which defines the onset of the nonlinear regime (34Ferry J. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley and Sons, New York1980Google Scholar). We first measured the elastic modulus of IF polymers after three cycles of oscillatory shear deformation as the ratio of the maximum measured stress to the maximum imposed strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the wild-type keratin, mutant keratin, and vimentin IF polymers all display elastic moduli that are independent of the strain amplitude for small deformations (Fig.3). All three polymers seemingly soften past a yield strain γ of about 10% and display liquid-like properties (G′ < G“) at γ > 200% (Fig.3). This yield strain is similar to that obtained for F-actin suspensions under comparable conditions (41Xu J. Palmer A. Wirtz D. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 6486-6492Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Again, the nearly identical behavior of the three types of samples suggest that wide variations in the length of individual filaments does not significantly influence the behavior of the IF polymer when subjected to large deformation. Polymerization into short filaments is required to manifest the properties of a stiff viscoelastic gel, because we find that suspensions of keratin heterotetramers or vimentin “protofilaments” display small storage and loss moduli when tested at a 1 mg·ml−1 protein concentration (G′ ≈ 0.1–1 dyne·cm−2); data not shown). At another level, we find no significant difference in the visco-elastic modulus of vimentin IFs whether they are prepolymerized by dialysis (i.e. outside of the rheometer sample chamber) or polymerized within the rheometer sample chamber (via rapid dilution into concentrated assembly buffer; see Ref. 33Herrmann H. Hofmann I. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This result is entirely consistent with the ability of these gels to rapidly recover their visco-elastic moduli upon cessation of the input shear strain (see below). Finally, we find that keratin IFs assembled from native proteins behave similarly to recombinant proteins (data not shown), suggesting that no major bias are introduced because of the bacterial source of the IF proteins used in our study. To further analyze the behavior of IF polymers when subjected to large deformations, we monitored the storage modulus G′ in a continuous fashion as a fixed oscillatory deformation γ = 100% was applied to a K5-K14 filament suspension (Fig. 4). During the first cycle of shear, the stress initially increases linearly with the imposed strain, i.e. the behavior of the gel is linear. However, the stress soon increases faster than the imposed strain,i.e. the keratin polymer strain hardens, resisting further deformation (Fig. 4 B).

Here, we report the cloning and expression of a novel sPLA2 isolated from mouse thymus. Based on its structural features, this sPLA2 is most similar to the previously cloned mouse group IIA sPLA2 (mGIIA sPLA2). As for mGIIA sPLA2, the novel sPLA2 is made up of 125 amino acids with 14 cysteines, is basic (pI = 8.71) and its gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome 4. However, the novel sPLA2 has only 48% identity with mGIIA and displays similar levels of identity with the other mouse group IIC and V sPLA2s, indicating that the novel sPLA2 is not an isoform of mGIIA sPLA2. This novel sPLA2 has thus been called mouse group IID (mGIID) sPLA2. In further contrast with mGIIA, which is found mainly in intestine, transcripts coding for mGIID sPLA2 are found in several tissues including pancreas, spleen, thymus, skin, lung, and ovary, suggesting distinct functions for the two enzymes. Recombinant expression of mGIID sPLA2 in Escherichia coli indicates that the cloned sPLA2 is an active enzyme that has much lower specific activity than mGIIA and displays a distinct specificity for binding to various phospholipid vesicles. Finally, recombinant mGIID sPLA2 did not bind to the mouse M-type sPLA2 receptor, while mGIIA was previously found to bind to this receptor with high affinity.

Several mammalian intracellular and secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s) have been characterized and classified as different groups (5Dennis E.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Intracellular PLA2s comprise the well known Ca2+-sensitive arachidonoyl-selective 85-kDa cPLA2 (6Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) and a number of Ca2+-independent PLA2s (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, five different secreted PLA2s have been identified and classified as five distinct groups (4Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Main common characteristics of these sPLA2s are a relatively low molecular mass (13–16 kDa), the presence of many disulfide bridges, a broad selectivity for phospholipids with different polar head groups and fatty acid chains, and an absolute catalytic requirement for millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (1Dennis E.A.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Group IB sPLA2 is known as pancreatic-type sPLA2 because of its initial purification from pancreatic juice (9Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. De Haas G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 91: 91-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this sPLA2 was detected in other tissues including lung, spleen, kidney and ovary (10Seilhamer J.J. Randall T.L. Yamanaka M. Johnson L.K. DNA. 1986; 5: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and its involvement in various physiological and pathophysiological responses such as cell proliferation, cell contraction, lipid mediator release, acute lung injury, and endotoxic shock has been proposed (11Ohara O.

Group IIA sPLA2 is also referred to as the inflammatory-type sPLA2, as it is expressed at high levels during inflammation and associated diseases (3Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediator. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). This sPLA2 is a potent mediator of inflammation (3Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediator. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar) and a potent bactericidal agent (15Ganz T. Weiss J. Semin.

Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also expressed at high levels in various gastrointestinal cancers (18Ogawa M. Yamashita S. Sakamoto K. Ikei S. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1991; 74: 241-244PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ohmachi M. Egami H. Akagi J. Kurizaki T. Yamamoto S. Ogawa M. Int. J. Oncol. 1996; 9: 511-516PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that mouse group IIA (mGIIA) 2A comprehensive abbreviation system for the various mammalian sPLA2s was used: each sPLA2was abbreviated with a lowercase letter indicating the sPLA2 species (m, h, and r for mouse, human, and rat, respectively), followed by uppercase letters identifying the sPLA2 group (GIB, GIIA, GIIC, GIID, GV, and GX for group IB, IIA, IIC, V, and X sPLA2s, respectively). sPLA2serves as a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer (20MacPhee M. Chepenik P.K. Liddel A.R. Nelson K.K. Siracusa D.L. Buchberg M.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 21Cormier R.T. Hong K.H. Halberg R.B. Hawkins T.L. Richardson P. Mulherkar R. Dove W.F. Lander E.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the regulation and biological roles of group IIC, V, and X sPLA2s. Rat and mouse group IIC sPLA2s have been cloned (22Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this sPLA2 appears to be a non-functional pseudogene in humans (23Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.-R. Shih D.M. Klisak I. Chen J. Engle S.J. Siakotos A.N. Winstead M.V. Seilhamer J.J. Allamand V. Gyapay G. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Group V sPLA2 is highly expressed in heart (24Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been recently detected in murine macrophages and mastocytes, where it plays a role in lipid mediator production (25Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Group X sPLA2 has been cloned in humans and displays distinct structural features (4Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is mainly expressed in tissues and cells of the immune system, suggesting a role related to inflammation and/or immunity (4Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Besides their roles as enzymes, some sPLA2s have been shown to bind to specific membrane receptors (27Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To date, two main types of high affinity sPLA2 receptors have been identified initially using venom sPLA2s as ligands. N-type receptors are highly expressed in brain membranes and display high affinities for neurotoxic venom sPLA2s but not for nontoxic venom sPLA2s, suggesting that these receptors play a role in the neurotoxic effects of sPLA2s (28Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nicolas J.P. Lin Y. Lambeau G. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7173-7181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The physiological role(s) and the endogenous ligands of N-type receptors remain to be discovered. M-type receptors were identified in skeletal muscle (30Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and have now been cloned from different animal species (11Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These receptors may be involved in various biological effects of pancreatic group IB sPLA2 (11Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Kundu G.C. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the recent targeted disruption of the M-type receptor gene has indicated a role of this receptor in the inflammatory processes leading to endotoxic shock (12Hanasaki K. Yokota Y. Ishizaki J. Itoh T. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32792-32797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, studies with mammalian sPLA2s have shown that M-type receptors can be physiological targets for group IB and/or group IIA sPLA2s, depending on the animal species (11Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In light of the growing molecular diversity of mammalian sPLA2s, we have searched for novel sPLA2s in data bases and found a novel mouse sPLA2. This enzyme displays all the structural features of mammalian group IIA sPLA2s (7 disulfides and a C-terminal extension), and displays the best identity score (48%) with the previously cloned mGIIA sPLA2, also known as enhancing factor (32Mulherkar R. Rao R.S. Wagle A.S. Patki V. Deo M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Kadam S. Deshpande C. Coulier F. Mulherkar R. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 36: 553-558PubMed Google Scholar). However, the novel sPLA2 has similar levels of identity with mouse group IIC (43%) and group V (47%) sPLA2s, indicating that the novel sPLA2 is not significantly more related to mGIIA sPLA2 than to these two other sPLA2s and thus is not an isoform of mGIIA sPLA2. For these reasons, the novel sPLA2 is designated hereafter as mouse group IID (mGIID) sPLA2. Search for sPLA2 homologs in gene data bases stored at the National Center for Biotechnology by using the tBLASTn sequence alignment program (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) resulted in the identification of an expressed sequence tag (EST) (IMAGE Consortium clone identification 1225779 5′, GenBank accession number AA762051) that was derived from mouse thymus and that encodes a partial sequence of a novel sPLA2. The 501-nucleotide EST sequence was then used to clone the entire cDNA sequence coding for this novel sPLA2 by 5′ RACE-PCR experiments. These experiments were performed as follows: 10 μg of total mouse thymus RNA were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers (Promega) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Second strand DNA synthesis was carried out using RNase H and DNA polymerase I for 2 h at 16 °C. After blunt-ending with T4 DNA polymerase, double-strand cDNA was precipitated and ligated to adaptors containing sequences for the universal primers Sp6 and KS and SalI and EcoRI restriction sites. A first PCR reaction using KS primer and a specific sPLA2 reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 211–234 (Fig. 1) was followed by a second amplification using the same KS primer and a second specific reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 89–111 (Fig. 1). PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles. PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and screened using a 32P-labeled primer corresponding to nucleotides 59–87 (Fig. 1). Positive clones were analyzed by restriction and sequenced by using an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 377). The CV panel of mouse X Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids (35Williamson P. Holt S. Townsend S. Boyd Y. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used for the chromosomal assignment of mGIID sPLA2. For that purpose, a genomic fragment of 5.5 kilobase pairs was isolated by PCR and partially sequenced, and a set of specific primers was designed. A forward primer within an intron (5′-AAAGATTAGGTGGCTGGAACAACCA-3′) and an antisense primer within the exon coding for the active site region (5′-CATCCATCGATCTTCAGGTGGGCA-3′) were found to amplify a fragment of 230 nucleotides from a mouse CBA/H DNA template, while a product of 250 nucleotides was amplified with hamster V79TOR DNA as template. PCR reactions were performed in 25 μl containing 50 ng of DNA template, 0.5 μg of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 units of Taqpolymerase (Eurobio, France). PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Two Northern blots (Origene, catalog no. MB-1002 and MB-1012) and a mouse RNA Master blot (CLONTECH, catalog no. 7771-1) were probed with a randomly primed 32P-labeled mGIID cDNA fragment (nucleotides 58–436 in Fig. 1) in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (0.9m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 18 h at 42 °C and 50 °C, respectively. The membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.2× SSC (30 mm NaCl, 3 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0) in 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS films with a Transcreen-HE intensifying screen. The full-length cDNA coding for mGIID sPLA2(nucleotides 1–435 in Fig. 1) was subcloned into the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) and transfected into COS cells as described (4Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Five days after transfection, cell medium was collected and analyzed for sPLA2 activity or loaded on a heparin-agarose column (Sigma) to concentrate sPLA2 activity. The column was washed with 0.1 m NaCl, eluted stepwise with 1m NaCl, and eluted fractions were assayed for sPLA2 activity using [3H]oleate-labeledE. coli membranes (36Ancian P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13146-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment coding for a factor Xa cleavage site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) followed by the mGIID mature protein was prepared with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subcloned in frame with a truncated glutathioneS-transferase (∼10 kDa) encoded by the modified pGEX-2T vector (pAB3), which was previously used for the expression of porcine pancreatic sPLA2 (37van den Berg B. Tessari M. de Haas G.H. Verheij H.M. Boelens R. Kaptein R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4123-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant expression of the fusion protein was performed in E. coli BL21 host cells grown in 1 liter of Terrific broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown to an OD600 ∼0.8, and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxycholate) for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was homogenized with a French press (SLM Aminco). Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and washed four times with lysis buffer without detergents. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 100 ml of 6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.3 mNa2SO3, 20 mm borate, pH 7.4, and proteins were sulfonated by addition of 0.05 volume of Thannhauser reagent (38Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. After overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 5 liters of 1% acetic acid, the precipitated protein was pelleted and resuspended at 0.2 mg/ml protein in 6m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm borate, pH 8.0. The denatured sPLA2 (200 ml) was refolded by dialysis against 8 liters of 0.9 m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm cysteine for 24 h at 4 °C. The refolded protein was then dialyzed against 8 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. The fusion protein solution was clarified by centrifugation and finally subjected to overnight digestion at 20 °C with 40 units of factor Xa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was loaded at 2 ml/min onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The column was washed with buffer A until OD280 dropped to zero and then eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–1m NaCl, in 50 min at 1 ml/min). Fractions containing sPLA2 activity were pooled and directly loaded on a Nucleosil™ C18 reverse phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, 4.2 ml, 300 Å, 5 μm). Elution was performed at 1 ml/min using water/acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10–30% acetonitrile over 20 min, followed by 30–60% acetonitrile over 110 min). N-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems Sequencer model A473. Ion spray mass spectrometry was performed on a simple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ion-spray source and using polypropylene glycol for calibration. Small unilamellar vesicles of DOPM, POPC, POPE, POPG, and POPS (all from Avanti Polar Lipids) were prepared by sonication as described (39Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar POPC vesicles were prepared by extrusion (40Bayburt T. Gelb M.H.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Initial velocities for the hydrolysis of these vesicles by mGIIA, mGIID, and hGIIA sPLA2s were monitored using a fluorescent fatty acid displacement assay (42Kinkaid A.R. Voysey J.E. Wilton D.C.

For each type of phospholipids, assays were calibrated by measuring the fluorescence change following the addition of a known amount of oleic acid to reaction mixtures containing all components except enzyme. Competitive substrate specificity studies to examine the phospholipid headgroup preferences of mGIIA, mGIID, and hGIIA sPLA2s (43Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7318-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using pairs of competing and radiolabeled substrates present as minor components in sonicated DOPM vesicles. Reaction mixtures contained 40 μm DOPM containing ∼120,000 cpm of 3H-phospholipid and ∼20,000 cpm14C-phospholipid in 100 μl of the same buffer as was used in the kinetic studies described above. Lipids were mixed in chloroform, solvent was removed with a stream of N2 and then in vacuo for 30 min, and buffer was added followed by sonication. Mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with sufficient enzyme to hydrolyze 10–20% of the preferred radiolabeled substrate (10–20 ng of mGIIA or hGIIA sPLA2s, ∼1 μg of mGIID sPLA2). Reactions were quenched, and liberated fatty acids were prepared for scintillation counting as described (45Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H.

The sources of radiolabeled phospholipids for these experiments are as follows: [3H]DPPC (89 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), [3H]DPPG (400 Ci/mol, prepared from [3H]DPPC by head group exchange with cabbage phospholipase D from Sigma as described in Ref. 46Schmitt J.D.

Interfacial binding of sPLA2s to anionic vesicles was monitored using energy transfer measured with a spectrofluorimeter as described (47Yu B.Z. Ghomashchi F. Cajal Y. Annand R.R. Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3870-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The release of fatty acids from live RAW 264.7 cells (400,000 cells/ml) treated exogenously with sPLA2s was measured with the fatty acid binding protein assay as described (48Koduri R.S. Baker S.F.

Specific activities were calculated from the rates measured in the presence of two or three different amounts of enzyme under conditions where the rate was proportional to the amount of enzyme (5 ng to 6 μg, depending on the sPLA2). Cobra venom (Naja naja) sPLA2 was from Sigma. Competition binding assays with recombinant mouse M-type receptor expressed in COS cells were performed as described using125I-OS1 as labeled sPLA2 ligand (31Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes containing M-type receptor,125I-OS1, and unlabeled sPLA2s were incubated at 20 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (140 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Incubations were started by addition of membranes and filtered after 60 min through GF/C glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine. Protein sequences of various sPLA2s were used to search for novel sPLA2s in gene data bases by using the tBLASTn sequence alignment program (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). This resulted in the identification of an EST of 501 nucleotides (Fig.1) that was derived from a mouse thymus cDNA library, and that displayed high homology to sPLA2s. We thus postulated that this EST was a partial copy of a mRNA coding for a novel low molecular mass sPLA2. This thymus EST sequence was then used to search in data bases for other related EST sequences. A second EST derived from a mouse mammary gland cDNA library was identified and found to have identity to the 3′-end of the thymus EST sequence. On the other hand, no related sequence was found on human EST data bases. Since none of the mouse EST sequences were found to encode for the full-length sPLA2, PCR experiments were performed to clone the entire cDNA sequence. Primers were first designed from the thymus EST sequence and used in PCR experiments on different mouse tissue cDNAs. DNA products of the expected size were obtained from mouse BALB/c thymus cDNAs and found to have the same sequence as the original EST sequence (Fig. 1). 5′ RACE-PCR experiments were then performed on the same cDNAs to obtain the full-length cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Screening of the amplified products with a specific oligonucleotide probe resulted in the identification of a DNA fragment of 128 nucleotides that is identical to the EST sequence in its 3′-end and contains in its 5′-end sequence all the expected features of a sPLA2 including a signal peptide sequence preceded by an initiator methionine. Based on this sequence, a new set of primers was designed to amplify the full-length sPLA2 cDNA from mouse BALB/c t"

Computer modeling and structural analysis predicted a cluster of positively charged amino acids at the interface between complement control protein modules 1 and 2 of the C4BP α-chain to be involved in C4b binding. Three C4BP mutants, R39Q, R64Q/R66Q, and R39Q/R64Q/R66Q, were expressed and assayed for their ability to bind C4b and to function as factor I cofactors. The apparent affinities of R39Q, R64Q/R66Q, and R39Q/R64Q/R66Q for immobilized C4b were 15-, 50-, and 140-fold lower, respectively, than that of recombinant wild type C4BP. The C4b binding site demonstrated herein was also found to be a specific heparin binding site. In C4b degradation, the mutants demonstrated decreased ability to serve as factor I cofactors. In particular, the R39Q/R64Q/R66Q mutant was inefficient as cofactor for cleavage of the Arg937-Thr938 peptide bond in C4b. In contrast, the factor I mediated cleavage of Arg1317-Asn1318 bond was less affected by the C4BP mutations. In conclusion, we identify a cluster of amino acids that is part of a C4b binding site involved in the regulation of the complement system.

C4b-binding protein complement control protein monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-buffered saline The human complement system comprises about 35 known plasma- and membrane-bound proteins involved in efficient activation and tight regulation of the system. Complement proteins form multi-molecular complexes, and limited proteolysis is central for both activation and regulation. Factor I is a serine protease responsible for down-regulation of both classical and alternative pathways of complement. Factor I degrades activated forms of complement factors C3 (C3b) and C4 (C4b) when they are bound to factor H or C4b-binding protein (C4BP),1 respectively (1Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Seya T. Nakamura K. Masaki T. Ichihara-Itoh C. Matsumoto M. Nagasawa S. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).C4BP is a large plasma protein (molecular mass, ∼570 kDa) consisting of seven identical α-chains and a unique β-chain linked together by disufide bridges (3Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α- and β-chains contain eight and three complement control protein (CCP) modules, respectively (5Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). CCP modules consist of approximately 60 amino acids forming a compact hydrophobic core surrounded by five or more β-strands organized into β-sheets (6Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of C4BP demonstrated a spider-like conformation, with the seven α-chains forming extended tentacles (7Dahlbäck B. Smith C.A. Müller Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3461-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,8Dahlbäck B. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11631-11634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synchrotron x-ray scattering and hydrodynamic analysis suggested that C4BP, in solution, is a bundle of seven extended arms held together at their C termini with an average arm-axis angle of 10° rather than being a spider-like molecule (9Perkins S.J. Chung L.P. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). C4BP interacts not only with C4b (3Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) but also with protein S (single binding site on β-chain) (10Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2512-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), serum amyloid P component (11Schwalbe R.A. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21749-21757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bacterial surface proteins fromStreptococcus pyogenes (12Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar), and heparin (13Hessing M. Vlooswijk R.A. Hackeng T.M. Kanters D. Bouma B.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 204-208PubMed Google Scholar).C4BP controls C4b-mediated reactions, thereby regulating the classical pathway of complement. Apart from acting as a cofactor to factor I, C4BP also accelerates the natural decay of the C4bC2a complex, which is the classical pathway C3 convertase (14Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). C4, which is the precursor of C4b, is composed of a 93-kDa α-chain, a β-chain (75 kDa), and a 32-kDa γ-chain, which are linked by disulfide bridges (15Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Gigli I. von Zabern I. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Bolotin C. Morris S. Tack B. Prahl J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2008-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During complement activation, C1s cleaves a 9-kDa fragment (C4a) from the N terminus of the α-chain (18Budzko D.B. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Immunochemistry. 1970; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Patrick R.A.T., S.B. Lepow I.H. Immunochemistry. 1970; 7: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The remaining part of the molecule (C4b) acquires transient capability to bind amino and hydroxyl groups via a reactive glutamyl residue that is exposed upon cleavage of an internal thiolester bond (20Law S.K.A. Lichtenberg N.A. Holcombe F.H. Levine R.P. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 634-639PubMed Google Scholar). C4b-like molecules can also be generated from C4 by treatment with amines, chaotropes, or repeated freezing and thawing, which result in the cleavage of the internal thiolester bond without liberation of C4a (21Zabern I. Bloom E. Chu V. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1433-1438PubMed Google Scholar).Each α-chain of C4BP contains a C4b binding site, but, most likely due to sterical hindrance, only up to four C4b molecules can bind to one C4BP molecule (22Ziccardi R.J. Dahlbäck B. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13674-13679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several different regions of the α-chains have been suggested to be involved in C4b binding. Initially, an N-terminal 48-kDa α-chain fragment, formed by chymotrypsin digestion, was found to bind C4b and to express factor I cofactor activity (23Nagasawa S. Mizuguchi K. Ichihara C. Koyama J. J. Biochem. 1982; 92: 1329-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,24Fujita T. Kamato T. Tamura N. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3320-3324PubMed Google Scholar). This agreed well with electron microscopy results, which demonstrated C4b binding to the peripheral end of each C4BP tentacle (7Dahlbäck B. Smith C.A. Müller Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3461-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Several reports agree with the concept that the three most N-terminal CCPs are necessary and sufficient for C4b binding (25Ogata R.T. Mathias P. Bradt B.M. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2273-2280PubMed Google Scholar, 26Accardo P. Sanchez Corral P. Criado O. Garcia E. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4935-4939PubMed Google Scholar, 27Härdig Y. Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The C4b binding site in human C4BP partially overlaps with the binding site for the S. pyogenes surface proteins (12Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar, 26Accardo P. Sanchez Corral P. Criado O. Garcia E. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4935-4939PubMed Google Scholar), and recently, it was suggested that Arg66 and/or His67 is involved in these interactions (26Accardo P. Sanchez Corral P. Criado O. Garcia E. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4935-4939PubMed Google Scholar).The elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of complement is hindered by the lack of structural information. To overcome these limitations, we have used a combination of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to study the interaction between C4b and C4BP. In a recent study, we identified a cluster of positively charged amino acids present at the surface of the CCP1–2 modules of the C4BP α-chain as a potential binding site for C4b and heparin (28Villoutreix B.O. Härdig Y. Wallqvist A. Covell D.G. Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We now report results obtained with a series of C4BP mutants (R39Q, R64Q/R66Q, and R39Q/R64Q/R66Q), which show this cluster to be crucial for binding of both C4b and heparin.DISCUSSIONThe factor I cofactor function of C4BP resulting in the degradation of C4b is a physiologically important regulatory mechanism of the complement system. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the interacting proteins, C4BP, C4b, and factor I, three-dimensional structures of the individual proteins and of protein complexes have not been determined experimentally and are unlikely to become available in the near future. However, molecular modeling and computer-guided site-directed mutagenesis are efficient tools for the identification of binding sites and elucidation of structure-function relationships. These techniques have proven successful in other studies,e.g. in the investigation of two CCP modules from CD46 (41Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Devaux P. Mumenthaler C. Schneider-Schaulies J. Braun W. Gerlier D. Cattaneo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22072-22079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Based on the sequence similarities between CCP modules in C4BP and various CCPs with known three-dimensional structures, we constructed a three-dimensional model for the α-chain of human C4BP (28Villoutreix B.O. Härdig Y. Wallqvist A. Covell D.G. Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Theoretical and interactive analysis of potential binding sites suggested the interface between C4BP CCP1 and CCP2, displaying a cluster of positively charged amino acids, to be of putative functional importance. Sequences of five cDNAs coding for C4BP α-chains have been reported: human (42Chung L.P. Bentley D.R. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), bovine (43Hillarp A. Thern A. Dahlbäck B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4190-4199PubMed Google Scholar), rat (44Hillarp A. Wiklund H. Thern A. Dahlbäck B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (45Kristensen T. Ogata R.T. Chung L.P. Reid K.B. Tack B.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and rabbit (46Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Analysis of interspecies similarities of amino acid sequences showed the N-terminal region of the α-chain containing the positively charged cluster to be highly conserved suggesting physiological importance (46Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations prompted us to construct several α-chain mutants in which arginines in CCP1 and CCP2 were replaced by glutamine residues. Three mutants, R39Q, R64Q/R66Q, and R39Q/R64Q/R66Q, were expressed in the eucaryotic system and purified. From the results of direct binding studies and a competition assay, it is clear that the suggested electropositive cluster indeed represents a key interaction site for C4b. Our data agree with a previous report focusing on the S. pyogenes-C4BP interaction by Accardo et al. (26Accardo P. Sanchez Corral P. Criado O. Garcia E. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4935-4939PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested the binding site for C4b to span CCP1–3 and pointed out the importance of the Arg66-His67 pair. A mutant carrying the combined change of Arg66 to Glu and His67 to Thr demonstrated decreased binding to C4b-Sepharose at physiological ionic strength. However, at 40 mm NaCl, no difference in binding (estimated as retention on a C4b-Speharose) between mutant and recombinant wild type C4BP could be observed (26Accardo P. Sanchez Corral P. Criado O. Garcia E. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4935-4939PubMed Google Scholar).The C4b-C4BP interaction is highly sensitive to salt concentration, and already at 200 mm NaCl, the binding decreased by about 50%. This stands in sharp contrast to the C4BP-protein S interaction, which is essentially unaffected by high salt concentrations (47Blom A.M. Covell D.G. Wallqvist A. Dahlbäck B. Villoutreix B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Protein S binds to the most N-terminal CCP of the β-chain (48Härdig Y. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20861-20867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of a β-chain model revealed a cluster of solvent exposed hydrophobic residues, which are potentially involved in the binding of protein S (47Blom A.M. Covell D.G. Wallqvist A. Dahlbäck B. Villoutreix B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Such clusters of residues with hydrophobic characteristics favor tight and stable interactions and may therefore have been maintained during evolution.Even though most reports suggest the C4b binding site to be located within CCPs 1–3, other regions of the α-chain have been proposed to be involved as well. Thus, proteolytic fragments of C4BP were used to map the C4b binding and factor I cofactor activities to distinct regions spanning CCP6–7 and CCP3–6, respectively (49Chung L.P. Reid K.B. Biosci. Rep. 1985; 5: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, a monoclonal antibody directed to CCP6 was found to block C4b binding (50Hessing M. Kanters D. Takeya H. van 't Veer C. Hackeng T.M. Iwanaga S. Bouma B.N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which is difficult to reconcile with the observation that mouse C4BP lacking CCP5–6 binds human C4b (45Kristensen T. Ogata R.T. Chung L.P. Reid K.B. Tack B.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a cryptic binding site for C3b is located near the C terminus of the α-chain (51Mikata S. Miyagawa S. Fukui A. Murakami Y. Shirakura R. Matsuda H. Hatanaka M. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Suzuki K. Nagasawa S. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This site was only exposed in recombinant, monomeric cell-bound C4BP, which makes its physiological significance unclear. However, such a cryptic C3b binding site may also have the ability to interact with C4b, which could explain some of the disagreement in published reports. When all available data are taken into consideration, it appears clear that the interface between CCP1 and CCP2 forms a crucial binding site for C4b. However, other regions within CCP1–3 are presumably required for expression of the full binding capacity between C4BP and C4b and for expression of factor I cofactor activity.The C4b-C4BP complex is not the first example of an interaction in which the interface area between two CCP modules plays a pivotal role in forming a binding site. Thus, the binding sites for measles virus on CD46 involves the interface between CCP1 and CCP2 together with parts of CCP2 (41Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Devaux P. Mumenthaler C. Schneider-Schaulies J. Braun W. Gerlier D. Cattaneo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22072-22079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, insertion of two and four amino acids between CCP1 and CCP2 and between CCP3 and CCP4 of factor H, respectively, entirely abolished its factor I cofactor function (52Kuhn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that an antibody blocking the interaction between CR2 and C3dg is directed against an epitope on a recess formed between CCP1 and CCP2 (53Prodinger W.M. Schwendinger M.G. Schoch J. Köchle M. Larcher C. Dierich M.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4604-4610PubMed Google Scholar).The decreased binding of mutated C4BP to C4b was matched by loss of its factor I cofactor activity. However, the mutations introduced in C4BP had differential effects on the two cleavage sites in C4b, such as the cleavage of the Arg937-Thr938 peptide bond was more severely affected as compared with the Arg1317-Asn1318 bond. The mechanism by which C4BP and factor H function as factor I cofactors in the degradation of C3b and C4b is unknown. Recently, it was suggested that factor H causes conformational changes in C3b, facilitating its interaction with factor I (54Soames C.J. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that factor I binds both factor H and C3b and that the binding sites do not overlap. Possibly, a similar mechanism is involved in the C4BP/factor I mediated C4b degradation. This would be consistent with the presence of a secondary C4b binding site located outside the electropositive cluster in CCP1–2, which possibly is more involved in the cleavage of the Arg1317-Asn1318 peptide bond than the Arg937-Thr938 bond. This could explain the selective impairment of one of the cleavage reactions.Heparin interacts with several complement proteins, but the affinity of the binding of heparin to C4BP is the highest among the complement proteins, most likely due to the multimeric nature of C4BP (39Sahu A.

We now show that the C4b binding site also interacts with the negatively charged heparin but not with chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronan that is negatively charged due to a presence of carboxyl groups. The pattern, composition, and spacing of basic amino acids in heparin binding peptides and proteins have been investigated in detail (55Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 56Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem.

From these studies, it is known that heparin (characterized by a high charge density) interacts tightly with peptides displaying a series of at least three to five positively charged residues and that the binding is stronger when the cluster contains arginine residues rather than lysines. Our results are fully consistent with these observations as we show that Arg39, Arg64, and Arg66play a key role in heparin binding. In addition, because of its location, we suggest that Lys63 is also involved in the heparin binding site. Indeed, after numerous molecular modeling trials (i.e. using different intermodule angles), the most rational location for the Lys63 side chain is in direct vicinity to the three guanidinium groups of Arg39, Arg64, and Arg66. The mutations were found to abrogate the binding of C4BP to heparin almost entirely, which suggested that the electropositive cluster in CCP1–2 constitutes the major heparin binding site in C4BP. Analysis of the three-dimensional model of the whole α-chain of C4BP showed that the electropositive cluster between CCP1 and CCP2 was the only one presenting the key characteristics of a heparin binding site. It is noteworthy that heparin binding sites have also been found at the surface of factor H CCP7, CCP13 and CCP20 (57Pangburn M.K. Atkinson M.A. Meri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16847-16853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Blackmore T.K. Sadlon T.A. Ward H.M. Lublin D.M. Gordon D.L. J.

However, the mechanism of action of heparin in the case of factor H seems to be different than the one for C4BP, because heparin enhances binding of factor H to surface-bound C3b, thereby helping in the inactivation of C3b by factor I (60Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, low molecular weight heparin (5 kDa) was ineffective in the factor H-C3b system, whereas it still inhibits C4b-C4BP interaction. In a C4b degradation assay, similar concentrations of heparin were required to inhibit factor I cofactor activity as the ones needed for blocking C4BP binding to immobilized C4b (not shown). The multimeric nature of C4BP makes the heparin interaction potentially interesting from a physiological perspective. Binding of C4BP to the host cells via for example three heparin binding sites present on three different α-chains would favor degradation of C4b close to the cell surface as the other four α-chains would be free to interact with C4b and factor I. Thus, interaction of C4BP with heparin-like molecules, present at the surface of some cells, could protect them from the destructive and inflammatory consequences of complement activation. The localization of the heparin binding site at the tip of the C4BP tentacles is consistent with this hypothesis because if such a site was located closer to the central core region of C4BP, it would not be as easily accessible for binding.In recent years, several complement components have gained recognition as potential therapeutics, e.g. complement components may have cardioprotective roles, have anti-inflammatory actions, or help to overcome hyper acute rejection during xenotransplantation (reviewed in Ref. 61Makrides S.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 59-87PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, a surface-bound form of human C4BP consisting of only one α-chain (CCP1 to CCP8) has been constructed (51Mikata S. Miyagawa S. Fukui A. Murakami Y. Shirakura R. Matsuda H. Hatanaka M. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Suzuki K. Nagasawa S. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This engineered C4BP molecule efficiently blocked complement-mediated endothelial cell lysis, suggesting that C4BP could be useful for clinical xenotransplantation. However, although complement regulators have therapeutic potential, our knowledge of the intermolecular interactions involving complement regulatory proteins is still rudimentary. The now identified binding site for C4b on the C4BP molecule is part of an effort not only to describe sites for protein-protein interactions but also to enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of the complement system by factor I and its cofactor proteins. The human complement system comprises about 35 known plasma- and membrane-bound proteins involved in efficient activation and tight regulation of the system. Complement proteins form multi-molecular complexes, and limited proteolysis is central for both activation and regulation. Factor I is a serine protease responsible for down-regulation of both classical and alternative pathways of complement. Factor I degrades activated forms of complement factors C3 (C3b) and C4 (C4b) when they are bound to factor H or C4b-binding protein (C4BP),1 respectively (1Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Seya T. Nakamura K. Masaki T. Ichihara-Itoh C. Matsumoto M. Nagasawa S. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). C4BP is a large plasma protein (molecular mass, ∼570 kDa) consisting of seven identical α-chains and a unique β-chain linked together by disufide bridges (3Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α- and β-chains contain eight and three complement control protein (CCP) modules, respectively (5Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). CCP modules consist of approximately 60 amino acids forming a compact hydrophobic core surrounded by five or more β-strands organized into β-sheets (6Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of C4BP demonstrated a spider-like conformation, with the seven α-chains forming extended tentacles (7Dahlbäck B. Smith C.A. Müller Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3461-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,8Dahlbäck B. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11631-11634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synchrotron x-ray scattering and hydrodynamic analysis suggested that C4BP, in solution, is a bundle of seven extended arms held together at their C termini with an average arm-axis angle of 10° rather than being a spider-like molecule (9Perkins S.J. Chung L.P. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). C4BP interacts not only with C4b (3Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) but also with protein S (single binding site on β-chain) (10Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

C4BP controls C4b-mediated reactions, thereby regulating the classical pathway of complement. Apart from acting as a cofactor to factor I, C4BP also accelerates the natural decay of the C4bC2a complex, which is the classical pathway C3 convertase (14Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). C4, which is the precursor of C4b, is composed of a 93-kDa α-chain, a β-chain (75 kDa), and a 32-kDa γ-chain, which are linked by disulfide bridges (15Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp.

Morris S. Tack B. Prahl J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2008-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During complement activation, C1s cleaves a 9-kDa fragment (C4a) from the N terminus of the α-chain (18Budzko D.B. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Immunochemistry. 1970; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Patrick R.A.T., S.B. Lepow I.H. Immunochemistry. 1970; 7: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The remaining part of the molecule (C4b) acquires transient capability to bind amino and hydroxyl groups via a reactive glutamyl residue that is exposed upon cleavage of an internal thiolester bond (20Law S.K.A. Lichtenberg N.A. Holcombe F.H. Levine R.P. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 634-639PubMed Google Scholar). C4b-like molecules can also be generated from C4 by treatment with amines, chaotropes, or repeated freezing and thawing, which result in the cleavage of the internal thiolester bond without liberation of C4a (21Zabern I. Bloom E. Chu V. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1433-1438PubMed Google Scholar). Each α-chain of C4BP contains a C4b binding site, but, most likely due to sterical hindrance, only up to four C4b molecules can bind to one C4BP molecule (22Ziccardi R.J. Dahlbäck B.

Our earlier studies suggested that calcitriol induces translocation of cytoplasmic VDR, but the physiologic relevance of this finding remained uncertain. Previous studies demonstrated that the activation function 2 domain (AF-2) plays an essential role in VDR transactivation. To elucidate hormone-dependent VDR translocation and its role, we constructed green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras with full-length VDR (VDR-GFP), AF-2-truncated VDR (AF-2del-VDR-GFP), and ligand-binding domain (LBD)-truncated VDR (LBDdel-VDR-GFP). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with these constructs. Western blot analysis, fluorescent microscopy, and transactivation assays showed that the generated chimeras are expressed and fluoresce and that VDR-GFP is transcriptionally active. After hormone treatment, cytoplasmic VDR-GFP translocated to the nucleus in a concentration-, time-, temperature-, and analog-specific manner. Hormone dose-response relationships for translocation and for transactivation were similar. Truncation of LBD and truncation of AF-2 each abolished hormone-dependent translocation and transactivation.

The hormonally active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, is the principal regulator of calcium homeostasis and also regulates hormone secretion, immune functions, cell proliferation, and differentiation (1DeLuca H.F. Zierold C. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56 (Discussion, S54–S75): S4-S10Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, VDR undergoes an activation process. The mechanism and the regulatory steps involved in this activation process are under intense investigation. An understanding of these activation steps offers possibilities for selective pharmacological modulation of steroid hormone actions. Recent studies showed that steroid receptor activation involves conformational changes (2Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. Macdonald P.N. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The activation process of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), androgen receptor, and progesterone receptor also includes a translocation of these receptors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. For many years, however, VDR has been considered to reside exclusively in the nucleus even without hormone (8Clemens T.L. Garrett K.P. Zhou X.Y. Pike J.W. Haussler M.R. Dempster D.W.

Nevertheless, subcellular distribution of VDR remained controversial. Dynamic studies were needed in living cells to clarify the intracellular localization of VDR and to investigate the physiologic significance of a VDR translocation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras with other steroid hormone receptors were used recently to demonstrate hormone-induced translocation (13Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc.

This approach allows introduction of mutated steroid hormone receptors into GFP chimeras to explore the role of particular domains in receptor trafficking and steroid hormone actions. Recent studies showed that a segment of VDR close to the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), called the activation function 2 domain (AF-2) plays a primary role in conducting the hormonal signal to the VDR-dependent genes (18Nakajima S. Yamagata M. Sakai N. Ozono K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The role of AF-2 domain in receptor trafficking has not been investigated. In the present study, we developed VDR-GFP chimeras to study subcellular distribution of VDR, to clarify the existence of a hormone-dependent translocation of VDR, and to investigate the possibility that translocation is part of the activation process. A GFP chimera with a truncated AF-2 region of VDR was used to investigate the role of hormone-dependent translocation in VDR function. We report here that a subset of VDR is translocating from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in a hormone analog-, dose-, time-, and temperature-dependent fashion. This translocation requires an intact AF-2 region. The close correlation between hormone-induced translocation and transactivation further supports a model for VDR activation that includes hormone-dependent translocation. The GFP gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pQBI25 plasmid (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) as template with Pwo proofreading DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).HindIII and KpnI restriction sites were inserted into the pQBI25 plasmid before the GFP gene. The wild-type VDR and the two truncated VDR sequences were also amplified by PCR, using the pAV-hVDR plasmid as template (gift from Dr. J. Wesley Pike, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH). The generated amplicons (wild-type containing amino acids 1–427, AF-2-truncated containing amino acids 1–421, and LBD-truncated containing amino acids 1–294) were inserted into the modified pQBI25 plasmid between theHindIII and KpnI sites. The DNA sequences of all generated constructs (VDR-GFP, AF-2del-VDR-GFP, and LBDdel-VDR-GFP) were verified using dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). Cells grown in 165-cm2 flasks were mock-transfected or transfected with 15 μg of VDR, VDR-GFP, AF-2del-VDR-GFP, or LBDdel-VDR-GFP plasmids by LipofectAMINE Plus reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). In another experiment, each flask of cells was transfected with 30 μg of plasmids. After allowing for receptor expression for 24, 48, or 72 h in the absence of hormone, high salt extract was prepared as described before (25Smith C.L. Hager G.L. Pike J.W. Marx S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, resuspended in high salt buffer containing 300 mm KCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml aprotinin (Sigma) and then sonicated. Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h, and the resultant supernatants were desalted and concentrated using Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Concentrated supernatants were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C in Tris-glycine sample buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA) with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and kept at −70 °C. For controls, purified GFP (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and a high salt extract from VDR overexpressing 293 cells (25Smith C.L. Hager G.L. Pike J.W. Marx S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were used. Samples containing 5 μg of protein were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), and after electrophoretic fractionation, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk and then with avidin/biotin blocking kit reagents (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then subjected to Western blot analysis using VD2F12 anti-VDR (a gift from Dr. Hector F. DeLuca, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) or polyclonal anti-GFP (CLONTECH) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were from Sigma and Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence kit reagents and protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown on 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). COS-7 cells were selected because they are deficient in expressing endogenous VDR. Cells were transfected by diethyl aminoethyl dextran method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with or without one of the three expression plasmids (0.05 μg/well), the luciferase reporter plasmid p24OH/LUC-23 (0.8 μg/well) (gift from Dr. Hector F. DeLuca), and the β-galactosidase standardization plasmid pGL3 (1.2 μg/well) (Promega, Madison, WI). Total DNA amount was equalized by adding sheared herring DNA. The p24OH/LUC-23 plasmid encodes a luciferase that is under the control of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase promoter (26Arbour N.C. Ross T.K. Zierold C. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated with graded doses of either calcitriol (Solvay Duphar, Weesp, The Netherlands), 20-epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a-trihomo-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (KH1060) (gift of Leo Pharmaceuticals, Ballerup, Denmark), cholecalciferol (D3) (Sigma), or vehicle for 48 h. Cells were lysed on the plates, and both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. Luciferase detection reagents were from Promega. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by spectrophotometry using reagents from Sigma. Luminescence data were normalized to β-galactosidase values and expressed as fold induction relative to ethanol-treated controls. Experiments were done at least twice, with triplicate samples. Data are presented as means ± 1 S.E. Whereas most of the microscopy experiments were done using COS-7 cells, subcellular distribution of VDR-GFP was also evaluated in ROS17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells (gift from G. A.

Cells were subcultured into 2-chamber glass coverslip slides (Nalge Nunc Int., Naperville, IL) and then transfected with 0.2 μg/well plasmid by LipofectAMINE Plus reagents. Cells were used within 48 h after transfection. Vehicle or hormones were added in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% dextrose. For studies on living cells, an incubator was built around the microscope to maintain controlled 37 °C temperature. Pictures were taken of living cells before and after hormone treatment from multiple fields with 10% attenuation and 8 line averaging. For real time imaging, pictures were taken every 15 s from the same microscopy field at 30% attenuation of 50% laser power. Morphometric analysis was performed using pictures of fixed cells. After hormone or vehicle treatment, cells were fixed in −20 °C methanol for 1 min. Images were collected with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 fluorescent microscope equipped with an LSM410 laser scanning unit (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). The 488 nm line of a krypton-argon laser was used for excitation with a bandpass 510–525 nm emission filter. 50 images were collected from each sample, using a 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective with constant acquisition parameters. For evaluation of nuclear/cytoplasmic signal distribution, confocal images were taken of each fluorescing cell at the highest circumference of the nuclei. 60–80 cells were evaluated for each experimental condition. Cells that showed clear morphological changes due to protein overexpression were excluded from the statistical analysis. Fluorescence intensities and area measurement values were obtained from nuclei, cytoplasm, and an area in the background using the Area Measure function of the laser scanning microscope software (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Integrated fluorescence values were calculated by multiplying mean brightness with the respective area values. The ratios of nuclear integrated fluorescence and whole cell integrated fluorescence were corrected for background brightness of the same picture. Data are presented as mean ± 1 S.E. To develop a physiologically relevant model for studying intracellular trafficking of VDR, we generated a series of VDR-GFP chimeras with a highly fluorescent GFP variant fused in frame to the C terminus of the human VDR. A Gly-Ala linker was used between the VDR and GFP to provide a flexible link between the two proteins. In addition to the chimera containing the wild-type VDR (VDR-GFP), two other chimeras were generated, one with a truncated AF-2 region (AF-2del-VDR-GFP), and another with a large deletion within the ligand-binding region (LBDdel-VDR-GFP). In the AF-2del-VDR-GFP, six amino acids were deleted at the C terminus of VDR. This deletion severely compromise hormone-dependent transactivation capacity (28May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Gill R.K. Atkins L.M. Hollis B.W. Bell N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the LBDdel-VDR-GFP, we generated the same mutation that was identified in cells from one of our patients with hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets (30Bliziotes M. Yergey A.L. Nanes M.S. Muenzer J. Begley M.G. Vieira N.E. Kher K.K. Brandi M.L. Marx S.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 66: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the resulting truncated protein does not bind hormone and does not activate VDR target genes (31Wiese R.J. Goto H. Prahl J.M. Marx S.J. Thomas M. al-Aqeel A. DeLuca H.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fusion protein expression was monitored by both microscopy and Western blot analysis in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Microscopy showed the presence of fluorescent proteins as early as 4 h after transfection, and a maximal expression after 24 h. To verify whether the predicted size proteins were expressed, we prepared high salt protein extracts 48 h after transfection with 15-μg plasmids for each flask of cells. Using Western blot analysis, fusion proteins were detected with both the anti-GFP and the anti-VDR antibodies (Fig. 1). We detected immunoreactivity with both antibodies for a 77-kDa band in the VDR-GFP extract (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 3), a 76-kDa band in the AF-2del-VDR-GFP extract (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 4), and a 61-kDa band in the LBDdel-VDR-GFP extract (Fig. 1,A and B, lane 5), which were the expected molecular masses for the chimeric proteins. No significant degradation products, incorrectly expressed proteins, 27-kDa GFP (compare with purified GFP on Fig. 1 A, lane 2), or 50-kDa VDR (compare with extract from VDR overexpressing cells on Fig. 1 B, lane 2) was detected in the extracts from cells expressing chimeric proteins. However, in samples prepared after transfection with more plasmids or with longer posttranscription time, degradation products were detectable (data not shown). Based on these data, in subsequent experiments care was taken to minimize overexpression and protein degradation by using relatively low plasmid concentrations and by minimizing the time for expression. Transcriptional activation capacities of the full-length and truncated VDR-GFP fusion proteins were determined by a luciferase reporter assay in COS-7 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When VDR-GFP-transfected cells were stimulated by 10 nmcalcitriol, the reporter gene was activated by 13-fold (Fig.2). No activation above the endogenous level was detected after 10 nm calcitriol treatment in cells that were transfected with AF-2del-VDR-GFP or LBDdel-VDR-GFP. No activation was detected after exposure to D3 in cells transfected by either full-length or truncated VDR-GFP constructs (Fig.2). These data demonstrated that the transiently expressed VDR-GFP is transcriptionally active in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, VDR-GFP transcriptional activity is calcitriol analog-specific and is also contingent upon an intact ligand-binding domain. For microscopy, VDR-GFP was transiently expressed in various types of cultured cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” VDR-GFP fluorescence was easily detectable in every type of cell tested, and the subcellular distribution was also similar regardless of cell type. Without hormone treatment, fluorescence from unliganded VDR-GFP was detected both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Figs. 3, A, C, andE, and 4 A). The cytoplasmic distribution was homogeneous in most cells, but in a subpopulation of cells VDR-GFP concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 A). Within the nucleus, unliganded VDR-GFP distributed homogeneously, with the exclusion of the nucleoli. Significant cell-to-cell differences in the nuclear/cytoplasmic brightness ratios were apparent within the same cell population. Whereas some cells contained the receptors predominantly in the cytoplasm, most cells had the same brightness in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, and occasionally the nucleus appeared moderately brighter than the cytoplasm. Experiments with higher plasmid concentration for transfection or with longer time after transfection showed that overexpressing cells often had large fluorescent clumps in the cytoplasm and within the nucleus and that fluorescence increased disproportionately in the nucleus.Figure 4Real time recording shows calcitriol-induced VDR-GFP translocation into the nucleus. COS-7 cells were grown on chambered coverglasses and transfected with VDR-GFP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 4 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 nm calcitriol at 37 °C. Translocation of VDR-GFP was followed up by confocal microscopy. Images were taken before hormone treatment (A) and 6 (B), 10 (C), 12 (D), 14 (E), 20 (F), 25 (G), and 30 (H) min after hormone treatment. Arrowheads point to plasma membrane (P), nucleus (N), intranuclear foci (f), and nucleolus (n). Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the VDR-GFP expressing cells were treated with 100 nmcalcitriol for 30 min at 37 °C, the fluorescent signal from the cytoplasm shifted into the nucleus (Fig. 3, B, D, andF). After hormone treatment, the cytoplasm became dark, and the nuclear fluorescence intensity significantly increased. This hormone dependent translocation was apparent in every cell line that we studied. Within the nucleus after hormone treatment, the fluorescence distribution became more heterogeneous; in some cells, small foci were detected, but the nucleoli remained void of receptors (Fig. 3). To demonstrate that the shift in fluorescence intensity from the cytoplasm into the nucleus after hormone treatment represents true translocation of receptors, real-time imaging was carried out on single COS-7 cells by confocal microscopy during hormone treatment. Care was taken to maintain constant 37 °C temperature and to minimize photodamage. Viability of cells after imaging was tested by monitoring membrane integrity and subsequent cell division. Translocation was detected as early as 5 min after hormone treatment and completed within 25–30 min (Fig. 4). First, receptors moved from the periphery of the cell into the perinuclear region (Fig. 4,B and C). During this time, receptors along the plasma membrane became visible (Fig. 4 D,at P). These receptors moved from the plasma membrane into the nucleus at later time points (Fig. 4, G and H). Perinuclear vacuoli, characteristic of this cell type, remained dark during translocation. After 5 min with calcitriol, a gradual increase in nuclear fluorescence paralleled a decrease in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4,C–H). After 30 min, cytoplasmic fluorescence was minimal (Fig. 4 H). No additional translocation was detected when cells were followed up to 2 h. After removal of hormone, cytoplasmic fluorescence was restored within 30 min (data not shown). Similar hormone-dependent translocations were recorded in melanoma cells (data not shown). Although it is apparent in Fig. 3,A, C, and E, and in Fig. 4 A that VDR-GFP can move into the nucleus without hormone treatment, these experiments conclusively demonstrated that calcitriol induces the translocation of the cytoplasmic VDR-GFP into the nucleus. COS-7 cells were used for quantitative characterization of hormone-dependent translocation of VDR-GFP. Because COS-7 cells are deficient in VDR, the motion rate of VDR-GFP was not influenced by the motion rate of unlabeled VDR which would homodimerize with labeled VDR in other types of cells. Images were taken from fixed cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We used methanol fixation because preliminary experiments showed that this fixation method causes the least change in cytoplasm/nucleus VDR-GFP distribution (data not shown), but this fixation still caused changes in intranuclear distribution. The most noticeable change was that the nucleoli were no longer void of receptors after fixation (compare Fig. 4 and Fig.5 C). Previous studies with GFP chimeras, as well as our preliminary experiments, showed that fluorescence intensities in cell compartments are measures of receptor number. We therefore determined the integrated brightness values from the cytoplasm and nucleus at each condition. Statistical analysis of data allowed characterization of the translocation process, despite the inhomogeneity of nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution. Our data show that before hormone treatment, only about 25% of total cellular VDR-GFP fluorescence is in the nucleus (Fig.5 A). After hormone treatment for 30 min, the nuclear fluorescence increased to about 70% of the total cellular fluorescence. This change reflects a hormone-dependent movement of half the VDR-GFP into the nucleus. Analysis of the time course of VDR-GFP translocation shows a half-maximal response 15 min after calcitriol and slightly earlier (∼13 min) after the same dose of the more potent analog, KH1060. Temperature sensitivity was tested to verify whether hormone dependent translocation of VDR-GFP is an active process. Transfected cells were treated with hormone at 4 °C, at room temperature, and at 37 °C. After 30 min with hormone, translocation was detected only at 37 °C (Fig. 5, B and C). If translocation were driven by diffusion, we would detect a shift of receptors from the cytoplasm into the nucleus at room temperature. However, we did not find translocation at 20 °C or lower temperatures, suggesting that motion is driven by an energy-dependent mechanism. To characterize concentration dependence of VDR-GFP translocation, images were taken from fixed cells before and 30 min after exposure to graded doses of hormones. Fig.6 shows that a small shift of fluorescence from the cytoplasm into the nucleus is detectable with 100 pm of calcitriol or 10 pm of KH1060. Half-maximal translocation was at 5 nm or 10 pmof calcitriol or KH1060, respectively (Fig. 6). When hormone-dose dependence of translocation is compared with hormone dose dependence of transactivation, the similarities of these two functions become clear. Half-maximally effective dose for calcitriol to induce transcription was also 5 nm, and for KH1060, it was 10 pm. These data show that KH1060 is more potent than calcitriol in inducing both translocation and transactivation by the full-length VDR-GFP and suggest that translocation is part of the receptor activation process. Hormone-induced changes in receptor functions are characterized by hormone analog specificity and by a dependence on the structural integrity of the receptor protein. To test the hormone-dependent translocation of VDR-GFP, we compared the effects of different hormone analogs on VDR-GFP translocation. Saturating doses of calcitriol induced complete receptor translocation (Fig. 7). The same"
https://openalex.org/W2029937030,"EmrE is a 12-kDa Escherichia colimultidrug transporter that confers resistance to a wide variety of toxic reagents by actively removing them in exchange for hydrogen ions. The three native Cys residues in EmrE are inaccessible toN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and a series of other sulfhydryls. In addition, each of the three residues can be replaced with Ser without significant loss of activity. A protein without all the three Cys residues (Cys-less) has been generated and shown to be functional. Using this Cys-less protein, we have now generated a series of 48 single Cys replacements throughout the protein. The majority of them (43) show transport activity as judged from the ability of the mutant proteins to confer resistance against toxic compounds and from in vitro analysis of their activity in proteoliposomes. Here we describe the use of these mutants to study the accessibility to NEM, a membrane permeant sulfhydryl reagent. The study has been done systematically so that in one transmembrane segment (TMS2) each single residue was replaced. In each of the other three transmembrane segments, at least four residues covering one turn of the helix were replaced. The results show that although the residues in putative hydrophilic loops readily react with NEM, none of the residues in putative transmembrane domains are accessible to the reagent. The results imply very tight packing of the protein without any continuous aqueous domain. Based on the findings described in this work, we conclude that in EmrE the substrates are translocated through a hydrophobic pathway.

EmrE is a highly hydrophobic 12-kDa protein that has been purified by taking advantage of its unique solubility in organic solvents. After solubilization and purification, it retains its ability to transport as judged from the fact that it can be reconstituted in a functional form (5Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the sequence yielded four putative transmembrane domains of similar sizes. Results from transmission Fourier transform infrared measurements agree remarkably well with this hypothesis and yielded α-helical estimates of 78 and 80% for EmrE in the organic solvent mixture (CHCl3, MeOH) and 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphocholine, respectively (6Arkin I. Russ W. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphocholine bilayer most of the amide groups in the protein do not undergo amide-proton hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange implying that most (∼80%) of the residues are embedded in the lipid. In addition, EmrE is the first polytopic membrane protein of this size that has been studied by high resolution NMR. A series of heteronuclear (1H-15N) two- and three-dimensional experiments as well as few triple resonance experiments were applied to the 110-residue protein and led to the assignment of 1H,15N, and a large part of the 13C backbone, as well as many of the side chain resonances. A preliminary analysis of the secondary structure, based on sequential nuclear Overhauser enhancements connectivities, deviation of chemical shifts from random coil values, and 3J(HNHa)-coupling constants, supports a model where the protein forms four α-helices: residues 4–26 (TMS1),132–53 (TMS2), 58–76 (TMS3), and 85–106 (TMS4) (7Schwaiger M. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. Coles M. Groger A. Schwarz A. Schuldiner S. Kessler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). EmrE is functional as a homo-oligomer as suggested by co-reconstitution experiments of wild type protein with three different inactive mutants in which negative dominance has been observed (8Yerushalmi H.

In this work we use the scanning cysteine accessibility method to assess the exposure of residues at various positions in the protein. The scanning cysteine accessibility method is based on the generation of mutants in which unique reactive Cys residues are implanted at desired positions. Each mutant protein is then challenged with various sulfhydryl reagents so as to assess the exposure and reactivity of the Cys residue. The scanning cysteine accessibility method was successfully used to identify residues exposed to the aqueous translocation pathway of ligand-activated channels and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (9Akabas M.

However, other studies have clearly identified reactive residues in these regions (15Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

The reactive residues are thought to delineate water-filled cavities that may represent the substrate translocation pathway. Indeed, in some cases the residues were shown to be located in the vicinity of the binding site of the hydrophilic substrates (16Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R.

In striking contrast with the findings for the other ion-coupled transporters, the results with EmrE suggest the existence of a hydrophobic pathway through which the substrates are translocated.

In plasmid pKK56-CL, EmrE is cloned into EcoRI andHindIII sites of pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In addition, the three cysteines (Cys39, Cys41, and Cys95) have been replaced with Ser (19Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21193-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the overlap extension procedure described by Ho et al. (21Ho S.F. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). For each mutation a set of two overlapping oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were constructed. The outside primers were those used for the wild type EmrE (5Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The template was always CL-EmrE. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were prepared incorporating a unique restriction site to facilitate mutant identification, and in several cases this required an additional conservative mutation. Mutated DNA was identified by the acquisition of the new restriction site and sequenced (ABI PRISMTM 377, Perkin-Elmer) to ensure that no other mutations occurred during the amplification process. For testing resistance to toxic compounds, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB-Amp medium. 5 μl of serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures (10−1–10−6) were spotted on plates containing the desired compounds as indicated for each experiment. Growth was visualized after 24 h at 37 °C. The assay was repeated at least three times for each mutant. E. coli JM109 transformed with the appropriate plasmid was grown in minimal medium A supplemented with glycerol (0.5%), thiamine (2.5 μg/ml), ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and a mixture of amino acids (MEM amino acids; Sigma). When the culture reached anA 600 = 0.9, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to 0.5 mm; 2 h later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. EmrE was extracted essentially as described (5Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) from 50 mg of cells (wet weight) with 550 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) incubated for 20 min on ice. For phase separation 110 μl of H2O were added, and the suspension was centrifuged. The upper phase was removed, and 4 volumes of acetone were added to the lower phase. After at least 1 h at −20 °C, EmrE was collected by centrifugation, washed with cold acetone, and dried. For analysis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the sample was resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed in 16% gels as described (22Schagger H. Jagow G.v. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). For reconstitution, 4–9 μg of extracted protein was mixed withE. coli phospholipids (18 μl of a suspension of 50 mg/ml in water diluted prior to the experiment in 180 μl of chloroform:methanol, 1:2) and 750 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The suspension was dried with Argon and resuspended in a solution (60 μl) containing 0.18 m NH4Cl, 0.015m Tris-HCl, pH 6.9. The suspension was kept at −70 °C. Before the assay, the proteoliposome suspension was thawed and sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for a few seconds until clear. Transport of [14C]methyl viologen into proteoliposomes was assayed by dilution of 3 μl of the ammonium chloride containing proteoliposomes into 200 μl of an ammonium-free medium containing 35 μm[14C]methyl viologen (90 nCi), 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Tricine, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5. At given times the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice cold solution, filtering through Schleicher & Schull filters (0.2 μm), and washing with an additional 2 ml of solution. The radioactivity on the filters was estimated by liquid scintillation. In each experiment the values obtained in a control reaction with 5 μm nigericin were subtracted from all experimental points. This background was between 5 and 10% of the experimental values. The assay was done in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Cells (50 mg of wet weight) were suspended in 500 μl of a solution containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgSO4. [14C]NEM (NEN Life Science Products) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (2 Ci/mol). After 20 min at room temperature the reaction was stopped by addition of 20 mmdithiothreitol. After 10 min 1 ml of above buffer was added, and the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with the same buffer. EmrE was extracted from the pellet as described above and analyzed in SDS gels. The amount of EmrE in each mutant was estimated from the Coomassie-stained gels. The amount of radioactivity associated with EmrE was quantitated after exposure of the gel to a Phosphorimager FUJIX BAS 100. The assay was repeated at least three times for each mutant protein. The CL-EmrE protein displays significant transport activity and therefore provides a good starting point for generation of mutant proteins with single Cys replacements. In this work we report the results obtained after replacing all the amino acids (starting at position 28 and continuing up to position 57) in TMS2 and its adjacent loops (Fig. 1). In addition, at least four mutants (one helical turn) were analyzed in each of the other TMSs and one in each hydrophilic loop (Fig. 1), a total of 48 single Cys replacements. The activity of each of the mutant proteins has been tested in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the resistance conferred by each of the proteins was assessed by testing the ability of cells expressing them to grow under otherwise nonpermissive conditions. This was achieved in solid media containing either ethidium (200 μg/ml), acriflavine (100 μg/ml), or methyl viologen (0.1 mm) in which 5 μl of logarithmic dilutions of an overnight culture were spotted (Fig. 2, three right panels). Cells carrying the vector plasmid without any insert cannot grow in these media at any of the dilutions tested. Cells expressing either wild type EmrE or the CL-EmrE were able to grow at each of the dilutions. At the high dilutions (10−3–10−5), the single colonies observed displayed a similar size indicating similar growth rates. As expected (not shown) all the cells grew to a similar degree in control plates containing only ampicillin and none of the toxic compounds. This assay provides a dynamic range to qualitatively analyze activity of the mutants generated. We assume that growth at dilutions of 10−3–10−5 is a result of robust EmrE activity. Growth on ethidium is taken as the standard because, as will be seen below, in some mutants the specificity toward other substrates maybe modified. In TMS2 and the adjacent loops, 28 of the 30 mutants generated were capable of conferring significant resistance to ethidium. Most (25 mutants) were indistinguishable from the wild type; growth was observed also at dilutions of 10−4 or 10−5. Two mutant proteins (Y40C and F44C) conferred no measurable resistance. Three mutant proteins (V34C, C41, and I54C) seemed to be less effective than the wild type. The results for mutants in the other TMS are summarized in Fig.3. In TMS1 single unique replacements were generated distal and terminal to the essential glutamyl residue at position 14 (8Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins I11C, L12C, A13C, V15C, I16C, G17C, and T18C were tested for function (Fig. 3). Although T18C and I11C showed no activity, G17C displayed some marginal activity. The other four mutants displayed an activity indistinguishable from that of the wild type protein. Mutants in TMS3, S72C, L73C, L74C, and S75C displayed resistance to ethidium similar to wild type. Mutants in TMS4, I94C, C95, A96C, and G97C displayed wild type activity, whereas L93C showed no activity at all in this assay. Cysteine replacements in loops 4 and 5 (L83C and H110C) exhibited full activity. The levels of resistance to different substrates are being used here to obtain a very qualitative idea of the activity of the various mutants. However, no absolute quantitation can be made because the levels of expression of EmrE do differ among the various mutants. Notwithstanding this limitation, several important conclusions can be made. Five mutant proteins are incapable of conferring measurable resistance: I11C and T18C in TMS1, Y40C and F44C in TMS2, and L93C in TMS4. Except for I11C and T18C, the mutants are not expressed to detectable levels even under full induction of expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (not shown). These residues may play a role in folding and stability of the protein. All the other mutants tested, albeit expressed to diverse levels, are capable of conferring some degree of resistance to ethidium. We conclude that with the exception of the above mentioned residues, each one of the other 43 residues tested can be replaced with Cys and produces a mutant protein that maintains an activity significant enough to confer resistance to ethidium. The fact that such a large number of residues are so permissive has been observed with other transporters as well (12Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that even residues (such as Val15, Arg29, Pro32, Leu47, Thr50, Pro55, Ile94, and Gly97) that are highly conserved in the family of the MiniTEXANs (1Schuldiner S. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 335-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Tam R. Saler M.H. Turner R.J. Weiner J.H. Goldberg E.B. Grinius L.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) can be replaced without loss of phenotypic complementation. The conservation of these residues may be necessary for functions other than the one measured and/or for stability of the protein. EmrE is a multidrug transporter and, as such, transports a variety of toxic substrates. The specificity of all the mutants to several substrates has been compared using the phenotypic assay described above (Figs. 2 and 3). In general, growth in the presence of acriflavine yielded a pattern very similar to that displayed in ethidium with the exception of three mutants in TMS3 that displayed a decreased resistance to this toxic agent: S72C, L74C, and S75C (Fig. 3). A few strains in TMS2 (V34C, T36C, A52C, and I54C) also showed some decrease of resistance to acriflavine (Fig. 2). More dramatic differences were detected when growth was challenged with 0.1 mm methyl viologen. Mutants A48C and A52C that showed robust resistance to ethidium and acriflavine show no resistance to methyl viologen. I54C showed a very significant resistance to ethidium and acriflavine but no resistance to methyl viologen. A few others are also noteworthy: V34C, T36C, C41, A42C, L47C, Q49C, and G57C displayed 2–3 orders of magnitude less resistance to methyl viologen, relative to the others (Fig. 2). All the mutant proteins have been purified and assayed for ΔpH driven [14C]methyl viologen uptake activity in proteoliposomes. Most of them (34 mutants) display significant levels of transport that range between 200 and 2000 pmol/min/mg. In addition to the five mutant proteins that do not display any activity in vivo, a few others lose practically all their activity (<100 pmol/min/mg protein) upon purification. Even though they display activity in vivo, no activity was detected with protein extracted from: L12C and A13C in TMS 1; P32C, P55C, T56C, and G57C in the loops either distal or proximal to TMS2; and S72C and L74C in TMS3. These residues may be important for the proper folding after the organic solvent treatment or for proper reconstitution into the proteoliposomes. Other assays, independent of the extraction with organic solvents, are now being developed to further test this phenomenon. We have previously shown that the activity of the wild type protein is unaffected by exposure to NEM and other sulfhydryls even at high concentrations (19Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21193-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We interpreted these results as suggesting that the Cys residues are not accessible to NEM. We now confirm this conclusion by directly measuring accessibility of the Cys residues to [14C]NEM and extend our studies to all the single Cys replacements generated. Each mutant protein was challenged with the radiolabel in the intact cell. It was then partially purified, and the radioactivity associated with it was measured after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using this experimental protocol, neither the wild type protein nor the fully Cys-less protein (CL-EmrE) were labeled at all (Fig. 4). As expected, T28C, a mutant with a Cys residue in a putative hydrophilic loop, was fully labeled. From quantitation of the amount of radioactivity incorporated and the protein in the gel, it can be estimated that about 1 mol of [14C]NEM was incorporated per mol of T28C. To demonstrate that the lack of labeling of the wild type protein is due to a structural constraint, EmrE was denatured with a mixture of 2% SDS and 8 m urea. Under these conditions all three Cys residues are fully accessible, and about 3 mol NEM are incorporated per mol EmrE. As expected, no further increase in the labeling level was observed under these conditions in either CL or T28C. These results confirm our hypothesis that the Cys residues in the wild type protein are inaccessible to NEM and allow for a detailed study of the reactivity of Cys at each one of the mutants generated. The above experimental paradigm was used to assess the level of labeling of all the functional single Cys replacements generated in this work. The results in Fig. 5 describe the labeling of residues in TMS2 and the adjacent loops. A distinct pattern of labeling was observed in which three domains are apparent: in the first group (from Thr28 to Ser33) all the residues were labeled, although to varying degrees (between 30 and 100%). We suggest that these residues are exposed to solvent and form part of loop 2. A similar conclusion is reached with another group of residues starting at Tyr53 and continuing to Gly57. We conclude that these residues form part of loop 3. A very different behavior is observed with a large group of residues inaccessible to [14C]NEM. This group includes all the residues at positions 34–52. In several mutants (V34C, T36C, A42C, S43C, L46C, and T50C), there was no measurable radioactivity associated with the protein. In the others, with two exceptions, the level was significant but always lower than 10%. The only two mutants in this domain that are labeled to levels of about 20% are Q49C and L51C. To assess the rates of labeling, two fully accessible mutants were compared with two that are not labeled. Although both T50C and T36C are not labeled even after 2 h incubation, T28C and G57C are fully labeled after 5–10 min (data not shown). To show that the lack of labeling is due to structural constraints, all the proteins that are inaccessible to [14C]NEM in the intact cell were challenged with the label after purification and solubilization in the presence of 2% SDS. Most of the mutant proteins reacted with the sulfhydryl reagent under these conditions (data not shown). However, three of them, V34C, L47C, and A48C, were accessible only upon treatment with harsher denaturing conditions (2% SDS and 8m urea). A similar picture is uncovered when the accessibility of residues in the other three TMS is analyzed. The results of this study are summarized in Fig. 6. In each TMS, at least four contiguous residues were replaced with Cys and challenged with NEM. In TMS1, L12C, A13C, and I16C were nearly completely inaccessible. Low labeling of mutants V15C (13% of T28C) and G17C (20% of T28C) was observed (Fig. 6). In TMS3, mutants S72C, L73C, and L74C showed no reactivity whatsoever, whereas S75C was labeled to a low (23% of T28C) but significant degree. In TMS4, mutants I94C, C95, A96C, and G97C were not labeled to any measurable degree. As expected, residues in hydrophilic loops 4 (L83C) and 5 (H110C) were fully labeled. Only a very small number of residues appear essential to EmrE function. In this work we describe the generation of single Cys replacements in 48 residues, about 50% of the protein, and nearly all of them (43 residues) show a measurable activity. Also, 7 of the 8 charged residues in the protein can be replaced without loss of activity. 3H. Yerushalmi and S. Schuldiner, unpublished results. Interestingly, even residues conserved in the family can be replaced without loss of activity. As mentioned above, the conservation may be necessary for functions other than the ones we are testing. Among the inactive mutants, in three cases (Y40C, F44C, and L93C) the protein is not detectable at measurable levels and therefore little can be concluded about the role of these residues on catalytic activity. It is possible that they play a role in folding, insertion, or stability of the protein. Replacement of Ile11 and Thr18 with Cys yields practically inactive proteins. It is interesting that both Ile11 and Thr18 are located at a distance of about one helical turn from the Glu14, the only charged residue in the putative membrane domain. Glu14 cannot be replaced even with Asp, suggesting a central role in the catalytic cycle (8Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Tam R. Saler M.H. Turner R.J. Weiner J.H. Goldberg E.B. Grinius L.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).3 The role of both residues needs to be studied further by a more detailed characterization of the mutant proteins and by replacements with other amino acids. In addition to Ile11, Glu14, and Thr18 only two other residues, Tyr60 and Trp63 in TMS3, have been previously shown to be important for activity. Even substitution with other aromatic amino acids caused a complete loss of activity (8Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The finding that most residues of ion-coupled transporters can be replaced without serious impairment of function has already been described and discussed in extensive studies of the E. coli lac permease (16Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In these studies, only six positions (of 417 positions) are clearly irreplaceable. It has been suggested that the role of most of the nonessential amino acids may be to provide a structural scaffold. In our studies, mutagenesis of two groups of residues has generated proteins with modified specificity to at least one of the substrates of EmrE. Practically all replacements in TMS3 display decreased resistance to acriflavine. In TMS2, a total of eight mutants show a significant decreased resistance to methyl viologen. They seem to cluster on two faces of the α-helix (Fig. 7): one group at positions 36, 47, and 54 and the other group at positions 34, 41, 48, and 52 with 42 somewhat close to this cluster. Interestingly, the first group is in the same face of two proteins that are not expressed (Y40C and F44C). These mutants provide an excellent tool for further investigation of the location of the binding contacts of substrates. The results described in this work demonstrate that all the residues in putative membrane domains of EmrE are practically inaccessible to [14C]NEM (Fig. 1). The reaction of maleimides with sulfhydryl groups involves addition of mercaptide ions in the protein to the olefinic double bond (25Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, Inc., San Francisco, CA1971Google Scholar). Therefore low levels of labeling may result from either one of the following reasons or a combination of them: steric hindrance, lack of ionization of the sulfhydryl group, or low reactivity because of neighboring residues. NEM is a relatively hydrophobic and small maleimide that can freely cross lipid membranes. The latter contention is supported in this work by the fact that residues in all the hydrophilic loops are fully accessible. In loops 2 (residues Thr28 to Ser33) and 3 (Tyr53 to Gly57), all the residues react with NEM. The lower reactivity of some of the residues in hydrophilic loops (such as at the position of Leu30) may reflect steric hindrance, because clearly its neighbors react quantitatively. Residues at positions Pro32 and Ser33 and Tyr53 to Gly56 may be at the edge of the membrane domain. In loop 4 and at the C terminus one residue was tested, and they were shown to be fully accessible to NEM. In contrast, none of the residues in putative transmembrane domains reacted with NEM to a significant degree. In this domain some of the sulfhydryl residues face the lipid milieu, and they do not seem to be able to release their proton and therefore cannot react with NEM. As for the rest of the residues, very tight packing of the helices would prevent even relatively small reagents such as NEM from approaching. In the case of other proteins such as the Tn-10 encoded tetracycline/H+ antiporter and the erythrocyte anion exchanger, evidence has been provided that residues in some transmembrane domains are inaccessible to the permeant sulfhydryl reagent NEM (12Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that NEM could be used to identify the membrane embedded domains. However, other studies have clearly identified reactive residues in membrane domains (15Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R.

The reactive residues are thought to delineate water-filled cavities that may represent part of the substrate translocation pathway. Also, in the extensive studies performed with the E. coli lac permease parts of the membrane embedded areas were found inaccessible to NEM. Yet, many others reacted freely with NEM (16Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Indeed, both in thelac permease (16Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and in UhpT (17Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the NEM-reactive residues were shown to be located in the vicinity of the binding site of the hydrophilic substrates. Unlike in the other transporters, in EmrE, every single TMS was shown to be inaccessible to NEM, suggesting that the substrates are not translocated through an hydrophilic pathway. The results described in the present work cannot exclude the presence of a highly selective filter that prevents molecules other than substrates from accessing a putative aqueous pathway in EmrE. However, this possibility is refuted by Fourier transform infrared studies of EmrE in which we found that a large fraction of the amide protons do not readily exchange with solvent deuterium (6Arkin I. Russ W. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, the results described support the model of a tightly packed four helix antiparallel bundle in which the majority of the protein is well embedded in the membrane and not accessible to solvent. The boundaries of the embedded segments as estimated with this technique are in remarkably good agreement with the secondary structure determined from the NMR analysis of the protein (7Schwaiger M. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. Coles M. Groger A. Schwarz A. Schuldiner S. Kessler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the case of EmrE, the substrates are quite hydrophobic, and therefore it maybe energetically more favorable to interact directly with the protein rather than permeate through a water-filled pathway. Movement of substrates through a tightly packed protein must require disruption and reorganization of the existing structure. These types of interaction have been observed in several cases. For example, NMR shows that the singular structures of soluble synthetic four helical bundles adopt a disordered array of states upon binding a hydrophobic heme cofactor. The interaction of the heme with the polypeptide is quite specific and displays a relatively high affinity in the nanomolar range (26Mulholland S.E. Gibney B.R. Rabanal F. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10296-10302Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tetraphenylphosphonium, a high affinity substrate of EmrE, interacts specifically also with BmrR, a transcription activator of the Bmr gene, a Bacillus subtilis multidrug transporter (27Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this protein, the tetraphenylphosphonium binds to a hydrophobic pocket with a key electrostatic component (Glu134) at its bottom (28Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The entrance of tetraphenylphosphonium to the binding pocket occurs after unfolding of a nine-residue α-helix. At present, without further structural information, we can only speculate that a similar type of binding site may exist in EmrE as well where only one negatively charged and essential Glu residue (Glu14) is present in the putative transmembrane domains of the protein. The results presented above also suggest that entrance of the ligand to the binding site may require movement of parts of the protein. We thank Chen Yenover for generating some of the mutants and Dvir Rotem for analysis of the phenotype of various mutants."

Infection of primary B cells with EBVin vitro results in continuous proliferation of latently infected B cells, giving rise to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).

Other data demonstrate that EBNA3C may also directly modulate transcription from the viral Cp promoter as well as expression of the viral LMP1 and the cellular CD21 genes independent of EBNA2 (15Radkov S.A. Bain M. Farrell P.J. West M. Rowe M. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8552-8562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang F. Gregory C. Sample C. Rowe M. Liebowitz D. Murray R. Rickinson A. Kieff E. J.

Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3491-3498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that EBNA2 and EBNA3C cooperate in the course of B cell immortalization on multiple levels, including competition for cellular factors as well as direct modulation of the expression of shared target genes. The studies described here were undertaken to identify additional cellular factors that may participate in this complex regulation. We report the cloning and characterization of DP103, a novel member of the DEAD box family of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases, which was isolated due to its ability to bind to EBNA2 as well as EBNA3C. The rapidly growing DEAD box family includes members from a broad range of pro- as well as eukaryotic organisms (for a review see Ref. 19Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The family's name is derived from the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), one of at least eight highly conserved motifs shared by the family members. The conserved motifs are separated by similar spacings and are arranged in a common core region as represented by the prototype of the family, the DEAD box protein eIF-4A. Based on the observation that this core region harboring the full set of conserved motifs is present in all family members, they are all thought to act as RNA helicases, although helicase activity has been demonstrated for only a minority of DEAD box proteins. In many family members, the core region is flanked by N- or C-terminal extensions sharing little or no sequence homology, suggesting a role for these regions in more specialized functions. DEAD box proteins have been shown to play important roles in cell development, differentiation, and proliferation. They are implicated in nearly all processes that are linked to RNA metabolism, such as translation initiation, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome assembly, mRNA stabilization, and mRNA transport (reviewed in Refs. 19Schmid S.R.

Adherent mammalian cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The insect cell line SF158 (21Knudson D.L. Tinsley T.W. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 934-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kept at 27 °C in TC100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed), 40 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Recombinant baculoviruses His6DP103 expressing the full-length or DP103ΔN expressing an N-terminal truncated DP103 were generated by lipofection (InsectinPlusTM, Invitrogen) of plasmid pBBHis2B:dp103 with Bac-N-BlueTM (Invitrogen) or pACYM1:dp103ΔN with BaculoGold® (PharMingen) DNA, respectively, into SF158 cells as described elsewhere (22Hille A. Klein K. Baumler S. Grasser F.A. Mueller-Lantzsch N. J. Med. Virol. 1993; 39: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing EBNA2 of the type 1 EBV strain M-ABA were described previously (22Hille A. Klein K. Baumler S. Grasser F.A. Mueller-Lantzsch N. J. Med. Virol. 1993; 39: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the full-length EBNA3C with an N-terminally fused His6-tag were a generous gift from Marion Buck and Tom Sculley (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia). The rat monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) R3 directed against EBNA2 and 1H-4 directed against EBNA1 have been described (23Kremmer E. Kranz B. Hille A. Klein K. Eulitz M. Hoffmann-Fezer G. Feiden W.

The mouse mAb A10 directed against EBNA3C (25Maunders M.J. Petti L. Rowe M. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Martin Rowe (University of Wales, Cardiff, UK). For the production of rat mAbs directed against different epitopes of DP103, either amino acids 713–824 or 352–614 of DP103 were expressed in Escherichia coli as TrpE fusion proteins from plasmids pATH2:dp103CT or pATH2:Δdp103Δ, respectively, in BL21/DE3 (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The gel-purified proteins were used to immunize Lou/c rats. The fusion and screening for DP103-specific mAbs were done as described (23Kremmer E. Kranz B. Hille A. Klein K. Eulitz M. Hoffmann-Fezer G. Feiden W. Herrmann K. Delecluse H.J. Delsol G. Bornkamm G.W. Mueller-Lantzsch N. Grasser F.A. Virology. 1995; 208: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The specific clones 9A-3 (IgG2c), directed against aa 713–824, and 8H-4 (IgG2a), directed against aa 352–614 of DP103 were subcloned and used for further experiments. A polyclonal rabbit serum was raised against the TrpE fusion protein comprising aa 713–824 of DP103 as described (27Grasser F.A. Haiss P. Gottel S. Mueller-Lantzsch N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a review of the yeast two-hybrid system, see Ref. 28Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The cDNA library and yeast strains used for the two-hybrid screen with plasmid pBTM116:ΔE2Δ (encoding aa 122–344 of EBNA2 from the type 1 EBV strain M-ABA) have been described previously (29Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The library clones isolated from this screen, expressing the cDNA inserts as fusion proteins with the transactivation domain of GAL4 (GAL4AD), were co-transformed into the yeast strain SFY526 (30Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 53-179Google Scholar) as described (31Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together with various deletion mutants of EBNA2A, -2B, and -3C cloned in the vector pGBT9. Co-transformants were grown on 100-mm plates with synthetic medium lacking tryptophan and leucine at 30 °C until colonies were 2 mm in diameter, and β-galactosidase activity was determined by the hydrolysis of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal)in situ (32Breeden L. Naysmith K. Cold Spring Harbar Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The lacking 5′-region of the DP103-encoding cDNA was isolated by performing three successive rounds of 5′-RACE. Briefly, mRNA from 8 × 107 BJAB cells was prepared using the mRNA Isolation Kit (CLONTECH). For the generation of cDNA, 1 μg of mRNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperscriptTM reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was primed withDP103 cDNA-specific primers RC01 (5′, TACCAATCATCTTCCTGGGCTTCAGTC), RC03 (5′, CAACAGTAGGTCACTGTCAGCCCCAAT), or RC05 (5′, AAAGCTTGATTAAATGGAATTCTGCTG) in the first, second, or third round of RACE, respectively. The reaction was carried out either at 42 °C or, in order to overcome secondary structures, at 51 °C for 30 min. Subsequent steps were performed using the MarathonTM cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was generated, ligated to an adaptor (CLONTECH), and subjected to PCR amplification with an 5′-primer specific for the adaptor andDP103-specific primers RC02 (5′, TGTCTTCATCTGGATTCCAGGTGATTC), RC04 (5′, CCAGATTCACCTTCTCAGCATCAATCC), or RC06 (5′, CCCTCCAATAAAGACATGACACTCTAAGCC) in the first, second, or third round of RACE, respectively. Products were subsequently cloned in the vector pGEM (Promega). For the generation of plasmid pATH2:dp103CT, a segment encoding amino acids 713–824 from the open reading frame of the DP103-cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primersDP103BamHI(713)5′ (5′-CGCGGATCCAGAATCACCTGGAATCCAGATG) andDP103HindIII(UTR)3′ (5′-AAAGACTCAAAGCTTTTCAAG), digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated to the BamHI/HindIII-cleaved vector pATH2. Plasmid pATH2:Δdp103Δ was generated in a similar way using primersDP103BamHI(352)5′ (5′, GCAGCGTCTGGATCCTATGGCTA) and DP103SalI(614)3′ (5′, GCCTGTGTCGACCCTGATGATTTCC). Plasmid pATH2:dp103ΔN was constructed by digestion of the first RACE product withBamHI and PflMI and ligation to theBamHI/PflMI-cleaved pATH2:dp103CT vector. Removal of the insert with BamHI and BglII and cloning into the BamHI site of pACYM1 yielded plasmid pACYM1:dp103ΔN. The recombinant protein was expressed as a non-fusion protein initiating with the ATG codon at position 1064, comprising amino acids 352–824 of DP103. Plasmid pGEM:dp103 was constructed by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of the complete coding region of the DP103-cDNA with primers DP103(9)5′ (CCATGGCGGCGGCAGTTGAAG) and DP103(2631)3′ (ATGGATGTGTCCCAGTGGAAAGACTC) and subsequent ligation to the linearized vector pGEM (Promega). For in vitro translation, the insert from pGEM:dp103 was removed with NcoI/SalI and cloned into the NcoI/SalI-cleaved pGEM vector to yield plasmid pGEM:dp103ivt. Plasmid pBBHis2B:dp103 was generated by removal of the insert from pGEM:dp103ivt byNcoI/SalI digestion and ligation to theNcoI/SalI-cleaved pBBHis2B vector (Invitrogen). This construct expresses DP103 as a fusion protein with an N-terminal tag consisting of an antibody epitope (Anti-Xpress, Invitrogen) and a His6-tag. The GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD) fusions of EBNA2 and EBNA3C were constructed in the vector pGBT9 (30Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 53-179Google Scholar). For cloning of pGBT9:E2A-(1–213), the corresponding region of EBNA2 from the EBV type 1 strain M-ABA was PCR-amplified with primers E2AEcoRI(1)5′ (5′, GCCGAATTCATGCCTACATTCTATCTTGCG) and E2ASalI(213)3′ (5′,GTCGACTGGTGGCACCGTTAGTGTTGCAGG), digested withEcoRI and SalI, and subsequently cloned into theEcoRI/SalI-cleaved vector pGBT9. Additional fusions of EBNA2 and EBNA3C were generated in a similar way using primers with suitable restriction sites. Sequence information concerning these primers can be obtained from the authors upon request. Two pGBT9 constructs expressing GAL4BD fusions of aa 127–985 of EBNA3C from the type 1 EBV strain B95-8 and aa 127–1062 of EBNA3C from the type 2 EBV strain AG876 were kindly provided by Kenia Krauer (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia). Soluble extracts of 2 × 107 EBV-positive and EBV-negative cells were separated by centrifugation through a 5–30% sucrose gradient as described (27Grasser F.A. Haiss P. Gottel S. Mueller-Lantzsch N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifteen fractions collected by bottom puncture were precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by immunoblotting. Total cellular RNA from cultured cells was isolated using the “RNAeasy kit” (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of total RNA from tissues was done as described (33Tureci O. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundschuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For the generation of probes, nucleotides 1654–2113 of the DP103-cDNA from plasmid pATH2:dp103ΔN were removed by digestion withEcoRI/PflMI. Multiprime labeling of the probe, blot transfer, and hybridization were performed as described (33Tureci O. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundschuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107 SF128 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing full-length His6-tagged EBNA3C, full-length EBNA2, or N-terminally truncated DP103ΔN protein as described previously (22Hille A. Klein K. Baumler S. Grasser F.A. Mueller-Lantzsch N. J. Med. Virol. 1993; 39: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer NLB (150 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and 300 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) in ice-cold buffer NLB were added to 500 μl of clarified supernatants containing EBNA2 or EBNA3C. After incubation overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, the Ni-NTA-agarose was loaded on a column and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer NWB (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) 20 times. The beads were removed from the column and incubated overnight with 500 μl of clarified lysates from dp103ΔN-expressing cells at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were again applied on a column and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer NWB 20 times. Bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient using 500 μl of buffer NWB supplemented with imidazole in final concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm. 40 μl from each fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting. Chemical cross-linking was essentially carried out as described (34de Gunzburg J. Riehl R. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4007-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, EBV-negative BJAB or EBV-positive B95-8 cells were harvested and washed twice in PBS. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with 1 mm DSP (dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]/Lomant's reagent, Pierce) for 30 min, washed twice in PBS, and lysed for 30 min in buffer K (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells per 0.5 ml. Debris was sedimented (30 min, 4 °C, 13,000 rpm), and 50 μl of hybridoma supernatants were added to 0.5 ml of the clarified lysates. After incubation for 1 h, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and samples were incubated again for 1 h. Pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. 2 × 108 cells from suspension cultures were pelleted, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of buffer K (see above) with 1 mm DTT. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the clarified supernatants were pre-adsorbed on 150 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. The DP103-specific mAb 9A-3 or an irrelevant mAb directed against TrpE were added to the supernatants at a final concentration of 25 ng/μl. The samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight, and 80 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads in PBS were added. After incubation at 4 °C on a rotating wheel for 1.5 h, the beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer, once in ice-cold ATPase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), and twice in ice-cold ATPase buffer supplemented with ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a final concentration of 50 μm. The samples were supplemented with 800 ng of total cellular RNA isolated from B95-8 or Akata cells and brought to a final volume of 80 μl with ice-cold ATPase buffer. After addition of 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (ICN), reactions were incubated at 37 °C. After 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 3.5 h of incubation, 1 μl of the samples were spotted on TLC plates (Sigma). TLC plates were developed in 0.75 mKH2PO4, pH 3.0, and subjected to autoradiography. Data base searches were performed using the BLOCKS, BLASTP, and TBLASTN programs (35Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar). Hydrophilicity of DP103 was determined according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (37Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) over a window length of 17 residues. All programs were accessed through the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher internet pages. 2The on-line address is as follows:http://kiwi.imgen.bcm.tmc. edu:8088/search-launcher/launcher.html. In a search for proteins that interact with both EBNA2 and EBNA3C, we determined whether candidate clones identified in a previous two-hybrid screen for EBNA2-associated proteins could also bind to EBNA3C in this assay. Details of the original screen have been described previously (29Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GAL4AD-fusion protein encoded by the cDNA clone SE97 induced β-galactosidase activity when co-expressed with the full-length EBNA3C fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. To map further the regions mediating the interaction, additional deletion mutants of EBNA2 and EBNA3C from the type 1 EBV strains M-ABA or B95-8, respectively, were co-expressed with SE97. As shown in Fig. 1, the smallest fragments that conferred binding to SE97 comprised aa 121–213 of EBNA2 and aa 534–778 of EBNA3C. Since these regions are poorly conserved between the EBNA2 and EBNA3C alleles of the type 1 and type 2 viruses, additional mutants of EBNA2 and EBNA3C from the type 2 strains Jijoye or AG876, respectively, were employed in the yeast two-hybrid system. In both cases, the EBV type 2-derived mutants induced β-galactosidase activity when co-expressed with SE97 (Fig. 1). Thus, the ability to interact with the protein encoded by SE97 is conserved between the EBNA2 and EBNA3C alleles of both types 1 and 2 EBV strains. The cDNA insert in SE97 comprised 793 bp with an open reading frame of 479 bp. The clone was assumed to be incomplete since it lacked both a candidate start codon and a polyadenylation signal. Furthermore, this sequence hybridized to a unique transcript of approximately 3.0 kilobase pairs in Northern blots (see Fig.7 A). Using mRNA derived from the EBV-negative B cell line BJAB, a segment containing an additional 2003 bp was obtained by 5′-RACE. The complete 3′-end of the clone is likely to be represented by an expressed sequence tag (EST) of 140 bp derived from human tonsillar cells (GenBankTM accession number AA731204). The EST shows a perfect match of its 5′-terminal 74 bp to the 3′-end of the library clone and harbors a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) at position 101, 18 bp upstream of the binding site of the oligo(dT) primer. The size of the cloned sequence together with the 3′-region covered by the EST is 2842 bp and correlates with the size of the transcript observed in Northern blotting, assuming an additional 200 bases for an average sized poly(A)-tail (38Sachs A.B. Deardorff J.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, two additional independent 5′-RACE experiments yielded products terminating at the same 5′-position. Thus, the cloned sequence is likely to represent the complete 5′-end of the DP103-encoding transcript. To rule out the possibility that the sequence retrieved by RACE resulted from nonspecific cDNA fusion or was unique to the starting material used, cDNAs spanning the entire 2796 bp were amplified, cloned, and sequenced, using mRNA derived from human placenta, the human B cell line BJAB, as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes from two healthy donors. The cDNAs were identical with the exception of an average of four base substitutions per clone, which are likely to represent reverse transcriptase-PCR artifacts since they are located randomly throughout the sequence and were always unique to a specific clone. The aa sequence shown in Fig. 2was translated from the consensus nucleotide sequence deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF106019). A putative start codon in good context for translation initiation (39Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar) is present at position 11, initiating a continuous open reading frame of 2472 bp that encodes a protein of 824 aa. The presence of highly conserved motifs in the predicted amino acid sequence clearly identifies the protein as a novel member of the DEAD box family of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. Since monoclonal antibodies detect a cellular protein with an apparent molecular mass of 103 kDa (see following paragraph and Fig.3 B), the protein was designated DP103 (DEAD box protein of 103 kDa), whereas we will refer to the human gene as DP103 in the following. We note that a short segment of 22 aa with a high proportion of basic residues (41%) is present at the C terminus of DP103, the first five residues of which (KTRLK) are repeated at position 55–59 (indicated in Fig. 2).Figure 3Characterization of the DP103 protein.

https://openalex.org/W2012501423,"Tissue hypoxia is intimately associated with a number of chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine. In this study, we investigated the impact of hypoxia on the expression of a panel of inflammatory mediators by intestinal epithelia. Initial experiments revealed that epithelial (T84 cell) exposure to ambient hypoxia evoked a time-dependent induction of the proinflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (37 ± 6.1-, 7 ± 0.8-, and 9 ± 0.9-fold increase over normoxia, respectively, each p < 0.01). Since the gene regulatory elements for each of these molecules contains an NF-κB binding domain, we investigated the influence of hypoxia on NF-κB activation. Cellular hypoxia induced a time-dependent increase in nuclear p65, suggesting a dominant role for NF-κB in hypoxia-elicited induction of proinflammatory gene products. Further work, however, revealed that hypoxia does not influence epithelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) or MHC class I, the promoters of which also contain NF-κB binding domains, suggesting differential responses to hypoxia. Importantly, the genes for TNF-α, IL-8, and MHC class II, but not ICAM-1 or MHC class I, contain cyclic AMP response element (CRE) consensus motifs. Thus, we examined the role of cAMP in the hypoxia-elicited phenotype. Hypoxia diminished CRE binding protein (CREB) expression. In parallel, T84 cell cAMP was diminished by hypoxia (83 ± 13.2% decrease, p < 0.001), and pharmacologic inhibition of protein kinase A induced TNF-α and protein release (9 ± 3.9-fold increase). Addback of cAMP resulted in reversal of hypoxia-elicited TNF-α release (86 ± 3.2% inhibition with 3 mm 8-bromo-cAMP). Furthermore, overexpression of CREB but not mutated CREB by retroviral-mediated gene transfer reversed hypoxia-elicited induction of TNF-α defining a causal relationship between hypoxia-elicited CREB reduction and TNF-α induction. Such data indicate a prominent role for CREB in the hypoxia-elicited epithelial phenotype and implicate intracellular cAMP as an important second messenger in differential induction of proinflammatory mediators. Tissue hypoxia is intimately associated with a number of chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine. In this study, we investigated the impact of hypoxia on the expression of a panel of inflammatory mediators by intestinal epithelia. Initial experiments revealed that epithelial (T84 cell) exposure to ambient hypoxia evoked a time-dependent induction of the proinflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (37 ± 6.1-, 7 ± 0.8-, and 9 ± 0.9-fold increase over normoxia, respectively, each p < 0.01). Since the gene regulatory elements for each of these molecules contains an NF-κB binding domain, we investigated the influence of hypoxia on NF-κB activation. Cellular hypoxia induced a time-dependent increase in nuclear p65, suggesting a dominant role for NF-κB in hypoxia-elicited induction of proinflammatory gene products. Further work, however, revealed that hypoxia does not influence epithelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) or MHC class I, the promoters of which also contain NF-κB binding domains, suggesting differential responses to hypoxia. Importantly, the genes for TNF-α, IL-8, and MHC class II, but not ICAM-1 or MHC class I, contain cyclic AMP response element (CRE) consensus motifs. Thus, we examined the role of cAMP in the hypoxia-elicited phenotype. Hypoxia diminished CRE binding protein (CREB) expression. In parallel, T84 cell cAMP was diminished by hypoxia (83 ± 13.2% decrease, p < 0.001), and pharmacologic inhibition of protein kinase A induced TNF-α and protein release (9 ± 3.9-fold increase). Addback of cAMP resulted in reversal of hypoxia-elicited TNF-α release (86 ± 3.2% inhibition with 3 mm 8-bromo-cAMP). Furthermore, overexpression of CREB but not mutated CREB by retroviral-mediated gene transfer reversed hypoxia-elicited induction of TNF-α defining a causal relationship between hypoxia-elicited CREB reduction and TNF-α induction. Such data indicate a prominent role for CREB in the hypoxia-elicited epithelial phenotype and implicate intracellular cAMP as an important second messenger in differential induction of proinflammatory mediators. interferon-γ tumor necrosis factor-α Hanks' balanced salt solution cyclic AMP response element cyclic AMP response element binding protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay major histocompatibility complex intercellular adhesion molecule 1 protein kinase A interleukin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays polymerase chain reaction phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein kinase A inhibitor The human intestine is lined with a single layer of protective epithelial cells that possess properties such as barrier and ion (and subsequent fluid) transport functions (1Powell D.

Such epithelial functions are tightly controlled by an array of immune-derived factors within the intestinal microenvironment, and regulation of such conditions can vary greatly during active episodes of inflammation. A number of previous studies have revealed specificity with regard to regulation of epithelial end point function, including tight junction permeability, electrogenic chloride secretion, and neutrophil transmigration (4Colgan S.P.

This work utilizing intestinal epithelial cells in vitro has revealed that ligation of receptors for IFN-γ,1 interleukin-4, or interleukin-13 results in increased macromolecular permeability (4Colgan S.P.

On the whole, other cytokine responses (i.e.regulation of Cl− secretion, fluid transport, MHC, and MHC-like molecule expression, polymorphonuclear leukocyte transmigration, etc.) appear to reveal a unique “functional fingerprint” with respect to individual cytokines. Others have demonstrated the presence of functional receptors for IL-2 (10Ciacci C. Mahida Y.R. Dignass A. Koizumi M. Podolsky D.K. J. Clin.

Based on this previous work, we have proposed that epithelial cells have the unique ability to “phenotype-switch,” whereby epithelia lose classic qualities of epithelia (i.e. barrier function, ion transport properties, etc.) and assume features resembling immune-type cells (i.e.surface expression of MHC class I and II, antigen presentation properties, regulated polymorphonuclear leukocyte trafficking, etc.) (5Colgan S.P.

Tissue ischemia/hypoxia often occurs concomitantly with other inflammatory processes, and thus, appropriate models to study mechanisms of inflammation should also account for conditions of cellular hypoxia. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of hypoxic signal transduction. Several reports indicate that hypoxia down-regulates activity of cellular cAMP-generating machinery and that such diminished cAMP signaling can influence gene expression and end point cellular functions (14Taylor C.T. Lisco S.J. Awtrey C.S. Colgan S.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 568-575PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ogawa S. Koga S. Kuwabara K. Brett J. Morrow B. Morris S.A. Bilezikian J.P. Silverstein S.C.

Bischoff J. Mayer J.E. Colgan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7075-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At the transcriptional level, a primary target for cAMP-mediated signaling is cAMP response element binding proteins, a family of 43-kDa leucine zipper transcription factors that share certain structural motifs, bind DNA as dimers, and regulate transcription of target genes (19Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). At present, it is not known whether hypoxia-mediated gene expression is directly related to CREB activity or CREB expression. Recently, we have studied the role of epithelia in intestinal ischemia using a model epithelium, T84 cells. In response to conditions of ambient hypoxia, epithelia express a more classical immune-like phenotype, including release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (20Colgan S.P. Dzus A.L. Parkos C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Taylor C.T. Dzus A.L. Colgan S.P.

Med. 1996; 184: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), diminished ion transport (14Taylor C.T. Lisco S.J. Awtrey C.S. Colgan S.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 568-575PubMed Google Scholar), and induction of major histocompatibility complex class II expression (21Taylor C.T. Dzus A.L. Colgan S.P. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 657-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The basis for these changes in epithelial function are not well understood, and thus, in the studies defined here, we hypothesized a basic mechanism of hypoxia-induced phenotype switch. These studies revealed that hypoxia specifically induces a panel of epithelial proteins that bear cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) within the region important for regulation of gene expression. Further mechanistic insight was defined with one gene product, epithelial-derived TNF-α, and revealed a critical role for CRE and CRE-binding proteins (CREB) in induction of TNF-α. Such results define a primary role for CRE in the hypoxia-elicited epithelial phenotype and implicate CREB down-regulation as a mechanism of differential induction of proinflammatory mediators by cellular hypoxia. The T84 cell line is a human colonic carcinoma cell line (22Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. McRoberts J. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which, when plated on permeable membrane supports, forms polarized monolayers of columnar intestine-like epithelial cells. T84 cells are functionally well differentiated with regard to electrogenic Cl− secretion and ion transport and serve as excellent models of crypt columnar epithelial cells (22Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. McRoberts J. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 354-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). T84 cells were grown as monolayers in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco/Vogt modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 15 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 14 mm NaHCO3, 40 mg/ml penicillin, 8 mg/ml ampicillin, 90 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5% newborn calf serum. Monolayers were subcultured from flasks every 7–14 days by brief trypsin treatment (0.1% trypsin and 0.9 mm EDTA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline). Epithelial exposure to hypoxia was performed as described previously (20Colgan S.P. Dzus A.L. Parkos C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T84 cell growth media (1:1 Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were replaced with fresh, pre-equilibrated hypoxic media, and cells were placed in a humidified environment within the hypoxia chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI) and maintained at 37 °C. Standard hypoxic conditions, based on previous work (20Colgan S.P. Dzus A.L. Parkos C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), were pO2 20 torr, pCO2 35 torr, with the balance made up of nitrogen and water vapor. Normoxic controls were cells exposed to the same experimental protocols under conditions of atmospheric oxygen concentrations (pO2 147 torr and pCO2 35 torr within a tissue culture incubator). Epithelial expression of indicated surface proteins was quantified using a cell-surface ELISA, as described before (5Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Matthews J.B. D'Andrea L. Awtrey C.S. Lichtman A. Delp C. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C402-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were grown and assayed for antibody binding following exposure to normoxia or hypoxia for the indicated periods. Cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS (Sigma), blocked with media for 30 min at 4 °C. Anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (clone P2A4 (24Dittel B.N. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. LeBien T.W. Blood. 1993; 81: 2272-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, used as undiluted cell culture supernatant), anti-MHC class I (25Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) (clone W6/32 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, used as 1:100 diluted ascitic fluid), or anti-MHC class II (clone L243(5) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, used as undiluted cell culture supernatant) were used to examine protein surface expression by ELISA. After washing with HBSS, a peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Cappel, West Chester, PA) was added. Secondary antibody (10 μg/ml) was diluted in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After washing, plates were developed by addition of peroxidase substrate (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), 1 mm final concentration, Sigma) and read on a microtiter plate spectrophotometer at 405 nm (Molecular Devices). Controls consisted of media only and secondary antibody only. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. optical density at 405 nm (secondary antibody background subtracted). IFN-γ (1000 units/ml, 48 h) served as a positive control for induction of these molecules, as described before (5Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Matthews J.B. D'Andrea L. Awtrey C.S. Lichtman A. Delp C. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C402-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokine (TNF-α) and chemokine (IL-8) levels were quantified by capture ELISA as described previously (20Colgan S.P. Dzus A.L. Parkos C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Taylor C.T. Dzus A.L. Colgan S.P. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 657-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Phorbol myristate pre-exposure (10 ng/ml, 12 h) served as a positive control for induction of IL-8 (20Colgan S.P. Dzus A.L. Parkos C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and TNF-α (21Taylor C.T. Dzus A.L. Colgan S.P. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 657-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Following experimental treatment of epithelial cells, whole cell extracts (for examination of CREB and phospho-CREB) were prepared as described previously (26Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For analysis of nuclear extracts (NF-κB activation), confluent monolayers of T84 cells on 100-mm Petri dishes were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation in 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per ml, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4 °C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation (15 s). Nuclei were rinsed once in buffer A and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin). Nuclei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min. Proteins were measured (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). Samples (25 μg/lane, as indicated) of T84 cell lysates were separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked overnight in blocking buffer (250 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20, 5% goat serum, and 3% bovine serum albumin). For Western blotting, anti-NF-κB (rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for p65 subunit of NF-κB, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), anti-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or anti-phospho-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were added for 3 h; blots were washed, and species-matched peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, exactly as described previously (27Zünd G. Uezono S. Stahl G.L. Dzus A.L. McGowan F.X. Hickey P.R. Colgan S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1571-C1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled bands from washed blots were detected by ECL. Resulting bands were quantified from scanned images using NIH Image software (Bethesda). Nuclear extracts of cells exposed to indicated experimental conditions were obtained as described above. The following synthetic oligonucleotide probes were synthesized (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.; The Woodlands, TX) and used as probes in EMSAs; the CRE-like motif (bold) lies at −115/−93 relative to the transcription start site in the TNF-α promoter, 5′-GTCGACCTCCAGATGACGTCATGGGTTGTC-3′. Oligonucleotide probes for EMSA were digoxigenin-labeled according to manufacturer's instructions (Gel Shift kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear lysates for 10 min at 37 °C and separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. DNA-protein complexes were transblotted to nylon membrane, probed with anti-digoxigenin-peroxidase, and developed by ECL. Controls consisted of free probe alone and excess unlabeled probe. For supershift analysis, protein-DNA complexes were incubated with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; 1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis. Confluent T84 monolayers on 6-well plates were exposed to indicated experimental conditions, and cAMP was quantified exactly as before (14Taylor C.T. Lisco S.J. Awtrey C.S. Colgan S.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 568-575PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cooled to 4 °C; cAMP was extracted from washed monolayers with extraction buffer (66% EtOH, 33% HBSS containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine, 5 mm, Sigma), and lysates were cleared by spinning at 10,000 × g for 5 min and dried under vacuum to remove EtOH. Samples were reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was quantified using displacement ELISAs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Data were converted to concentration using a daily standard curve, and concentrations were expressed as cAMP per μg of total protein. Epithelial cells grown on permeable supports were exposed basolaterally to Rp-cAMPs (0–50 μm Sigma), protein kinase A inhibitor amide (0–30 μm; Calbiochem), or 8-bromo-cAMP (0–3 mm; Sigma) for 48 h prior to harvesting of cells for CREB determination or basolateral supernatants for TNF-α assay as described above. Total RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's procedure from normoxic and hypoxic (6, 12 or 24 h) T84 cells using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). 10–50 μg of each RNA sample was treated with DNase I (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN), and protein contaminants were then removed through a phenol/chloroform extraction step. RNA samples were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocaronate-treated water. The reaction was set up according to Promega's Reverse Transcription System protocol (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Briefly, 1 μg of RNA was added to the reaction mixture consisting of 4 μl of 25 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2 μl of 10× Reverse Transcriptase Buffer, 2 μl of 10 mmol/liter of each dNTP, 0.5 μl of rRNase in ribonuclease inhibitor (20 units total), 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer in a total volume of 20 μl. The single-stranded cDNA was synthesized (MJ Research, Inc., Thermocycler Model PTC-200) using one cycle at 25 °C for 10 min, one cycle at 42 °C for 45 min, and one cycle at 95 °C for 5 min followed by a final cycle at 4 °C for 5 min. The PlatinumTM Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity PCR System from Life Technologies, Inc., was used in the amplification step. The PCR reaction for human TNF-α contained 1 μmeach of the sense primer (5′-CGGGACGTGGAGCTGGCCGAGGAG-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-CACCAGCTGGTTATCTCTCAGCTC-3′), 5 μl of Reverse Transcriptase reaction, 5 μl of 10× PlatinumTM Taq high fidelity PCR buffer, 2 μl of 50 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mmol of dNTP, and 2.5 units of PlatinumTM Taq High Fidelity enzyme mix in a total volume of 50 μl. The amplification reaction included a 5-min denaturation at 94 °C and a 5-min annealing at 60 °C, followed by 30 cycles at 72 °C of 1.5 min, 94 °C for 45 s, and 60 °C for 45 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR reactions were then visualized on a 1% agarose gel containing 5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. A 355-base pair fragment corresponding to TNF-α was observed. In order to ensure that an equal amount of template was used in each amplification reaction, 5 μl of Reverse Transcriptase reaction was used as template with 1 μmeach of human β-actin sense primer (5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′) in identical reactions; a 661-base pair amplified fragment with equal intensity was observed in all samples. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer of T84 cells with CREB and mutant CREB (serine to alanine mutated at site 133, the PKA phosphorylation site) containing vectors was performed using a previously described technique (28Hershberg R.M. Framson P.E. Cho D.H. Lee L.Y. Kovats S. Beitz J. Blum J.S. Nepom G.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, CREB or mutant CREB cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Marc Montminy, Harvard Medical School) was expressed under the control of the CMV-IE promoter, and the cDNA for the dominant selectable marker (neomycin resistance) was expressed under control of the viral long terminal repeat. 106 epithelial cells were plated 24 h prior to infection. Cells were washed once, and then 3–4 ml of fresh, 0.45-μm filtered, viral supernatant supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene were added to the adherent cells. After 8 h, 5 ml of fresh complete medium was added, and the cells were cultured for 48 h before drug selection. Cytokine, nucleotide, and cell-surface ELISA data were evaluated by analysis of variance and by Student'st test with p < 0.05 considered significant. All values are given as mean ± S.E. for nexperiments. Recently, we demonstrated that hypoxia enhances epithelial responses to the cytokine IFN-γ, and such responses were subsequently attributed to induction of epithelial TNF-α release from the basolateral surface (21Taylor C.T. Dzus A.L. Colgan S.P. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 657-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not reveal significant insight into mechanisms that evoke induction of TNF-α, and therefore, we sought to understand such findings at the mechanistic level. As an initial screen, a panel of epithelial proinflammatory markers were examined to determine whether such signaling by hypoxia was specific for TNF-α or is generalized to other molecules. As shown in Fig. 1, responses to hypoxia were specific. Indeed, epithelial exposure to hypoxia induced TNF-α release (maximal 37.0 ± 6.1-fold increase, p < 0.01), IL-8 release (maximal 7.0 ± 0.8-fold increase,p < 0.01), and induced surface expression of MHC class II (maximal 9.0 ± 0.9-fold increase, p < 0.01). Hypoxia did not, however, influence epithelial ICAM-1 expression (p = not significant compared with normoxia) or MHC class I (p = not significant compared with normoxia) indicating a degree of specificity for signaling by hypoxia. In an attempt to gain insight into such specificity, we began by examining induction pathways of these pro-inflammatory genes. The regulatory regions of each of these genes contain a binding site for NF-κB, a transcription factor important in induction of a number of proinflammatory genes (29Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts derived from epithelia exposed to hypoxia (measured pO2 20 torr for 0–48 h) revealed cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the p65 subunit NF-κB, a reliable readout of NF-κB activation (27Zünd G. Uezono S. Stahl G.L. Dzus A.L. McGowan F.X. Hickey P.R. Colgan S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1571-C1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, periods of hypoxia as short as 6 h revealed a significant cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Such responses to hypoxia were maximal by 24 h (densitometric measurement of 360.5 versus normoxic control value of 82.2 relative units) and were similar to our positive control PMA (497.9 relative units). We next concentrated on elucidating pathways of epithelial gene induction by hypoxia, specifically using TNF-α to define these principles. TNF-α gene induction and protein release can be regulated in a number of ways including transcriptional and post-translational pathways. Thus we examined whether hypoxia induces transcription of the epithelial TNF-α gene. As shown in Fig. 3, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed a time-dependent induction of TNF-α. Such induction was detectable at 12 h, maximal at 24 h, and exceeded that of our positive control (PMA, 10 ng/ml for 12 h). These data reveal that hypoxia activates transcriptional pathways. In addition to a binding site for the transcription factor NF-κB, the TNF-α, IL-8, and MHC class II genes bear a cAMP responsive consensus binding site, termed a cAMP response element (CRE) (26Whitley M.Z.

Importantly, the regulatory regions of those molecules not induced by hypoxia (MHC class I and ICAM-1, see Fig. 1) do not contain a CRE. These CRE DNA consensus motifs serve to regulate transcription of genes through protein kinase A and calcium-dependent pathways. In general, increases in intracellular cAMP are associated with decreased TNF-α release (30Tannenbaum C.S. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1274-1279PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, termed cAMP response element binding proteins (CREB), positively or negatively regulate the activation of CRE-containing genes (e.g. cAMP can increase or decrease transcription) depending on the gene (31Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Since a number of different consensus motifs serve as functional CREs, we examined the contribution of the CRE found within the TNF-α promoter. To do this, we developed an EMSA using oligonucleotides flanking the TNF-α CRE (32Newell C.L. Deisseroth A.B. Lopez-Berestein G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, proteins from nuclear extracts of T84 cells bind to the CRE region of the TNF-α promoter.

First, LDLR(−/−) mice were transplanted with either LDLR(+/+) marrow or LDLR(−/−) marrow and were challenged with an atherogenic Western type diet. The diet caused severe hypercholesterolemia of a similar degree in the two groups, and no differences in the aortic lesion area were detected. Thus, macrophage LDLR expression does not influence foam cell lesion formation in the setting of extreme LDL accumulation. To determine whether macrophage LDLR expression affects foam cell formation under conditions of moderate, non-LDL hyperlipidemia, we transplanted C57BL/6 mice with either LDLR(−/−) marrow (experimental group) or LDLR(+/+) marrow (controls). Cholesterol levels were not significantly different between the two groups at baseline or after 6 weeks on a butterfat diet, but were 40% higher in the experimental mice after 13 weeks, mostly due to accumulation of β-very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL). Despite the increase in cholesterol levels, mice receiving LDLR(−/−) marrow developed 63% smaller lesions than controls, demonstrating that macrophage LDLR affects the rate of foam cell formation when the atherogenic stimulus is β-VLDL. We conclude that the macrophage LDLR is responsible for a significant portion of lipid accumulation in foam cells under conditions of dietary stress."

The first zinc finger-DNA complex to be visualized at atomic resolution involved the three fingers of Zif268 (11Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). This structure of the Zif268-DNA complex, since refined to 1.6 Å (12Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), revealed that the complex has a relatively simple, modular arrangement (Fig. 1 a). Each finger contains a short, two-stranded antiparallel β sheet and an α helix. The sheet and the helix are held together by a small hydrophobic core and by a zinc ion, which is coordinated by two conserved cysteines from the sheet region and two conserved histidines from the α helix. Each of the three Zif268 fingers has a similar docking arrangement with respect to the DNA, and each uses residues from the amino-terminal portion of its α helix to contact bases in the major groove. The majority of the base contacts involve the guanine-rich strand of the binding site, and each finger makes its primary contacts with a three base pair subsite (GCG/TGG/GCG).In the Zif268 complex, amino acid residues at four positions of the α helix make direct base contacts (positions −1, 2, 3, and 6, numbering with respect to the start of the helix). These contacts are summarized below and in Fig. 1 b. (For a detailed description of the Zif268-DNA interface, the reader is referred to the original papers describing the structure (11Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 12Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).) The residue at position −1 of the α helix is an arginine in all three fingers (Arg18, Arg46, and Arg74), and, in each case, this arginine makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 3′ end of the finger's subsite. Each of the fingers also has an aspartic acid at position 2 of the α helix (Asp20, Asp48, and Asp76), and in each finger this aspartic acid residue makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the arginine from position −1. This interaction presumably helps orient the arginine and could thus increase the specificity of the arginine-guanine interaction. The aspartic acid from position 2 may also interact with a base on the opposite strand of the DNA that is just outside the primary 3-base pair subsite of the finger. (Note that although we describe the binding site in terms of 3-base pair subsites in this paper, one could also describe recognition with respect to overlapping 4-base pair subsites.) In all three fingers, the residue at position 3 of the α helix contacts the middle base of the finger's 3-base pair subsite, but these contacts are different in different fingers. In finger two, the residue at position 3 is a histidine. This histidine forms a hydrogen bond with guanine 6 and makes van der Waals' contacts with thymine 5. Fingers one and three have a glutamic acid at position 3 of the helix. These glutamic acids do not make any hydrogen bonds with the bases, but the 1.6 Å structure revealed that they do make van der Waals' contacts; the Cγ and Cδ from each of these glutamic acids are in van der Waals' contact with the C5 and C6 of the cytosine from the middle base pair of the finger's subsite. Fingers one and three have an arginine at position 6 of the α helix. In both of these fingers, this arginine makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 5′ end of the finger's subsite. (Finger two has a threonine at the corresponding position, but this residue does not make any direct base contacts.)Numerous modeling, design, and selection studies (3Rebar E.J. Pabo C.O.

However, the precise contribution that individual residues make to binding affinity and specificity in the Zif268-DNA complex has not been known. Although a few mutants with changes in the base-contacting residues have been constructed, the subsequent binding studies used peptides expressed on the surface of phage (17Choo Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Isalan M. Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and we believe that measurements with purified peptides will ultimately be more accurate. To carefully study the roles of individual residues, we have constructed five mutants with alterations in the base-contacting residues of finger one. Here we report the equilibrium dissociation constants of these peptides at a wild type site and two mutant binding sites, and we use these data to analyze the role that each of these residues plays in site-specific recognition.RESULTSWe have constructed mutants of Zif268 in which each of the base-contacting residues in finger one, Arg18, Asp20, Glu21, and Arg24, has been individually mutated to alanine. Because the side chains of Arg18 and Asp20 interact with each other, we also have constructed an R18A/D20A double mutant. Each of these mutant peptides has been overexpressed and purified, and its affinity for a Zif268 binding site has been determined by a gel mobility shift assay. Altered binding sites also have been tested with wild type Zif268 and with some of the mutant peptides.Contribution of Positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 to Overall DNA Binding EnergyWe began by determining the affinity of each of the five mutants for a wild type Zif268 binding site. The apparent dissociation constants measured for the mutant peptides and for wild type Zif268 under the same conditions are listed in TableI. Wild type Zif268 binds the oligonucleotide site used in these studies (Fig. 2 b) with aK d of 0.17 nm (Fig.3 a). (K dvalues reported in previous studies range from 0.01 to 6.5 nm, depending on the binding conditions used (3Rebar E.J. Pabo C.O.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).) Mutating Arg18 (at position −1 of the helix) to alanine results in a 100-fold loss of affinity (K d = 17 nm). Simultaneously mutating Arg18 and Asp20 (positions −1 and 2 of the helix) to alanine produces a peptide that binds with an apparent K d of 4.4 nm (Fig. 3 c). Thus, the double mutant binds 26-fold less tightly than wild type Zif268 but about four times as tightly as the R18A single mutant. At this stage, we do not know why the double mutant binds more tightly than the single mutant, but it is possible that the R18A mutant, in addition to losing contacts with the guanine, also leads to some unfavorable electrostatic interactions for the Asp20 residue that is now left without a partner. (For example, there could be unfavorable electrostatic interactions between the acidic residues at positions 2 and 3 of the helix and the DNA.) Alternatively, some rearrangement might occur in the double but not the single mutant that allows another side chain (such as Glu21) to form new contacts with the DNA.Table IApparent dissociation constants for wild type Zif268 and the five mutant peptides at a wild type binding siteProteinK dK d/K d wild typeΔG mut− ΔG wild typemkcal/molZif2681.7 (± 0.07) × 10−101R18A1.7 (± 0.08) × 10−8100−2.7D20A1.0 (± 0.01) × 10−100.60.30R18A/D20A4.4 (± 0.42) × 10−926−1.9E21A2.5 (± 0.91) × 10−101.5−0.24R24A7.0 (± 1.21) × 10−8412−3.6 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Equilibrium binding curves for the wild type Zif268 peptide (a), the D20A mutant peptide (b), and the R18A/D20A mutant peptide (c), each binding to the wild type binding site (filled circles) and to the GCC site (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The D20A peptide binds with slightly greater affinity than does the wild type peptide (K d = 0.10 nm; Fig.3 b). This observation also is surprising; we expected the D20A mutant to bind less tightly because this mutation eliminates the hydrogen bonds between Asp20 and Arg18 that presumably help orient the arginine side chain. The basis for the increased affinity of the D20A peptide is unclear, but it seems possible that this mutation may allow the arginine side chain to interact with Glu21 and contact the phosphate backbone instead of the base (a similar arrangement has been observed in the structure of wild type Zif268 with a suboptimal binding site; see Ref. 22Elrod-Erickson M.

The largest effect on binding affinity is caused by mutation of Arg24to alanine; the R24A peptide binds approximately 400-fold less tightly than does wild type Zif268 (K d = 70 nm).Figure 4Equilibrium binding curves for the wild type Zif268 peptide (a) and the E21A mutant peptide (b), each binding to the wild type binding site (filled circles) and to the GAG site (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Asp20 (position 2) and Specificity at Base Pair 10As mentioned previously, Asp20 (position 2 of the α helix) makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with Arg18(position −1), which, in turn, makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with guanine 10. To determine whether this Asp-Arg interaction plays any role in determining specificity at base pair 10, we studied binding of the wild type Zif268 and the D20A and R18A/D20A mutant peptides to a site in which guanine 10 was changed to cytosine (the GCC site; Fig. 2 b). Wild type Zif268 binds the GCC site with an apparent K dof 20 nm, 118-fold less tightly than it binds the wild type GCG site (Fig. 3 a and TableII). The D20A peptide, however, binds the GCC site with a K d of 2.4 nm, only 24-fold less tightly than it binds the wild type site (Fig. 3 b). Thus, the Asp20 → Ala mutation results in significantly reduced specificity at base pair 10. As expected, the R18A/D20A double mutant has lost almost all specificity at base pair 10; the R18A/D20A peptide binds the GCC site with a K d of 5.1 nm, almost as well as it binds the wild type site (Fig. 3 c).Table IIApparent dissociation constants for the wild type, D20A, and R18A/D20A peptides at the GCC binding siteProteinK dK d GCC site/K d WT sitemZif2682.0 (± 0.78) × 10−8118D20A2.4 (± 0.19) × 10−924R18A/D20A5.1 (± 0.47) × 10−91.2 Open table in a new tab Glu21 (position 3) and Specificity at Base Pair 9Glu21, which in the crystal structure of the Zif268 complex makes van der Waals' contacts with cytosine 9 (12Elrod-Erickson M.

Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), does not appear to make a significant contribution to binding affinity. (The E21A mutant has only a slightly lowerK d than does the wild type protein.) To determine whether this residue nonetheless plays some role in determining binding specificity, we examined binding of the wild type and E21A peptides to a site in which cytosine 9 was changed to adenine (the GAG site; Fig. 2 b). Wild type Zif268 displays a clear preference for a wild type GCG subsite: Zif268 binds the GAG site with a K d of 2.2 nm, 13-fold less tightly than it binds the wild type binding site (Fig. 4 a and TableIII). However, mutating Glu21to alanine results in a loss of specificity at base pair 9; the E21A mutant peptide displays no preference for a wild type binding site and actually binds the GAG site slightly more tightly than the wild type site (K d of 0.10 nm; Fig.4 b). It appears that Glu21 has a greater effect on specificity than it has on affinity per se.Table IIIApparent dissociation constants for the wild type and E21A peptides at the GAG binding siteProteinK dK d GAG site/K d WT sitemZif2682.2 (± 0.30) × 10−913E21A1.0 (± 0.23) × 10−100.4 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe data presented here allow us to evaluate the energetic contributions to binding affinity made by the base-contacting residues from finger one of Zif268 and to examine their contributions to specificity. In the cocrystal structure of the Zif268-DNA complex (11Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 12Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), Arg18 (position −1 of the α helix) and Arg24 (position 6) each make a pair of hydrogen bonds with a guanine. Our binding studies show that each of these arginine residues makes a significant contribution to the overall binding energy (Table I). The acidic residues from positions 2 and 3 of the α helix, Asp20 and Glu21, do not appear to contribute significantly to binding affinity (Table I). However, these residues do contribute to specificity, as indicated by comparing the affinities of wild type and mutant peptides for wild type and mutant binding sites. In particular, we find that mutating Asp20 results in a reduced specificity for guanine at position 10 of the binding site (Table II). This decrease in specificity is probably due to the loss of the hydrogen bonds between Asp20 and Arg18 (and possibly also to the loss of the water-mediated hydrogen bond Asp20 normally makes to cytosine 10′). Glu21also contributes to specificity; mutating this glutamic acid to alanine results in a loss of specificity at base pair 9 (Table III). The structural basis for this observation is not entirely clear, but the Glu21 side chain, through its proximity to base 9, may help exclude bases other than cytosine from this position of the binding site. It also seems possible that favorable van der Waals' contacts between the glutamic acid and the cytosine may be energetically balanced by the unfavorable effects of having this glutamate near the DNA. (This could explain how Glu21 contributes to specificity even though mutating this residue to alanine has very little effect on the net binding energy.) We also note that, as in all experiments of this sort, there is the possibility of compensating structural rearrangements that may complicate the interpretation, and crystal structures of the mutant complexes would be needed for a really definitive interpretation of the energetics.In summary, our data show that Arg18 and Arg24both make significant contributions to binding affinity (and presumably also to specificity). The acidic residues Asp20 and Glu21 do not make large contributions to the overall energy of DNA binding but do help determine specificity. These studies clarify several important questions about recognition and provide a better basis for understanding zinc finger-DNA interactions. Zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 class are one of the most abundant DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotes (1Jacobs G.H.

Each of the fingers also has an aspartic acid at position 2 of the α helix (Asp20, Asp48, and Asp76), and in each finger this aspartic acid residue makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the arginine from position −1. This interaction presumably helps orient the arginine and could thus increase the specificity of the arginine-guanine interaction. The aspartic acid from position 2 may also interact with a base on the opposite strand of the DNA that is just outside the primary 3-base pair subsite of the finger. (Note that although we describe the binding site in terms of 3-base pair subsites in this paper, one could also describe recognition with respect to overlapping 4-base pair subsites.) In all three fingers, the residue at position 3 of the α helix contacts the middle base of the finger's 3-base pair subsite, but these contacts are different in different fingers. In finger two, the residue at position 3 is a histidine. This histidine forms a hydrogen bond with guanine 6 and makes van der Waals' contacts with thymine 5. Fingers one and three have a glutamic acid at position 3 of the helix. These glutamic acids do not make any hydrogen bonds with the bases, but the 1.6 Å structure revealed that they do make van der Waals' contacts; the Cγ and Cδ from each of these glutamic acids are in van der Waals' contact with the C5 and C6 of the cytosine from the middle base pair of the finger's subsite. Fingers one and three have an arginine at position 6 of the α helix. In both of these fingers, this arginine makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 5′ end of the finger's subsite. (Finger two has a threonine at the corresponding position, but this residue does not make any direct base contacts.) Numerous modeling, design, and selection studies (3Rebar E.J. Pabo C.O.

However, the precise contribution that individual residues make to binding affinity and specificity in the Zif268-DNA complex has not been known. Although a few mutants with changes in the base-contacting residues have been constructed, the subsequent binding studies used peptides expressed on the surface of phage (17Choo Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Isalan M. Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and we believe that measurements with purified peptides will ultimately be more accurate. To carefully study the roles of individual residues, we have constructed five mutants with alterations in the base-contacting residues of finger one. Here we report the equilibrium dissociation constants of these peptides at a wild type site and two mutant binding sites, and we use these data to analyze the role that each of these residues plays in site-specific recognition. RESULTSWe have constructed mutants of Zif268 in which each of the base-contacting residues in finger one, Arg18, Asp20, Glu21, and Arg24, has been individually mutated to alanine. Because the side chains of Arg18 and Asp20 interact with each other, we also have constructed an R18A/D20A double mutant. Each of these mutant peptides has been overexpressed and purified, and its affinity for a Zif268 binding site has been determined by a gel mobility shift assay. Altered binding sites also have been tested with wild type Zif268 and with some of the mutant peptides.Contribution of Positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 to Overall DNA Binding EnergyWe began by determining the affinity of each of the five mutants for a wild type Zif268 binding site. The apparent dissociation constants measured for the mutant peptides and for wild type Zif268 under the same conditions are listed in TableI. Wild type Zif268 binds the oligonucleotide site used in these studies (Fig. 2 b) with aK d of 0.17 nm (Fig.3 a). (K dvalues reported in previous studies range from 0.01 to 6.5 nm, depending on the binding conditions used (3Rebar E.J. Pabo C.O.

Simultaneously mutating Arg18 and Asp20 (positions −1 and 2 of the helix) to alanine produces a peptide that binds with an apparent K d of 4.4 nm (Fig. 3 c). Thus, the double mutant binds 26-fold less tightly than wild type Zif268 but about four times as tightly as the R18A single mutant. At this stage, we do not know why the double mutant binds more tightly than the single mutant, but it is possible that the R18A mutant, in addition to losing contacts with the guanine, also leads to some unfavorable electrostatic interactions for the Asp20 residue that is now left without a partner"

These enzymes catalyze the formation of cross-linked peptidoglycan (1Wise Jr., E.M. Park J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 2Tipper D.J.

The sensitivity of PBPs to penicillins is related to the structural similarity between the β-lactam ring of penicillin and the carboxyl-terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine residues in the natural substrates of these enzymes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the major human pathogens of the upper respiratory tract, has developed resistance to β-lactam antibiotics via modification of the target enzymes, PBPs. Altered PBPs have a reduced affinity for the β-lactams, and increased drug concentrations are required for their in vivo inhibition. Low-affinity PBPs in resistant clinical strains of pneumococci (R-PBPs) are encoded by mosaic genes (3Dowson C.G. Hutchison A. Spratt B.G. Mol.

In resistant clinical strains of S. pneumoniae, up to five PBPs are phenotypically altered in β-lactam low-affinity variants: PBPs 1a, 1b, 2a, 2x, and 2b (4Laible G. Spratt B.G. Hakenbeck R. Mol.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 106: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are primary targets for β-lactams (14Grebe T. Hakenbeck R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 829-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a detailed understanding of the structural modifications conferring the β-lactam resistance properties of these two PBPs is a crucial step in designing new β-lactam antibiotics. A prime candidate for such an analysis is the PBP2x from S. pneumoniae strain R6 whose three-dimensional structure is available (15Pares S. Mouz N. Petillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). By comparing R-PBP2x sequences with sequences from sensitive strains of streptococci (S-PBP2x), we have established that the resistant character of PBP2x is often associated with substitution at position Thr338. This position is located immediately after the active site Ser337, but does not contact the antibiotic (15Pares S. Mouz N. Petillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis we have confirmed the role of this position in modulating the reactivity of Ser337 toward β-lactams (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). During the course of this work we have identified other amino acid positions that were preferentially altered in R-PBP2xs. Herein, we extend our initial PBP2x sequence analysis and we present evidence linking the resistant phenotype to amino acid replacement at position 552 and 550. These positions are part of the active site groove strand β3 and defines one of the main contact region with the antibiotic as shown by the high resolution structure of a complex between PBP2x and the β-lactam cefuroxime (Fig. 1). Changes at both positions display different patterns of antibiotic acylation efficiency but a similar pattern of deacylation. These functional results highlight the role of the strand β3 residues of the active site groove in conferring the antibiotic-specific resistant phenotype. Deduced peptide sequences of 28pbp2x genes from penicillin-sensitive and -resistantS. pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mitis, were analyzed.

A DNA fragment encoding soluble PBP2x (PBP2x*), corresponding to Gly49 to Asp750, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pCG31 (19Laible G. Keck W. Lurz R. Mottl H. Frere J.M. Jamin M. Hakenbeck R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amplification was carried out using the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 3 min once and then 30 cycles (95 °C for 1 min; 55 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2.5 min). Polymerase chain reaction mixture (50 μl total volume) contained 5 ng of pCG31 template DNA, 50 pmol of primers, 0.2 mmol of 2′-deoxynucleotide 5′-triphosphates, and 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The 2125-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was purified by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel using the GeneClean kit (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA) and inserted into the pCR-Script SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting plasmid was digested simultaneously with EcoRI andXhoI restriction enzymes. The 2114-base pair purifiedEcoRI-XhoI DNA fragment was ligated into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) resulting in plasmid pGEX-S-PBP2x* encoding the glutathione S-transferase region fused to the NH2 terminus of S-PBP2x*. The complete nucleotide sequence encoding S-PBP2x* was determined using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham France SA). No unexpected mutation was detected, an observation confirmed by the mass spectrometry measurement of the encoded protein. The expression vector pGEX-S-PBP2x* was modified by introducing the replication origin of phage f1 as follows. First, a small DNA cassette resulting from the hybridization of oligonucleotides K7ori1 (5′-CAAGGTACCGCATGCAAGCTTTCTAGACCGACGT-3′) and K7ori2 (5′-CGGTCTAGAAAGCTTGCATGCGGTACCTTGACGT-3′) was introduced into the unique AatII restriction site of pGEX-S-PBP2x*. The resulting plasmid vector, pGEX-S-PBP2x*KX, was digested with a combination of KpnI and XbaI restriction enzymes and the large DNA fragment was purified as described above. This DNA fragment was ligated with the 525-base pairKpnI/XbaI DNA fragment from pUC-f1 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) containing the replication origin of phage f1. The resulting expression vector pGEX-S-PBP2x*-f1 was used to transform CJ236 Escherichia coli (dut-1,ung-1, thi-1; relA-1; pCJ105 (Cmr)). The transformed strain was infected with the M13K07 helper phage (Bio-Rad). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the single-stranded DNA produced from the resulting phagemid. Each mutant was controlled by DNA sequencing in the region of the expected mutation. Recombinant S-PBP2x* and all mutants derived from it described here were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography as described before (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I.

The proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their molecular masses were measured by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using a PE Sciex (Toronto, Canada) APIIII+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ionspray source (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Functional homogeneity of proteins was determined by titrating the active sites present in the preparation using cefotaxime as a reporter. PBP2xs (100 μm) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, with or without a 5-fold excess of cefotaxime, and analyzed by ESI-MS. The hydrolytic activity, defined by k cat/K m, of the TP was assayed in the presence of S2d, a synthetic thiol ester analogue of the cell wall stem peptide (Table I), according to the method described in Ref. 20Zhao G.

Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The apparent rate of decay k app (with (k 2/K) =k app/[β-lactam]) was determined from the exponential decrease of the fluorescence using the Pade-Laplace method following the simplex method. The deacylation reaction obeys the following equation, −k3t=ln{[EI*]t/[EI*]0}Equation 2 where [EI*]0 is the initial concentration of acyl enzyme and [EI*]t is its concentration at time t. The acyl enzyme was quantitated by fluorography (21Di Guilmi A.M. Mouz N. Andrieu J.P. Hoskins J. Jaskunas S.R. Gagnon J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5652-5659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of 25 resistant PBP2x produced by S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were compared with those of penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae,S. mitis, and S. oralis. Overall, 73 sites within the 351-residue TP domain of PBP2x (residue 266 to 616) were changed in at least one of the isolates, and 29 positions were affected in at least 20% of the strains (Fig. 2). The number of amino acid differences between one R-PBP2x and the TP PBP2x from S. pneumoniae R6 strain ranged from 11 to 45. A substitution at Thr338 occurred in 20 R-PBP2xs (80%). There was only one substitution Gln552 → Glu common to the remaining five sequences. This mutation was found, furthermore, in combination with an Pro338 in one, and with Ala338 in another three cases. In summary, at least one of the two positions, 338 or 552, were changed in all 25 sequences examined. Most interestingly, both amino acid changes are known to confer a resistance phenotype in vivo 2J. Krauß and R. Hakenbeck, unpublished results. and thus appear to be first candidates for a close in vitro investigation. The distance between the α carbon of the 15 remaining amino acid positions and the active site Ser337 α carbon was measured. Two positions, 338 and 552, are within 10 Å of Ser337 and are part of or near to conserved sequence motifs of the ASPRE family (active site serine penicillin recognizing enzymes) (Fig. 3) (22Joris B. Ghuysen J.M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frere J.M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, positions 338 and 552 are putative determinants for resistance to β-lactams. Indeed, position 338 was shown to be a key position in modulating the affinity to β-lactams, even thought this side chain is not in direct contact with either the substrate or the β-lactams (16Mouz N.

A Thr550 → Ala mutation has been observed in five independently obtained laboratory mutants after selection with extended spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime or cefpodoxime) (Table I), and a mutation to Gly550 has also been reported (14Grebe T.

The contribution of positions 552 and 550 to the resistance character was probed by site-directed mutagenesis in S-PBP2x*, a molecular context deprived of all the other amino acid changes found in R-PBP2xs. Six S-PBP2x* mutants were expressed in E. colias glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography following cleavage by thrombin. The yield of purified S-PBP2x* mutants is comparable to the one reported for S-PBP2x* and ranges from 20 to 50 mg/liter of bacterial culture (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y.

The molecular mass for all mutants measured by ESI-MS corresponds to the calculated mass deduced from the amino acid sequence (TableII). ESI-MS was also used to demonstrate that all mutants and S-PBP2x* are fully acylated by cefotaxime when incubated with an excess of antibiotic (data not shown). These results show functional homogeneity of all mutants.Table IICalculated and observed molecular masses (Da) of S-PBP2x* and variants, free and acylated by cefotaxime.

Open table in a new tab The error is estimated to ±10 Da. Accurate determination of enzyme kinetic parameters might be affected by variations in stability between mutants. This is especially true fork 3 measurement which requires long incubation periods at 37 °C. Therefore, we have measured the residual activity of the mutants following prolonged incubation at 37 °C which is the temperature used to measure all kinetic parameters (k 2/K, k 3, andk cat/K m). Since the enzymatic activity remained constant over time, the kinetic parameters of all mutants can be directly compared. The effect on S-PBP2x* of mutations most frequently found in β-lactam-resistant laboratory or clinical isolates, was determined. The acylation efficiency, represented by k 2/K, of S-PBP2x* mutants was measured by following the rapid accumulation of the acyl enzyme reported by the quenching of the protein intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 4). The acylation efficiencies of S-PBP2x* Q552E decrease by 72% for both Pen G and cefotaxime when compared with S-PBP2x*. The pattern of acylation efficiency of the S-PBP2x* T550A mutant is very different with ak 2/K reduction over 90% for cefotaxime whereas acylation by Pen G is not affected. To distinguish the influence of the hydroxyl group from the steric property of the side chain, the T550S S-PBP2x* mutant was constructed. This mutation reduces the acylation efficiency of enzyme for both antibiotics by about two-thirds. The reduction of β-lactam inhibition efficiency on laboratory and clinical resistant PBPs results mostly from a large decrease of thek 2/K, the influence of the slow deacylation rate being negligible (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Jamin M. Hakenbeck R. Frere J.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The deacylation rate of the three single mutants was measured by fluorography (TableIII). This rate ranges from 1.3 × 10−5 (s−1) to 3.8 × 10−5(s−1). These values remain very low, thus the effect of the mutations on the efficiency of acylation by β-lactams dominates.Table IIIKinetic parameters of S-PBP2x* and its variants with cefotaxime, Pen G, and thiol ester substrate S2dMutation(s) in S-PBP2x*CefotaximePen GPen GS2dk2/K × 10 −3(m −1 · s −1)k3 × 10 5 (s −1)kcat/Km(m −1 · s −1)S-PBP2x*209.0 ± 18.099.0 ± 12.02.7 ± 0.62,500 ± 200Q552E59.4 ± 3.130.6 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.41,690 ± 270T550A11.9 ± 0.9112.0 ± 10.01.3 ± 0.31,360 ± 140T550S62.0 ± 5.532.0 ± 2.82.1 ± 0.2210 ± 20T338A114.0 ± 2.436.7 ± 3.94.1 ± 0.4510 ± 40T338A-Q552E18.3 ± 3.319.5 ± 1.61.9 ± 0.1300 ± 20T338A-Q552E-S571P<0.2<3.8NDaND, not determined.<5a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To monitor the effect of the mutations on the enzymatic properties of S-PBP2x*, we have determined the hydrolytic activity of the mutants for the S2d substrate analogue of the cell wall stem peptide (Table III). The hydrolytic activities of the S-PBP2x* Q552E and T550A mutants were reduced by 32 and 46%, respectively, when compared with the S-PBP2x* activity. A marked decrease ofk cat/K m for the S2d thiol ester is observed for the S-PBP2x* T550S mutant, with less than 10% remaining activity of the wild type soluble enzyme. Thus, the S-PBP2x* T550S mutant, which is absent in the set of clinical or laboratory isolates, has a much reduced level of hydrolytic activity than the Q552E and T550A mutants. In previous work (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) we have shown that positions 338 and 571 were critical determinants for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. In our set of 25 clinical isolate PBP2x sequences, three of them contain both the T338A and Q552E mutations and one displays the combined substitutions T338A, Q552E, and S571P. These two combinations of mutations were introduced in the context of S-PBP2x* as a mean to evaluate their effect in the enzymatic properties (Table III). The acylation efficiencies of S-PBP2x* T338A,Q552E double mutant decrease by over 90 and 80% for cefotaxime and Pen G, respectively, when compared with S-PBP2x*. The deacylation rate of the mutant-Pen G complex decreases by 30% over the wild type enzyme. This slow rate remains negligible over the decrease of acylation efficiency. Thek cat/K m for the hydrolysis of S2d for the double mutant is reduced 8-fold when compared with S-PBP2x*. The S-PBP2x* T338A,Q552E,S571P mutant is active since it can be fully acylated when incubated with a five times excess of cefotaxime as determined by ESI-MS (data not shown). However, the accurate kinetic parameters of this triple mutant cannot be determined because their values are too low. Based upon previous experiments (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we have estimated the minimal measurable kinetic parameters as below 0.1 and 3.8% of the wild type value for k 2/Kfor cefotaxime and Pen G, respectively. Similarly, the minimal measurable k cat/K m for S2d is 0.2% of the wild type value. PBP2x is one of the main determinants for β-lactam resistance in the Gram-positive pathogen S. pneumoniae. The 351-residue long TP domain from S. pneumoniae R-PBP2x contains between 11 and 45 amino acid changes when compared with homologous genes from sensitive streptococci. Only a few of those changes are likely to be linked to the resistance phenotype. Two positions, located within 10 Å of the active site Ser337, display a restricted pattern of substitutions in R-PBP2x but are strictly conserved in PBP2x from sensitive strains. These amino acid changes in PBP2x are likely to be relevant to the acquisition of the resistance phenotype. The first position, Thr338 in S-PBP2x from R6 strain was shown to be a major determinant for resistance to β-lactam (16Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The second position, Gln552 in S-PBP2x from R6 strain, follows the Lys-Ser-Gly conserved motif (Fig. 3) in the ASPRE family and is part of strand β3 which borders the enzyme active site (15Pares S. Mouz N. Petillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have replaced this position by a Glu, a side chain frequently found in R-PBP2xs. This mutation reduced the efficiency of acylation by over two-thirds for both cefotaxime and Pen G but had only a marginal effect on the deacylation step considering that this value remains very low. This result unambiguously identifies position 552 as another key position for the modulation of PBP2x sensitivity to β-lactams. The PBP2x active site displays a global positive charge favoring binding of β-lactams which present a global negative charge. Introduction of a negative charge in active site via Glu552 conflicts with β-lactams and consequently leads to the observed reduction in acylation efficiency. Electrostatic steering effects are important in class A β-lactamases, which also belong to the ASPRE family (26Wade R.C. Gabdoulline R.R. Ludemann S.K. Lounnas V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5942-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the net charge of inhibitors and thiol substrate is −1, the driving force for ligand binding is affected by the mutation Q552E. Besides this long-range electrostatic effect, a direct contact between Gln552 and the β-lactams was shown by the recent 2.8-Å resolution x-ray structure of the complex between S-PBP2x* and cefuroxime. 3E. Gordon, manuscript in preparation. The cefuroxime lies close and parallel to strand β3 (Fig. 1), a mode of binding of β-lactams to the active site different from the one reported for theStreptomyces R61 PBP complexed to cefotaxime and cephalothin (27Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The furan ring of cefuroxime is close to the S-PBP2x* Gln552 side chain. Cefuroxime and cefotaxime have very similar structures (Table I). Assuming that their mode of binding to PBP2x is very close, then the introduction of a negative charge in strand β3 might conflict with the cefotaxime. The effect is much less pronounced when the hydrolytic activity of the Q552E mutant against the S2d substrate analogue is considered. S2d is a shorter molecule than cefotaxime and Pen G and the S2d phenyl group is less likely to be affected by Glu552 as it could be more readily accommodated by the protein. Thr550 in R6 strain, which is also located in strand β3 at a distance of 6.6 Å from active site Ser337, is often altered to Ala in PBP2x isolated from β-lactam-resistant S. pneumoniae selected in the laboratory using a single cephalosporin antibiotic. The T550A mutation in S-PBP2x* is neutral for Pen G but reduces the acylation efficiency for cefotaxime almost 20-fold. The same mutation was found in one PBP2x from a clinical isolate. The mutation increases the resistance of S. pneumoniae to cephalosporin but reduces its resistance to penicillin (17Coffey T.J. Daniels M. McDougal L.K. Dowson C.G. Tenover F.C. Spratt B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that, contrary to mutation Q552E, substitution T550A in S-PBP2x* affects the acylation efficiency for cefotaxime and Pen G differently. Our experimental data are in agreement with the observed differences between clinical and laboratory PBP2x mutants. Multiple selective pressure leads to PBP2x with a reduced acylation efficiency toward a larger spectrum of β-lactams than when a single antibiotic is used under laboratory conditions. Interestingly, some natural variants of TEM-1 β-lactamases have been found to contain an A237T substitution in a position equivalent to residue 550 in PBP2xs (28Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 29Sougakoff W. Petit A. Goussard S. Sirot D. Bure A. Courvalin P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 78: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These class A β-lactamases, generally penicillinases, have the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime. Preserving the hydroxyl group at position 550 while altering the steric property of the side chain (T550S mutation) leads to a PBP2x* mutant unable to discriminate between the Pen G and cefotaxime. This mutant displays acylation efficiency values very close to the Q552E mutant (Fig. 4). T550S mutation is not found in our collection of R-PBP2x, and this could be explained by the marked reduction in hydrolytic activity of the mutant. Thus, it is likely that the TP activity of S-PBP2x* T550S mutant is affected to a greater extent than it is for the Q552E mutant, which might be detrimental to the host bacteria. These differences might explain the selection of Glu at position 552 over Ser at position 550 in clinical isolates. All R-PBP2x sequences of the considered set contain substitutions at position 338 or 552; in four cases, the R-PBP2x sequences contain both substitutions. Combining T338A with Q552E further reduces the acylation efficiency over the single mutants. This reduction is more pronounced in the triple mutant T338A,Q552E,S571P reproducing a combination of side chains found in one sequence from our set of clinical isolates. Thus a limited number of mutations is sufficient to mimic the enzymatic properties of R-PBP2x. We thank Bernard Sartor and Isabelle Petit for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2076877843,"We previously reported the presence of two cellular serine/threonine protein kinases incorporated in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles. One protein kinase is MAPK ERK2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase), whereas the other one, a 53-kDa protein, still needs to be identified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the capsid protein CAp24 is phosphorylated by one of those two virion-associated protein kinases (Cartier, C., Deckert, M., Grangeasse, C., Trauger, R., Jensen, F., Bernard, A., Cozzone, A., Desgranges, C., and Boyer, V. (1997) J. Virol. 71, 4832–4837). In this study, we showed that CAp24 is not a direct substrate of MAPK ERK2. Moreover, using site-directed mutagenesis of each of the 9 serine residues of CAp24, we demonstrated the phosphorylation of 3 serine residues (Ser-109, Ser-149, and Ser-178) in the CAp24. Substitution of each serine residue did not affect viral budding, nor viral structure. By contrast, substitution of Ser-109, Ser-149, or Ser-178 affects viral infectivity by preventing the reverse transcription process to be completely achieved. Our results suggest that CAp24 serine phosphorylation is essential for viral uncoating process."

An acute response involves the rapid mobilization of cholesterol from intracellular stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the first step of steroid hormone synthesis is catalyzed by the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (P450SCC). By a more chronic and slower process, ACTH release from the pituitary stimulates transcription of the cytochrome P450 steroid hydroxylase genes, leading to optimal steroidogenic capacity such that steroid hormones can be generated on demand via the acute response. Analyses of the promoter regions of the genes encoding the steroid hydroxylases have led to identification of elements that can confer cAMP responsiveness to reporter genes. Interestingly, these promoter elements usually lack sequence similarity to the classical cAMP-responsive element, and furthermore, the factors interacting with these atypical cAMP-responsive sequences are not related to classical cAMP-responsive element-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of the regulatory regions of the human, bovine, rat, and mouseCYP11A genes, which encode P450SCC, have revealed species-specific variations in both the location and composition of cAMP-responsive elements (3Ahlgren R.

Deletion analysis of the bovine CYP11A gene through transfections in the mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line Y1 identified a cAMP-responsive sequence between −183 and −83 base pairs upstream of the start site of transcription (3Ahlgren R. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3313-3319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the functional cAMP-responsive sequence was found to reside within region −118 to −100, which is a G-rich sequence that is highly conserved in this position when comparing CYP11A from different species (9Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1682-1690PubMed Google Scholar). This element is similar to binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1, and a previous study has shown that the −118/−100 sequence binds a protein that is recognized by antibodies to Sp1. Mutations within the site that interfere with the binding of the Sp1-related protein in vitro also block cAMP induction mediated by the element in vivo (10Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, a sequence between −70 and −50 was shown to bind a protein antigenically related to Sp1 and to support cAMP-dependent transcription (10Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the Sp1-related factor could account only for part of the −118/−100 and −70/−50 binding activities present in Y1 extracts, and the ability of Sp1 to activate transcription was not tested directly. Sp1 is not the only protein binding to and acting through so-called GC boxes and related motifs present in many promoters. Recently, cDNAs encoding Sp1-related proteins have been isolated, indicating the existence of an Sp1 multigene family (11Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 12Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Three Sp1-related proteins called Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 have been characterized. They contain zinc-finger motifs as well as glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich stretches similar to those of Sp1. The DNA-binding domains of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 are highly conserved, and they recognize GC boxes with very similar specificities and affinities. Sp2, on the other hand, appears to have a DNA binding specificity that is very different from those of the other family members. The high degree of structural conservation among Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 is, however, not mirrored by a similar functional conservation. Several studies have indicated that whereas Sp1 and Sp4 act as transcriptional activators, Sp3 has bifunctional activities and acts both as an activator and a repressor of transcription (13Hagen G.

Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to Sp1, Sp4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding sites (14Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the different members of the Sp family of transcription factors may have unique rather than redundant functions. In light of this, we wanted to explore the possibility of usingDrosophila SL2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp factors, to test directly the function of individual Sp factors on theCYP11A gene and to study the influence of activation of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway. We also set out to determine whether the G-rich −118/−100 element of theCYP11A gene binds factors in addition to the suggested Sp1-related factor and, if so, could these be other members of the Sp family. The Scc-wt-luc plasmid contains the region between −186 and +12 of the bovine CYP11A gene fused to the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison WI). In Scc-mut-luc, the Gs at positions −107 and −108 have been changed to Cs (18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Dr. Evan R.

H295R cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with insulin (6.25 μg/ml), transferrin (6.25 μg/ml), selenium (6.25 ng/ml), linoleic acid (5.35 μg/ml; ITS Plus, Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), 2% Nu-SerumTM(Collaborative Research), and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Y1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum specific for insect cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). All transfections were performed in six-well dishes. Transient transfection of H295R cells was performed by use of the transfection reagent LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The protocol provided by the manufacturer was followed using 1.7 μl of transfection reagent/μg of plasmid. The amounts of plasmids transfected are as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin as indicated in the figure legends. After transfection, the cells were grown for 16 h before the forskolin treatment was started. SL2 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (20Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For CAT assays, cells were harvested by scraping in 0.1 m Tris acetate (pH 7.75), 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and 50–100 μl of the supernatant was used for determination of CAT activities as described (20Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CAT activities were quantified by phosphoimaging of thin-layer chromatography plates on a BAS-5000 phosphoimager (Fuji Film, Stockholm, Sweden). For luciferase assays, cells were harvested by scraping in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100, and 40 μl of cell lysate were used in the luciferase assay. Luciferase activities were determined utilizing a luciferase assay kit (Bio Thema, Dalarö, Sweden) and a Lucy-1 luminometer (Anthos, Austria) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay procedure (Pierce). Whole cell extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline; harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline; collected by gentle centrifugation; and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. The samples were boiled for 5 min before loading on the gel. The cells were treated with forskolin (10 μm) in fresh medium as indicated in the figure legends prior to preparation of whole cell extracts. Control extracts are extracts from cells given fresh medium only. For detection of Sp1, protein extracts were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters by semidry electroblotting in a buffer containing 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol. The filters were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween for 1 h (Tris-buffered saline/Tween) at room temperature; washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween; and subsequently incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature as indicated below. Bound antibodies were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) in combination with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and were visualized using a LAS1000 CCD camera (Fuji Film). The antibodies against Sp1 have been described previously (13Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides that were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). EMSA conditions were as described (10Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and antibodies in supershift experiments were added to the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min prior to their use in EMSAs. The antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 have been described previously (13Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), as have antibodies against ASP (22Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25213-25219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and antibodies against Egr-1 (antibody 189) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts prepared from the human and mouse adrenocortical tumor cell lines H295R and Y1, respectively. When the −118/−100 element (indicated inboldface in Fig.1 B) was radioactively labeled and incubated with Y1 or H295R extracts, three major complexes were observed (Figs. 2 and 3, indicated byarrows and arrowheads, respectively). All three complexes were specific in nature as judged by the ability of an excess of unlabeled −118/−100 element to abolish the appearance of the complexes (Fig. 2, second through fourth lanes). Also, an excess of an oligonucleotide encompassing an Sp1-binding site (23Dynan W.S. Saffer J.D. Lee W.S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4915-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) abolished the formation of all three complexes (Fig. 2,fifth through seventh lanes). Thus, these results provide further evidence that members of the Sp family of transcription factors participate in binding to the −118/−100 element. However, the −118/−100 element appears to be a weak Sp1-binding site since the unlabeled oligonucleotide encompassing the Sp1 consensus sequence was more effective in competing for binding than the unlabeled −118/−100 element.Figure 3EMSA profiles with the−118/−100 element and nuclear extracts from H295R and Y1 cells. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the −118/−100 element of the bovineCYP11A gene or the Sp1-binding site were incubated with 8 μg of nuclear extract (n.e) protein from H295R or Y1 cells. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on native 4% polyacrylamide gels. The arrowheads indicate specific complexes I—III. Anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, and anti-Sp4 antibodies (1 μl) were added to the indicated reactions by means of a 30-min preincubation with the nuclear extract at 4 °C. as, antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine which of the complexes may contain Sp factors, antibodies specific for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 were then added to the extracts. As shown in Fig. 3, anti-Sp1 antibodies significantly reduced or abolished the complex with the slowest mobility (complex I), whereas anti-Sp3 antibodies abolished the formation of a complex with higher mobility (complex II) and reduced formation of complex I. The addition of anti-Sp4 antibodies had no effect on the formation of either complex. Significant amounts of the fastest migrating complex (complex III) were resistant to the addition of antibodies to Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4, either when added individually or in combination with the nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when an oligonucleotide encompassing the Sp1-binding site was employed as a probe (Fig. 3). These results suggest that both Sp1 and Sp3 are present in adrenocortical nuclear extracts and bind to the −118/−100 element of the bovine CYP11A gene and that additional factors also recognize the element. Furthermore, the results suggest that the levels of Sp4 in Y1 or H295R nuclear extracts are very low since the addition of anti-Sp4 antibodies was without effect on complexes formed when the −118/−100 element or the Sp1-binding site was employed as a probe. We also performed an EMSA in which antibodies against the transcription factors Egr-1 and ASP were employed. The addition of antibodies against Egr-1 had no effect on the formation of the fastest migrating complex (complex III) in EMSA (data not shown). Egr-1 has previously been shown to bind Sp1-binding sites, but these results indicate that Egr-1 is not part of the complexes formed between the −118/−100 element and adrenocortical nuclear extracts. Similarly, antibodies to ASP, a protein that participates in the cAMP-dependent regulation of the CYP21 gene and that binds GC-rich sequences (22Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25213-25219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect (data not shown). Transient transfections of H295R cells were performed with a reporter construct in which sequences between −186 and +12 of the bovine CYP11A gene have been fused to the luciferase gene (Scc-wt-luc) (Fig. 1 A). The results show that the bovine promoter is active also in this human adrenocortical cell line (Fig.4), as has been previously shown to be the case in mouse Y1 cells (3Ahlgren R. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3313-3319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the promoter activity was stimulated by forskolin treatment of the cells. To determine the effects of individual Sp factors on CYP11Apromoter activity, we next investigated the activities of Scc-wt-luc inDrosophila SL2 cells. These insect cells provide a useful model since there are no endogenous Sp factors present. As shown in Fig. 5, Scc-wt-luc was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by cotransfection of a plasmid (pPacSp1) containing the Sp1 cDNA under the control of theDrosophila melanogaster actin 5C promoter (Fig. 5). A 9-fold stimulation was obtained when 1 μg of Sp1 expression plasmid was cotransfected with Scc-wt-luc. Cotransfection with pPacSp3 or pPacSp4 also resulted in stimulation of luciferase activity, 3- and 3.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 5). To determine if the effects of cotransfection of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 on luciferase activity are mediated by the −118/−100 element, we next employed the Scc-mut-luc construct, in which this element has been mutated (Fig. 1 B), in cotransfection experiments. Mutation of the element has previously been shown to interfere with protein binding in EMSA (10Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the mutation did indeed abolish Sp1- and Sp4-mediated effects on luciferase activity in SL2 cells and reduced the effects of Sp3 (Fig. 5). Thus, these results establish that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 can act as positive regulators of the bovineCYP11A gene and suggest that these effects are mediated through the GA-rich element localized between −118 and −100. Sp3 has previously been demonstrated to repress Sp1-dependent activation of several genes, and therefore, the effect of Sp3 on Sp1-mediated activation of a CYP11Areporter construct was explored in cotransfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 6, there was no effect of Sp3 on Sp1-mediated activation of the Scc-wt-luc construct in SL2 cells, whereas Sp3 repressed Sp1-mediated activation of the BCAT2 construct by 40%. To test the possibility that Sp1 levels in adrenocortical cells are regulated by cAMP, we performed Western blot analysis of extracts from H295R and Y1 cells that had been treated with forskolin for various lengths of time. As shown in Fig. 7, forskolin did not have an appreciable effect on Sp1 levels at any of the time points investigated. EMSA experiments were performed with the −118/−100 element and nuclear extracts from Y1 and H295R cells maintained in the presence or absence of forskolin for 6 h. The results of these experiments indicate that forskolin treatment does not alter the binding of protein factors to the −118/−100 element (data not shown). Mutation of the −118/−100 element within the CYP11A promoter (Scc-mut-luc) reduced forskolin-induced luciferase activity in H295R cells (Fig. 4), as has previously been shown in Y1 cells and primary cultures of bovine luteal cells (18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Since the cAMP-dependent regulation of the CYP11A promoter thus appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the −118/−100 element (Fig. 4) (18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and since Sp1 acts via this element (Fig. 5), we wanted to determine if the Sp1-dependent activation of the CYP11A gene is modulated by PKA. For this purpose, SL2 cells were transiently cotransfected with Scc-wt-luc and pPacSp1, and 18 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μmforskolin or a 200 μm concentration of the cAMP analogue 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP) for 6 h. In addition, SL2 cells were transiently cotransfected with Scc-wt-luc, pPacSp1, and an expression plasmid encoding the PKA catalytic subunit (Cα) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The results are shown in Fig.8 and demonstrate that forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP treatment enhanced Sp1-mediated activation of Scc-luc activity (2.4- and 2.6-fold, respectively). Cotransfection of SL2 cells with Cα resulted in a 4.2-fold increase in the Sp1-mediated activation of the Scc-luc reporter gene. Furthermore, in the absence of pPacSp1, there was no effect of forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP on the Scc reporter gene, suggesting that the cAMP-dependent activation is dependent on the presence of Sp1. Previous studies have shown the −118/−100 sequence of the bovineCYP11A gene to be involved in cAMP-dependent transcription in Y1 (9Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1682-1690PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine ovarian luteal (24Begeot M. Shetty U. Kilgore M. Waterman M. Simpson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17317-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells. It has also been shown to bind a protein antigenically related to Sp1. However, Sp1 is not the only transcription factor that can bind to and act via GC boxes and related motifs. In this study, we have performed supershift EMSA employing antibodies against several other GC box-binding proteins to determine what factors could bind the −118/−100 element. We demonstrate herein that this element, in addition to binding Sp1, also binds Sp3, another member of the Sp family of transcription factors, and that it binds additional factors, which remain to be identified. We also made use of Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp factors, to dissect the possible functional roles of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. Intriguingly, all factors were shown to stimulate the activity of a cotransfected reporter construct driven by the bovineCYP11A promoter. Sp3 can act both as an activator of transcription (25Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Nielsen S.J. Praestegaard M. Jorgensen H.F. Clark B.F. Biochem.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and as a repressor of Sp1-mediated transcription (15Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dennig J. Beato M.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, in the case of the CYP11A promoter, Sp3 did not repress the Sp1-dependent activation. In contrast, Sp3 could repress Sp1-mediated activation of the BCAT2 reporter construct in SL2 cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that the effect of Sp3 is dependent on the promoter context in which the Sp1 site is localized. The BCAT2 construct harbors two Sp1 sites, and this has previously been shown to be important for the negative effect of Sp3 (27Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Constructs containing a single Sp1 site, such as theCYP11A reporter, were less prone to be repressed by Sp3. In fact, Sp3 often activated transcription of such constructs (27Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The results obtained with CYP11A thus further illustrate the complexity of Sp1 sites and their context dependence. The −118/−100 element is required for basal and cAMP-mediated transcription of transfected CYP11A reporter genes in several cell types, including murine adrenocortical Y1 cells (9Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1682-1690PubMed Google Scholar, 10Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and bovine luteal cells (18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Begeot M. Shetty U. Kilgore M. Waterman M. Simpson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17317-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that this is also the case for human adrenocortical H295R cells, in which mutation of the −118/−100 element abolished cAMP-mediated stimulation of the Scc-luc construct. To establish that the effects of Sp factors on CYP11A-driven luciferase activity is mediated through the −118/−100 element, the same reporter gene construct mutated in the −118/−100 element was employed in transfection experiments in SL2 cells. Our results establish a positive role for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in the regulation of the bovine CYP11A gene via this element since the mutant construct was unresponsive. Evidence suggests that, in addition to the element at −118 to −100, a region between −70 and −50 binds factors antigenically related to Sp1 and may contribute to cAMP-dependent regulation of CYP11A (3Ahlgren R. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3313-3319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the results presented in this study suggest that this element is of less importance for Sp1-mediated activation since the construct mutated in the −118/−100 element, but with an intact Sp1 site at −70 to −50, was unresponsive. Sp1 has traditionally been characterized as a constitutive transcription factor and has been considered to be a regulator of basal promoter activity. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that Sp1 binding and transactivation can be modulated by a variety of stimuli, and Sp1 has been suggested to mediate the effects of various growth factors and hormones (29Jensen D.E.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This suggests that Sp1 may have a critical role also in directing tissue-specific (32Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Tan S.

Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and hormonal regulation of gene expression. Sp1 sites have been mapped to reside within cAMP-responsive regions in several genes, including the adrenodoxin gene (34Chang C.Y. Huang C. Guo I.C. Tsai H.M. Wu D.A. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1362-1370PubMed Google Scholar), the human surfactant protein 2A gene (35Young P.P. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1082-1093PubMed Google Scholar), the rhesus growth hormone variant gene (36Schanke J.T. Durning M. Johnson K.J. Bennett L.K. Golos T.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human urokinase gene (37Grimaldi P. Geremia R. Albanesi C. Rossi P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the rat sgk gene (38Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The close association between the Sp1 site at −118 to −100 in the bovineCYP11A gene and cAMP responsiveness prompted us to investigate the effect of cAMP on Sp1-mediated activation of the Scc-luc construct in SL2 cells. Our results indicate that forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP treatment of the cells, as well as cotransfection of the PKA catalytic subunit, enhanced the effect of Sp1 on Scc reporter gene activity. The effect of forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP was only observed in cells transfected with Sp1, linking this transcription factor to the response. Interestingly, a recent report (39Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cotransfection of insect Sf9 cells with Sp1 and the PKA catalytic subunit enhances Sp1-dependent activation of a reporter gene under the control of the SV40 promoter. Combined, these results suggest that Sp1 may be a bona fide nuclear target of the PKA-dependent signal transduction pathway. The mechanism by which Sp1 confers cAMP responsiveness to theCYP11A promoter is not yet defined. Tissue-specific and/or hormonal regulation of Sp1 expression is a possible mechanism by which Sp1 activity could be modulated. However, the levels of Sp1 protein in adrenocortical cells (Fig. 7) or ovarian granulosa cells (38Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are not altered by forskolin treatment as determined by immunoblot analysis. This suggests that other mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications of Sp1 or regulated interactions of Sp1 with other factors, are more likely to be involved. Sp1 has been shown to be a phosphoprotein, but the effect of phosphorylation on Sp1 activity is complex. Phosphorylation by a DNA-dependent kinase appears not to alter the activity (40Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), whereas casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation results in a decreased DNA binding activity (41Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the finding that PKA phosphorylation of Sp1in vitro increases its DNA binding activity (39Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, when the −118/−100 element was employed as a probe in EMSA, the same gel shifts were obtained with nuclear extracts from untreated or forskolin-treated adrenocortical cells, indicating that forskolin does not affect the DNA binding activity of Sp1 in this cell type for this particular site (data not shown). Thus, although Sp1 can serve as a substrate for PKA phosphorylation in vitro, it has not yet been demonstrated that this occurs in vivo in adrenocortical or other steroidogenic cells. It is recognized that Sp1 can interact with several other transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (42Lee Y.H. Yano M. Liu S.Y. Matsunaga E. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p53 (43Borellini F. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (44Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31149-31155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the estrogen receptor (31Porter W. Saville B. Hoivik D. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and thereby activate transcription. Increasing evidence is emerging that Sp1 enhances cooperative interactions among multiple transcription factors to juxtapose the transcriptional regulatory domains of the proteins with the transcription initiation complex (45Bessereau J.L. Mendelzon D. LePoupon C. Fiszman M. Changeux J.P. Piette J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 46Dittmer J. Gegonne A. Gitlin S.D. Ghysdael J. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21428-21434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether similar cooperative interactions of Sp1 with other transcription factors underlie the cAMP responsiveness of CYP11A remains to be determined. Finally, the sequence between −70 and −50 also predicts a binding site for steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a nuclear orphan receptor required for normal development of adrenals and gonads and a positive regulator of all steroid hydroxylase genes studied so far (reviewed in Ref. 47Parker K.L.

In most cases, the SF-1-binding sites are localized within cAMP-responsive regions, and SF-1 has been proposed to mediate the response in certain cases (48Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Clemens J.W. Lala D.S. Parker K.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that both Sp1 and SF-1 are necessary to achieve cAMP-dependent regulation of the CYP11A gene in Y1 cells as well as in primary bovine luteal cells (18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a two-hybrid assay revealed protein-protein interactions between Sp1 and SF-1, although no physical interaction could be demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (18Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction between the two factors could be through interaction with a coactivator. Recently, we have shown that mutation within the activation function-2 domain of SF-1 transforms the transcription factor into a dominant-negative mutant with respect to cAMP-dependent activation of the bovine CYP17gene (50Jacob A.L. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Also, others have shown that SF-1 can interact with steroid receptor coactivator 1 (51Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It could therefore be envisioned that cAMP might stimulate the interaction of coactivators, e.g.steroid receptor coactivator 1, not only with SF-1, but possibly also with Sp1. In conclusion, our results establish Sp1 as a cAMP-responsive transcription factor in the context of the bovine CYP11Apromoter and suggest the interesting possibility that cAMP may influence the interaction of Sp1 with cofactors shared with other transcription factors involved in CYP11A regulation. The expert technical assistance of Torild Ellingsen and Anita Koldingsnes is greatly appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2083196757,"Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful tool for the characterization of the molecular basis of ligand binding. We recently used this technique to demonstrate the proximity between a residue within the carboxyl-terminal half of a secretin-like ligand and the amino-terminal domain of the secretin receptor (Dong, M., Wang, Y., Pinon, D. I., Hadac, E. M., and Miller, L. J. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 903–909). In this work, we have developed another novel radioiodinatable secretin analogue ([Bpa6,Tyr10]rat secretin-27) that incorporates a photolabilep-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) residue into position 6 of the amino-terminal half of the ligand and used this to identify a specific receptor residue proximate to it. This probe specifically bound to the secretin receptor with high affinity (IC50 = 13.2 ± 2.5 nm) and was a potent stimulant of cAMP accumulation in secretin receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary-SecR cells (EC50 = 720 ± 230 pm). It covalently labeled the secretin receptor in a saturable and specific manner. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of this molecule yielded a single labeled fragment that migrated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel at M r = 19,000 that shifted to 10 after deglycosylation, most consistent with either of two glycosylated fragments within the amino-terminal tail. By immunoprecipitation with antibody directed to epitope tags incorporated into each of the two candidate fragments, the most distal fragment at the amino terminus was identified as the domain of labeling. The labeled domain was further refined to the first 16 residues by endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage and by cyanogen bromide cleavage of another receptor construct in which Val16 was mutated to Met. Radiochemical sequencing of photoaffinity-labeled secretin receptor fragments established that Val4 was the specific site of covalent attachment. This provides the first residue-residue contact between a secretin ligand and its receptor and will contribute substantially to the molecular understanding of this interaction. Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful tool for the characterization of the molecular basis of ligand binding.

Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These are structurally distinct from the Class I receptors in the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family, sharing their heptahelical topology but having distinct signature sequences and a unique extended amino-terminal motif with six conserved Cys residues (3Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Ulrich II, C.D. Holtmann M. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Class II receptors all bind moderately large peptides that have diffuse pharmacophoric domains (3Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of ligand binding to these receptors is not well understood. At the present time, broad receptor domains of importance in ligand binding have been identified. This is based predominantly on mutagenesis studies, including analysis of chimeric receptors, deletion constructs, and site mutants (5Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.-J. Carrero I.

These studies have postulated a critical role for the amino-terminal domain of the Class II receptors in binding their natural peptide ligands. Application of these approaches to the secretin receptor have been consistent with observations with other family members (8Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Peptides. 1996; 17: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The indirect insights provided by the mutagenesis studies have been supported by the more direct analysis of interacting domains by affinity labeling (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Zhou A.T. Bessalle R. Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. Proc.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22498-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Included among these studies is the first demonstration of the affinity labeling of a segment of the amino terminus of the secretin receptor that represents the first 30 residues using a probe with its photolabile site of attachment in position 22 in the carboxyl-terminal half of the ligand (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the specific molecular basis of binding of these ligands to their receptors remains unclear. In the present work, we have attempted to define a second domain of interaction between a distinct region of secretin and its receptor and to refine the molecular details of this interaction to the level of a single residue. For this, we have developed another novel photolabile radioiodinatable agonist probe. This probe, [Bpa6,Tyr10]rat1secretin-27, bound to the secretin receptor specifically and with high affinity and efficiently covalently labeled a single domain within that receptor. The ligand binding domain was localized by a series of targeted enzymatic and chemical fragmentation reactions, and the labeled residue was identified as Val4 using radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr), phenylisothiocyanate, and the solid phase oxidant, N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (Iodo-beads) were from Pierce. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was from Worthington. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride andN-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads were from Sigma. Concanavalin A-agarose was from EY Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA). Endoproteinase Lys-C and the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody directed to the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Endo F was prepared in our laboratory, as we have reported (16Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other reagents were analytical grade. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing the rat wild-type secretin receptor (CHO-SecR) and hemagglutinin epitope-tagged secretin receptor constructs SecR-HA37 and SecR-HA79, which have been previously established and characterized (1Dong M.

Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), were used as sources of receptors for the current study. An additional cell line was established for this report that expresses a hemagglutinin-tagged secretin receptor construct in which Val16 was mutated to Met (SecR-V16M-HA37) to introduce an additional site for CNBr cleavage. The construct was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, as previously reported (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This cell line was established in a similar manner to the above cell lines and had its binding and ability to transmit a signal fully characterized. Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C on tissue culture plastic in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and were lifted mechanically before membrane preparation. Enriched plasma membranes from these cell lines were prepared as we previously described (18Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rat secretin-27, [Tyr10]rat secretin-27, [Bpa6,Tyr10]rat secretin-27, and HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) peptides were synthesized by manual solid-phase techniques and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC (19Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Identities of the peptides were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. [Tyr10]rat secretin-27 and [Bpa6,Tyr10]rat secretin-27 were radioiodinated oxidatively with Na125I, upon exposure to the solid phase oxidant, N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (Iodo-beads, Pierce) for 15 s, and product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC to yield specific radioactivities of 2000 Ci/mmol (19Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The agonist activity of [Bpa6,Tyr10]rat secretin-27 was studied using a competition binding assay for stimulation of cAMP activity in the CHO-SecR cells (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). The assay was performed as we have previously described (20Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). For this, intact cells were stimulated with hormone at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold perchloric acid. After adjusting the pH to 6 with 30% KHCO3, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used in the assay. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6000. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times in independent experiments. The ability of [Bpa6,Tyr10]rat secretin-27 to bind to the secretin receptor was explored in a standard radioligand competition binding assay using the secretin receptor-bearing membranes from the CHO-SecR cells (17Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Membranes (1–10 μg of protein) were incubated with a constant amount of radioligand [Tyr10]rat secretin-27 (3–5 pm) and increasing concentrations of nonradiolabeled secretin analogue (0–1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature in KRH medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Bound and free radioligand were separated using a Skatron cell harvester with glass fiber filtermats that had been soaked in 0.3% polybrene, with bound radioactivity quantified in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm secretin and represented less than 20% of total binding. A similar assay was used to characterize the binding activity of the cell line expressing the SecR-V16M-HA37 secretin receptor mutant. For covalent labeling, receptor-bearing membranes from the CHO-SecR-HA37 cells containing approximately 100 μg of protein were incubated with 100 pm[Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 in KRH medium in the absence or presence of various concentrations of unlabeled secretin (from 0–1 μm). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, the incubation mixture was photolyzed for 30 min at 4 °C in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500-Å lamps. Membranes were pelleted, washed, and exposed to reduction and alkylation as we previously described (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were either separated directly by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) or solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 and bound to concanavalin A-agarose before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For selected experiments, the affinity-labeled secretin receptor and its relevant fragments were deglycosylated with endo F under the conditions we previously reported (22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gel-purified, affinity-labeled native and deglycosylated secretin receptor were digested with CNBr in 70% formic acid according to the procedure previously described (22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Endoproteinase Lys-C digestion was performed as we recently reported (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The products of cleavage were separated on 10% NuPAGE gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) using MES running buffer, with labeled products visualized by autoradiography. The apparent molecular masses of radiolabeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of MultimarkTM protein standards (Novex) versus the log values of their apparent masses. Definitive identification of the affinity-labeled secretin receptor fragments was achieved by immunoprecipitation of affinity-labeled intact and digested epitope-tagged constructs. Immunoprecipitations were performed using the procedure that we previously reported (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), adsorbing the antigen-antibody complex onto protein G-agarose (Calbiochem) before application to NuPAGE gel electrophoresis. Radiochemical sequencing was performed using Edman degradation chemistry and quantifying radioactivity released in each cycle. For this, radiolabeled CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C fragments of the receptor that had been eluted from NuPAGE gels were precipitated with 90% acetone for at least 4 h at −20 °C. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,800 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed with acetone. Purified fragments were coupled to N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads through the sulfhydryl group of a Cys residue. This was accomplished by derivatizing the amino groups on the beads withm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccininmide ester at pH 7.0 and quenching remaining amino reactivity with Tris before adding the labeled receptor fragment. Cycles of Edman degradation were repeated manually in a manner that has been previously described in detail (22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All observations were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and are expressed as means ±S.E. Binding curves were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) and were plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis routine for radioligand binding in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). [Bpa6,Tyr10]Rat secretin-27 contains a Tyr residue in position 10 for radioiodination and a photolabile Bpa in the position of Phe6 for covalent attachment. This secretin analogue was synthesized by manual solid-phase techniques, purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and characterized chemically by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. As expected, it bound to the secretin receptor saturably, specifically, and with high affinity with a K i of 26.3 ± 3.7 nm (IC50 = 13.2 ± 2.5 nm; Fig. 1). This analogue was a full agonist, stimulating intracellular cAMP accumulation in the secretin receptor-bearing CHO (CHO-SecR) cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 = 720 ± 230 pm (Fig. 1). We have previously characterized the epitope-tagged secretin receptor mutant, SecR-HA37, and showed that it behaved similarly to the wild-type receptor, with the advantage of having the epitope tag for rapid purification and domain identification (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This was used as source of receptor for affinity labeling (Fig. 2). The [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 analogue covalently labeled a protein migrating on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel at M r = 70,000, with this labeling inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner with unlabeled secretin. It should be noted that the epitope tag on the SecR-HA37 receptor construct resulted in electrophoretic migration that was slightly different from that of the wild-type secretin receptor (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,17Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of three similar experiments is also shown. The IC50 of this competition was 6.7 ± 1.2 nm. The efficiency of affinity labeling of this ligand was similar to that of the [125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]rat secretin-27 probe that we have recently reported (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As expected, deglycosylation with endo F of the labeled receptor resulted in a shift of migration to approximate M r = 42,000. Bands of this size were absent in affinity-labeled nonsecretin receptor-bearing CHO cell membranes. CNBr has long been used for quantitative cleavage of membrane proteins (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Ji Z.S. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Theoretically, CNBr cleavage of the secretin receptor would result in 11 fragments ranging in molecular weight from 1 to 11 thousand (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The spectrum of molecular masses and the presence of glycosylation at distinct sites may provide evidence for the domain being labeled using this single manipulation. Therefore, CNBr was used as a first indication of the domain being covalently labeled by [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27. Shown in Fig. 3 is a typical autoradiograph of a 10% NuPAGE gel used to separate the products of CNBr digestion of the affinity-labeled SecR-HA37 secretin receptor. As a control, the CNBr cleavage of the same receptor that was affinity-labeled with [125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]rat secretin-27 was shown in parallel in this figure. Like [125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]rat secretin-27, the [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 probe specifically labeled a band migrating at an approximateM r = 19,000. The migration of this fragment clearly shifted to approximate M r = 10,000 after deglycosylation with endo F. Given this evidence for glycosylation and the mass of the ligand probe attached (3,307 daltons), there were two reasonable candidate fragments. These represented the first CNBr fragment at the amino terminus of the receptor and the third fragment. Both have sites for glycosylation, with the first most closely fitting the expected masses. To determine which of these domains contained the site of covalent attachment, two well characterized secretin receptor mutants, SecR-HA37 and SecR-HA79 (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig.4, both intact secretin receptor mutants affinity labeled with [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 were recognized by anti-HA monoclonal antibody as demonstrated by their saturable immunoprecipitation in the absence and presence of excess competing HA peptide. However, immunoprecipitation of CNBr fragments of both affinity-labeled receptor mutants revealed that only the fragment from the HA37-tagged construct was radioactive (Fig. 4). This provides definitive identification of fragment one at the amino-terminal tail as the affinity-labeled receptor domain. Endoproteinase Lys-C, which specifically cleaves at Lys residues, was used to further refine the labeled receptor domain. As shown in Fig.5, this protease cleaves CNBr fragment one of the receptor into a nonglycosylated fragment of 3,425 daltons, a glycosylated fragment with core protein of 2,910 daltons, and two tiny fragments. A typical autoradiograph of a NuPAGE gel used to separate the fragments of Lys-C digestion of the CNBr-cleaved affinity-labeled secretin receptor is shown. The fully digested band migrated at approximate M r = 6,000 and did not shift after treatment with endo F. Given the mass of the attached probe, this was most consistent with the amino-terminal portion of fragment one. To be certain of this, the intact affinity-labeled receptor was also cleaved with Lys-C. If labeling had occurred in the carboxyl-terminal portion, this would have been expected to produce a band of higher molecular mass because of the presence of glycosylation. Instead, this procedure produced a labeled band of the same size as that produced by sequential digestion of CNBr fragment one. This identified the first 30 residues at the extreme amino-terminal tail of the secretin receptor as the domain of attachment of the [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 analogue. To further refine our understanding of the location of labeling, a stable cell line was established that expressed a secretin receptor mutant in which Val16 was changed to Met to introduce an additional site for CNBr cleavage (SecR-V16M-HA37). This receptor construct was functionally characterized in binding and cAMP assays. Data in Fig. 6 demonstrate specific and high affinity binding as well as stimulation of cAMP accumulation in response to secretin in these cells that is indistinguishable from that in control cells. Plasma membranes were prepared from the CHO-SecR-V16M-HA37 cells and affinity-labeled with [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 under the same conditions used for wild-type secretin and epitope-tagged SecR-HA37 receptors. This construct was also labeled saturably and specifically with [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27, with the labeled band migrating on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel at approximate M r = 70,000 and shifting toM r = 42,000 after deglycosylation with endo F (Fig. 7). CNBr cleavage of the intact receptor yielded a fragment migrating at approximateM r = 4,500 that did not shift after further treatment with endo F. Like digestion of the SecR-HA37 receptor, the endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage of the intact SecR-V16M-HA37 mutant receptor yielded a radioactive fragment migrating at approximateM r = 6,000, representing the first 30 amino acids at the amino terminus. Further cleavage of this fragment with CNBr yielded a radioactive fragment migrating at approximateM r = 4,500. These consistently identified that the first 16 amino acids at the amino terminus of the secretin receptor included the site of covalent attachment of [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27.Figure 7Cleavage of SecR-V16M-HA37 receptor affinity-labeled with [Bpa6 , 125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27. Shown is a typical autoradiograph of a NuPAGE gel used to separate products of labeling of SecR-V16M-HA37 receptor-bearing membranes in the presence and absence of excess competing unlabeled secretin (1 μm). Like the SecR-HA37 secretin receptor, the affinity-labeled secretin receptor migrated at approximate M r = 70,000. After deglycosylation with endo F, this band migrated at approximateM r = 42,000. CNBr digestion of both native and deglycosylated receptor mutant yielded fragments migrating similarly atM r = 4,500. Digestion of the intact affinity-labeled SecR-V16M-HA37 receptor with Lys-C alone yielded a fragment migrating at M r = 6,000. Further digestion of this fragment with CNBr resulted in a fragment migrating at M r = 4,500. These data suggest that the site of labeling resides within the region of residue Ala1 to Met16.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The site of covalent labeling of the secretin receptor with [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27 was further localized by radiochemical sequencing using manual Edman degradation. For this, the radiolabeled receptor fragments resulting from CNBr and Lys-C digestions were purified by NuPAGE gel electrophoresis. The profiles from this sequencing are shown in Fig.8. These were repeated with six independent samples for each fragment, with the radioactive peak eluting consistently in cycle 4 in all experiments. This corresponds with covalent attachment to Val4 of the secretin receptor. Of note, similar results were observed with radiochemical sequencing of the purified affinity-labeled fragment resulting from endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of a secretin receptor mutant in which we inserted an initiation codon and a Flag epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK) just prior to the predicted start of the mature receptor (AHTVGVPP) (data not shown). This was done to be certain that the postulated signal sequence was cleaved as has been predicted (2Ishihara T. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This further confirmed that Val4 is the site of covalent labeling of the secretin receptor with [Bpa6,125I-Tyr10]rat secretin-27. There is extraordinary structural diversity of ligands that can bind to and activate molecules in the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Of particular interest is the correlation between the structures of groups of ligands and the structural themes expressed within the groups of G protein-coupled receptors that they recognize (25Kolakowski L.F. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schwartz T.W. Perlman S. Rosenkilde M.M. Hjorth S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 812: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This organization has even been helpful in identifying the ligands for orphan receptor cDNA sequences that have been cloned. It has also been helpful in the identification of general themes for the binding determinants for groups of ligands, such as biogenic amine binding occurring in the intramembranous confluence of helices and glycoprotein hormones binding to large extracellular domains (27Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, we have detailed insights into the molecular basis of ligand binding for only a very small subset of these receptors (28Strader C.D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All the ligands that bind to and activate the Class II receptor family that have been identified to date have consistent structural features, representing moderately large peptides with diffuse pharmacophoric domains (29Bodanszky M. Bodanszky A. Peptides. 1986; 7 Suppl. 1: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, these peptides all have prominent areas of α helical content, with the extent of helix dependent on the hydrophobicity of their environment (30Blankenfeldt W. Nokihara K. Naruse S. Lessel U. Schomburg D. Wray V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Pellegrini M. Royo M. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Robinson R.M. Blakeney E.W. Mattice W.L. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 1217-1228Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structure of secretin is consistent with these themes (33Gronenborn A.M. Bovermann G. Clore G.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Clore M. Nilges M. Brunger A. Gronenborn A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the demonstration that two segments of α helix within secretin are separated by a turn, with this also affected by the environment. It is quite likely that the conformation of these peptides changes as they move from the aqueous milieu of the circulation and bind to their receptor molecules. We have been particularly interested in the conformation of secretin as it binds to its receptor. To gain insight into this, we are building a series of probes that are structurally similar to secretin while incorporating a photolabile site of covalent attachment in different positions throughout the pharmacophore. These should be useful in a strategy of intrinsic photoaffinity labeling and site determination. The first of these probes had a photolabile Bpa residue in position 22, within the carboxyl-terminal half of the ligand (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated to covalently label a specific receptor domain consisting of the first 30 residues at the amino terminus (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The present work has extended this insight by siting a Bpa in position 6, within the amino-terminal half of the ligand. Importantly, we have been able to substantially extend the level of insight provided by this contact to the level of a single residue of labeling, Val4, near the amino terminus of the receptor. Such insight will finally provide a solid constraint that can ultimately be built into meaningful conformational models of the ligand-bound receptor. It is particularly interesting that the domains labeled with the Bpa22- and Bpa6-containing secretin analogues were both near the end of the amino terminus of the secretin receptor. This is within a predicted α helical domain of the receptor. Helix-helix interaction has been postulated to exist in the recognition of ligands for Class II receptors (30Blankenfeldt W. Nokihara K. Naruse S. Lessel U. Schomburg D. Wray V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Pellegrini M. Royo M. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the mutagenesis studies, which suggested a critical importance of the amino-terminal tail region of the secretin receptor, although some extracellular loop domains may complement this domain and contribute to secretin binding and activation of its receptor (7Vilardaga J.-P.

By identifying a specific receptor residue that is proximate to a specific residue within a secretin agonist ligand, we have provided a valuable constraint to contribute to a meaningful molecular model of the agonist-bound receptor. At the present time, however, such a model cannot be proposed because of inadequate insight into the conformation of the important and long amino-terminal domain of the receptor. Delineation of the disulfide bonds that are predicted to exist and involve the highly conserved Cys residues within this domain (38Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Camus J.C. De Neef P. Christophe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) may provide key constraints to begin the modeling of this region. It will be particularly interesting and important to further localize the receptor residue proximate to the Bpa22 residue within the probe we used previously ([125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]rat secretin-27) (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). With such information, two distinct molecular contacts could be introduced. Although there will still be substantial opportunity for flexibility and movement of different parts of the ligand relative to the receptor, these insights will generate testable hypotheses to model residue interactions."

Embryonic cPLA2 activity remained constant from the 1-cell stage until the onset of somitogenesis, at which time it increased sharply.

The family of PLA2 enzymes is diverse and has been shown to function in digestion of lipids, microbial degradation, inflammation, cell signaling, and membrane remodeling (5Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). PLA2 enzymes are primarily classified on the basis of their Ca2+dependence and whether they are cytosolic or secreted (5Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent high molecular mass (85 kDa) cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) and some of the lower molecular mass (28–40 kDa) Ca2+-independent cytosolic PLA2s (iPLA2s) exhibit a substrate preference for phospholipids with arachidonic acid (AA) at the sn-2 position (6Gijon M.

Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14850-14853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is of particular significance because AA released by PLA2 activity is the precursor for the synthesis of eicosanoids, potent lipid mediators that include prostaglandins and leukotrienes (2Dennis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gijon M. Leslie C. Semin. Cell & Dev.

In contrast, secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s) and the 80-kDa cytosolic iPLA2 can liberate AA, but they exhibit little preference for sn-2 AA (5Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). A number of studies have explored the contributions of different PLA2 isoforms on total AA release and eicosanoid synthesis. In mice in which the cPLA2 gene was disrupted by targeted mutagenesis, the production of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor were all reduced in peritoneal macrophages (10Bonventre J.

Whereas the 80-kDa cytosolic iPLA2 can augment cPLA2-induced AA release, work by Dennis and co-workers (12Balsinde J. Balboa M. Dennis E. J. Biol.

Overexpression studies in tissue culture support the model that following pro-inflammatory stimuli cPLA2 activation triggers the immediate release of AA (within 30 min) that is essential for a later, sPLA2-induced, phase of AA release (measured over a 10-h period) (14Balsinde J.

Whether or not sPLA2 plays a central role in eicosanoid production, the above studies indicate that cPLA2 is an important mediator of stimulus-induced AA release and subsequent eicosanoid synthesis. The cPLA2 protein is ubiquitously expressed in all adult human tissues (17Miyashita A. Crystal R.G. Hay J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) but is subject to complex regulation that enables the immediate generation of eicosanoids in response to physiologic stimuli (18Lin L.

For example, in cell culture, a number of receptor agonists (e.g. interleukin-1, ATP, and thrombin) increase cytosolic calcium.

The lack of a morphological phenotype in these mice could be due to the expression and overlapping function of two other recently identified cPLA2 homologues (35Underwood K. Song C. Kriz R. Chang X.

As a first step in exploring the function of lipases in developing embryos, we have devised an assay to measure PLA2 activity in embryonic extracts of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, utilizing BODIPY-labeled phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a substrate. By using this assay with different BODIPY-labeled substrates, and in the presence of various PLA2 inhibitors, we have identified cPLA2 as the principal enzymatic activity in zebrafish embryogenesis, and we characterized the developmental activity profile. The finding that cPLA2 activity was the primary enzyme responsible for embryonic activity was confirmed by Western analysis of sucrose density gradient fractions. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to study vertebrate embryonic PLA2 activity in vivo in that embryos are optically clear and experimentally accessible. These properties permit detection of enzymatic activity in living embryos using a quenched BODIPY-labeled PC that fluoresces upon cleavage by PLA2 (36Meshulam T. Herscovitz H. Casavant D. Bernardo J.

(Ann Arbor, MI). Phenylbutylmethyl fluorophosphonate (PMFP) and trifluoromethylelaidoyl ketone (ECOCF3) were kindly provided by M. Gelb (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Methods for breeding and raising zebrafish were followed as described (38Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 3rd Ed. University of Oregon, Eugene1995Google Scholar). Embryos were obtained from natural matings of wild-type fish and staged according to criteria previously outlined (39Kimmel C. Ballard W. Kimmel S. Ullmann B. Schilling T. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8760) Google Scholar). Single embryos were placed in 0.5 ml of embryo medium (EM; in mm: 13.7 NaCl, 0.537 KCl, 0.025 Na2HPO4, 0.044 KH2PO4, 1.30 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 4.2 NaHCO3, pH 7.2 (38Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 3rd Ed. University of Oregon, Eugene1995Google Scholar)), containing 150–200 ng of a fluorescent phospholipid substrate, and sonicated for 2–5 s (6.3-cm cup horn, 100 watts; Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Inc. Plainview, NY). After 2–4 h at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) (40Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (42855) Google Scholar), mixed, and centrifuged (30 s, 16,000 × g). The aqueous fraction was discarded, and the remaining lipid was dried under vacuum, resuspended in chloroform, and loaded on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (LK6D, Whatman, Clifton, NJ). Plates were developed in toluene, diethyl ether, ethanol, and acetic acid (50:40:2:0.2), and quantified using a laser scanner (blue laser, 800 V, Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Embryos (64-cell or shield stages) were placed in Petri dishes containing EM and examined under a dissecting stereomicroscope. The most posterior region of the yolk cell was pierced with number 5 watchmaker's forceps. The wound was gently reopened 1 or 2 times over the course of 10–20 min until most of the yolk had flowed away from the blastoderm. Blastoderms were then rinsed in EM and assayed as described. Zebrafish lipids were added to some assays and were prepared as follows. Embryos (20 at shield stage) were homogenized in EM (50 μl) by sonication; methanol (100 μl) and chloroform (200 μl) were added, and the solution was mixed and centrifuged (30 s, 16,000 × g). The upper phase was discarded, and the lower phase was dried under a stream of N2. The lipids were resuspended in ethanol (2 μl) followed by the immediate addition of EM (98 μl). Either one embryo lipid equivalent (5 μl of lipid solution) or a control solution (5 μl of 2% ethanol in EM solution) was added to the assays. cPLA2 mRNA levels were detected by Northern analysis (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled cPLA2 probe prepared by random priming (Prime-It II; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) of gel purified (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) zebrafish cPLA2 cDNA (2.5 kilobase pairs) excised from the PDE4 vector (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). Zebrafish embryos were homogenized in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antiserum (1:1000) to human cPLA2 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) and a goat anti-rabbit secondary (1:2000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, embryos were homogenized in buffer that also contained 5% sucrose and loaded on a linear sucrose gradient (2 ml, 5–23%) for centrifugation (2 h at 259,000 × g). Fractions (130 μl) were collected, and aliquots were assayed for total protein, PLA2 activity, and by Western blotting as described above. Bis-BODIPY PC was purified by TLC to remove low abundance BODIPY-labeled degradation products immediately prior to incorporation into liposomes. The liposome composition that yielded the best quenching was based on two previously published protocols (36Meshulam T. Herscovitz H. Casavant D. Bernardo J. Roman R. Haugland R. Strohmeier G. Diamond R. Simons E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21465-21470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kim T. Sundaresh C. Feinstein S. Dodia C. Skach W. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of DPPS/cholesterol/phosphatidylglycerol/bis-BODIPY PC (107:31:20:1; a total of 287 nmol) was dried under N2 and resuspended in ethanol (10 μl) followed by the addition of EM (10 μl). The solution was again dried under N2 until the volume was approximately 7 μl to ensure the evaporation of most of the ethanol. EM (0.15 ml) was added, and liposomes were prepared by sonication of the mixture on ice (20 min, probe type). Liposomes were incubated with dechorionated gastrulating embryos (2–4 h at 28 °C; 20 μl/embryo). Embryos were rinsed with EM and placed in a glass depression slide. Fluorescence was visualized using a Leica TCSNT confocal microscope. We have developed a sensitive assay for PLA2 activity that utilizes a PC substrate containing a BODIPY-labeled fatty acid on the sn-2 position. Cleavage of this lipid by PLA2 liberates a fluorescent fatty acid that is readily separated from the uncleaved substrate on TLC plates and quantified by laser scanning. The addition of purified PLA2(N. mossambica mossambica) to the assay buffer (EM + substrate) resulted in complete cleavage of the substrate, detected as the appearance of a band on the TLC plate that co-migrates with free BODIPY-labeled fatty acid (Fig. 1 A, lane 1), the expected product of PLA2 activity (Fig.1 A, lane 2). To test whether other phospholipases generate products that also co-migrate with the free BODIPY-labeled fatty acid, we examined the cleavage products of purified phospholipase C and phospholipase D in the assay. Samples incubated with phospholipase C produced a distinct fluorescent diacylglycerol species that was easily resolved from the free BODIPY-labeled fatty acid (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The expected product of phospholipase D activity, a fluorescent phosphatidic acid species, migrated with the uncleaved PC substrate and not with the free fatty acid generated by PLA2 (data not shown). In samples without added enzyme, we observed a consistent small amount of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate (0.03–0.05% of the substrate/h) which is 10–100-fold less than that observed with samples containing PLA2 (Fig.1 A, lane 5). For this reason, all experiments included at least one control incubation that consisted of assay buffer alone. Following quantification of the TLC plate, the fluorescence of this control reaction was used as the base line for all samples. By using this assay, PLA2 activity could be detected in extracts of single zebrafish embryos (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Zebrafish PLA1 activity was not detected in these assays using a TLC solvent system that resolves fluorescent lyso-PC (the expected product of PLA1) from the fluorescent PC substrate (data not shown). To test whether any PLA2 was inactivated during the incubation period (typically 2–3 h), zebrafish embryonic extracts were assayed for various lengths of time. The rate of substrate cleavage was independent of assay duration for more than 7 h (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the PLA2activity in zebrafish embryonic extracts was stable. Shortly after fertilization, the zebrafish zygote segregates into two domains, the dividing cells (blastodisc) atop a yolk cell (39Kimmel C. Ballard W. Kimmel S. Ullmann B. Schilling T. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8760) Google Scholar). The blastodisc divides multiple times generating a cellular blastoderm (approximately 4000 cells) that continues to divide while migrating over the large (∼700-μm diameter) yolk cell in a process termed epiboly (42Solnica-Krezel L. Stemple D.L. Driever W. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on the yolk composition of other teleosts (43Navas J. Bruce M. Thrush M. Farndale B. Bromage N. Zanuy S. Carrillo M. Bell J. Ramos J. J. Fish Biol. 1997; 51: 760-773Crossref Google Scholar, 44Gallagher M. Paramore L. Alves D. Rulifson R. J. Fish Biol. 1998; 52: 1218-1228Crossref Google Scholar), the zebrafish yolk likely contains lipoproteins and lipids. The observed PLA2 activity of the zebrafish embryo might serve the following two functions: it could be associated with degradation of yolk lipid for a nutritive purpose, or it could be a mediator of cell signaling in the blastoderm. To distinguish between these possibilities, the yolk was separated from the overlying blastoderm by piercing the yolk cell and extruding the yolk (Fig.2 A). Levels of PLA2 activity in the blastoderm and intact embryo were then compared. Whereas we observed a small reduction in activity after yolk removal in embryos assayed at the 64–128-cell stage (31 ± 5%), no reduction was observed in shield stage embryos (6 h post-fertilization, approximately 16,000 cells) (Fig. 2 B). Shield stage embryos and blastoderms were also assayed in the presence of additional zebrafish lipids to quantify the activity in the blastoderm and the levels of endogenous zebrafish lipid that can compete in the assay (Fig. 2 B, and see “”). Modeling of these data indicate that the yolk contains no PLA2 activity at shield stage (see “”) and suggests that embryonic activity primarily mediates cell signaling in the blastoderm rather than yolk lipid processing. To characterize the phospholipase activity present in zebrafish embryos, we utilized the fluorescent TLC assay to analyze substrate preference, calcium dependence, and response to specific inhibitors. Two substrates with different acyl chains were useful to distinguish between activity due to sPLA2 or to cPLA2/iPLA2 (D-7707 contains a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid on the sn-2 position and a BODIPY-labeled fatty acid on the sn-1 position, and D-3803 contains a BODIPY-labeled saturated fatty acid on the sn-2 position and an unlabeled fatty acid on the sn-1 position) (Fig. 3 A). sPLA2is known to exhibit little specificity for particular acyl chains, and accordingly, purified snake enzyme cleaved both substrates in the assay (Fig. 3 B, lane 2 upper arrow and lane 5, lower arrow). In contrast, purified human cPLA2 showed a strong preference for D-3803 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) over D-7707 (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). The BODIPY-labeled acyl chain of D-3803 was cleaved by cPLA2 30-fold more readily than was saturated fatty acid of D-7707 (Fig. 3 A, lane 3 versus lane 6). When D-3803 was used a substrate, there was a linear relationship between enzyme concentration and the level of PLA2 cleavage product; as little as 20 ng of human cPLA2 extract generated significant BODIPY-labeled fatty acid (3-fold greater than blank, Fig. 3 C). This level of activity is in the range of that previously observed for cleavage of phospholipids containing radiolabeled AA (22Clark J. Lin L. Kriz R. Ramesha C. Sultzman L. Lin A. Milona N. Knopf J. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) and confirms our observation that the affinity of cPLA2 for, and cleavage of, D-3803 is comparable to that of endogenous cPLA2 substrates. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic BODIPY moiety at the sn-2 position disrupts the local membrane environment in a fashion similar to AA. The substrate preference of the enzymatic activity present in zebrafish extracts (Fig. 3 D) was more similar to that of the purified human cPLA2 (D-3803 is cleaved to release a BODIPY-fatty acid, whereas D-7707 is not cleaved), suggesting that zebrafish embryos do not contain significant sPLA2 activity. Consistent with this observation, extract PLA2 activity was not significantly inhibited by dithiothreitol (10 mm), a potent sPLA2 inhibitor (treated embryos had 87 ± 9% of control activity, n = 3, p > 0.4). Since cPLA2 and some iPLA2s can exhibit similar acyl chain preferences, comparisons of the cleavage rates of different substrates is insufficient to discriminate between their activities. One defining characteristic of iPLA2s is their Ca2+ independence. The PLA2 activity in zebrafish embryonic extracts was reduced by greater than 80% (Fig.4 A) with the removal of free Ca2+ through the addition of EGTA (10 mm), suggesting that the activity was predominantly due to cPLA2and not iPLA2. To confirm this observation, zebrafish extracts were incubated with a panel of PLA2 inhibitors that are known to exhibit different relative potencies for the two classes of enzyme. MAFP, an irreversible inhibitor of cPLA2 that is believed to form a covalent bond with serine 228 of the catalytic site (45Huang Z. Payette P. Abdullah K. Cromlish W. Kennedy B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3712-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was a potent inhibitor of the zebrafish extract activity (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, the well characterized competitive cPLA2inhibitor AACOCF3 (46Riendeau D. Guay J. Weech P.K. Laliberte F. Yergey J. Li C. Desmarais S. Perrier H. Liu S. Nicoll-Griffith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15619-15624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Street I. Lin H. Laliberte F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N. Huang Z. Weech P. Gelb M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) was also effective in blocking extract activity (Fig. 4 C). The substitution of the arachidonyl moiety of MAFP with a phenyl-butyl group (PMFP) or the arachidonyl moiety of AACOCF3 with an elaidoyl moiety (ECOCF3) yields inhibitors that are more potent against iPLA2. 2M. Gelb, personal communication. However, these modified inhibitors were less effective than their arachidonyl versions at inhibiting extract activity (Fig. 4, B andC). In sum, the ranked potency of PLA2inhibitors for zebrafish extracts (MAFP (ED50 2 nm) > PMFP (ED50 200 nm) > AACOCF3 (ED50 15 μm) > ECOCF3 (ED50 30 μm)) more closely paralleled that expected for cPLA2 than that expected for iPLA2 (PMFP > MAFP > ECOCF3 > AACOCF3). An additional inhibitor, BEL, is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of iPLA2 that can also inhibit cPLA2, but only at higher doses (14Balsinde J. Dennis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In zebrafish extracts, BEL was 1000 times less effective an inhibitor of PLA2 activity than MAFP. Moreover, inhibition of the zebrafish activity required 50-fold higher doses than reported for purified iPLA2 (48Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 49Hazen S. Zupan L. Weiss R. Getman D. Gross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.4 D). Taken together, the pharmacological profile of the PLA2 activity in the zebrafish embryo is most consistent with the cPLA2 subtype. PLA2 activity in lysates was characterized during different stages of zebrafish embryonic development. The activity observed at the 1-cell stage reflects a significant maternal contribution of cPLA2protein to the embryo (note that zygotic transcription does not begin until the 1000-cell stage) (Fig.5 B). Activity remained constant from the 1-cell to 4-somite stage and then increased,"

In Type II cells, proteolytic processing of the SP-B proprotein is initiated in the multivesicular body with cleavage of an NH2-terminal propeptide to generate a processing intermediate of 25 kDa (11Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L100-L108PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hawgood S. Latham D. Borchelt J. Damm D. White T. Benson B. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L290-L299PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage of a COOH-terminal propeptide results in liberation of the hydrophobic mature peptide which forms homodimers of 18 kDa. Mature SP-B is stored with surfactant phospholipids in lamellar bodies, the contents of which are released into the alveolar airspace via basal and stimulus-induced secretion (reviewed in (13Rooney S.A. Young S.L. Mendelson C.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the well characterized SP-B biosynthetic pathway in Type II cells, little is known about synthesis and processing of SP-B in Clara cells. Technical problems in the isolation of pure populations of these cells has made study of SP-B processing by Clara cells difficult. Clara cells are the most abundant cell type within the conducting airways of the murine lung, comprising more than 50% of the epithelial cells lining the terminal bronchioles (14Plopper C.G. Mariassy A.T. Hill L.H. Exp. Lung Res. 1980; 1: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Plopper C.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 128: S37-S41PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of SP-B in cells at the terminal airway/alveolar junction suggests that under certain circumstances, Clara cells may contribute SP-B to the alveolar surfactant pool. In addition to a putative alveolar surfactant function, Clara cell SP-B may also promote formation of a surfactant film in the terminal bronchioles which may be important for maintaining the patency of small conducting airways. Finally, given the widespread distribution of Clara cells in the murine airway, it is possible that SP-B has function(s) that are independent of surfactant activity. In order to better understand the role of SP-B in Type II cells and Clara cells, we have generated transgenic mouse lines in which SP-B expression was ablated and then restored in a cell-specific manner.

Prior to injection, the 4.4-kb transgene was released from the vector by SalI/NotI digestion and gel-purified using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Purified DNA was extensively dialyzed against 5 mmTris (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mm EDTA and subsequently microinjected into fertilized eggs of the FVB/N mouse strain by the Children's Hospital Transgenic Core facility (Cincinnati, OH). Founder mice were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mouse tail DNA using a 5′-primer (5′-CAATCACTGCCCTCTACCTCTT-3′) specific to murine CCSP promoter and a 3′-primer (5′-GCACCCTTGGGAATCATGGCTTGGATC-3′) specific to human SP-B to generate an 800-bp product. Genomic DNA isolated from mouse tail was amplified in a 35-cycle PCR with 0.5 μm of each primer, 400 μm dNTPs, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of master mixture buffer (10 μm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 nm EDTA) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR results were confirmed by Southern blotting of BamHI-digested tail DNA with the 400-bp 32P-labeled SV40 small t intron/poly(A) probe. Transgene expression was identified by S1 nuclease protection assay with a human SP-B probe (18Yei S.P. Bachurski C.J. Weaver T.E. Wert S.E. Trapnell B.C. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The two independent lines of mCCSP/hSP-B mice which had detectable levels of transgene expression were subsequently interbred to increase SP-B expression. In order to achieve selective expression of SP-B in Clara cells of SP-B −/− mice, mCCSP/hSP-B transgenic mice were crossed with SP-B +/− mice to produce mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) offspring. The mSP-C/hSP-B transgene, composed of a 4.8-kbXbaI/XhoI murine SP-C promoter (a kind gift from Dr. Stephan Glasser, Division of Pulmonary Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) followed by a 1.6-kbXhoI/EcoRI fragment of the full-length human SP-B cDNA and a 400-bp EcoRI/NotI cassette containing the SV40 small t intron and polyadenylation signal, was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The 6.8-kb transgene was released from the vector byXbaI/NotI digestion, gel-purified with QIAEX resin (Qiagen), extensively dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mm EDTA, and subsequently injected into fertilized eggs of the FVB/N mouse strain. Founder mice were identified by an 800-bp PCR product with a 5′-primer (5′-CTGAAAAGCCAGGAACAAACAAGC-3′) specific to the murine SP-C promoter and a 3′-primer (5′-GCACCCTTGGGAATCATGGCTTGGATC-3′) specific to human SP-B. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR and Southern blotting and transgene expression verified as described above. Three independent mSP-C/hSP-B lines were subsequently established. To achieve selective expression of SP-B in Type II cells of SP-B −/− mice, mSP-C/hSP-B transgenic mice were bred with murine SP-B+/− hemizygous mice to produce SP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) offspring.

In situ hybridization of paraffin-embedded embryonic and adult lungs was performed using both human and murine SP-B cRNA probes under stringent conditions followed by extensive post-hybridization washing to minimize cross-reactivity between the murine and human SP-B probes, as described previously (21Damore-Bruno M.A. Wikenheiser K.A.

To assess the processing and secretion of SP-B in transgenic animals, 5 to 100 μg of protein from total lung homogenate or 30 μg of protein from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed with antiserum 28031, directed against the mature SP-B peptide, at a dilution of 1:500, antiserum 96189, directed against recombinant COOH-terminal propeptide of human SP-B, at a dilution of 1:5000, or antiserum 55522, directed against recombinant human SP-B proprotein, at a dilution of 1:5000 (23Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for SP-B proprotein was performed with antisera 96189, 55522, or 55019 as described previously (24Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Serial 5-μm paraffin sections from lung tissues were loaded onto polylysine-coated slides (Fisher, Atlanta, GA). Slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated in a series of graded alcohols, and treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 2% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antiserum diluted 1:500, 1:1000, or 1:2000 in blocking solution (24Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). After washing, the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in the blocking solution, followed by incubation for 30 min with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex using Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The slides were color developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-HCl and further enhanced with nickel cobalt followed by counterstaining with nuclear fast red. Sections were photographed on a Microphot-FXA Nikon fluorescence microscope. Fetuses were collected by cesarean section at 18 days of gestation and the torso fixed in ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (SCB) at pH 7.3 for 2 h. The fixed lungs were removed, cut into 1–2-mm3 blocks, post-fixed in fresh fixative overnight at 4 °C, washed in 0.1 m SCB, and incubated with 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) in 0.1 m SCB for 2 h at room temperature. Tissues were dehydrated in a series of graded alcohol solutions and embedded in EMbed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Ultrathin sections were cut at 100 nm of thickness using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Reichert, Austria), and post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Alveolar Type II epithelial cells and Clara cells were photographed at ×8,000 using a JEOL 100-CXII electron microscope at 80 keV of accelerating voltage. Immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections was performed precisely as we have previously described (25Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M.G.

We have previously demonstrated that SP-B RNA is not detected in Clara cells of this transgenic line and alveolar surfactant pool size and phospholipid composition are not different from wild type littermates (26Akinbi H.T.

Three 6-week-old hSP-C/hSPBΔc(mSP-B −/−) mice and 3 wild type mice in the same genetic background (FVB/N) were exposed to 95% oxygen for 48 or 72 h as described previously (27Nogee L.M. Wispe' J.R.

Following exposure, mice were immediately sacrificed by a lethal injection of pentobarbital, rapidly exsanguinated, and the lungs perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The lungs were excised, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and prepared for either hematoxylin and eosin staining or immunostaining with antibodies directed against the mature SP-B or proprotein. Control mice consisted of 3 room air-exposed littermates of the same genotype. For semiquantitative analysis, MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA) was used to acquire and store images of hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections from the right upper, right middle, right lower, left upper, and left lower lobes. Five sections from each lung were visualized with a ×20 objective lens and MetaMorph software used to assess total number of Type II cells, average Type II cell size, average septal wall thickness, total alveolar space, and average alveolar space. These measurements were scored by 3 masked observers and compared statistically by two-way ANOVA. Each observer also noted the degree of microhemorrhages and exudation/pulmonary edema (none, mild/minimal, severe). SP-B is synthesized in both alveolar Type II cells and bronchiolar Clara cells. To define the functions of SP-B in each cell type, transgenic mice were generated in which the full-length human SP-B cDNA was targeted to the bronchiolar Clara cell (mCCSP/hSP-B) or the alveolar Type II cell (mSP-C/hSP-B) using either the murine CCSP or the murine SP-C promoter. Of 49 offspring from mCCSP/hSP-B injections, 12 (24%) were transgene positive, identified by both PCR and Southern blot analyses of tail DNA, whereas 5 out of 24 progeny (21%) were positive for the mSP-C/hSP-B transgene (not shown). Among these founders, two lines of mCCSP/hSP-B and three lines of mSP-C/hSP-B which expressed detectable levels of human SP-B were identified by S1 nuclease protection analyses and Western blotting (not shown). The two lines of mCCSP/hSP-B mice were subsequently interbred to increase SP-B production in Clara cells. To target SP-B mRNA to either Type II cells or Clara cells in SP-B −/− mice, the mCCSP/hSP-B and mSP-C/hSP-B transgenic mice were crossed with murine SP-B +/− hemizygous mice. Offspring carrying both the human SP-B transgene and a single copy of the murine SP-B gene were bred to achieve cell-specific hSP-B expression in the SP-B −/− background. Previous studies have suggested that the 2.3-kb mouse CCSP (16Stripp B.R. Huffman J.A. Bohinski R.J. Genomics. 1994; 20: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Hackett B.P. Gitlin J.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) promoters direct gene expression specific to Clara cells or alveolar Type II cells, respectively. To assess the specificity of hSP-B transgene expression from the murine CCSP and murine SP-C promoters, in situ hybridization was performed using human and murine SP-B probes (Fig.1). In the adult wild type animal, murine SP-B mRNA was detected in alveolar Type II cells and bronchiolar Clara cells (Fig. 1 A). In day 18 fetal mice expressing human SP-B under control of the murine CCSP promoter in the wild type background (mCCSP/hSP-B), human SP-B mRNA was detected in Clara cells but not in Type II cells (Fig. 1 D), whereas murine SP-B mRNA was detected in both alveolar and bronchiolar cells (Fig.1 C). In the mCCSP/hSP-B mice, human SP-B mRNA was detected at higher levels in the proximal bronchiolar epithelium than in distal bronchioles on day 18 of gestation (not shown). When these mice were crossed into the SP-B −/− background to generate mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice, SP-B mRNA (not shown) and protein (Fig. 2) were detected in presumptive Clara cells but not in alveolar epithelial cells of the fetal lung, consistent with Clara cell restricted expression of SP-B protein.Figure 2Cellular localization of SP-B proprotein in mCCSP/hSP-B (mSP-B −/−) transgenic mice. Fetal lungs were collected from wild type (A) and mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) (B) mice on day 18 of gestation and stained for SP-B proprotein with polyclonal antibody directed against COOH-terminal propeptide of human SP-B (antibody 96189). Antibody 96189 detected mouse SP-B very poorly (A) but readily detected human SP-B (B) in presumptive Clara cells (arrow) and intra-alveolar inclusions (arrowheads).

However, in contrast to the results for in situ hybridization analyses, SP-B protein was detected in some Clara cells. In mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 1, staining for SP-B in Clara cells was extensive and only slightly less than that in Clara cells from wild type littermates (not shown); however, in a second mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line (line 2), SP-B staining was largely restricted to alveolar Type II epithelial cells and only a few Clara cells expressing SP-B protein were detected (Fig. 4). Immunohistochemical analysis of a third mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line (line 3) indicated that SP-B protein was detected in some, but not all, Type II cells (see below, “Type II Cell-restricted Expression” and Fig. 9). These results suggest that the site of transgene integration strongly influences expression from the 4.8-kb murine SP-C promoter.Figure 4Cellular localization of SP-B proprotein in mSP-C/hSP-B (mSP-B −/−) transgenic mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed on lung sections from wild type mice (A) and mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 2 (B) using antibody 55522 which detects both mouse and human SP-B. SP-B immunoreactivity was detected in Type II cells (arrowheads) of wild type and transgenic mice.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial lung sections from 6-week-old wild type mice (A and B) and mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 3 (C andD) using antibody 28031 to detect SP-B (A andC), or antibody 68514, to detect SP-C (B andD). Approximately equal numbers of SP-B and SP-C immunoreactive cells (arrowheads) were detected in alveoli of wild type mice (A and B), whereas the number of SP-B immunoreactive cells was notably decreased in mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic mice (C and D). In transgenic mice (D), clusters of SP-C immunoreactive Type II cells were detected, consistent with alveolar collapse (arrows). Enlarged alveolar space(S) were common in mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice (C and D). Magnification is ×95 for all panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of both human and murine SP-B RNA was observed in Clara cells from mCCSP/hSP-B transgenic mice in the SP-B +/+ background. mCCSP/hSP-B transgenic mice survived without overt evidence of respiratory pathophysiology and had normal body weight, lung weight, reproductive function, longevity, and normal gross lung structure, suggesting that expression of human SP-B in Clara cells did not significantly alter lung function (not shown). To determine the fate of SP-B synthesized by Clara cells, bronchoalveolar lavage from wild type and mCCSP/hSP-B transgenic mice was immunoblotted with antibody directed against the COOH-terminal propeptide of human SP-B (antibody 96189) (Fig.5) or antibody (55522) directed against the full-length human SP-B (not shown). Both the 42-kDa SP-B proprotein and 25-kDa processing intermediate were detected in increased concentrations in lavage from mCCSP/hSP-B mice relative to wild type littermates, consistent with secretion and accumulation of human SP-B precursor in the airway of transgenic animals. These results also suggest that partial processing of the SP-B proprotein normally occurs in Clara cells. In order to restrict SP-B synthesis to Clara cells, both mCCSP/hSP-B transgenic lines were crossed with hemizygous SP-B +/− mice to produce mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice. Newborn mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) pups from both mCCSP/hSP-B parental transgenic lines died within minutes of birth, similar to findings in SP-B −/− mice (4Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). To further increase SP-B protein levels, the two mCCSP/hSP-B lines were interbred prior to crossing into the SP-B −/− background. mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) pups carrying multiple copies of the mCCSP/hSP-B transgene and expressing increased levels of SP-B protein (Fig.6 A) also died of acute respiratory dysfunction within minutes of birth. Western blots of lung homogenates from newborn mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) pups with antibody 96189 detected both the 42- and 25-kDa forms of SP-B (Fig.6 A); however, mature SP-B peptide (18 kDa) was not detected, even when 10-fold more protein was loaded on the gel (Fig.6 B), strongly suggesting that these pups died from the lack of mature SP-B peptide and that Clara cells did not completely process pro-SP-B to the active peptide. Mature SP-B peptide was readily detected in lung homogenates from wild type littermates (Fig.6 B). Consistent with the neonatal death of mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice, ultrastructural analyses of lungs from pups on day 18 of gestation indicated that Clara cell-restricted expression of hSP-B was associated with severe disruption of the surfactant biosynthetic pathway in Type II cells (Fig. 7). Lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage form of pulmonary surfactant, were never detected; instead, similar to SP-B −/− mice, numerous multivesicular bodies and composite bodies, containing disorganized membrane lamellae and vesicular elements, were observed in Type II cells. The ultrastructure of Clara cells was unremarkable (not shown). Overall, restricted expression of SP-B in Clara cells was not associated with postnatal survival, formation of mature SP-B peptide, or normal lamellar body biogenesis.Figure 7Ultrastructure of type II cells in mCCSP/hSP-B (mSP-B −/−) and mSP-C/hSP-B (mSP-B −/−) transgenic mice. Electron microscopy was performed on ultrathin sections from lungs of mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice (A) and mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice (B) on day 18 of gestation. mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 2, in which expression of SP-B was largely restricted to Type II cells, was selected for these studies. Multivesicular bodies (arrow) and composite bodies (arrowhead) containing multivesicular bodies and membrane lamellae were detected in alveolar Type II epithelial cells of mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) fetuses. Mature lamellar bodies were never detected in mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) fetal lung, but were always detected in mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice (B, arrowhead).Bar, 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mSP-C promoter was used to generate three mSP-C/hSP-B transgenic lines expressing both endogenous murine SP-B and human SP-B mRNA in Type II epithelial cells. Expression of human SP-B mRNA and protein in Type II cells did not alter lung structure or function in any of the three transgenic lines, consistent with a previous study in which a truncated human SP-B proprotein was expressed in Type II cells of transgenic mice (26Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9640-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the mSP-C/hSP-B transgenic mice, human SP-B proprotein was processed to the mature peptide and formed heterodimers with endogenous mouse SP-B mature peptide (Fig.8); lung morphology in these mice was normal (not shown). To generate mice in which SP-B was synthesized only in Type II cells, mSP-C/hSP-B transgenic mice were crossed into SP-B −/− background. Offspring from mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 2, in which SP-B expression was largely restricted to Type II cells, were normal in terms of body weight, lung weight, reproductive function, and longevity, indicating that decreased expression of SP-B in Clara cells was not associated with any overt pathophysiology (not shown); furthermore, lamellar body structure was indistinguishable from wild type littermates and there were no detectable ultrastructural abnormalities in Type II cells (not shown). The ultrastructure of Clara cells in mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice was also indistinguishable from that of SP-B +/+ littermates (not shown). Although Western blotting indicated equivalent levels of SP-B in all three transgenic lines (not shown), fewer alveolar cells stained for pro-SP-B than for pro-SP-C in mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 3, consistent with the lack of SP-B expression in some Type II cells of mice from this transgenic line (Fig. 9). Both enlarged and collapsed alveoli were observed, consistent with heterogeneity of alveolar inflation (Fig. 9). While ultrastructural analyses revealed normal Type II cell morphology, some Type II cells had abnormal lamellar bodies with morphology similar to those from SP-B −/− mice, Fig. 7. These results underscore the importance of SP-B in Type II cells and suggest that regional deficiency of SP-B may lead to heterogeneous inflation. SP-B mRNA is markedly increased in Clara cells in response to hyperoxia (28Wikenheiser K.A. Wert S.E. Wispe J.R. Stahlman M. Damore-Bruno M. Singh G. Katyal S.L. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L32-L39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SP-B +/− mice are highly susceptible to oxygen induced injuryin vivo (31Tokieda K. Iwamoto H.S. Bachurski C. Wert S.E. Hull W.M. Ikeda K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test the hypothesis that SP-B production by Clara cells is critical for recovery from oxygen-induced lung injury, 6-week-old hSP-C/hSP-BΔc(mSP-B −/−) mice were exposed to 95% O2. By immunohistochemistry, SP-B protein was detected in Type II cells but not in Clara cells of hSP-C/hSP-BΔc(mSP-B −/−) mice (not shown) consistent with the results of previous in situ hybridization studies (26Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9640-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There was no difference in gross lung structure between transgenic mice and wild type littermates with respect to septal thickening, microhemorrhages, alveolar inflammatory cell infiltration, or Type II cell hyperplasia or hypertrophy after 48 or 72 h of O2 exposure. Mean survival times for wild type mice (7.5 days ± 0.5, n = 10) and transgenic mice (7.9 days ± 0.7, n = 10) were not significantly different (p = 0.79) after 10 days of hyperoxic challenge and mortality was not detected in either group prior to 96 h of exposure. These results suggest that lack of SP-B protein in Clara cells did not increase susceptibility to oxygen-induced lung injury. SP-B is expressed in both Type II epithelial cells and non-ciliated Clara cells of the pulmonary epithelium. Type II cells are restricted to the alveoli, whereas Clara cells are widely distributed in conducting airways of the mouse but are absent in alveoli. The increased abundance of Clara cells in terminal bronchioles suggests that Clara cells in this region may contribute SP-B to the alveolar surfactant pool. This hypothesis was tested by selectively replacing SP-B expression in either Clara cells or Type II cells of SP-B −/− mice. Restoration of SP-B in Clara cells was not sufficient to correct pulmonary dysfunction or neonatal lethality in SP-B −/− mice, whereas selective expression in Type II cells completely restored lung functionin vivo. These results indicate that the neonatal lethality in SP-B −/− mice is due to the absence of SP-B expression in Type II cells and that expression of SP-B in Clara cells cannot replace this function. The failure of selective expression of human SP-B in Clara cells to correct respiratory failure in SP-B −/− mice is likely caused by the lack of mature SP-B peptide in these animals. SP-B proprotein and processing intermediate (25 kDa) were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and were dramatically increased in mice carrying multiple copies of the transgene; however, complete processing to the mature SP-B peptide by Clara cells was not observed. These results are similar to those in the H441 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line, and provide further support for the Clara cell origin of this cell line (32O'Reilly M.A. Weaver T.E. Pilot-Matias T.J. Sarin V.K. Gazdar A.F. Whitsett J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for incomplete processing of SP-B in H441 cells and Clara cells of mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice is that these cells lack an endoprotease that cleaves the 25 kDa processing intermediate to generate the mature SP-B peptide. Given that lamellar bodies were never detected in mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice, it is unlikely that SP-B proprotein or the 25-kDa form secreted by Clara cells is internalized and processed by Type II cells. Incomplete processing of SP-B proprotein, complete absence of mature SP-B peptide, and consistent neonatal respiratory failure in mCCSP/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice strongly suggest that, under resting conditions, Clara cells do not contribute SP-B to the alveolar surfactant pool. In SP-B +/− mice exposed to 95% oxygen for 3 days lung compliance was markedly reduced relative to wild type littermates (31Tokieda K. Iwamoto H.S. Bachurski C. Wert S.E. Hull W.M. Ikeda K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Altered lung function was associated with increased severity of pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation, lung permeability, and protein leakage into the alveolar space supporting the concept that SP-B deficiency exacerbates hyperoxic-induced lung injury. In SP-B +/+ mice similarly exposed to hyperoxia, SP-B RNA was dramatically increased in bronchiolar cells and decreased in alveolar cells suggesting that production of SP-B in Clara cells may compensate for diminished expression in Type II cells during hyperoxic challenge (28Wikenheiser K.A. Wert S.E. Wispe J.R. Stahlman M. Damore-Bruno M. Singh G. Katyal S.L. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L32-L39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that loss of SP-B expression in Clara cells would increase susceptibility to hyperoxic-induced lung injury; however, the complete loss of SP-B in Clara cells of hSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) mice did not exacerbate hyperoxic-induced changes in mortality or lung structure relative to wild type littermates. These results suggest that expression of SP-B in Clara cells is not required for surfactant homeostasis in unchallenged mice or for recovery from or adaptation to hyperoxia. It has been suggested that the patency of terminal bronchioles is maintained by the presence of a surfactant film similar to that in alveoli (33Enhorning G. Duffy L.C. Welliver R.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Given the large numbers of Clara cells present in terminal bronchioles, it is possible that SP-B produced by these cells contributes to formation of a surface film. Consistent with this hypothesis, SP-B +/− mice, in which SP-B RNA and protein levels are decreased 50% compared with wild type littermates, exhibit air trapping related to collapse of small airways (34Clark J.C. Weaver T.E. Iwamoto H.S. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the ability of SP-B to promote rapid formation of a stable phospholipid film is likely exclusive to the mature peptide which is not synthesized in Clara cells. Since Type II cells are the sole source of mature SP-B, any SP-B peptide in the terminal airways is likely derived from the alveolar surfactant pool; however, to date, there is no direct evidence for movement of SP-B from alveoli to conducting airways. Although the role of SP-B in Clara cells remains uncertain, it is clear that expression of SP-B in Type II cells is absolutely required for lung function in vivo. Expression of a full-length (this study) or truncated (26Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9640-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) human SP-B proprotein in Type II cells of SP-B −/− mice completely reversed neonatal respiratory dysfunction and lethality in these mice. The importance of SP-B expression in Type II cells is further supported by results in mSP-C/hSP-B(mSP-B −/−) transgenic line 3 in which SP-B expression was restored in some, but not all, Type II cells. These mice had distended alveoli and septal thickening consistent with focal atelectasis. This outcome is similar to that in ventilated preterm lambs in which surfactant deficiency resulted in dilation of alveolar ducts with collapse of some adjacent alveoli (35Pinkerton K.E. Lewis J.F. Rider E.D. Peake J. Chen W. Madl A.K. Luu R.H. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 77: 1953-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a model in which Type II cells lacking SP-B secrete surfactant with poor surface activity leading to collapse of the involved alveolus at the end expiration. The collapsed alveolus contributes to thickening of the alveolar wall, while the expelled air enters an adjacent alveolus resulting in distension (36Mead J. Takishima T. Leith D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1970; 28: 596-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Although distended, this alveolus remains open at the end expiration because Type II cells in this unit express SP-B and, consequently, secrete a functional surfactant. In summary, selective restoration of SP-B synthesis in Type II cells completely rescued the respiratory failure following birth of SP-B −/− mice. Expression of SP-B in some, but not all Type II cells of SP-B −/− mice, allowed postnatal survival, but resulted in significantly altered lung architecture and function. Synthesis of pro-SP-B in Clara cells of SP-B −/− mice resulted in respiratory dysfunction and invariable neonatal death, associated with the complete absence of mature SP-B peptide in the lungs of these mice. These results indicate that expression and processing of the SP-B proprotein to the mature peptide in Type II cells is absolutely required for lung function in vivo and that synthesis of pro-SP-B in Clara cells cannot substitute for this function."

We have discovered that caspase-8 and its homologs can physically interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family members and activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, or stress-activated protein kinase) pathway. This ability resides in the DED-containing prodomain of these proteins and is independent of their role as cell death proteases. A point mutant in the first DED of caspase-8 can block JNK activation induced by several death domain receptors. Inhibition of JNK activation blocks apoptosis mediated by caspase-10, Mach-related inducer of toxicity/cFLIP, and Fas/CD95, thereby suggesting a cooperative role of this pathway in the mediation of caspase-induced apoptosis.

In addition to its ability to activate the caspase cascade, TNFR1 is also known to activate a kinase cascade involving activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the JNK pathways via recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) (18Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Fas/Apo-1 was recently shown to activate the JNK pathway via the adaptor protein Daxx (19Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Activation of the JNK pathway leads to the phosphorylation-induced activation of transcription factors c-Jun, activating transcription factor-2, and Elk-1 (20Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). While JNK activation has been implicated in oncogenic transformation and immune response in mammalian cells, its role in cell death is still controversial. For example, overexpression of several kinases of this pathway has been shown to induce cell death, whereas their corresponding dominant negative mutants can block stress-induced and DD receptor-induced apoptosis in several cell lines (22Ichijo H.

JNK activation has also been implicated in nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells, which can be blocked by JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1), a recently identified inhibitor of the JNK pathway (26Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 27Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R.

Daxx was recently shown to activate JNK via apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and act cooperatively with the FADD-induced caspase cascade in the mediation of Fas-induced apoptosis (19Yang X.

Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Finally, gene knock-out of JNK3, a terminal kinase of the JNK pathway leads to resistance against neuronal cell death (29Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). On the contrary, JNK activation was found to be dispensable for the TNFα- and/or Fas-induced apoptosis in HeLa and Jurkat cells, suggesting that the requirement for the JNK pathway in apoptosis is cell type- and stimulus-dependent (18Liu Z.G.

Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The role of caspase cascade in JNK activation is also controversial. Fas/Apo-1-induced JNK activation in a Fas-sensitive neuroblastoma cell line was shown to be resistant to the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (23Goillot E. Raingeaud J. Ranger A. Tepper R.I. Davis R.J. Harlow E. Sanchez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3302-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Similarly, Fas-induced JNK activation in 293 cells was resistant to caspase inhibitors CrmA, z-VAD, and z-DEVD (19Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Fas-induced JNK activation was found to be sensitive to caspase inhibitors in Jurkat (T cell leukemia) and SKW6.4 (B lymphoblastoid) cells (31Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F.

Krammer P.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2087-2096PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study analyzed Fas-mediated JNK activation in Jurkat cells and discovered that while the JNK activity induced by low levels of Fas cross-linking could be blocked by z-VAD, that activated at higher levels of Fas cross-linking was z-VAD-resistant (30Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that, depending on the cell type and the magnitude of the stimulus, Fas can activate the JNK pathway by caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. Until recently, DED-containing proteins were mainly known for their interaction with FADD and the resultant activation of the caspase cascade. However, a recent study, using yeast two-hybrid interaction and coimmunoprecipitation assays, demonstrated that MRIT/Casper can also interact with various TRAF family members (12Shu H.B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This study, however, did not test the functional significance of the above interaction. In the present study, we explore the ability of MRIT and other caspase family members to interact with the TRAFs and activate the JNK pathway. 293T and MCF7 cells were obtained from Dr. David Han (University of Washington, Seattle). 293 EBNA cells were obtained from Invitrogen. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against FLAG, hemagglutinin (HA), and Myc tags were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Murine antibody against human FADD was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Flag beads were obtained from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems. A pull-down kinase assay kit for stress-activated protein kinase/JNK was obtained from New England Biolabs, and the constructs for Pathdetect luciferase reporter assay were purchased from Stratagene. The expression constructs for the death receptors, FADD, CrmA, MRIT isoforms, and the various caspases have been described previously (11Han D.K. Chaudhary P.M. Wright M.E. Friedman C. Trask B.J.

A construct encoding JBD-JIP1 was a gift from Dr. Roger Davis, and dominant negative rMEKK1 was obtained from Dr. Richard Gaynor. Constructs encoding mTRAF1, mTRAF2, TRAF3, mTRAF5, and I-TRAF were prepared using the corresponding IMAGE consortium expressed sequence tag clones (Genome Systems) as templates. The various point mutants of caspase-8, -7, and -9 were generated using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The various deletion and fusion constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction using custom primers. Epitope-tagged expression constructs for caspase-3, -8, and -10; MRIT; TRAFs; and their deletion and point mutants were tagged at the C termini. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated fluorescent dye-terminator sequencing on an ABI 373 sequencing machine. Expression of all constructs was confirmed by Western analysis on total cell extracts. 293 EBNA cells (1.2 × 105) were transfected in duplicate with various expression constructs (500 ng) along with a fusion transactivator plasmid containing yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to transcription factor c-Jun (pFA-cJun) (50 ng), a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene downstream of the GAL4 upstream activating Sequence (pFR-luc) (500 ng), and a Rous sarcoma virus/LacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter construct (75 ng). Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. 32–40 h later, cell extracts were prepared using the Luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase assays were performed using 20 μl of cell extract. The cell lysate was diluted 1:20 with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and used for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to the β-galactosidase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. Western blot analysis on cell extracts prepared from similarly transfected cells was used to confirm that the various expression constructs led to the production of the desired proteins. For studying in vivo interaction, 2 × 106 293T cells were plated in a 100-mm plate and co-transfected 18–24 h later with 5 μg/plate of each epitope-tagged construct along with 1 μg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding plasmid (pEGFP or HA-GFP) by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. 18–36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and one EDTA free mini-protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunoprecipitation, cells lysate (500 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of FLAG or control mouse Ig beads precoated with 2% bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with a wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl and again with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blot. As a measure of JNK activation, we tested the ability of caspase-8 and its homologs to induce phosphorylation of transcription factor c-Jun in a “pull-down” kinase assay. As shown in Fig.1 A, expression of active site mutants of caspase-8 and -10 and MRIT led to significant JNK activation in 293 EBNA cells, which was comparable in magnitude with that observed with CD40, a known activator of this pathway. All of the above DED-containing proteins are missing the critical cysteine residue at the putative caspase active site and are proteolytically inactive. Therefore, JNK activation by them is not related to the activation of the caspase cascade and the resultant activation of the stress-response genes. Activation of the JNK pathway by the above DED-containing proteins was confirmed using a reporter assay in which luciferase expression was driven by JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the activation domain of transcription factor c-Jun fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 B). This assay further demonstrated that the DED-containing prodomains of caspase-8 and MRIT were even more effective than the full-length proteins in c-Jun transcriptional activation (Fig. 1 B). Additional experiments localized the JNK-activating ability of caspase-8 to its prodomain, while no significant JNK activation was observed with the construct expressing its protease domain (Fig. 1 C). Coexpression of the caspase-8 prodomain with either a GAL4-cFos fusion construct or a GAL4 DNA binding domain construct failed to activate the luciferase reporter construct, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the assay (Fig.1 C). The observed activation of the JNK pathway was not limited to 293 EBNA cells, since the caspase-8 prodomain activated this pathway in COS (African green monkey kidney) and 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells as well (data not shown). However, we have failed to observe significant activation of the JNK pathway by the above proteins in the baby hamster kidney cells (data not shown), which indicates tissue/species specificity of this response. We also tested the JNK activating ability of several non-DED-containing caspases, such as caspase-1, -2, -3, -7, and -9 and active site mutants of caspase-7 and -9. However, none of these caspases were able to activate the JNK pathway in 293 EBNA cells (Fig.2 A and data not shown), supporting the requirement of the DEDs for this process. The ability of MRIT and the active site mutants of caspase-8 and -10 to activate the JNK pathway suggests that this ability is independent of their role in the activation of the caspase cascade and the resultant activation of the stress response genes. However, it is conceivable that the overexpression of these proteins leads to their oligomerization with the endogenous caspases and the resultant activation of the caspase cascade. Similarly, the prodomain of caspase-8 could activate the JNK pathway by oligomerizing and activating the endogenously expressed caspase-8. To rule out this possibility, we tested the ability of CrmA and p35 to block JNK activation by the caspase-8 prodomain and full-length MRIT (MRIT-α1 isoform). CrmA is a cowpox virus-encoded inhibitor of the protease activity of the proximal caspases, whereas p35 is a baculovirus-encoded inhibitor of both proximal and distal caspases. As demonstrated in Fig.2 B, both CrmA and p35 failed to block JNK activation by the caspase-8 prodomain, thereby confirming that it activates the JNK pathway independent of the activation of the caspase cascade. Surprisingly, both CrmA and p35 could block JNK activation by MRIT (Fig. 2 B), which suggests a difference in the mechanism of JNK activation between MRIT and caspase-8. Several viruses were recently shown to encode proteins that contain DEDs, and these proteins were found to block apoptosis mediated by death domain receptors by binding to FADD or caspase-8 (34Thome M.

These proteins, also called vFLIPs (FLICE inhibitory proteins), include MC159L from the molluscum contagiosum virus, E8 from equine herpes virus 2, and ORF-K13 from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus. Based on the ability of cellular DED-containing proteins to activate the JNK pathway, we were interested in checking whether their viral homologs could do the same. However, as shown in Fig.2 C, none of the vFLIPs could activate the JNK pathway, thereby indicating the specificity of this response. Since both cellular and viral DED-containing proteins share the property of binding to FADD, these negative results also argue against the involvement of FADD in JNK activation by the cellular DED-containing proteins. To further define the role of DEDs in caspase-8-mediated JNK activation, we mutated several conserved residues in the DED1 of caspase-8 and tested their ability to activate JNK activation in the 293 EBNA cells. One of these mutants, containing an Asp to Ala substitution at amino acid residue 73 (caspase-8 D73A) was found to be incapable of JNK activation on its own and was selected for further studies (Fig.3 A and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 A, this mutant effectively blocked JNK activation by caspase-8 prodomain and caspase-10 C358A in a dominant negative fashion (Fig. 3 A). This mutant was also highly effective in blocking JNK activation induced by different DD receptors, including TNFR1, Fas/CD95, DR3, and DR4, consistent with the involvement of caspase-8 or its homologs in JNK activation by these receptors (Fig. 3 B). Finally, the caspase homology domain of caspase-8 could partially block JNK activation induced by caspase-8 and -10 as well (Fig. 3 A), thus explaining the stronger JNK activation seen with the construct encoding only the caspase-8 prodomain (Fig. 1 B). TRAF2 has been shown to play an essential role in JNK activation by different members of the TNFR family. To determine its role in caspase-8-induced activation of the JNK pathway, we used a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 (amino acids 87–501) that has been previously shown to block JNK activation by different TNFR family members. As shown in Fig.3 C, dominant negative TRAF2 could successfully block JNK activation by the caspase-8 prodomain. TRAF2 is believed to activate the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway via mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) (37Yuasa T. Ohno S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32102-32107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested the involvement of MEKK1 in JNK activation by the caspase-8 prodomain. As shown in Fig.3 D, caspase-8 prodomain-induced JNK activation was effectively blocked by a kinase-defective mutant of full-length rat MEKK1. JIP-1 is a recently identified cytoplasmic protein that binds to JNK through its N-terminal JNK-binding domain (JBD) (27Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). JIP-1 and its JBD cause cytoplasmic retention of JNK and are specific inhibitors of the JNK signal transduction pathway in several cellular processes including cell death (27Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 E, JBD of JIP-1 was highly effective in blocking JNK activation mediated by the caspase-8 prodomain. To delineate the mechanism of JNK activation by caspase-8 and its homologs, we tested their ability to physically interact with the TRAF family members using a coexpression-coimmunoprecipitation assay in 293T cells. Caspase-8 could coimmunoprecipitate TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5 but failed to coimmunoprecipitate I-TRAF (Fig. 4,A–C). This ability to immunoprecipitate TRAF proteins was not limited to caspase-8, since caspase-10 could successfully coimmunoprecipitate TRAF1 and TRAF2 as well (data not shown). We also confirmed the previously demonstrated interaction between MRIT/Casper and TRAFs (data not shown). However, caspase-3, a non-DED-containing caspase, failed to coimmunoprecipitate TRAF1 in the above assay, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the interaction (data not shown). Caspase-8 also failed to coimmunoprecipitate GFP, which served as a negative control (Fig. 4, B, F, andG). The ability of caspase-8 to interact with TRAF1 protein was confirmed using bacterially expressed and purified proteins, which demonstrated that this interaction does not require the presence of any intermediate bridging protein(s) that could be present in 293T cells (Fig. 4 D). We also tested the interaction between caspase-8 D73A and the TRAFs. As shown in Fig. 4 E, this mutant of caspase-8 successfully coimmunoprecipitated TRAF1 or TRAF2. These results indicate that activation of the JNK pathway involves interaction of specific residue(s) of caspase-8 prodomain with the TRAFs and not the simple act of binding of the two proteins. We next sought to determine which domains of caspase-8 interact with the TRAF proteins. Both the prodomain (amino acids 1–180) and the caspase homology domain (amino acids 217–479) of caspase-8 could coimmunoprecipitate TRAF1 or TRAF2 (Fig. 4, F andG). The ability of the prodomain of caspase-8 to interact with TRAF proteins was unexpected, since a deletion construct encoding the homologous prodomain of MRIT/Casper was recently shown not to interact with the TRAF proteins (12Shu H.B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, we tested the ability of the naturally occurring MRITβ1 isoform to coimmunoprecipitate TRAF1. Like the prodomain construct used in the previous study (12Shu H.B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), the MRITβ1 isoform contains both DEDs and has additional 37 amino acids at the COOH terminus (11Han D.K. Chaudhary P.M. Wright M.E. Friedman C. Trask B.J. Riedel R.T. Baskin D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11333-11338Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). MRITβ1 successfully coimmunoprecipitated TRAF1 (Fig. 4 F), suggesting that the additional amino acids at the COOH terminus may contribute to the stability of the MRITβ1 isoform or alternatively to its interaction with TRAF1. Taken together, the above results suggest that the DED-containing proteins interact with TRAF family members through multiple domains. The TRAF proteins are characterized by the presence of a TRAF domain at their COOH termini, which, based on its functions and sequence conservation among different family members, can be further subdivided into TRAF-N and TRAF-C subdomains (39Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For example, the TRAF-N domain of various family members is required for self-association and association with the cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, whereas the TRAF-C domain is required for interaction with receptors and signaling molecules RIP and TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) (39Takeuchi M.

To identify the components of the glucagon receptor necessary for G-protein coupling, we replaced sequentially all or part of each intracellular loop (i1, i2, and i3) and the C-terminal tail of the glucagon receptor with the 11 amino acids comprising the first intracellular loop of the D4 dopamine receptor. When expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells, the mutant receptors fell into two different groups with respect to hormone-mediated signaling. The first group included the loop i1 mutants, which bound glucagon and signaled normally. The second group comprised the loop i2 and i3 chimeras, which caused no detectable adenylyl cyclase activation in COS-1 cells. However, when expressed in HEK 293T cells, the loop i2 or i3 chimeras caused very small glucagon-mediated increases in cAMP levels and intracellular calcium concentrations, with EC50values nearly 100-fold higher than those measured for wild-type receptor. Replacement of both loops i2 and i3 simultaneously was required to completely abolish G protein signaling as measured by both cAMP accumulation and calcium flux assays. These results show that the i2 and i3 loops play a role in glucagon receptor signaling, consistent with recent models for the mechanism of activation of G proteins by rhodopsin-like GPCRs.

G protein-coupled receptor first intracellular loop second intracellular loop third intracellular loop polymerase chain reaction endoglycosidase H transmembrane parathyroid hormone The peptide hormone glucagon plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. To achieve its intracellular effects, glucagon must bind to a glycoprotein receptor that spans the plasma membrane. The glucagon receptor belongs to the superfamily of heptahelical, transmembrane GPCRs1 that makes up approximately 1–2% of the total number of genes in the human genome (1Fraser C.M. Lee N.H. Pellegrino S.M. Kerlavage A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 113-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Characterization of GPCRs within a particular receptor class has been facilitated by the fact that many structural motifs and functional domains have been conserved. For example, eight highly conserved amino acid residues within the transmembrane domains of GPCRs within the rhodopsin-like class, which includes visual opsins, biogenic amine receptors, and various chemokines, were identified (2Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These residues permit precise alignments of receptor primary structures so that results of structure-function studies can be generalized in many cases. For example, the location of the ligand-binding domain (4Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and the mechanism of agonist-induced receptor activation (5Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) are probably conserved for all GPCRs within the rhodopsin-like class. Rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor have been widely studied as prototypical GPCRs (6Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the glucagon receptor belongs to a separate class of related GPCRs that includes receptors for glucagon-like peptide-1, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, PTH/PTH-related peptide, growth hormone-releasing hormone, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and corticotrophin-releasing factor (8Segre G.V.

Even the familiar, rigorously conserved eight residues and other motifs such as the C-terminal palmitoylation sites are absent. Thus, few studies of rhodopsin or biogenic amine receptors provide applicable structural-functional information about the ligand-binding domain or the molecular mechanism underlying the G protein coupling of the glucagon receptor and other receptors in its unique GPCR subfamily. In previous studies (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) of the glucagon receptor, we identified general regions involved in ligand binding and cell surface expression, focusing on the extracellular and transmembrane domains. Our current work attempts to identify regions of the intracellular domain of the glucagon receptor involved in G protein coupling and signal transduction. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that two cytoplasmic loops (loops i2 and i3) are required together to obtain the full effect of glucagon-induced adenylyl cyclase activation and mobilization of intracellular calcium. We constructed a series of chimeras between the rat glucagon receptor and the human D4 dopamine receptor (Fig. 1). Each region of the glucagon receptor to be studied was replaced with all or part of the 11 amino acids comprising the first intracellular loop of the D4 dopamine receptor. This sequence was chosen because: (i) it shared no homology with any part of the intracellular portion of the glucagon receptor; (ii) the periodicity of charged residues did not match that of any intracellular region of the glucagon receptor; and (iii) it was not likely to have a role in signal transduction (13Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The mutant receptor genes were expressed in cell culture and evaluated for cell surface expression, ligand binding, and the ability to elevate cellular second messengers cAMP and calcium. We report that a tripeptide sequence in loop i1 and the membrane-proximal portion of the C-terminal tail are required for proper intracellular processing and cell surface expression. Furthermore, we show that loop i2 and loop i3 are each involved in coupling to Gs. However, only simultaneous replacement of both loops eliminated completely glucagon-induced signal transduction as measured by elevation of intracellular cAMP and calcium levels. This finding is consistent with the mechanism of receptor-G protein coupling proposed for the rhodopsin-like class of GPCRs (14Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P.

Namely, at least two intracellular loops of the glucagon receptor (loops i2 and i3) act synergistically to bind Gsand catalyze guanine-nucleotide exchange. The construction of the synthetic rat glucagon receptor gene (GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank accession number U14012) was previously reported (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the gene was performed using a combination of restriction fragment replacement “cassette mutagenesis” (18Lo K.-M. Jones S.S. Hackett N.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 91: 2285-2289Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and PCR-based mutagenesis in a modified pGEM-2 (Invitrogen) cloning vector (17Carruthers C.J. Unson C.G. Kim H.N. Sakmar T.P. J.

All mutants were screened by restriction endonuclease analysis and positive clones were confirmed using Taq FS dye terminator cycle fluorescence-based sequencing on a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Model 377A DNA Stretch Sequencer (Perkin Elmer). The receptor genes were then subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The mutant receptors are shown schematically in Figs. 1 and 2. The four loop i1 receptor chimeras (G1D1, G1D1n, G1D1i, and G1D1c) and the point mutant H178R, were prepared by replacing a 76-base pairBssHII-BstEII restriction fragment with synthetic duplexes that encoded the desired amino acid residues. In G1D1, the first intracellular loop of the glucagon receptor (residues Lys169-Ile177) was replaced with the undecapeptide TERALQTPTNS, which corresponds to the first intracellular loop of the human D4 dopamine receptor (2Probst W.C.

Civelli O. Nature. 1991; 350: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). In G1D1n, the tripeptide Lys169-His171 was replaced with TERA. In G1D1i, the tripeptide Cys172-Arg174was replaced with LQT. In G1D1c, the tripeptide Asn175-Ile177 was replaced with PTNS. The successive replacements corresponded to the N-terminal, intermediate, and C-terminal portions of loop i1, respectively. The loop i2 chimera, G2D1, was prepared by restriction fragment replacement. An 82-base pairSpeI-NsiI restriction fragment was replaced with a synthetic duplex in which base pairs coding for amino acid residues Ser252-Glu261 of the glucagon receptor were substituted with a sequence coding for the first intracellular loop of the D4 dopamine receptor (TERALQTPTNS). The loop i3 chimera, G3D1, was prepared by first introducing a BglII restriction site into the synthetic gene in the pGEM-2 cloning vector using PCR (17Carruthers C.J. Unson C.G. Kim H.N. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 101-base pair PacI-BglII restriction fragment was then replaced with a synthetic duplex in which the sequence coding for amino acid residues Leu334-Ala349 was replaced with a sequence coding for the first intracellular loop of the D4 dopamine receptor (TERALQTPTNS). The double-loop chimera, G23D1, was prepared by combining the appropriate segments of G2D1 and G3D1 at aPacI site. The C terminus chimera, GCD1, was prepared by replacement of a 63-base pair AlwNI-BspEI restriction fragment with a synthetic duplex in which codons for amino acid residues Glu407-Arg415 were substituted with a sequence encoding the first intracellular loop of the D4 dopamine receptor (TERALQTPTNS) followed by two successive stop codons. The construction of truncation mutants T7a and T7b was described previously (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

Glucagon receptor and mutant receptor genes were expressed in COS-1 and HEK 293T cells by transient transfection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Preparation of membranes from transfected COS-1 cells was carried out as described previously (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by measuring intracellular cAMP levels as a function of hormone concentration as reported (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J.

Assays of glucagon-dependent increases in intracellular calcium concentration in HEK 293T cells were performed as follows. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8.0 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) 36–48 h after transfection and then each 100-mm plate was incubated in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for 15–20 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected either by tituration or scraping and added to 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% newborn calf serum, 2% fetal bovine serum in Petri dishes at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The cells were collected in 17 × 120-mm conical tubes, pelleted by spinning at 2,000 rpm for 2 min, washed twice in EBSS-H buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2 mm CaCl2), and resuspended in 1 ml of EBSS-H at a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106cells/ml. The fluorophore Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to a final concentration of 2 μm and the cells were incubated for 60–75 min at room temperature. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of EBSS-H, washed again, and incubated in EBSS-H for 30–45 min. Just prior to the assay, the cells were pelleted and transferred to cuvettes at a density of 0.25–0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Fluorescence due to intracellular calcium was measured at room temperature in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 505 and 525 nm, respectively. Ligand binding, cAMP, and calcium studies were performed at least three times on independent samples to verify reproducibility. For graphical representation of an individual experiment, the data at each concentration of glucagon were fit to a 4-parameter logistic function of the form:f(x) = [(a-d)/(1 + (x/c) b)] + d. The IC50 and EC50 values were calculated from the inflection point (c) of the best-fit curve (Sigmaplot, Jandel Scientific Software). The cytoplasmic surface of the glucagon receptor consists of three loops and a C-terminal tail (Fig.1). Five mutant receptors were constructed in which the first intracellular loop of the human D4 dopamine receptor was substituted for one or more portions of the cytoplasmic domain of the rat glucagon receptor. G1D1, G2D1, G3D1 signify the mutant receptors in which the first, second, or third intracellular loops of the glucagon receptor were replaced, respectively (Fig. 1). In G23D1, both the second and third intracellular loops were replaced. In GCD1, the entire C-terminal tail was replaced. Additional mutants were constructed to study the role of specific segments of intracellular loop i1 of the glucagon receptor (Fig. 2). Successive tripeptides from the N-terminal, intermediate, and C-terminal portions of the loop were replaced with the analogous portions from loop i1 of the D4 receptor. Since loop i1 of the D4 receptor is one amino acid longer than loop i1 of the glucagon receptor, three of the four loop i1 chimeras are longer than the original receptor (Fig. 2). The primary structures of all mutants are shown schematically in Figs. 1 and 2. The construction, expression, and characterization of the truncation mutants T7a and T7b were described previously (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27720-27727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutants T7a and T7b have 70 and 42 amino acid residues, respectively, deleted from the C terminus of the glucagon receptor. All mutant receptor genes were expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection. Glycosidase analysis was employed to determine if alterations of the cytoplasmic loops affected the ability of the mutant receptors to reach the cell surface. Total cellular membranes were isolated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation. Immunoblot analysis of the membrane preparations using the DK-12 antibody and the effects of glycosidase treatment are shown in Fig.3. All mutant receptors immunoreacted with the DK-12 antibody. This behavior was expected since the DK-12 epitope resides on the extracellular surface of the receptor, which was not altered by any of the mutations. The enzymeN-glycosidase F cleaves all asparagine-linked carbohydrates, leaving an aspartic acid in place of the original asparagine. The enzyme Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) cleaves only high mannose carbohydrates to yield asparagine-linkedN-acetylglucosamine, but cannot remove N-linked complex carbohydrates. The glucagon receptor, like other glycoproteins, is modified by high-mannose carbohydrate moieties when originally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, and is therefore sensitive to both enzymes. However, as the receptor is transported through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, its glycosylation undergoes progressive modification to the complex carbohydrate form, losing its sensitivity to Endo H, but retaining its susceptibility to N-glycosidase F cleavage (20Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 21Robbins P.W. Hubbard S.C. Turco S.J. Wirth D.F. Cell. 1977; 12: 893-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We used this difference in endoglycosidase sensitivity to demonstrate the degree of cell surface expression of the receptor mutants, as reported for a different set of glucagon receptor mutants in a previous study (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27720-27727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the results of an experiment to test the effect of endoglycosidase treatment on the three loop chimeras (G1D1, G2D1, and G3D1) and the C-terminal tail chimera (GCD1). Fig.3 B shows the effect on the double-loop replacement mutant G23D1. The loop i1 mutants (G1D1n, G1D1i, and G1D1c) are presented in Fig. 3 C. The pattern of glycosidase sensitivity differed among the mutant receptors, but fell into two distinct groups. The first group consisted of mutant receptors that were sensitive to bothN-glycosidase F and Endo H, indicating that they were not expressed on the cell surface. This group included mutant receptors G1D1 and GCD1 (Fig. 3 A), and G1D1c (Fig. 3 C). Mutants G1D1 and G1D1c had apparent molecular weights equal to that of the wild-type receptor, which indicated that a mutant receptor of the expected size was in fact being translated and inserted into the cell membranes. The apparent molecular weight of GCD1 was slightly less than that of the wild-type receptor as expected. The second group consisted of mutant receptors that were sensitive to N-glycosidase F but not Endo H, indicating that they were processed and transported to the cell surface. This group included G2D1, G3D1, G23D1, G1D1n, and G1D1i. The mutant receptor H178R, with a single amino acid change in loop i1, also fell into this category. All six of these mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface. They also had the same apparent molecular weights as the wild-type receptor as judged by their electrophoretic mobilities. The results of competitive ligand-binding experiments are presented in Fig. 4. Increasing concentrations of glucagon were used to compete with125I-glucagon for binding to COS-1 cell membranes containing expressed glucagon receptor or mutant receptors. The cytoplasmic loop mutations were not expected to affect directly the ligand-binding domain of the glucagon receptor, which consists primarily of the N-terminal tail, first extracellular loop, and the transmembrane helices (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27720-27727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Unson C.G.

Each of the mutant glucagon receptors that reached the cell surface as judged by endoglycosidase sensitivity analysis bound glucagon with essentially normal affinity (Fig. 4 A). The data points from experiments with these receptors were well approximated by a 4-parameter logistic function characteristic of ligand-receptor equilibrium binding (Fig.4 A). These data were used to determine the concentrations of unlabeled glucagon required to displace 50% of receptor-bound125I-glucagon (IC50 values) (TableI). The average IC50 values ranged from 17 nm for mutant H178R to 196 nmfor mutant G3D1 under conditions where the IC50 for the native receptor was 40 nm. It is well established that mutant GPCRs, including the glucagon receptor, that do not traffic to the cell surface are defective in ligand binding (11Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K.

Open table in a new tab The mutant glucagon receptors were assayed for the ability to mediate the activation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 5). The amount of glucagon-dependent cAMP accumulation in COS-1 cells expressing the glucagon receptor or receptor mutants reflects the level of adenylyl cyclase activation and thereby indicates the efficiency of receptor coupling to Gs. Of the six mutant receptors that reached the cell surface and bound glucagon (Fig. 4 A), only three (G1D1n, G1D1i, and H178R) mediated a glucagon-dependent increase in cAMP concentration (Fig.5 A). The basal cAMP levels in COS cells expressing these receptors were similar to cells in which the wild-type glucagon receptor was expressed (data not shown). This result indicates that none of the mutant receptors exhibited constitutive activity. The cAMP levels obtained upon glucagon treatment of the cells expressing the mutant receptors were consistently 50–100% of the maximum change seen in cells expressing wild-type receptor. In the assay for adenylyl cyclase activation, the loop i2 and i3 chimeras (G2D1, G3D1, and G23D1) did not increase cAMP concentrations above basal levels (Fig. 5 B). Each of these three receptor mutants was expressed on the cell surface and bound glucagon as judged by endoglycosidase analysis and hormone competition-binding experiments, respectively. Thus, these three receptor mutants were defective in glucagon-dependent G protein coupling. The extent of the G protein-coupling defect of these mutants was evaluated in more detail as described below. As expected, the receptor mutants that failed to reach the cell surface and bind glucagon also failed to mediate an increase in cellular cAMP levels (Fig. 5 B). The effective glucagon concentration at 50% maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (EC50 value) for each of the mutant receptors is presented in Table I. Receptor mutants G1D1n, G1D1i, and H178R displayed EC50 values nearly identical to that of the wild-type receptor (4.8 nm). To further characterize the difference in signaling among"

We demonstrate that this effect is dependent on the internalization of somatostatin-receptor complexes and that it is totally independent from the peptide-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Indeed, the inhibitory effect of the peptide on growth hormone mRNA levels was totally insensitive to pertussis toxin treatment but was totally abolished under conditions which block somatostatin receptor internalization. Comparative confocal microscopic imaging of fluorescent somatostatin sequestration and fluorescence immunolabeling of sst1, sst2A, and sst5 receptors suggests that sst2A is most probably responsible of the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on growth hormone expression.

Biological actions of SRIF are exerted through multiple receptors subtypes, which have recently been cloned and are referred to as sst1, sst2, sst3, sst4, and sst5 (for review, see Refs. 1Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Panetta R. Demchyshyn L. Niznik H. Srikant C.B. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1249-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and 2Reisine T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G813-G820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are widely expressed in the anterior pituitary, peripheral tissues, and brain (3Patel Y.C. Greenwood M. Panetta R.

Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the pituitary, the predominant effects of SRIF are the inhibition of the secretion of growth hormone (GH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone, although inhibitory effects of SRIF on the release of luteinizing hormone and prolactin have also been documented (5Lamberts S.W. van Koetsveld P. Hofland L.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Shimon I. Taylor J.E. Dong J.Z. Bitonte R.A. Kim S. Morgan B. Coy D.H. Culler M.D. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). GH secretion is inhibited by SRIF through both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways (7Epelbaum J. Dournaud P. Fodor M. Viollet C. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 25-44PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, these effects have been described as being pertussis toxin-sensitive, suggesting the implication of a SRIF receptor coupled to Gi or Go (8Yajima Y. Akita Y. Saito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2684-2689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SRIF has also been shown to reduce transcription of the GH gene in vivo (9Sugihara H. Minami S. Okada K. Kamegai J. Hasegawa O. Wakabayashi I. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this effect was interpreted as being indirect, involving central inhibition of growth hormone-releasing hormone release (10Bluet-Pajot M.T. Epelbaum J. Gourdji D. Hammond C. Kordon C. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Wood D.F. Docherty K. Ramsden D.B. Sheppard M.C. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1990; 125: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There has been no evidence thus far that SRIF may directly inhibit GH expression. Recent studies have shown that interactions of SRIF with its receptors resulted in a temperature- and receptor-dependent internalization of receptor-ligand complexes (13Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Houle M. Reisine T. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The efficacy of this internalization process, as well as the pattern of intracellular trafficking of internalized ligand and receptors, were shown to vary according to the receptor subtypes involved (13Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Houle M. Reisine T. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A.

Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 9: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As for other G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-induced sst receptor internalization has been proposed to play a role in receptor desensitization through cell surface down-regulation (17Dournaud P. Boudin H. Schonbrunn A. Tannenbaum G.S. Beaudet A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1056-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Early observations of nuclear translocation of internalized 125I-SRIF in AtT-20 cells have also raised the possibility that internalization may affect transcriptional activity in this cell line (19Morel G. Pelletier G. Heisler S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1972-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The possibility that internalization of receptor-ligand complexes may play a role in transmembrane signaling has so far mainly been explored for growth factor and cytokine receptors (for a review, see Ref. 20Bevan A.P. Drake P.G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, have suggested that internalization of G protein-coupled receptors may also be mandatory for certain types of cell signaling. Thus, changes in the duration of inositol phosphate accumulation and associated calcium responses (21Hunyady L. Merelli F. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, ligand-induced receptor internalization of β-adrenergic receptors was recently shown to be directly involved in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (24Daaka Y.

Molecular biological and biochemical studies have shown that AtT-20 cells express four of the five cloned SRIF receptors subtypes (sst1, sst2, sst4, and sst5) (28Patel Y.C. Panetta R. Escher E. Greenwood M. Srikant C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1506-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and internalize radioactive SRIF with high efficiency (29Hofland L.J. van, K. P. Waaijers M.

Although AtT-20 cells are mainly documented to express POMC and to secrete ACTH (30Reisine T. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Luini A. Lewis D. Guild S. Schofield G. Weight F. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3128-3132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preliminary studies from our laboratory suggest that AtT-20 cells may also express GH. 2P. Sarret, D.

The aim of the present study was to confirm that AtT-20 cells truly express GH, to determine whether this expression is regulated by SRIF, and to investigate the role played by receptor/ligand internalization in this regulatory function. Mouse AtT-20/D16–16 tumor cell line was a gift from Dr. Nabil Seidah (Clinical Research Institute, Montréal, Québec, Canada). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and gentamycin were purchased from Life Technologies Inc., fetal calf serum and 1,10-phenanthroline from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and horse serum from Boehringer Ingelheim. The polyclonal rabbit anti-sst5 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Hans-Jürgen Kreienkamp (Institut für Zellbiochemie und Klinische Neurobiologie, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany) and polyclonal rabbit anti-sst1 and -sst2A antibodies were gifts from Agnes Schonbrunn (Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, University of Texas, Houston, TX).

Tyr0 -[ d-Trp8]SRIF-14 was iodinated and purified as described previously (32Sadoul J.L. Mazella J. Amar S. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Bodipy-[d-Trp8]SRIF-14 (fluo-SRIF) was synthesized and purified as published (14Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Houle M. Reisine T. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mouse AtT-20/D16–16 tumor cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum supplemented with gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were plated in 12-mm multi-well dishes for binding experiments, in 60-mm culture dishes for cAMP measurements, and in 100-mm culture dishes for GH mRNA detection. The culture medium was removed, and cells were equilibrated with 500 μl of Earle's Tris-Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 3.6 mm MgCl2, supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) in the presence or in the absence of 0.45 m sucrose for 30 min or of 100 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 15 h. The incubation medium was replaced by 250 μl of fresh buffer containing 0.1 nm125I-labeled Tyr0 -[ d-Trp8]SRIF (2000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 0.8 mm1,10-phenanthroline. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice with 500 μl of binding buffer. To discriminate between surface-bound and sequestered125I-Tyr0 -[ d-Trp8]SRIF, cells were left unwashed or washed for 2 min with 500 μl of a hypertonic acid buffer (binding buffer containing 0.2 macetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4). Cells were then harvested in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled[ d-Trp8]SRIF and represented less than 5% of the total binding. Saturation experiments were performed by incubating pretreated cells with increasing concentrations (from 0.5 to 16 nm) of125I-Tyr0 -[ d-Trp8]SRIF isotopically diluted with unlabeled Tyr0 -[ d-Trp8]SRIF in the binding buffer. Dissociation constant (K d) and maximal binding capacity (B max) were derived from Scatchard analysis of the data. AtT-20 cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with polylysine (10 μg/ml). Fluo-SRIF (20 nm) was added on preincubated cells for the indicated times, and cells were washed twice with 500 μl of binding buffer. Nonspecific labeling was determined in parallel by carrying out the incubation in the presence of 1 μm [ d-Trp8]SRIF-14. For selective visualization of internalized fluo-SRIF, cells were washed with hypertonic acid buffer as described above. Labeled cells were deposited on glass microscope slides, air-dried, and examined under a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope and an argon-krypton laser. Samples were scanned under 568 nm wavelength excitation; images were acquired as single transcellular optical sections and averaged over 32 scans/frame. Images were then processed using the Carl Zeiss CLSM software 3.1 version, stored on Jazz disks, and mounted using Photoshop. AtT-20 cells grown on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with polylysine (10 μg/ml) were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% glucose and then incubated with or without 20 nm [ d-Trp8]SRIF-14 at 37 °C. After washing twice with 500 μl of equilibration buffer, cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (2 × 10 min) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and one of the following: 1) a 1:50 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal sst5 antibody, 2) a 1:2500 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal sst2A antibody, 3) a 1:2000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal sst1 antibody. The specificity of each of these receptor antibodies has been fully established elsewhere (15Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Nehring R.B. Roosterman D. Meyerhof W. Richter D.

Cells were then rinsed two times for 10 min each in TBS, incubated with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:100 in TBS for 45 min, rinsed in TBS (two 10-min rinses), and mounted on glass slides with Aquamount for confocal microscopic examination. Images were acquired, stored, and archived as described above. Cells were preincubated in the culture medium either alone or in the presence of 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 15 h or with 0.45 m sucrose in Earle's buffer for 30 min to inhibit internalization. The culture medium was then removed, and cells were incubated with 100 nm [ d-Trp8]SRIF-14 for 60 min at 37 °C or 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with TBS, and total RNAs were prepared at various times. The method of analysis was based on the competition between known amounts of a cDNA competitor and the GH cDNA to be measured for the annealing with common primers during the PCR. The cDNA competitor was prepared from the TA-cloning plasmid containing the wild-type GH cDNA. The cDNA encoding GH was obtained from the reverse transcript product of untreated cells by PCR using a sense oligonucleotide (5′-ACCTCCTGGCTCCTGACCGTC-3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GGTCTCCGCTTTGTGCAGGTC-3′), which corresponded to nucleotide sequences 19–39 and 577–597 of the open reading frame of GH mRNA (35Linzer D.I. Talamantes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9574-9579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product (579 bp) was purified from a 2% low gelling temperature agarose gel and subcloned into the TA-cloning vector. The GH sequence was confirmed by sequencing using the ABI-PRISM DNA sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The plasmid was linearized with BsmI, which cleaves the GH cDNA. After partial digestion with exonuclease III (Erase-a-Base) and treatment with nuclease S1, extremities were blunted with the Klenow fragment of polymerase I and ligated. We selected a 384-bp fragment that has been used as the competitor in the RT-PCR quantitative experiments. Total RNAs were extracted from AtT-20 cells following various experimental conditions using the RNAble kit (Eurobio). The first cDNA strand was obtained from RNAs (6 μg) using the Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega). After cDNA synthesis for 1 h at 42 °C, samples were denaturated for 5 min at 99 °C and chilled on ice. Before analysis of GH mRNA content from AtT-20 cells submitted to various effectors, PCR conditions were optimized with the Opti-Prime PCR optimization kit. The PCR buffer was then: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl. One tenth of the first-strand cDNA was amplified in a volume of 50 μl with 200 ng of each primer, 2 μl of Taq polymerase (0.5 unit/μl) (Appligene), and decreasing concentrations of the cDNA competitor. Amplification was carried out with a first cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, 55 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, followed by 34 cycles, 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 8 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. As controls, each RT sample was submitted to PCR either with a sense or a reverse primer. In some cases, the PCR was carried out without the competitor cDNA, or without the RT product. PCR band intensities detected with ethidium bromide were analyzed by laser densitometry. When the ratio between the density of the cDNA competitor band and that of the GH band was expressed as a function of the amount of competitor, the representation was linear (Fig. 6) (36Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar,37Peten E.P. Striker L.J. Garcia P.A. Striker G.E. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1993; : S55-S58PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of cDNA in the sample was calculated from the experimental condition that gave a ratio = 1. AtT-20 cells were preincubated with 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min in culture medium under the various experimental conditions (control, incubation in the presence of hyperosmolar sucrose, or pretreatment with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin; see above). Cells were then incubated in culture medium containing 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine with or without 0.1 μm [ d-Trp8]SRIF-14 or 10 μm forskolin. The reaction was terminated by removing the medium and scraping off cells in 1.5 ml of 65% ethanol. After centrifugation, the dried pellet was dissolved in 0.05m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% preservative. The cAMP content was then measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In order to characterize the properties of SRIF internalization in AtT-20 cells and to define optimal conditions for blocking the internalization process, we performed association kinetics of125I-Tyr0-[ d-Trp8]SRIF-14 (125I-SRIF) on whole AtT-20 cells under various experimental conditions. In the absence of any pretreatment,125I-SRIF bound specifically to AtT-20 cells at 37 °C in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The radioactivity associated with the cells reached a plateau within 20 min. Removal of surface-bound radioactivity by acid-NaCl wash revealed that 80% of the total 125I-SRIF bound at this time was intracellular (Fig.1 A). By comparison, when the incubation was carried out at 4 °C, maximal binding reached a plateau somewhat later (at approximately 40 min). The bulk of this binding (85% of total at 60 min) was acid-washable at all times, indicating that the ligand had not been internalized into the cells (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of 0.45 m sucrose, the association of 125I-SRIF was similar to that observed at 37 °C (plateau value obtained at 20 min; Fig. 1 C). However, no remaining radioactivity was detected following acid-NaCl wash, indicating that hyperosmolar sucrose efficiently blocked internalization of the bound ligand (Fig.1 C). Finally, when cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin, the amount of 125I-SRIF sequestered into the cells (i.e. acid wash-resistant) was similar to that seen in controls, indicating that pertussis toxin had no effect on the internalization process (Fig. 1 D). In order to verify that the parameters of 125I-SRIF association with AtT-20 cells were not modified by the addition of hyperosmolar sucrose or by preincubation with pertussis toxin, saturation experiments were performed at 37 °C under equilibrium conditions. As illustrated by the Scatchard plot in Fig.2, the maximal amount of cell-associated125I-SRIF was affected neither by hyperosmolar sucrose nor by pertussis toxin treatment. However, the addition of 0.45m sucrose decreased the EC50 value toward125I-SRIF (4.42 ± 0.38 nm,n = 2) as compared with control experiments (1.49 ± 0.21 nm, n = 4) or to experiments performed in the presence of pertussis toxin (1.34 ± 0.17 nm, n = 3) (Fig. 2). These data clearly indicate that the maximal amount of 125I-SRIF associated with AtT-20 cells is not affected by sucrose or pertussis toxin treatment. To visualize the intracellular trafficking of internalized SRIF, AtT-20 cells were incubated at 37 °C with 20 nm Fluo-SRIF and cell surface labeling was stripped off with hypertonic acid wash. After 5 min of incubation, the internalized ligand formed small intracellular fluorescent hot spots distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). By 30 min, these hot spots had increased in number and intensity and were heavily clustered next to the nucleus (Fig. 3). In cells incubated in the presence of 0.45 m sucrose, the fluorescent label remained sequestered at the periphery of the cells at all times (Fig.4 A). This labeling was exclusively surface-bound since it was entirely strippable by hypertonic acid wash (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Effect of hyperosmolar sucrose on fluo-SRIF internalization in AtT-20 cells. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 nm SRIF in the presence of hyperosmolar sucrose and either air-dried (A) or acid-washed (B). In the air-dried specimen (A), the label is confined to the periphery of the cell, in a pattern distinct from that observed in the absence of hyperosmolar sucrose (compare with Fig. 3). This pericellular labeling is entirely surface-bound since it totally disappears after hypertonic acid wash (B). Scale bar, 5 μmView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunohistochemistry revealed very distinct distributional patterns for sst1, sst2A, and sst5 receptors. In the absence of SRIF, all of these receptors were essentially localized at the cell surface (Fig.5). Following 5 or 20 min of incubation with SRIF, both sst1 and sst5 immunolabeling remained confined to the periphery of the cells, where it formed a more or less continuous ring (Fig. 5, left and right). By contrast, after 5 min of incubation with SRIF, sst2A immunolabeling was clearly translocated from the cell surface to intracellular endosome-like compartments (Fig. 5, center). After 20 min of incubation with SRIF, sst2A-immunoreactive receptors formed a single concentrated hot spot in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5). By that time, sst2 cell surface labeling had almost completely disappeared (Fig. 5). The amount of GH mRNA present in AtT-20 cells following incubation with SRIF under various experimental conditions was determined by quantitative RT-PCR using competing primers against the target cDNA and a competitor DNA. An example is given in Fig. 6 A, in which the amount of the target GH cDNA (579 bp) was determined in AtT-20 cells in the absence of SRIF (control) and after 90 min of incubation with the peptide. This amount of GH mRNA was measured in a series of PCR runs containing various amounts of the competitor DNA (384 bp). All PCR products were quantified by laser scanning, and the ratios of competitor over target band densities were plotted for each PCR condition as a function of the amount of competitor DNA (Fig.6 B). The amount of GH cDNA was then extrapolated from the straight line for a ratio of 1 and expressed in attomoles (amol)/μg of total RNA taking into account that the DNA competitor was double-stranded and that 1/10th of the RT product was used for PCR. Once the method had been validated, the amount of GH mRNA was measured in AtT-20 cells at various times following incubation with SRIF in conditions of unimpaired (controls and pertussis toxin-treated) and impaired (incubation at 4 °C or in the presence of sucrose) internalization (Fig. 7 A). Incubation with 100 nm SRIF dramatically decreased the amount of GH mRNA from 93 amol/μg of RNA to a minimum of 7.5 amol/μg within 90 min. The basal amount slowly recovered after 48 h (Fig. 7 A). In cells preincubated with pertussis toxin, SRIF produced identical inhibitory effect on GH mRNA levels. By contrast, when the internalization process was blocked by 0.45m sucrose or by incubation at 4 °C, no modification of GH mRNA content was measured (Fig. 7 A). To ensure that the regulatory effect of SRIF on GH mRNA was specific, parallel PCR experiments were performed to demonstrate that incubation with SRIF did not modify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA content in AtT-20 cells between 0 min and 48 h (Fig. 7 B). Taken together, the data indicate that the inhibitory effect of SRIF on GH mRNA level are prevented when the internalization process is blocked. To confirm that the effects of receptor internalization on GH mRNA levels were independent of adenylate cyclase activity, we measured the ability of SRIF to stimulate the production of cAMP in AtT-20 cells in the absence or in the presence of hyperosmolar sucrose or of pertussis toxin. Incubation of AtT-20 cells with 10 μm forskolin increased the intracellular content of cAMP from 0.4 pmol/105 cells to 2.2 pmol/105cells within 75 min (Fig. 8 A). SRIF-14 (100 nm) inhibited this forskolin-stimulated cAMP content after 20 min and up to 75 min of incubation with the peptide at 37 °C (Fig. 8 A). There also was an inhibitory effect of SRIF on forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation when the experiments were carried out at 4 °C, although the level of stimulation by forskolin was weaker than at 37 °C (Fig. 8 B). When the incubations were carried out at 37 °C but in the presence of hyperosmolar sucrose, the inhibitory effect of SRIF was similar to that observed in the absence of sucrose (Fig. 8 C). By contrast, when cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin, SRIF was without effect on the stimulatory action of forskolin (Fig. 8 D). These results demonstrate that the inhibitory action of SRIF on adenylate cyclase is blocked by preincubation with pertussis toxin but not by co-incubation with hyperosmolar sucrose and that the effect of SRIF on adenylate cyclase activity is independent of internalization. The present study provides the first demonstration that SRIF can directly decrease GH mRNA levels in anterior pituitary cells. It also demonstrates that this inhibitory effect is independent from the inhibition of adenylate cyclase also produced by SRIF in these cells but that it is dependent upon the internalization of SRIF/sst receptor complexes. The parameters of125I-Tyr0-[d-Trp8]SRIF-14 (125I-SRIF) binding to AtT-20 cells at 37 °C were comparable to those reported previously in this cell line using different SRIF agonists (19Morel G.

https://openalex.org/W2052696818,"ClpA, a member of the Clp/Hsp100 family of ATPases, is both an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone and the regulatory component of ClpAP protease. We demonstrate that chaperone and protease activities occur concurrently in ClpAP complexes during a single round of RepA binding to ClpAP and ATP-dependent release. This result was substantiated with a ClpA mutant, ClpA(K220V), carrying an amino acid substitution in the N-terminal ATP binding site. ClpA(K220V) is unable to activate RepA, but the presence of ClpP or chemically inactivated ClpP restores its ability to activate RepA. The presence of ClpP simultaneously facilitates degradation of RepA. ClpP must remain bound to ClpA(K220V) for these effects, indicating that both chaperone and proteolytic activities of the mutant complex occur concurrently. ClpA(K220V) itself is able to form stable complexes with RepA in the presence of a poorly hydrolyzed ATP analog, adenosine 5′-<i>O</i>-(thiotriphosphate), and to release RepA upon exchange of adenosine 5′-<i>O</i>-(thiotriphosphate) with ATP. However, the released RepA is inactive in DNA binding, indicating that the N-terminal ATP binding site is essential for the chaperone activity of ClpA. Taken together, these results suggest that substrates bound to the complex of the proteolytic and ATPase components can be partitioned between release/reactivation and translocation/degradation."

Nature. 1998; 392: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The use of viral vectors has potentially many risks, including toxicity associated with expression of viral structural proteins, insertional mutagenesis, and induction of different immune responses (2Miller A.D.

With the advantages of being nonimmunogenic and easy to reproduce (purify to homogeneity), synthetic plasmid-liposome complexes constitute the most important alternative to viral vector systems. In particular, substantial efforts have been focused on the development of cationic lipids (CLs),1 which are efficient carriers for DNA (5Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M.

The ratio of CL to DNA is known to be important for optimal efficiency in vitro (5Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The optimal ratio occurs when the number of positive charges incorporated into the CL exceeds the number of negative charges on the DNA, which reflects a necessary electrostatic association of the CL-DNA aggregates with the negatively charged cell surface (12Behr J.-P.

Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1701-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that serum components inhibit gene transfer by altering the size and shape of CL-DNA complexes (21Escriou V. Ciolina C. Lacroix F. Byk G. Scherman D. Wils P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and that binding of serum proteins, such as albumin, lipoproteins, and macroglobulin, to CL-oligonucleotide complexes interferes with cellular uptake of the complexes (22Zelphati O. Uyechi L.S. Barron LB. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has also been hypothesized that heparin present in serum could be an inhibitor of gene transfer by releasing the DNA from the CL (22Zelphati O. Uyechi L.S. Barron LB. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 23Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that gene delivery by synthetic CL could be limited by activation of the complement system (22Zelphati O. Uyechi L.S. Barron LB. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 24Plank C. Mechtler K. Szoka Jr., F.C. Wagner E. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Most components in serum with the potential of interacting with gene therapy vehicles are produced by hepatocytes. However, in vivo studies of CL-mediated gene transfer have shown that there are considerable variations in transfection efficiency between different tissues (25Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D.

A better understanding of the nature of the molecules that can potentially interfere with CL-DNA complex-based gene delivery may give rise to new strategies for efficient transfection of specific tissues and cell types in vivo. Molecules that are potential inhibitors of CL-mediated gene transfer include proteoglycans (PGs). Their glycosaminoglycan side-chains consist of repetitive disaccharide units with a wide variety of substitutions, which results in a substantial structural heterogeneity (27Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The large number of carboxyl and sulfate groups give them a greater linear charge density than DNA (27Casu B. Adv.

The objective of this study was to identify secreted molecules that may have diverse negative effects on CL-mediated gene transfer. We present evidence that CL-mediated gene transfer is inhibited by secreted cellular proteins, in particular PGs. PGs form complexes with CLs, leading to the release of DNA and intracellular accumulation of CL-PG complexes. This results in inhibition of DNA uptake (2–4-fold) and a disproportionate inhibition of reporter gene expression (100–1000-fold). It is also shown that the effects exerted by PGs on CL-mediated gene transfer are mediated by the glycosaminoglycan portion of the PGs, i.e. chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and heparan sulfate (HS). Protamine sulfate, a polybasic peptide that neutralizes the anticoagulant activity of glycosaminoglycans (35Sie P. Cremers B. Dupouy D. Caranobe C. Dol F. Boneu B. Thromb. Res. 1989; 54: 63-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), abrogated the inhibitory effects exerted by PGs. Finally, by fluorescence microscopy it was shown that glycosaminoglycans, internalized by a CL-dependent route, accumulate in the cell nuclei.

Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFL-1, CCL-153) and human lung carcinoma cells (A 549, CCL-185) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Monolayer cultures were maintained on plastic in Eagle's MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (In Vitro AB), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) in a humified 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. Cells were checked for mycoplasma using GEN-PROBE (Skafte & Claesson). Subconfluent monolayers of HFL-1 or A 549 cells in 25-cm2 culture flasks (approximately 1.5 × 106 cells) were labeled with Na235SO4 (50 μCi/ml) andl-[4,5-3H]leucine or [35S]methionine (20 μCi/ml) in 4 ml of fresh MEM for 24 h. The medium was aspirated, and cells were extensively washed with MEM to remove free radioisotope. This was followed by another incubation in 4 ml MEM for 24 h. The cell culture medium (CM) was reisolated for cellular uptake experiments. In some cases, the same procedure was performed without radioisotopes to obtain unlabeled CM used in DNA uptake and gene expression experiments, respectively. HFL-1 and A 549 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well (approximately 50% confluency) in 0.5 ml of growth medium 24 h before transfection. To prepare CL-DNA complexes, pGL3 plasmid DNA (1 μg/ml) and the desired amount of DOSPA/DOPE or DOGS were separately diluted in 100 μl of MEM or CM, mixed by inversion, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-lipid mixture was diluted to a final volume of 250 μl, vortexed, and then added to cells that had been rinsed twice with MEM. At the end of the 4-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.5 ml of growth medium. After an additional period of incubation for 48 h, cells were washed twice with MEM and treated with 150 μl of cell lysis reagent containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm CDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 (Promega) for 10 min at 4 °C followed by scraping. Luciferase expression was quantified in 5 μl of the cell lysate supernatant, using a luciferase assay kit. Light emission was measured by integration over 30 s at 25 °C using an EG & G Berthold Microlumat LB 96P luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein content of each sample, determined with the Pierce BCA protein assay. Two μg of plasmid DNA pGL3 was labeled with 32P by nick translation using Dnase I (100 pg), DNA polymerase I (5 units), and 0.7 nmol of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 33 pmol of [32P]dCTP for 2 h at 15 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (final volume of 110 μl). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl 0.2 m EDTA. Labeled DNA was purified from unincorporated nucleotides using Microspin S-200 HR columns according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by precipitation with 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 95% EtOH. DNA was recovered by centrifugation at maximum speed (14,000 rpm) in a bench-top centrifuge for 4 min. After washing with 70% EtOH, isolated DNA was assessed for integrity by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis at 70 V in Tris acetate EDTA buffer for 45 min. [32P]DNA plasmid bands were detected by EtBr staining. HFL-1 and A 549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 0.5 ml of growth medium. After 24 h, cells were rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of MEM and then supplemented with 1 μg/ml of pGL3 [32P]DNA (specific activity, 107 cpm/μg) and various amounts of CL, as described above. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were transferred to an ice bath and washed with ice-cold MEM, and then detached by trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) treatment in 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl (PBS), for 1 min at 20 °C, followed by suspension in 0.5 ml of growth medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, followed by two washings with MEM. This treatment removed CL-DNA complexes that were unspecifically attached to the cells. Finally, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of cell culture lysis reagent (defined above) for 10 min at 20 °C, and [32P]DNA radioactivity was determined in 250 μl of the cell lysate by liquid scintillation counting using Readysafe scintillation mixture (Beckman) and a Wallac Rack Beta counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells from parallel cultures were counted in a Bürker chamber, and cell-associated DNA was expressed as ng/106 cells. Plasmid DNA (20 μg/ml) was preincubated with EtBr (2.0 μg/ml) either in MEM or CM (prepared as described above) in a 96-well Microfluor plate. The indicated amount of DOSPA/DOPE or DOGS was added to give a final volume of 100 μl. EtBr fluorescence at 610 nm was continuously monitored using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrometer (excitation wavelength of 500 nm) and a Perkin-Elmer plate reader. The fluorescence signal stabilized in less than 5 min after the addition of the CL and was presented as the fraction in percent of the maximum fluorescence signal obtained without CL (control). Control values for the different media used were equal. HFL-1 and A 549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 0.5 ml of growth medium. After 24 h, cells were rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of MEM and then supplemented with a mixture of fresh radiolabeled CM, prepared as described above, 1 μg/ml DNA plasmid, and the desired amount of either DOSPA/DOPE or DOGS. After preincubation for 30 min at room temperature, the mixture was diluted to a final volume of 0.5 ml, vortexed and then added to the cells. At the end of the 4-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was aspirated, and cells were transferred to an ice bath and washed with ice-cold MEM, and then detached by trypsin treatment for 1 min, followed by suspension in 0.5 ml of growth medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation followed by washing with MEM. Then cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of cell lysis reagent for 10 min at 20 °C, and cell-associated [35S]sulfate and [3H]leucine radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Unlabeled cells in 25-cm2 flasks were rinsed twice with MEM and incubated with 4-ml aliquots of CM that had been radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H]leucine or [35S]methionine, 1 μg/ml plasmid DNA, and various amounts of DOSPA/DOPE. DNA plasmid was included in order to mimic the conditions of the experiments described above. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, followed by extensive washing with PBS. Cell layers were extracted with 2.5 ml of 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 1 mm di-isopropyl fluorophosphate for 10 min at 4 °C. Extracts were then subjected to either of the following procedures: 1) precipitation with 8 volumes of 95% ethanol, or 2) dilution with 1.3 volumes of 7 m urea, 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mmNEM followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose columns (1 ml) equilibrated in the same urea buffer as above. After sample application, the columns were washed with 10 bed volumes of the urea buffer and 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by elution with 3 bed volumes of 4 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.8, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm NEM, and 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Eluted material was recovered by precipitation with 8 volumes of ethanol. Samples from procedure 1 were dissolved in 150 μl of 5% (w/v) SDS buffer and subjected to SDS electrophoresis on 3–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels with a 3% stacking gel, as described elsewhere (37Schmidtchen A. Carlstedt I. Malmström A. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Material isolated by procedure 2 (polyanionic macromolecules) were dissolved in 0.4 ml of the 4 m guanidinium chloride-containing elution buffer (without bovine serum albumin) and chromatographed on Superose 6 HR 10/30 (flow rate, 0.4 ml/min), equilibrated in the same buffer. One-min fractions were analyzed for35S or 3H radioactivity by scintillation counting. Pooled material was concentrated in Centriplus 30 concentrators, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and then applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated in 7 m urea, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0 (starting buffer). After a 5-ml wash with starting buffer, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.3–1.2 m NaCl in the same buffer over 60 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of the collected fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting and pooled as indicated for further analysis. Material collected from ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in the appropriate buffer. Digestions with chondroitin ABC lyase (50 milliunits/ml) were performed in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HOAc, pH 7.3, 10 mmNa2EDTA, 10 mm NEM at 37 °C for 10 h. Digestions with HS lyase (3 milliunits/ml) were conducted in 200 μl of 3 mm Ca(OAc)2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm NEM at 37 °C for 10 h. Digested samples were lyophilized, dissolved in 0.5 ml of the starting buffer, and reapplied to the Mono Q column for linear gradient elution as described above. HFL-1 cells were seeded at a density of 50 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in growth medium. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with MEM and then supplemented with 1 μg/ml of AMAC-HS with or without 8 μg/ml DOSPA/DOPE in MEM. At the end of the 4 h incubation at 37 °C, medium was aspirated, and cells were trypsinized, suspended in growth medium, centrifuged, resuspended in growth medium, and replated on 4-well coverslips. With this procedure, unspecifically bound AMAC-HS was removed from the cells. After an additional incubation period of 24 h, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, followed by extensive rinsing in PBS and distilled water. Cells were then viewed using a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope and a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning microscope system. The optics used to separate fluorescence signal from noise was a dichroic mirror (562DCLP) and a band-pass filter (D540/30) from Chroma Technology, Inc. The light source used was a Kr+-laser (Coherent Innova 300) supplying 2-mW, 413-nm continuous light. The images were digitized and transferred to a computer workstation for merging, annotation, and printing. The following procedure was performed to assess the integrity of AMAC-HS isolated from cells: 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded in a 25-cm2 cell culture flask and grown for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with HS-AMAC (100 μg) and CL (800 μg) as described above. After the second incubation period of 24 h, cells were detached by scraping in PBS, centrifuged, and then lysed in the cell extraction buffer. The cell lysate was then passed through a DEAE-cellulose column (1 ml) as described above, in order to separate free AMAC from intact AMAC-HS. Eluted AMAC-HS was recovered by precipitation with ethanol and then dissolved in 200 μl of destilled water. The recovered material from cell cultures and standard solutions of AMAC-HS were then analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrometer (excitation wavelength of 430 nm) and a Perkin-Elmer plate reader (emission wavelength of 520 nm). We examined the influence of secreted cell molecules on CL-mediated gene transfer in two different types of cells: HFL-1 (human lung fibroblasts) and A 549 (a human lung carcinoma cell line). The CL formulations used were DOSPER/DOPE and DOGS, which are commercially available under the trade names LipofectAMINE and Transfectam, respectively. They are both lipospermines, carrying spermine, a natural counterion of DNA in vivo, as the DNA-binding group. The former transfection reagent also contains the neutral colipid DOPE. Throughout this study, these transfection reagents behaved very similarly. CL-mediated transfection was inhibited by CM in both HFL-1 and A 549 cells (Table I). At the highest lipid concentration used (16 μg/ml), transfection was inhibited by 99.5 and 99.9% in HFL-1 and A 549 cells, respectively. There was a substantial difference in transfection efficiency between the two cell lines (approximately 37-fold higher in A 549 compared with HFL-1). Conditioned CM obtained after shorter incubation periods was less inhibitory, but CM isolated already after 8 h significantly reduced gene expression. CM obtained after a 24 h-incubation was chosen for further studies. In a control experiment, plasmid DNA was incubated either in MEM or CM for 24 h at 37 °C and then analyzed for integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis. There was no difference in the recovery of intact plasmid (approximately 87%), suggesting that the inhibition of gene expression by CM was not due to increased degradation of the reporter gene plasmid. Moreover, preexposure of HFL-1 cells to CM for 4 h, prior to the addition of CL-DNA complexes, did not affect gene transfer efficiency. However, preexposure of cells for 4 h to CM supplemented with 16 μg/ml CL inhibited gene expression by approximately 85% compared with cells preexposed to MEM supplemented with CL (results not shown).Table IInfluence of CM components on CL-mediated transfection efficiencyCLLuciferase activityHFL-1A 549ControlCMControlCMμg/ml10 −3 × relative light units/μg of protein00.01 ± 0.0020.09 ± 0.0020.2 ± 0.0050.06 ± 0.002220 ± 0.80.3 ± 0.0355 ± 1.00.4 ± 0.03847 ± 1.10.5 ± 0.011900 ± 260.2 ± 0.011689 ± 2.70.5 ± 0.013300 ± 763.6 ± 0.03HFL-1 and A 549 cells were plated in 24-well dishes at 1 × 105 cells/well (24 h prior to the time of transfection) and then transfected with CL complexed with 1 μg/ml of DNA plasmid at a 2:1 to 16:1 (w/w) ratio (corresponding to a theoretical charge ratio of 0.8–6.4) either in CM or in MEM (control). After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was aspirated, and cells were rinsed twice with MEM. Growth medium was added, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for another 48 h.

In human, transcripts encoding two forms of the enzyme with apparent molecular masses of 69 and 82 kDa are found in brain and spinal cord; the 82-kDa form differs from the 69-kDa enzyme only in terms of a 118-amino acid extension on its amino terminus. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged choline acetyltransferase, we show that the 82-kDa enzyme is targeted to nuclei of cells, whereas the 69-kDa protein is found in cytoplasm. Expression of site-directed and deletion mutants of the 82-kDa isoform reveals that the extended amino terminus contains a nuclear localization signal in the first nine amino acids which targets the protein to nucleus.

This represents the first report of a neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzyme that is localized to the cell nucleus. choline acetyltransferase acetylcholine green fluorescent protein nuclear localization signal Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT,1 acetyl-CoA:cholineO-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in cholinergic neurons. These neurons are distributed widely throughout both central and peripheral nervous systems controlling a range of physiological functions. Dysfunction of cholinergic neurotransmission is found in a number of neurologic and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's chorea, and schizophrenia. The regulatory mechanisms underlying ACh biosynthesis have not been resolved. Under a variety of experimental conditions, the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis appears to be availability of the substrate choline rather than the catalytic activity of ChAT as the latter is considered to be present in the neuron in kinetic excess (1Tucek S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 60: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Distribution of ChAT within the neuron has been examined using subcellular fractionation techniques with characterization based upon immunological and biochemical approaches. In a number of species, about 80–90% of ChAT in nerve terminals is present as a cytosolic protein, a portion of which may be ionically associated with synaptic membranes, while the remaining 10–20% of the total enzyme appears to be bound nonionically to plasma membrane (2Benishin C.G.

Differential subcellular compartmentalization can serve as an important regulatory mechanism providing spatial restrictions for substrate or enzyme availability, as well as for the proximity of enzyme modulatory proteins and molecules. To date, the mechanism(s) governing the subcellular distribution of ChAT have not been elucidated, and the role that different pools of enzyme play in regulation of neurotransmitter biosynthesis is unclear. While ChAT is encoded by a single gene, multiple mRNAs for the protein are produced by alternative splicing and differential utilization of three different exons within the noncoding region of the gene (6Misawa H. Ishi K. Deguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20392-20399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Oda Y. Nakanishi I. Deguchi T. Mol.

Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In human, four isoforms of ChAT mRNAs (termed R, N1, N2, and M) have been identified (9Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of ChAT mRNA polymorphism is not known, although different transcript isoforms may vary in their stability or translational efficiency or may be differentially expressed in response to trophic factors and hormones. With the exception of human, the multiple transcripts for ChAT identified within a given species all appear to translate to a common protein with apparent molecular mass around 68 kDa (for review, see Ref. 10Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In humans, while the R and N transcripts encode a common 69-kDa protein, the M transcript translates to two protein isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 82 and 69 kDa due to the presence of two translation initiation sites in the M-ChAT mRNA (9Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Oda Y. Muroishi Y. Nakanishi I. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 38: 135-138Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The 82-kDa form of ChAT differs from 69-kDa ChAT only in terms of a 118-amino acid extension on its amino terminus. Cloning of ChAT from mammalian species, including human, has greatly facilitated studies of mechanisms underlying expression and regulation of the enzyme. The advent of green fluorescent protein (GFP) technology has provided new opportunities for investigating the subcellular compartmentalization of proteins. Because of its inherent fluorescence properties, direct visualization of GFP from the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria expressed as a fusion protein with other recombinant proteins can serve as an effective marker for protein localization and trafficking in living cells (12Kain S.R. Adams A. Kondepudi T. Yang T. Ward W.W. Pitts P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 650-655PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rizzuto R. Brini M. De Giorgi F. Rossi R. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we report for the first time the analysis of ChAT protein localization in living cells in real-time using confocal laser microscopy. Importantly, the 82-and 69-kDa forms of ChAT are differentially distributed in cells with the larger form localized specifically to nucleus and the smaller form present in cytoplasm. Human N1- and M-ChAT cDNAs were obtained from Dr. H. Misawa, Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Tokyo. Plasmids for ChAT-GFP conjugates were made by ligating coding regions of the ChAT cDNAs into KpnI and BamHI cloning sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) producing chimeric genes encoding NH2-terminal fusions to GFP; flanking in-frame 3′BamHI (used to replace the COOH-terminal stop codon) and 5′KpnI restriction sites were introduced into both M- and N1-ChAT by PCR. The cDNA construct M119A was generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of human M-ChAT with codon 119 ATG (Met) changed to GCG (Ala). The truncated deletion mutant of M-ChAT, −(1–9), was generated by PCR to mutate codon 9 AGG (Arg) to ATG (Met) and remove nucleotides encoding the first nine amino acids of 82-kDa ChAT. Integrity of the coding sequence, fusions, and mutations was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106cells/100-mm dish and transiently transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method (14Cullen B.R.

For confocal microscopy, cells were replated at 24 h after transfection onto 35-mm dishes containing a 1-cm glass-bottomed center well (Plastek Cultureware, Ashland, MA) in growth medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Confocal scanning laser microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM410 microscope using a × 63 oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using excitation (488 nm) and emission (515 nm) wavelengths obtained with standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets and an argon/krypton ion laser. Pinhole diameter and sensitivity of the detector were constant for all sections. A series of sections were made through each fluorescent cell, with a section through the center of the nucleus chosen for analysis. All images were acquired from cells at 2–4 days after transfection. HEK 293 expressing each construct (48 h after transfection) were subfractionated following the method of Antalis and Godbolt (15Antalis T.M. Godbolt D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to yield a pellet containing crude nuclei and the postnuclear supernatant. Nuclear pellets were washed once in lysis buffer, then three times in wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were extracted by resuspension in wash buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 700 units/ml of DNase I, then incubated for 45 min on ice to digest DNA (16Pujol M.J. Bosser R. Vendrell M. Serratosa J. Bachs O. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Membranes were pelleted from the postnuclear supernatant at 35,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman TLN 120 rotor at 4 °C, with the resulting supernatant yielding the cytosolic proteins. Membrane pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer containing 350 mm NaCl, then solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 with sonication (3 × 15 s) to yield the membrane proteins. Subcellular fractions were retained for analysis of ChAT specific activity using a radioenzymatic assay described previously (17Rylett R.J. Goddard S. Lambros A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant 69- and 82-kDa human ChAT was prepared from baculovirus-infected High 5 cells expressing the proteins. Recombinant viruses were prepared from plasmids made of either N1- or M119A-ChAT cDNA in pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen) and linearized Bac-N-Blue DNA (Invitrogen) in High 5 cells using the liposome transfection method (Invitrogen); following plaque purification, high titer viruses were prepared. At 40 h after infection, cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (200 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. After centrifugation (30 min; 15,000 × g), the resulting supernatant was used as a source of 69 and 82-kDa human ChAT. Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits using a 13-amino acid peptide localized to the carboxyl terminus of human ChAT protein (CEKATRPSQGHQP) (9Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin as immunogen (Genemed Synthesis Inc.). ChAT-specific immunoglobulins were affinity-purified on a column of the ChAT carboxyl-terminal peptide coupled to NHS-Sepharose (4 mg/1 ml of medium) according to manufacturers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) instructions. Rabbit antiserum (25 ml) was loaded onto the prepared affinity column (2.5 ml), which had been preequilibrated with PBS at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoglobulins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7. Proteins from one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in a semidry electroblotting apparatus using transfer buffer (48 mmTris, 39 mm glycine) containing 20% methanol. The membranes was saturated with 8% non-fat milk powder in PBS and probed with the purified fraction of IgG from antiserum against the ChAT carboxyl-terminal peptide (1:2,000) for 1 h, then stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:500;CLONTECH). Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To address the issue of subcellular localization of ChAT, in particular whether the 82- and 69-kDa forms of human ChAT are differentially distributed within the cell, we prepared constructs incorporating either the human M- or N1-ChAT cDNAs into a vector with the gene encoding GFP (Fig.1 A). Immunoblots of homogenates of HEK 293 cells transiently expressing M- or N1-ChAT cDNAs are shown in Fig. 1 B; both 69- and 82-kDa ChAT are expressed from M-ChAT, whereas only 69-kDa ChAT is expressed from N1-ChAT. Importantly, both ChAT-GFP fusion proteins retain catalytic activity with respect to synthesis of ACh in an in vitroassay (Fig. 1 C). Confocal microscopy of HEK 293 cells expressing M- or N1-ChAT-GFP conjugates revealed a striking difference in the fluorescence patterns for subcellular distribution of ChAT protein produced from the two constructs (Fig. 2 A). GFP-mediated fluorescence associated with M-ChAT was observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cells, whereas that associated with N1-ChAT was localized to cytoplasm and absent from the nucleus. Cells expressing GFP alone revealed a homogeneous subcellular distribution for the protein (data not shown; Ref. 12Kain S.R. Adams A. Kondepudi T. Yang T. Ward W.W. Pitts P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 650-655PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of ChAT enzymatic activity measured radioenzymatically following subcellular fractionation of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells was consistent with and paralleled observations made for the GFP fluorescence patterns for M- and N1-ChAT (Fig. 2 B). Specifically, ChAT activity was distributed about equally in nuclear (48%) and cytoplasmic (44%) fractions in cells expressing M-ChAT cDNA. In contrast, 90% of ChAT activity was present in cytoplasmic fractions of cells expressing N1-ChAT cDNA with minimal enzyme activity associated with the nuclear fraction (2%). In both cases, a small fraction (4–6%) of total ChAT activity was measured in the membrane fraction. These observations suggested that accumulation of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus was associated with the 82-kDa form of ChAT, since both M- and N1-ChAT constructs express the 69-kDa form of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant of M-ChAT in which the second translation initiation site, methionine 119, was replaced by an alanine residue (designated M119A) so that only the 82-kDa form of the enzyme was translated (Fig. 1 A); this was confirmed when expression of this construct in HEK 293 cells resulted in production of only 82-kDa ChAT (Fig. 1 B). Determination of the relative specific activity of the mutant form of ChAT (M119A) revealed that it did not differ significantly from that determined for the smaller isoform (Fig. 1 C). Importantly, confocal microscopy of the ChAT-GFP mutant M119A fusion protein shows that the 82-kDa form of ChAT is localized predominately in the nucleus, with a low level of fluorescence distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.3). In parallel with these observations, subcellular fractionation studies revealed that about 75% of total M119A-ChAT activity was found in the nuclear fraction, with the remaining approximately 20% of enzyme activity in the cytoplasm and a small fraction associated with membranes (Fig. 3). These data suggest that 82-kDa ChAT is preferentially targeted to, and compartmentalized in, the nucleus. In eukaryotic cells, the selective transport of proteins from cytoplasm to nucleus is mediated by short amino acid sequences, characteristically rich in basic residues, commonly referred to as nuclear localization signals (NLS) (19Chatterjee S. Javier M. Stochaj U. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NLS-containing proteins interact with cytoplasmic NLS receptors and a number of other soluble factors, which collectively function to dock and catalyze translocation of the protein through the nuclear pore complex in an energy-dependent manner (20Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 21Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A core NLS contains four or more arginine (Arg) and lysine (Lys) residues within a hexapeptide and is frequently flanked by acidic residues or helix-breakers such as proline (Pro) and glycine (Gly). A bipartite NLS consists of two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer region of ten or more nonconserved residues. Analysis of the amino terminus of the 82-kDa form of ChAT from amino acid residues 1–33 (MGLRTAKKRGLGGGGKWKREEGGGTRGRREVRP) reveals elements of both core and bipartite NLSs. To investigate the structure-function relationship of the predicted core NLS located in the immediate amino terminus of 82-kDa ChAT, a truncated mutant of M-ChAT in which amino acid residues 1–9 (MGLRTAKKR) were deleted was constructed (designated −(1–9); truncated 82-kDa ChAT) (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with this region functioning as an NLS, when the GFP fusion protein of this mutant was expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells, the mutant ChAT was no longer localized to the nucleus. Moreover, the fluorescence expression pattern of this construct mirrored that observed for the N-ChAT construct. Corresponding with the absence of nuclear localization of this ChAT mutant was loss of ChAT enzymatic activity associated with the nuclear compartment (10% of total) (Fig.3) and an increase in enzyme present in the cytoplasmic fraction (84%); 5% of ChAT was associated nonionically with membranes. Expression and subcellular distribution of M-, N-, M119A-, and -(1–9)-GFP fusion constructs were also examined in another non-neuronal cell line, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in neuronal pheochromocytoma line PC12 cells. Results similar to those reported for HEK 293 cells were found in PC12 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, indicating, that at least in the cells tested, the findings are consistent in both neuronal and non-neuronal phenotypes (data not shown). Finally, we determined whether differential subcellular compartmentation of ChAT altered ability of cells expressing the different forms of enzyme to synthesize ACh. It was predicted that if the major source of the ChAT substrates choline and acetyl-CoA are cytoplasmic, then ACh synthesis would be reduced in cells expressing the mutant ChAT M119A when compared with the other constructs. ACh synthesis assays were performed in intact transfected HEK 293 cells incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with [3H]choline (0.5 μm). Interestingly, these assays revealed no differences between cells expressing N- (69 kDa) or M- (69 and 82 kDa) ChAT or either of the mutant cDNAs M119A (82 kDa) or −(1–9) (truncated 82 kDa and 69 kDa) ChAT in terms of incorporation of [3H]choline into [3H]ACh. In cells expressing roughly equivalent amounts of enzyme, [3H]ACh synthesis was found to be 104% (M), 98% (M119A), and 105% (−1–9) of that measured in cells transfected with N1-ChAT cDNA (100%) (data are average of two separate experiments). We describe novel findings for the subcellular compartmentation of the 82-kDa form of the cholinergic neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzyme ChAT. This unique form of ChAT found in humans and primates is localized predominantly to the nucleus, whereas the 69-kDa form of the enzyme, which bears homology to that found in other species, is found in the cytoplasm. Results of mutation analysis also demonstrate that the immediate 5′ core NLS basic region of the 82-kDa form of ChAT appears to be both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of the enzyme. The other basic regions of the amino terminus of 82-kDa ChAT may either not be involved in nuclear localization or may participate in modulating the potency or extent of this subcellular compartmentalization, as has been reported for some other nuclear-targeted proteins (22Nigg E. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 23Gorlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 24Moroianu J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The physiological function associated with localization of ChAT in the nucleus is unknown. To date, no other examples of nuclear compartmentalization of a neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzyme have been reported. Experiments designed to determine whether nuclear compartmentalization of ChAT reduced neurotransmitter synthesis in cells expressing 82-kDa ChAT suggest that localization of at least 75% of total cellular ChAT in nucleus, as seen in the case of the mutant M119A, did not affect the ability of cells to synthesize ACh. One possible explanation for this observation may be that the approximately 20% of ChAT found in cytoplasm of cells expressing this ChAT mutant is adequate to support neurotransmitter synthesis. Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytosolic compartment and the process of nuclear translocation is saturable (25Iraurralde E. Adam S. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar), 82-kDa ChAT in cytoplasm either in transit to the nucleus or present in kinetic excess for the transport system may provide sufficient enzyme activity in the cytoplasm to catalyze ACh synthesis from the [3H]choline taken up by the cells. Alternatively, subcellular fractionation data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate clearly that nuclear-localized ChAT is catalytically active by acetylating choline in an in vitroassay. As the ChAT substrates choline and acetyl-CoA are small molecular weight compounds, they may diffuse freely through nuclear pores to equilibrate within the nucleus with the result that ACh synthesis could occur within the nucleus. The functional significance of a nuclear pool of neurotransmitter is not clear as it would not likely enter into the recycling vesicular pool from which ACh is released by exocytosis to communicate information to target cells. Recent reports indicate, however, that there is a form of muscarinic ACh receptors that is localized to the nuclear envelope (26Lind G.J Cavanagh H.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2943-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lind G.J. Cavanagh H.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1492-1507PubMed Google Scholar); this is one example of a growing class of G-protein-coupled receptors compartmentalized to the nucleus. It is not clear how the receptor binding sites are orientated. If the ligand binds in the cytoplasm and signals into the nucleus, cytoplasmic ACh could serve as a pool of ligand, or ACh formed in the nucleus could diffuse into cytoplasm through nuclear pores adjacent to receptors. If, however, the receptor ligand-binding site is orientated into the nucleus, ACh synthesized in the nucleus could bind and initiate signaling events to the cytoplasm. Alternatively, ChAT in the nucleus may acetylate other nuclear substrate(s), with potential candidate(s), including histones and/or other non-histone chromosomal-associated proteins, such as transcription factors. Histone acetylation, for example, is a reversible post-translational modification that destabilizes histones, nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures and is considered to be an important element in targeted transcriptional regulation and expression of many genes (28Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Histone acetylating enzymes belong to a large family of histone acetyltransferases (HAT), which includes an increasing number of transcriptional co-activators that possess HAT activity. These may be involved in regulation of a range of cellular functions such as proliferation and tumorigenesis, for example through acetylation of other proteins including p53 (29Bayle J.H. Crabtree G.R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 885-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether nuclear ChAT possesses intrinsic HAT activity or acetylates alternative substrates. In terms of other potential functional roles, nuclear localized ChAT could bind to DNA and participate in nuclear events, such as regulation of gene expression. Examination of the primary sequence of either 69- or 82-kDa ChAT does not reveal the presence of any of the well characterized motifs that facilitate DNA binding, such as zinc fingers or basic helix-loop-helix regions. There are, however, other examples of DNA binding proteins that lack major known DNA binding motifs, or some DNA binding motifs may not be easily recognized in the primary structures of proteins being revealed functionally only with correct folding of the protein into its higher, tertiary structure. Finally, the 82-kDa form of human ChAT may not have a functional role in nucleus per se, but could perhaps serve as a reservoir of precursor enzyme whose proteolytic cleavage results in generation of a smaller form of the enzyme. A potential precursor form of ChAT has been reported in Drosophila (30Slemmon J.R. Campbell G.A. Selski D.J. Bramson H.N. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and bovine (31Hersh L.B. Wainer B.H. Andrews L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1253-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based upon the existence of a 73–75-kDa ChAT protein, in addition to the more commonly described 67–69-kDa protein. In Drosophila, it appears that the larger form of the enzyme contains an amino-terminal extension that may undergo proteolytic processing to yield 67-kDa ChAT. A major difference between Drosophila and human, however, is that the M transcript that encodes the 82-kDa form of human ChAT also encodes 69-kDa ChAT from a second translation initiation site. It appears, from the data that exist, that Drosophila ChAT is produced as a single 75-kDa protein (32Pahud G. Salem N. Van de Goor J. Medilanski J. Pellegrinelli N. Eder-Colli L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1644-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To date, there is no evidence to indicate that 82-kDa human ChAT is proteolytically cleaved to generate 69-kDa ChAT. Expression of the 82-kDa form of ChAT is unique to humans and primates. It appears that all other species for which ChAT has been cloned express a single form of ChAT enzyme with an apparent molecular mass ranging from approximately 67 to 75 kDa (10Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This unique difference in ChAT expression between human and other mammals might contribute to the vulnerability observed for cholinergic neurons in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (9Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The atypical distribution of the 82-kDa human ChAT in nucleus may be important in this regard, and therefore its role in neurodegenerative pathologies requires examination. We thank Dr. Hidemi Misawa for his generous gift of the cDNAs for human M- and N1-ChAT."

Thus, the enzyme obeys to simple hyperbolic ligand binding behavior and standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, in some oligomeric enzymes, substrate binding to one subunit may modify the catalytic properties of the functionally related one(s). This property, named “homotropic interaction,” yields nonhyperbolic ligand binding isotherms and nonstandard Michaelis-Menten kinetics, representing a case of the general phenomenon named “cooperativity” (1Monod J.

Thus, the dimeric glutathione reductase fromEscherichia coli shows homotropic catalytic behavior when Gly418, present at the subunit interface, is replaced by Trp (3Scrutton N.S. Deonarain M.P.

Furthermore, trimeric aspartate transcarbamoylase from Bacillus subtilis and ornithine transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli show a homotropic substrate binding behavior upon mutation of Arg99 and Arg106, present at the enzyme active site, to Ala and Gly, respectively (5Stebbins J.W.

This binding mechanism minimizes changes of GSH affinity because of temperature fluctuation. As a whole, GST P1–1 represents the first enzyme displaying a temperature-dependent homotropic regulation of the substrate (e.g. GSH) binding. The wild type GST P1–1 (EC 2.5.1.18) was obtained as previously reported (10Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol.

The amplified DNA fragment was purified from agarose gel and used as a primer in the second polymerase chain reaction in combination with the second 3′ universal primer 5′-TCGAATTCGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC. The amplified DNA was restricted with SphI and subsequently ligated in the expression plasmid pGST-1 to produce the mutant enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out by the chain termination method. The Y49F mutant of GST P1–1 was expressed and purified as previously reported (10Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P.

GST P1–1 steady-state kinetics was carried out at pH 6.5 (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer) and between 5 and 43 °C, by varying GSH concentration from 10.0 μm to 10.0 mm, in the presence of CDNB as the co-substrate. The CDNB concentration (= 1.0 mm), corresponding approximately to that for the enzyme half-saturation, could not be further increased, accounting for the low co-substrate solubility (13Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments were also carried out at pH 5.0 (0.1 m sodium acetate buffer) and between 5 and 35 °C, by varying GSH concentration from 2.0 μm to 1.0 mm, in the presence of NBD-Cl as the co-substrate. The NBD-Cl concentration (= 0.2 mm) can be considered as saturating for the enzyme (14Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Antonini G. Parker M.W. Oakley A.J. Chiessi E. Nuccetelli M. Battistoni A. Bellizia A.

Equilibrium experiments for GSH binding to GST P1–1 were performed at pH 6.5 (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer), between 5 and 43 °C, by following the quenching of the enzyme intrinsic fluorescence, as a function of GSH concentration (ranging between 10 μm and 10 mm), in the absence of any co-substrate (9Ricci G.

The GST P1–1 concentration was 3 μm. Under all the experimental conditions, no GST P1–1 inactivation was observed within the experimental time. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the catalytic activity and the spectroscopic properties of GST P1–1 was completely reversible. Steady-state kinetics, obtained in the presence of a constant concentration of the co-substrate (e.g. CDNB or NBD-Cl) and by varying the GSH concentration, were analyzed in the framework of the minimum overall enzyme reaction scheme (Scheme 1) (15Segel I.H.

Accordingly, values of the Hill coefficient n and of the interaction parameter α for GSH binding to GST P1–1 are close to 1 (see Fig.1, and TablesI and II). However, positive cooperativity for substrate binding to GST P1–1 is observed above 35 °C. Thus, values of the Hill coefficientn and of the interaction parameter α are 1.4 and 0.14, respectively, at 43 °C (see Fig. 1, and Tables I and II). Conversely, negative cooperativity occurs below 25 °C, values of the apparent Hill coefficient n and of the interaction parameter α for GSH binding to GST P1–1 being 0.63 and 5.3, respectively, at 5 °C (see Fig. 1, and Tables I and II). As a whole, data given in Fig. 1 indicate that, at 43 °C, the affinity of GSH for the substrate-free enzyme is lower than that for substrate association to the GSH-monoligated GST P1–1 (e.g. K 1 > αK 1), but on the other hand, K 1 < αK 1, at 5 °C.Table IEffect of temperature on values of the overall parameters K and n for GSH association to GST P1–1GST P1–1Co-substrateParameteraExperiments have been performed in triplicate.

Open table in a new tab The unusual temperature-dependent GST P1–1 properties were observed also in the presence of the co-substrate NBD-Cl, the Hill coefficient n ranging from 0.64, at 5 °C, to 1.2, at 35 °C. Consistently, the value of the interaction parameter α decreases from 5.5, at 5 °C, to 0.42, at 35 °C (see Tables I andII). GSH binding to GST P1–1, as observed by following the quenching of the enzyme intrinsic fluorescence, displays temperature-dependent cooperativity also in the absence of CDNB and NBD-Cl (see Tables I and II). In fact, the value of the Hill coefficient n increases from 0.65, at 5 °C, to 1.3, at 43 °C. In agreement, the value of the interaction parameter α decreases from 5.1, at 5 °C, to 0.15, at 43 °C. On the other hand, no significant cooperativity for substrate binding to GST P1–1 was detected at 25 and 35 °C. Equilibrium data, obtained in the absence of any co-substrate, overlap steady-state results (see Tables I and II), indicating that a true homotropic behavior occurs for GSH binding to GST P1–1. In fact, the reliability of kinetic determinations to account for cooperativity is limited. In this respect, a noncooperative homodimeric enzyme, following the steady-state random mechanism, may yield apparent cooperativity, simulating intersubunit communications (15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 and in Tables I and II, the affinity of GSH for the substrate-free GST P1–1, expressed by K 1, is temperature-dependent with a positive apparent enthalpy value (e.g. ΔH K1 ∼ +50 kJ/mol). However, as a consequence of the temperature-dependent cooperative GSH binding to GST P1–1, the affinity of the substrate for the monoligated-enzyme (e.g. αK 1 =K 2) is almost temperature-independent (see Fig.1, and Tables I and II), the apparent ΔH αK1 (= ΔH K2) approaching zero. As expected, the value of the interaction parameter α decreases from 5.3 at 5 °C, to 0.15 at 43 °C (see Table II), the value of ΔH αbeing about −50 kJ/mol. Tyr49 appears to be a crucial residue for the intersubunit communication in GST P1–1, contacting helices 4 and 5 of the opposite chain (17Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9912-9917Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (see Fig.2). Upon mutation of Tyr49 to Phe, negative cooperativity for GSH binding to the Y49F mutant of GST P1–1 occurs below 43 °C, in the presence of CDNB, as shown for the wild type enzyme below 25 °C (see Fig. 1, and Tables I and II). In fact, values of the Hill coefficient n decrease from 1.0, at 43 °C, to 0.64, at 5 °C (see Table I). In parallel, values of the interaction parameter α increase from 0.92, at 43 °C, to 7.6, at 5 °C (see Table II). As a whole, the affinity of GSH for the substrate-free Y49F enzyme is higher than that for the GSH-monoligated species below 43 °C (e.g. K 1 < αK 1 (see Table II). Point mutation of residues Gly41, Cys47, and Lys54, belonging to helix 2 and forming the G-site (17Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol.

In fact, in the presence and absence of CDNB, the replacement of Cys47 with Ser triggers homotropic behavior, at 25 °C (e.g. n ∼ 1.4 and α ∼ 0.09), as observed in the native enzyme at 43 °C (e.g. n ∼ 1.3 and α ∼ 0.14, at 43 °C) (see Tables I and II). Therefore, the affinity of GSH for the substrate-free C47S enzyme is lower than that for the GSH-monoligated species at 25 °C (e.g. K 1 > αK 1) (see Table II). Here, reported data indicate that GST P1–1 represents the first enzyme displaying a temperature-dependent homotropic regulation of substrate (e.g. GSH) binding to the two G-sites present in the homodimer. In fact, negative cooperativity for GSH binding to GST P1–1 occurs below 25 °C. On the other hand, positive cooperativity is observed above 35 °C (see Fig. 1, and Tables I and II). Temperature has been previously reported to reverse allosteric phenomena in rat liver fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, in phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and in carbamoylphosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli. In fact, when varying the temperature, the AMP, ADP, or IMP action changes from inhibition to activation. Therefore, these enzymes display a temperature-dependent etherotropic regulation for substrate and allosteric ligand binding (19Taketa K. Pogell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Braxton B.L. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Reinhart G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 47-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inspection of the three-dimensional model of GST P1–1 (17Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. Federici G. Parker M.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9912-9917Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2) fulfills a structural interpretation of the homotropic binding behavior of GSH. Structural perturbation occurring at the G-site by GSH binding would be transmitted to the G-site present in the adjacent subunit via helix 4 (residues 90–109), which represents the monomer-monomer interface and contains residues that interact with the active site. A key residue involved in the intersubunit communication may be Tyr49, which contacts, with its aromatic ring, the hydrophobic pocket located between helices 4 and 5 of the adjacent subunit. In particular, in the presence of GSH, the Tyr49 residue forms 14 van der Waals contacts with the adjacent monomer. Next, the hydroxyl group of Tyr49 is hydrogen bonded with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the Met91residue of the opposite subunit. However, in the absence of the substrate, Tyr49 forms only 8 van der Waals contacts and loses some intersubunit interactions. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments of GST P1–1 show that the replacement of Tyr49with Phe induces a perturbation of the homotropic GSH binding behavior (see Fig. 1, and Tables I and II). In fact, the Y49F GST P1–1 mutant exhibits negative cooperativity below 43 °C. Therefore, the mechanism for intersubunit communication still exists in the mutant, but the global effect undergoes a remarkable change. More precisely, it appears that Tyr49 is involved in the positive homotropic interaction which is absent in the Y49F mutant at 43 °C. Conversely, G41A, C47S, and K54A point mutations at 25 °C revert negative cooperativity induced by Tyr49 to Phe substitution (see Fig. 1, and Tables I and II). The positive cooperativity resulting from Gly41, Cys47, and Lys54 point mutations could be explained by the structural perturbation of helix 2 and by the resulting effects being transmitted through residue Tyr49 to the opposite subunit (9Ricci G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9912-9917Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this respect, Cys47 acts as a hinge which limits the extent of frequency of conformational transitions involving helix 2. In its absence, helix 2 would become more flexible (21Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar effect may be obtained by a higher temperature-enhancing motion of this flexible enzyme region. As a whole, GST P1–1 somewhat behaves as a thermodynamic system which obeys the Le Chatelier principle. In fact, whenever a physical or chemical factor forces the G-site to assume a low-affinity conformation for substrate binding, GST P1–1 opposes this perturbation by developing positive cooperativity, thus increasing the GSH affinity for the substrate-monoligated enzyme (e.g. K 1 > αK 1). This scenario is observed in the wild type GST P1–1 above 35 °C as well as in G41A, C47S, and K54A enzyme mutants at 25 °C (9Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W.

On the other hand, negative cooperativity occurs when the G-site is forced toward a high-affinity conformation, e.g. in the wild type enzyme at below 25 °C and in the Y49F GST P1–1 mutant below 43 °C. The physiological advantage of the GSH binding homotropic modulation mechanism becomes evident when considering that GST P1–1 is present in the human skin (e.g. in the upper layers of epidermis) (22Shimizu K. Toriyama F. Yoshida H. Virchows Arch. 1995; 425: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and may suffer very low and high temperatures. Thus, at the human skin GSH concentration (about 1–3 mm) (23Halprin K.M. Ohkawaro A. J. Invest. Derm. 1967; 48: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), GST P1–1 displays an almost unchanged affinity for GSH in a wild range of temperatures (e.g. between 5 and 43 °C; see Fig. 1). This aspect is particularly relevant considering the increased skin cancerogenesis observed in mice lacking Pi class GST, and indicates the crucial role of these enzyme(s) in cancer prevention (24Henderson C.J. Smith A.G. Ure J. Brown K. Bacon E.J. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5275-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Finally, the maintenance of the enzyme-substrate affinity is a well known phenomenon for evolutionary biochemists and, in organisms living at different temperatures, is pursued by the expression of homologous enzymes able to keep unchanged substrate affinity at the average body temperature of each species (25Hochachka P.W. Somero G.N. Biochemical Adaptation. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1984Crossref Google Scholar, 26Somero G.N. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 72-77Google Scholar). In this respect, GST is of particular interest as the conservation of the substrate (e.g. GSH) affinity is recovered in the same enzyme by triggering positive and negative cooperativity, representing a case of molecular adaptation and evolution.

Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Recently, the unstacking and subsequent extrahelical stabilization of a DNA base (“base flipping”) has expanded the examples of enzyme-mediated DNA deformations. Extrahelical base stabilization enables access of the catalytic enzyme groups to inaccessible target DNA residues, providing an elegant mechanism whereby discrimination can be achieved. ForS-adenosyl-l-methioninedependent DNA methyltransferases, base flipping also allows the modification of a large number of DNA sequences without the stereochemical constraint of cofactor-DNA interactions. X-ray crystal structures reveal that the C5cytosine-specific type II bacterial DNA methyltransferasesHaeIII DNA cytosine methyltransferase and HhaI DNA cytosine methyltransferase stabilize an extrahelical base without significantly bending DNA (2Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 3Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Similarly, uracil DNA glycosylase stabilizes an extrahelical uracil without further distortion of the DNA configuration (4Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In contrast, T4 endonuclease V recognizes thymine dimers, flips an adenine opposite to the lesion, and also bends the DNA by 60° (5Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Functional studies of theN 6-adenine EcoRI DNA methyltransferase (M.EcoRI)1 and the related EcoRV DNA adenine methyltransferase show that these adenine-specific base flipping enzymes also bend DNA (6Garcia R. Bustamante C. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Cal S. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1008-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The enzyme-DNA cocrystal structures provide compelling evidence for the stabilization of distorted DNA conformations; yet, surprisingly little is known concerning the coordination between sequence-specific DNA base recognition and flipping. Determining the temporal coordination between the binding of the enzyme to the DNA and the distortion of the DNA conformation is clearly required to elucidate the functional consequences. A severe limitation in our understanding of these processes derives from the fact that both structural and steady-state kinetic studies overlook any conformational intermediates. We report the identification and functional characterization of a bending-deficient M.EcoRI mutant (H235N M.EcoRI). Relatively minor functional consequences were revealed for H235N M.EcoRI at the level of the steady-state kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. In contrast, transient kinetic methods revealed a change in the rate-limiting step in the reaction that resulted in a profound enhancement in the discrimination against methylation at nontarget sequence DNA. Our data show that DNA bending may establish specificity by correctly assembling the enzyme-DNA complex to induce base flipping and thereby enhance catalysis. WT M.EcoRI and H235N M.EcoRI were purified as described previously (8Green P.J. Heyneker H.L. Bolivar F. Rodriquez R.L. Betlach M.C. Covarrubias A.A. Backman K. Russel D.J. Tait R. Boyer H.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and pKM(H235N) grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Enzyme expression was induced at early log phase (A 600 = 0.4) by the addition of isopropyl thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. pKM(H235N) was created by site-directed mutagenesis utilizing the method of Kunkle (10Kunkle T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Single-stranded uracil containing DNA served as template for in vitro second strand synthesis with the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GTCTTTATTAGGCATAAAGACTTGCC-3′. This oligonucleotide was used to convert codon 235 from histidine (CAU) to asparagine (AAU). Following plaque isolation and subcloning, the entire gene was sequenced on both strands to confirm that no undesired codon changes were present. Concentrations of the purified WT M.EcoRI (107 μm) and H235N M.EcoRI (15.8 μm) were determined spectrophotometrically utilizing the published extinction coefficient (11Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7265-7272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of the histidine to asparagine substitution at the protein level, H235N M.EcoRI was digested with chymotrypsin followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI/MS) analysis (12Everett E.A. Falick A.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wong D. Pavlovich J. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ESI/MS was performed on a VG Platform II (Fisons Instrument) mass spectrometer. The N2 nebulizing gas was maintained at 100 psi, with a 5.0 liter/min flow rate. TLCK-treated α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) (5% w/w of protein) was used to digest WT M.EcoRI and H235N M.EcoRI. Digestions were performed in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) buffer for 4 h and terminated by heating the samples at 100 °C for 5 min. The digested protein samples (∼100 pmol) were separated on a 1.0 × 150-mm 300 Å RP-C18 column (Michrom BioResources, Inc.) utilizing a flow rate of 50 μl/min with a linear gradient (0–50% acetonitrile) in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted peptides were detected by ESI/MS in positive ionization mode over the mass range m/z 300–1600, and the source temperature was maintained at 160 °C. The results of the ESI/MS analysis are summarized in Table I.Table IElectrospray ionization mass spectrometric verification of histidine replacement by asparagine at position 235 in H235N M.EcoRICT peptideTheoretical massObserved massDaWT M.EcoRI1686.981687.15 ± 0.98H235N M.EcoRI1662.961662.20 ± 0.98WT and H235N M.EcoRI were digested with TLCK-treated α-chymotrypsin followed by ESI/MS analysis.

The following peptides IRHKDLPLTRKYF and IRNKDLPLTRKYF (position 235 shown in bold) were generated from the chymotrypsin digestion (partial digests) of WT and H235N M.EcoRI, respectively.

Standard phosphoramidites and ancillary DNA synthesis reagents were obtained from Millipore/ Biosearch. 2-Aminopurine andN 6-methyladenosine phosphoramidites were purchased from Glenn Research and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Oligonucleotides were prepared on a Cyclone 8400 Plus DNA synthesizer (Milligen/Biosearch, Burlington, MA) using β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. DNA purity was assessed by 32P radiolabeling and visualized by autoradiography following 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. The following oligonucleotides (14-mers) were used and contained a centrally located EcoRI site: top strand, oligonucleotide 1, 5′-GGCGGAATTCGCGG-3′, and oligonucleotide 2, 5′-GGCGGAXTTCGCGG-3′; bottom strand, oligonucleotide 3, 5′-CCGCGAATTCCGCC-3′, and oligonucleotide 4, 5′-CCGCGAATTCCGCC-3′ (X represents 2-aminopurine, and A representsN 6-methyladenosine). Oligonucleotides 1 and 3, 1 and 4, and 2 and 4 were annealed to form unmodified, hemimethylated, and 2AP-substituted hemimethylated 14-base pair DNA duplexes, respectively. All thermodynamic binding, steady-state, and stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed with the cofactor analog sinefungin, and the catalytic cycle is limited to events leading to the chemistry step. Gel mobility shift assays were performed to determine KDDNA as described (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding solutions contained 100 mm Tris, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 μm sinefungin, 50 pm32P-labeled oligonucleotide, and varied enzyme concentration. All preincubations were done at 20 ± 2 °C for 30 min prior to loading the binding reactions onto a prerunning 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel followed by electrophoresis at 4 °C for 1 h at 200 V. Electrophoresis at 4 °C was shown to be very important for the stabilization of the H235N M.EcoRI-DNA complexes during electrophoresis to minimize complex dissociation (data not shown). The AdoMet-dependent quenching of protein tryptophan fluorescence was used to determine KDAdoMet (15Maegley K.A. Gonzalez Jr., L. Smith D.W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18527-18532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme-DNA complexes were observed by SFM with a Nanoscope III (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) in tapping mode using Digital Instruments n+silicon tapping mode probes at a resonance frequency of 300–400 kHz (6Garcia R. Bustamante C. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Bustamante C. Vesenka J. Tang C.L. Rees W. Guthold M. Keller R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A 300-base pair DNA substrate containing a centrally locatedEcoRI site was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of plasmid pGEM-3. Complexes were prepared in a buffer containing 3 nm DNA, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 10 μm sinefungin, and 50–100 nm mutant enzyme. Enzyme-DNA complexes were analyzed using the Nanoscope III software. Images were enlarged, two tangential lines were drawn along the center of the protruding DNA arms on both sides of the protein, and the bend angles were measured. The bend angle reported (0 ± 26°) was calculated from the measurement of 130 complexes. Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of hemimethylated DNA containing 2AP substituted at the target base were recorded and used to monitor the unstacking of the target base within the WT M.EcoRI and H235N M.EcoRI complexes as described (9Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, excitation was at 310 nm, and fluorescence emission was scanned from 330 to 430 nm. The titration of the fluorescence emission intensity at λmax (a blue shift from ∼370 to 360 nm is observed for both enzymes) was plotted versus enzyme concentration. The stopped-flow unit and fluorescence detection system utilized for these stopped-flow studies have been described in detail elsewhere (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Excitation was at 310 nm, and the fluorescence emission was collected through a 360-nm cut-on filter (Hoya Optics type L36). 2× solutions of enzyme (diluted into a degassed buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT at pH 7.5), double-stranded duplex DNA (diluted to 800 nm), and buffer alone each were loaded into three separate syringes. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes (100 μl) of enzyme and DNA solutions. Multiple runs were summed to increase the signal to noise ratio. Background measurements were made by measuring the fluorescence emission of “preshot” controls that included buffer or duplex 2AP-containing DNA alone prior to mixing together the enzyme and DNA solutions in the stopped-flow. Steady- and presteady-state kinetic parameters were determined using a filter binding assay as described previously (17Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incorporation of [3H]-methyl groups into DNA under “standard” andEcoRI “star” reaction conditions were used to evaluate the discrimination against the methylation of nontarget sequences by WT and H235N M.EcoRI. Standard reaction conditions included 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mm DTT, 3.0 nm DNA, 3.2 nm enzyme, and 1.68 μm[3H]AdoMet. EcoRI star conditions were similar except that the solutions contained 152 nm enzyme and included 20% glycerol (19Smith D.W. Crowder S.W. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies assessed with the filter-binding assay of the two proteins at 5 μm3H AdoMet showed no significant differences from the results obtained at 1.68 μm [3H]AdoMet (data not shown). The DNA substrate, plasmid pBluescriptSK (+) II, was digested with HaeIII endonuclease to generate the fragments shown in Fig. 6. Following incubation of the enzyme and DNA, the restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis and detected by fluorography as described (19Smith D.W. Crowder S.W. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein chemical modification data showed that incubation of M.EcoRI with the histidine-specific reagent diethylpyrocarbonate resulted in time-dependent enzyme inactivation. This inactivation occurred over 10-fold more slowly in the presence of DNA, strongly indicating that a histidine might be involved in DNA binding. 2N. O. Reich, unpublished data. Histidine 235 lies within a conserved motif common to the type II bacterial DNA methyltransferases (motif VIII) (20Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). An analysis of the adenine-specific TaqI DNA adenine methyltransferase-AdoMet cocrystal structure showed that the homologous peptide region forms a surface loop within the putative DNA binding cleft of the enzyme (21Labahn J. Granzin J. Schluckebier G. Robinson D.P. Jack W.E. Schildkraut I. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Further structure-guided analysis of the HhaI DNA cytosine methyltransferase-DNA cocrystal complex revealed that motif VIII directly interacts with the extrahelical cytosine and the phosphate group 5′ to the target leading to the movement of the target base into and correct assembly of the enzyme active site (2Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Given its plausible importance, histidine 235 was replaced with asparagine by site-directed mutagenesis removing the acid-base and hydrogen bonding properties of the histidine imidazole with the retention of some of the steric characteristics. The H235N mutant enzyme was expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity, and the asparagine substitution was confirmed at the protein level by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (TableI). Steady-state kinetic parameters for WT and H235N M.EcoRI were determined, and the results are summarized in TableII. These data reveal thatk cat for H235N M.EcoRI was reduced 30% and that the KmDNA was increased approximately 10-fold. The specificity constant (k cat/ KmDNA) for the modification of the target site was decreased approximately 14-fold for H235N M.EcoRI due predominantly to the changes in the KmDNA. In addition, H235N M.EcoRI showed a 5-fold increase inKm AdoMet, indicating a slightly decreased affinity of the enzyme for its cofactor.Table IISteady-state kinetic and thermodynamic parameters determined for WT and H235N M.EcoRIParameterWT M.EcoRIH235N M.EcoRIk cat(s−1)0.11 (0.006)aFrom Ref. 17.0.076 (0.009)K DDNA(nm)28 (7)274 (56)k cat/K m(m−1s−1)4 × 1063 × 105K mAdoMet(μm)0.27 (.06)1.98 (0.27)K DAdoMet(μm)10 (2.0)47 (12.0)K DDNA(specific)(nm)1.08 (0.1)bFrom Ref. 14.10.56 (1.7)K DDNA(2AP)(nm)0.51 (0.1)bFrom Ref. 14.1.6 (.4)K DDNA(abasic)(nm)0.29 (0.1)bFrom Ref. 14.3.13 (0.6)K DDNA(2,6-diAP)(nm)12.8 (5.4)bFrom Ref. 14.No shiftAll steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using a double-stranded 14-base pair oligonucleotide as the substrate.

Open table in a new tab All steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using a double-stranded 14-base pair oligonucleotide as the substrate. The numbers in parentheses are standard errors. All measurements are the result of at least duplicate determinations. Two methods were used to evaluate equilibrium base flipping by the H235N mutant. Equilibrium dissociation constants ( KDDNA) were determined by gel mobility shift assays for WT and H235N M.EcoRI binding to a 14-base pair DNA duplex containing a centrally located hemimethylatedEcoRI recognition site (Fig.2). These binding data revealed that the bending-deficient mutant bound the DNA substrate 10-fold weaker than WT M.EcoRI (Table II). In addition to unmodified DNA, equilibrium dissociation constants were also determined for the binding of H235N M.EcoRI to DNA containing base analogs or an abasic site incorporated at the target base. As shown in Table II, tighter binding to DNA containing destabilized target base pairs was observed for H235N M.EcoRI. In contrast, no stable enzyme-DNA complexes could be detected by gel shift assay when the target base was substituted with 2,6-diaminopurine, an analog that increases the number of H bonds at the target base. In addition, spectroscopic experiments were performed to assess the extrahelical stabilization of the target adenine. 2AP is a highly fluorescent adenine isomer that is an extremely sensitive spectroscopic probe for base flipping by M.EcoRI (9Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission intensity of 2AP is highly quenched within double-stranded DNA relative to the nucleoside, due predominantly to intrastrand base stacking interactions (22Ward D.C. Reich W. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the titration of DNA substituted with 2AP at the target base with saturating H235N M.EcoRI, a large increase in the fluorescence intensity and a 10 nm blue shift in the emission λmax were observed for both enzymes (Fig.3). This significant increase in the 2AP fluorescence emission is consistent with an unstacking of the target base within the enzyme-DNA complexes. The quantum yield of the H235N M.EcoRI bound 2AP-substituted duplex was approximately ∼30% greater than that observed for the WT enzyme-DNA complex. DNA bending was visualized directly by SFM of enzyme-DNA complexes. This method can be used to calculate the statistical distribution of bend angles determined for a population of enzyme-DNA complexes (16Bustamante C. Vesenka J. Tang C.L. Rees W. Guthold M. Keller R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). For WT M.EcoRI this SFM-based method reveals a bend angle (52°) identical to that of the more commonly used gel retardation analysis (6Garcia R. Bustamante C. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows representative H235N M.EcoRI-DNA complexes (inset) and a histogram derived from direct measurement of the bend angle for 130 enzyme-DNA complexes. The calculated bend angle (0 ± 26°) was similar to that of unliganded double-stranded DNA determined under identical conditions by this method (6Garcia R. Bustamante C. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The histogram in Fig. 4clearly shows DNA bending was drastically altered for H235N M.EcoRI and that unbent enzyme-DNA complexes were highly represented. For WT M.EcoRI the methylation of DNA sites related by a single base pair substitution (e.g. 5′-AAATTC-3′) occurs up to 20,000-fold more poorly than the target site (23Reich N.O. Olsen C. Osti F. Murphy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15802-15807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, nontarget site methylation is greatly enhanced in the presence of solutes such as glycerol (19Smith D.W. Crowder S.W. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Standard reaction conditions containing a relatively low enzyme concentration (3.2 nm) led solely to the detectable modification of the DNA restriction fragment containing the EcoRI site by both enzymes (Fig.5, 30 min lanes). However, at higher enzyme concentration (152 nm) in the presence of 20% glycerol, significant and time-dependent methylation of nontarget sites by WT M.EcoRI was observed (Fig. 5,WT, 10, 40, and 100 min lanes). Under identical reaction conditions H235N M.EcoRI incorporated significantly fewer methyl groups at nontarget sequence DNA (Fig. 5, H235N, 10,40, and 100 min lanes). Moreover, minimal methylation was detected when a 10-fold higher H235N M.EcoRI concentration and 10-fold longer incubation was utilized (Fig. 5,H235N, 1000 min lane). The inability of the mutant enzyme to significantly methylate nontarget sites was not due to gross differences in the enzyme thermal stability under these reaction conditions (data not shown). Under conditions of high enzyme concentration and excess DNA, WT M.EcoRI shows a presteady-state “burst” of product formation corresponding to k methylation(∼20–40 s−1) (18Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This rapid burst phase is followed by a slower product release step that is rate-limiting for turnover (17Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Manual presteady-state burst experiments were performed for both enzymes. As anticipated WT M.EcoRI showed a burst of product formation that was followed by a slower steady-state rate of product accumulation (Fig. 6). In direct contrast, H235N M.EcoRI showed no burst, indicating that the chemistry step or a prior event was rate-limiting for methylation by the mutant. These rapid quench experiments clearly indicate a change in the rate-limiting catalytic step for the bending-deficient mutant. Comparison of k cat for H235N M.EcoRI (Fig. 6 and Table III) withk methylation for WT M.EcoRI (18Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shows that the replacement of histidine 235 with asparagine decreased the apparent methylation rate constant by several orders of magnitude.Table IIIBase flipping kinetic parameters for H235N M.EcoRI[Protein]AmplitudeRateAmplitudeRateμm%s −1%s −10.3460.56540.0910.6340.19660.0350.9250.22760.045 Open table in a new tab For WT M.EcoRI base flipping is followed by the very fast methylation of the extrahelical base (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore under presteady-state conditions the precatalytic isomerization of the enzyme-DNA complex controls the rate of product formation. Hence, the lack of a burst for the mutant might not reflect a perturbation in methyl transfer to the extrahelical base per se but rather may reflect a slower transition of the target base to the enzyme active site. To directly determine whether the lack of burst kinetics was due to a perturbation of the chemistry step or a prior event, real time measurements of the base flipping transition were made. Stopped-flow fluorescence data obtained with 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 μmH235N M.EcoRI and 400 nm 2AP-substituted hemimethylated are shown in Fig. 7. The fractional amplitudes and rate constants for these stopped-flow fluorescence measurements are summarized in Table III. For direct comparison purposes, Fig. 7 (inset) shows stopped-flow data obtained during the first 0.5 s of the experiment for both WT and H235N M.EcoRI. Under similar reaction conditions, H235N M.EcoRI is clearly impaired in its ability to unstack the target base relative to the WT enzyme. These experiments showed that base flipping was extremely hindered for the bending-deficient mutant and slowed to the k cat level. Conformational changes in enzymes and substrates during catalysis are extremely difficult to characterize mechanistically. The interconversion and processing of the transient enzyme-substrate conformations can be extremely important for catalysis and form a critical part of many theories of how enzymes function (24Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, CA1985Google Scholar, 25Hackney D.D. The Enzymes. 19. Academic Press, San Diego, CA 921011990: 1-36Google Scholar). Inevitably, a complete understanding of enzyme specificity must include, in addition to a description of the chemical and kinetic mechanisms, a dissection of the conformational mechanism. The study of a conformational mechanism is difficult because the transitions between intermediates often occur extremely rapidly, and no obligate changes in chemical structure are involved. An additional challenge is the identification of the specific amino acids that are critical for the initiation and subsequent stabilization of the precatalytic conformational changes. DNA methyltransferases represent a true paradigm for large scale conformational changes induced upon formation of an enzyme-substrate complex: many of these enzymes require both significant DNA bending and base flipping prior to methyl group transfer. We initiated our studies based upon protein chemical modification data that showed a histidine residue to be important for DNA binding by M.EcoRI. Structure-guided sequence analyses of the type II DNA methyltransferases (20Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) suggested that motif VIII is involved in DNA binding. Histidine 235 lies within this conserved motif and was replaced by asparagine. Preliminary functional analysis of the H235N mutant revealed only small changes at the level of the steady-state kinetic parameters (Table II), implicating only minor perturbations in substrate binding and catalysis. However, in direct contrast to the WT enzyme, SFM analysis of DNA bending showed that H235N M.EcoRI enzyme-DNA complexes were indistinguishable from uncomplexed DNA, demonstrating a drastic difference in DNA bending (Fig. 5). DNA bending is frequently suggested to provide specificity (1Steitz T.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 16Bustamante C. Vesenka J. Tang C.L. Rees W. Guthold M. Keller R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar,26Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 27Winkler F.K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 2: 79-83Google Scholar, 28Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the bending-deficient mutant showed only a 10-fold weaker binding to its target sequence DNA (Table II). Based upon the frequently suggested importance of DNA bending to enzyme specificity, a much larger impact upon the KDDNA might have been anticipated. The overall equilibrium dissociation constant for proteins that must induce a change in DNA structure ultimately reflects the binding energy obtained in the distorted complex and the investment of binding free energy required to induce the conformational change. Hence, the relatively small difference in DNA binding free energy between WT and H235N M.EcoRI (ΔΔG° = +1.4 kcal mol−1) strongly implies that the energy “cost” to bend the DNA is essentially the same as the binding energy realized in the enzyme-bent DNA complex. To determine whether the lack of DNA bending by the mutant affected the ability of the enzyme to stabilize an extrahelical base, functional analyses of base flipping were performed. KDDNA measurements were determined for the binding of H235N M.EcoRI to DNA containing an abasic site or functionally modified purine bases. Tighter binding to oligonucleotides that destabilized the target base pair was detected (Table II). Similar binding trends have been observed for other DNA methyltransferases (7Cal S. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1008-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and for WT M.EcoRI (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and our results are consistent with a base flipping mechanism for H235N M.EcoRI. Additional support for this interpretation was obtained from the large increase in the fluorescence emission intensity detected following the binding of H235N M.EcoRI to DNA containing 2AP substituted at the target base (Fig. 4) (9Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the mutant enzyme-DNA complex was ∼30% greater than for the wild type, and no significant differences in the emission λmax were observed. This difference in steady-state emission might reflect a difference in the molecular environment surrounding the 2AP probe or may be of thermodynamic origin, and additional experiments are required to distinguish between these possibilities. The ability of the bending-deficient mutant to bind the DNA, stabilize the extrahelical base, and methylate target sequence DNA without any serious functional impairment in thermodynamic and steady-state kinetic parameters left obscure the consequences of DNA bending. We sought to probe additional effects of the amino acid substitution at the level of substrate discrimination. Under standard conditions, the wild type enzyme is able to discriminate up to 20,000-fold against related DNA sequences (e.g. AAATTC) (23Reich N.O. Olsen C. Osti F. Murphy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15802-15807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorography data in Fig.6 clearly shows that the mutant is dramatically decreased in its ability to methylate such closely related DNA sequences. Although H235N M.EcoRI readily modified the restriction fragment harboring the target (5′-GAATTC-3′) site, little nontarget DNA was methylated even after extended incubation in the presence of higher enzyme concentrations of enzyme (Fig. 5). The significant reduction in nontarget sequence modification was accompanied by a minor decrease in the specificity constant (k cat/K m) for target site methylation (Table II). In sum, H235N M.EcoRI methylated target DNA less efficiently but showed a much greater qualitative discrimination against the methylation at nontarget DNA and therefore greater overall specificity. The mechanism for this enhanced discrimination must derive from alterations in kinetic steps that are not revealed at the equilibrium binding or steady-state k cat level. For M.EcoRI, turnover is limited by a step subsequent to methyl group transfer (i.e. product release), and a large decrease upon the chemistry step could be completely obscured by steady-state kinetic data in isolation. To determine whether an impact upon the chemistry step had resulted from the asparagine substitution, the presteady-state rate of product accumulation was investigated by rapid quench methods (Fig. 6). Unlike the burst of product formation detected for WT M.EcoRI, no presteady-state burst kinetics were observed for H235N M.EcoRI. This lack of a burst showed that the chemistry step itself (k methylation) or a prior event, became rate-limiting for turnover. The single amino acid substitution that decreased the ability of H235N M.EcoRI to stabilize the bent DNA intermediate apparently also resulted in an enzyme-DNA interface that was not correctly or productively assembled for rapid catalysis. However, for WT M.EcoRI base flipping (or a prior step) is rate-limiting for the methylation reaction at target sequence DNA (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hence, the apparent decrease ink methylation may instead derive from a slower transition of the target base to the enzyme active site and not by a perturbation at the level of the chemistry step. Having identified that the mutant enzyme showed a change in the rate-limiting step we sought to mechanistically distinguish between a direct impact upon the methyl transfer step from an impact upon a precatalytic conformational change. Stopped-flow fluorescence measurements enabled real time observation of the base flipping transition (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These stopped-flow measurements clearly showed much slower 2AP total intensity time courses for H235N M.EcoRI compared with the wild type enzyme (see inset to Fig. 7) and conclusively demonstrate that the lack of DNA bending strongly decreases the rate of base flipping. Most interestingly, the observed rate constants for the slow 2AP fluorescence enhancement phase were nearly identical to k cat determined for H235N M.EcoRI under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 6) (TableIII). Thus, although no direct comparison ofk methylation for WT and H235N M.EcoRI is provided here, the lack of a presteady-state burst is understandable in the context of the slower flipping kinetics, which are the direct result of the inability of this mutant to bend the DNA. That slowing the rate of an obligate precatalytic isomerization can enhance enzyme discrimination is consistent with classic theoretical predictions. As described by Ninio (30Ninio J. Biochimie (Paris). 1975; 57: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), either causing “incorrect” substrates to dissociate faster from the E-S complex or slowing down the conversion of the E-S complex to the E-P complex can enhance enzyme discrimination. For M.EcoRI the precatalytic base flipping transition is the dominant selection barrier because it leads to a highly committed methyl transfer step. Slowing the conversion of the E-S complex to the activated intermediate (E-S′) effectively provides greater discrimination by allowing more frequent dissociation of the enzyme from the substrate. For the bending-deficient mutant the transition to the activated intermediate is rate-limiting at target sequence DNA, although the overall k cat is only slightly lower than that observed with WT M.EcoRI. Further mechanistic insight into the recognition process can be gained by the elucidation of the temporal coupling between the distinct conformational intermediates. For example, does DNA bending facilitate base flipping or is DNA bending a mechanism whereby helical stability can be restored following the unstacking of a DNA base? Direct measurement of the temporal coupling between DNA binding and target base flipping by WT M.EcoRI shows that these processes occur in near synchrony with only a 4 ms delay between binding and flipping (33Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5308-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hence, DNA bending must also occur simultaneously with the formation of the enzyme-DNA complex. Although the lack of detectable DNA bending does not preclude H235N M.EcoRI from base flipping, the activation energy required to induce base unstacking apparently is significantly larger in the absence of concomitant DNA bending. If H235N M.EcoRI is a more discriminating enzyme than the WT M.EcoRI, then why was this single amino acid substitution mutant not selected during the course of evolution? M.EcoRI is part of a bacterial type II restriction modification system, and the companion EcoRI endonuclease cleaves the identical (5′-GAATTC-3′) DNA sequence devoid of methylation. Endonuclease cleavage of nontarget DNA, although rare, is extremely harmful to the host cell. Hence, a more discriminating methyltransferase might leave nontarget sequence DNA exposed to potential cleavage. The selective pressure to protect all EcoRI sites against endonuclease cleavage in vivo requires an extremely efficient methyltransferase, whereas the need to modify some closely related sequence DNA at a decreased but significant level provides an additional level of selection. In sum, these selective pressures have probably both contributed to the evolution of this enzyme."

Rodriguez M.A. Walsh M. Vu H. Sniderman A.D. Clin. Investig. Med. 1988; 11: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). HyperapoB is a familial lipoprotein disorder characterized by increased plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) because of overproduction of hepatic apoB-100 lipoprotein particles (2Teng B. Thompson G.R. Sniderman A.D. Forte T.M. Krauss R.M. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6662-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Teng B. Sniderman A.D.

Additional studies have indicated that HyperapoB patients also have elevated plasma free fatty acid levels and delayed triglyceride clearance after an oral fat load (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H.

The molecular basis of HyperapoB has not been fully elucidated. Adipocytes and skin fibroblasts from a subset of patients with HyperapoB are impaired in their capacity to synthesize triglycerides (7Teng B. Forse A. Rodriquez M.A. Sniderman A.D. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1988; 66: 239-242Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it has been hypothesized that reduced triglyceride synthesis results in a metabolic disruption of the adipocyte-hepatocyte free fatty acid axis (8Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: S27-S33PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Frayn K.

Soc. 1997; 56: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This disruption will then produce a reduced rate of free fatty acid uptake by adipocytes with an enhanced delivery of free fatty acids and partially triglyceride-depleted chylomicron remnants to the liver. This would in turn cause an increased production of B-100-containing lipoprotein particles, yielding the HyperapoB phenotype.A protein was subsequently partially purified that stimulated triglyceride synthesis in both fibroblasts and adipocytes in vitro and was called ASP (11Cianflone K.M. Sniderman A.D. Walsh M.J. Vu H.T. Gagnon J. Rodriguez M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies suggested that the impairment in triglyceride synthesis in cells from HyperapoB patients was because of a difference in response to ASP (12Cianflone K.M. Maslowska M.H. Sniderman A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which was later suggested to be caused by a decrease in the ASP cell-surface receptor concentration (13Zhang X.J. Cianflone K. Genest J. Sniderman A.D. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 28: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On further purification and characterization, ASP was found to be identical to C3ades-Arg (14Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St-Luce S. Avramoglu R.K. Maslowska M. Hoang B. Monge J.C. Bell A. Mulay S.

This finding, together with the knowledge that adipocytes secrete proteins of the alternative pathway of complement (C3, Factor B and Factor D/adipsin) (16Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Obes. Res. 1996; 4: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), led to the proposal of an adipsin-ASP pathway as a means to generate C3ades-Arg by adipocytes (10Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K.

Cianflone K. Summers L. Fielding B. Frayn K. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1997; 56: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The recent generation of complement C3 “knock-out” mice (21Circolo A.

Immunopharmacology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) has provided an excellent opportunity to test the validity of this hypothesis in vivo. Because the complement protein C3 is the precursor of C3ades-Arg, which is identical to ASP, these mice will be totally deficient in ASP and would be predicted to exhibit phenotypic characteristics of hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. We present here data examining these mice as a possible murine model of this disease.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs discussed in the Introduction, impaired ASP function has been proposed as a cause of HyperapoB (24Sniderman A.D. Brown B.G. Stewart F.F. Cianflone K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 137-142Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HyperapoB is characterized phenotypically by elevated levels of plasma LDL because of overproduction of hepatic apoB-100 lipoprotein particles (2Teng B. Thompson G.R. Sniderman A.D. Forte T.M. Krauss R.M. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6662-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Teng B. Sniderman A.D. Soutar A.K. Thompson G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also indicated that HyperapoB patients have a delayed triglyceride clearance after an oral fat load as well as elevated free fatty acid levels (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that defective ASP causes HyperapoB, 6–12-week-old ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice were examined for plasma lipid and lipoprotein phenotypes characteristic of HyperapoB patients. ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice and wild-type littermates were fasted for 4–6 h and bled through the tail vein, and total plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations were determined. The results are shown in TableI. The average triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations in the plasma of ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient male mice were 61.3 ± 23.2 mg/dl, 76.3 ± 24.3 mg/dl, and 0.76 ± 0.2 mm, respectively. These concentrations were not significantly different from the plasma concentrations determined in the wild-type male mice (triglycerides, 58.9 ± 24.6 mg/dl; cholesterol, 75.6 ± 20.3 mg/dl; free fatty acids, 0.79 ± 0.2 mm). Similarly, female mice, whether wild-type or ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient, had similar fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations (Table I).Table IPlasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations in ASP-sufficient (+/+) and ASP-deficient (−/−) miceMaleFemaleASP (−/−)ASP (+/+)ASP (−/−)ASP (+/+)Triglycerides (mg/dl)61.3 ± 23.2 (31)58.9 ± 24.6 (27)61.3 ± 20.7 (22)63.1 ± 33.6 (18)Cholesterol (mg/dl)76.3 ± 24.3 (27)75.6 ± 20.3 (18)76.2 ± 28.7 (18)71.5 ± 17.0 (12)Free fatty acids (mm)0.76 ± 0.2 (11)0.79 ± 0.2 (14)0.77 ± 0.2 (13)0.85 ± 0.2 (12)Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. The number of mice studied is given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab To determine if the absence of ASP resulted in any change in the plasma lipoproteins, the plasma samples from fasted wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice were fractionated by FPLC using two serially connected Superose-6 columns. Fractions of 0.5-ml were collected, and protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were determined for each fraction. Shown in Fig.1 are the FPLC profiles obtained from plasma samples of 9 wild-type and 9 ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient male mice. The FPLC analysis indicated that the very low density lipoprotein, LDL, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different in ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type male mice (Fig. 1). This study was repeated using female mice. As with the male mice, no significant difference was observed in the very low density lipoprotein, LDL, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations of the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type female mice (data not shown). Collectively, the data in Table I and the FPLC profiles (Fig.1) demonstrate that the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in fasting mice are not affected by the absence of ASP.Because no differences in fasting levels of plasma lipids and lipoproteins were detected in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type animals, experiments were performed to determine if ASP deficiency alters plasma lipid concentrations following an oral fat load, as persistent postfat load hypertriglyceridemia has been documented in HyperapoB patients (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was performed by orally administering 0.4 ml of olive oil to fasted wild-type (10 males, 9 females) and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice (11 males, 10 females). Blood samples (0.04 ml) were then collected at 1-h intervals, and free fatty acid and triglyceride plasma concentrations were determined at each time point. The results from this study are shown in Fig. 2. There was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of free fatty acids or triglycerides in the 6 h following the olive oil gavage in ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type mice. Triglyceride concentrations in all animals increased 2–3-fold up to 2 h following the oral fat load. Within 6 h after the olive oil gavage, the plasma triglyceride concentrations returned to fasting levels in both wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice. There was a trend toward faster triglyceride clearance in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient male mice, although the difference was not significant (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that, in addition to the similar fasting lipid concentrations, ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice do not have significantly altered levels of plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids following an oral fat load.Figure 2Kinetic measurements of free fatty acids and triglycerides in ASP ( C3ades-Arg )-deficient and wild-type littermates following an oral fat load. Concentrations of free fatty acids and triglycerides were measured in male (A and C) and female (B and D) wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice subjected to an oral gavage of olive oil (400 μl). Closed circles depict the values determined from wild-type mice (10 males, 9 females), and open circlescorrespond to the concentrations determined from the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice (11 males, 10 females). The results are presented as mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As discussed, it has been postulated that a defective ASP response causes an enhanced production of hepatic apoB-100-containing lipoprotein particles, the metabolic hallmark of HyperapoB. Mice produce two forms of hepatic apoB, apoB-48, and apoB-100 (25Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J.

If defective ASP function does cause increased production of hepatic apoB lipoproteins, then the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice would be expected to have elevated levels of plasma apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100. To test this possibility, quantitative Western blot analysis was performed on total plasma samples from fasted ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type mice using a previously characterized sheep anti-rat apoB antibody (23Liao W.

The results of the Western blot experiment from male and female wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient littermates are shown at the top of Fig. 3. Densitometric measurements, normalized to an albumin standard, were determined and illustrated as bar graphs at the bottom of Fig. 3. It is clear by Western blot analysis there was no significant difference in the levels of apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100 in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type littermates.Figure 3Western blot analysis of apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100 from plasma of ASP ( C3ades-Arg )-deficient and wild-type littermates.

However, the in vivo data obtained in the current investigation, using a mouse model deficient in ASP, indicate that the possible role of impaired ASP function as a cause of HyperapoB needs to be reexamined. If impaired ASP function is a primary cause of hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, then it is difficult to explain why no significant phenotypic differences characteristic of HyperapoB are observed in the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice compared with normal littermates. If indeed ASP dysfunction does cause increased production of hepatic apoB lipoproteins, it is surprising that at least some elevation of apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100 was not observed in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient animals. In addition, plasma lipid clearance was not impaired in ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice as observed in HyperapoB patients (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although ASP function has been found to be similar in mouse and human cells (20Murray I. Parker R.A. Kirchgessner T.G. Tran J. Zhang Z.J. Westerlund J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that mice may not be an ideal model system for these in vivo studies. However, our observations are consistent with other observations in humans. For example, several unrelated human families have been discovered with complete complement protein C3 deficiency (28Singer L. Colten H.R. Wetsel R.A. Pathobiology. 1994; 62: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); these C3-deficient individuals do not appear to display an increased predisposition to hyperlipidemia or to coronary artery disease. Moreover, a recent study indicates that elevated serum C3 levels are associated with an increased prevalence of myocardial infarction (29Muscari A. Bozzoli C. Puddu G.M. Sangiorgi Z. Dormi A. Rovinetti C. Descovich G.C. Puddu P. Am. J. Med. 1995; 98: 357-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This is the opposite of the expected effect of C3, the obligate ASP precursor, if functionally impaired ASP causes HyperapoB, which predisposes individuals to myocardial infarction. In conclusion, our observations indicate that ASP deficiency does not cause HyperapoB in mice and that the role of ASP in HyperapoB in humans needs to be reevaluated. The acylation stimulating protein (ASP)1 is a 76-amino acid serum protein that was initially discovered in the course of studies to determine the metabolic defect in patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (HyperapoB) (1Cianflone K. Rodriguez M.A. Walsh M. Vu H. Sniderman A.D. Clin. Investig. Med. 1988; 11: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). HyperapoB is a familial lipoprotein disorder characterized by increased plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) because of overproduction of hepatic apoB-100 lipoprotein particles (2Teng B. Thompson G.R. Sniderman A.D. Forte T.M. Krauss R.M. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6662-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Teng B. Sniderman A.D. Soutar A.K. Thompson G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and is associated with an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease (4Sniderman A. Shapiro S. Marpole D. Skinner B. Teng B. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Additional studies have indicated that HyperapoB patients also have elevated plasma free fatty acid levels and delayed triglyceride clearance after an oral fat load (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HyperapoB syndrome is a major presentation of familial combined hyperlipidemia, an autosomal dominant disorder that constitutes the most common form of genetic hyperlipidemia. The molecular basis of HyperapoB has not been fully elucidated. Adipocytes and skin fibroblasts from a subset of patients with HyperapoB are impaired in their capacity to synthesize triglycerides (7Teng B. Forse A. Rodriquez M.A. Sniderman A.D. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1988; 66: 239-242Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it has been hypothesized that reduced triglyceride synthesis results in a metabolic disruption of the adipocyte-hepatocyte free fatty acid axis (8Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: S27-S33PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Frayn K.

Soc. 1997; 56: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This disruption will then produce a reduced rate of free fatty acid uptake by adipocytes with an enhanced delivery of free fatty acids and partially triglyceride-depleted chylomicron remnants to the liver. This would in turn cause an increased production of B-100-containing lipoprotein particles, yielding the HyperapoB phenotype. A protein was subsequently partially purified that stimulated triglyceride synthesis in both fibroblasts and adipocytes in vitro and was called ASP (11Cianflone K.M. Sniderman A.D. Walsh M.J. Vu H.T. Gagnon J. Rodriguez M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies suggested that the impairment in triglyceride synthesis in cells from HyperapoB patients was because of a difference in response to ASP (12Cianflone K.M. Maslowska M.H. Sniderman A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which was later suggested to be caused by a decrease in the ASP cell-surface receptor concentration (13Zhang X.J. Cianflone K. Genest J. Sniderman A.D. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 28: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On further purification and characterization, ASP was found to be identical to C3ades-Arg (14Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St-Luce S. Avramoglu R.K. Maslowska M. Hoang B. Monge J.C. Bell A. Mulay S. Cianflone K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the inactive product of the complement anaphylatoxin peptide, C3a (15Hugli T.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 153: 181-208PubMed Google Scholar). This finding, together with the knowledge that adipocytes secrete proteins of the alternative pathway of complement (C3, Factor B and Factor D/adipsin) (16Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Obes. Res. 1996; 4: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), led to the proposal of an adipsin-ASP pathway as a means to generate C3ades-Arg by adipocytes (10Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Summers L. Fielding B. Frayn K. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1997; 56: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Ann. Med. 1994; 26: 389-393Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Germinario R. Cianflone K. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies have led to a widely accepted hypothesis that ASP is a potent modulator of triglyceride synthesis that, when functionally impaired, would result in the HyperapoB syndrome (10Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Summers L. Fielding B. Frayn K. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1997; 56: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The recent generation of complement C3 “knock-out” mice (21Circolo A. Garnier G. Fukuda W. Wang X. Hidvegi T. Szalai A.J. Briles D.E. Volanakis J.E. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Immunopharmacology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) has provided an excellent opportunity to test the validity of this hypothesis in vivo. Because the complement protein C3 is the precursor of C3ades-Arg, which is identical to ASP, these mice will be totally deficient in ASP and would be predicted to exhibit phenotypic characteristics of hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. We present here data examining these mice as a possible murine model of this disease. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs discussed in the Introduction, impaired ASP function has been proposed as a cause of HyperapoB (24Sniderman A.D. Brown B.G. Stewart F.F. Cianflone K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 137-142Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HyperapoB is characterized phenotypically by elevated levels of plasma LDL because of overproduction of hepatic apoB-100 lipoprotein particles (2Teng B. Thompson G.R. Sniderman A.D. Forte T.M. Krauss R.M. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6662-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Teng B. Sniderman A.D. Soutar A.K. Thompson G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also indicated that HyperapoB patients have a delayed triglyceride clearance after an oral fat load as well as elevated free fatty acid levels (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that defective ASP causes HyperapoB, 6–12-week-old ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice were examined for plasma lipid and lipoprotein phenotypes characteristic of HyperapoB patients. ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice and wild-type littermates were fasted for 4–6 h and bled through the tail vein, and total plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations were determined. The results are shown in TableI. The average triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations in the plasma of ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient male mice were 61.3 ± 23.2 mg/dl, 76.3 ± 24.3 mg/dl, and 0.76 ± 0.2 mm, respectively. These concentrations were not significantly different from the plasma concentrations determined in the wild-type male mice (triglycerides, 58.9 ± 24.6 mg/dl; cholesterol, 75.6 ± 20.3 mg/dl; free fatty acids, 0.79 ± 0.2 mm). Similarly, female mice, whether wild-type or ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient, had similar fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations (Table I).Table IPlasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations in ASP-sufficient (+/+) and ASP-deficient (−/−) miceMaleFemaleASP (−/−)ASP (+/+)ASP (−/−)ASP (+/+)Triglycerides (mg/dl)61.3 ± 23.2 (31)58.9 ± 24.6 (27)61.3 ± 20.7 (22)63.1 ± 33.6 (18)Cholesterol (mg/dl)76.3 ± 24.3 (27)75.6 ± 20.3 (18)76.2 ± 28.7 (18)71.5 ± 17.0 (12)Free fatty acids (mm)0.76 ± 0.2 (11)0.79 ± 0.2 (14)0.77 ± 0.2 (13)0.85 ± 0.2 (12)Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. The number of mice studied is given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab To determine if the absence of ASP resulted in any change in the plasma lipoproteins, the plasma samples from fasted wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice were fractionated by FPLC using two serially connected Superose-6 columns. Fractions of 0.5-ml were collected, and protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were determined for each fraction. Shown in Fig.1 are the FPLC profiles obtained from plasma samples of 9 wild-type and 9 ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient male mice. The FPLC analysis indicated that the very low density lipoprotein, LDL, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different in ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type male mice (Fig. 1). This study was repeated using female mice. As with the male mice, no significant difference was observed in the very low density lipoprotein, LDL, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations of the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type female mice (data not shown). Collectively, the data in Table I and the FPLC profiles (Fig.1) demonstrate that the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in fasting mice are not affected by the absence of ASP.Because no differences in fasting levels of plasma lipids and lipoproteins were detected in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type animals, experiments were performed to determine if ASP deficiency alters plasma lipid concentrations following an oral fat load, as persistent postfat load hypertriglyceridemia has been documented in HyperapoB patients (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was performed by orally administering 0.4 ml of olive oil to fasted wild-type (10 males, 9 females) and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice (11 males, 10 females). Blood samples (0.04 ml) were then collected at 1-h intervals, and free fatty acid and triglyceride plasma concentrations were determined at each time point. The results from this study are shown in Fig. 2. There was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of free fatty acids or triglycerides in the 6 h following the olive oil gavage in ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type mice. Triglyceride concentrations in all animals increased 2–3-fold up to 2 h following the oral fat load. Within 6 h after the olive oil gavage, the plasma triglyceride concentrations returned to fasting levels in both wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice. There was a trend toward faster triglyceride clearance in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient male mice, although the difference was not significant (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that, in addition to the similar fasting lipid concentrations, ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice do not have significantly altered levels of plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids following an oral fat load.As discussed, it has been postulated that a defective ASP response causes an enhanced production of hepatic apoB-100-containing lipoprotein particles, the metabolic hallmark of HyperapoB. Mice produce two forms of hepatic apoB, apoB-48, and apoB-100 (25Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J.

If defective ASP function does cause increased production of hepatic apoB lipoproteins, then the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice would be expected to have elevated levels of plasma apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100. To test this possibility, quantitative Western blot analysis was performed on total plasma samples from fasted ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type mice using a previously characterized sheep anti-rat apoB antibody (23Liao W.

Yeung S.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The results of the Western blot experiment from male and female wild-type and ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient littermates are shown at the top of Fig. 3. Densitometric measurements, normalized to an albumin standard, were determined and illustrated as bar graphs at the bottom of Fig. 3. It is clear by Western blot analysis there was no significant difference in the levels of apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100 in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient and wild-type littermates. In summary, based on numerous observations in vitro it has been proposed that a defect in ASP function is the underlying defect in HyperapoB and that ASP deficiency would lead to the development of this disease. However, the in vivo data obtained in the current investigation, using a mouse model deficient in ASP, indicate that the possible role of impaired ASP function as a cause of HyperapoB needs to be reexamined. If impaired ASP function is a primary cause of hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, then it is difficult to explain why no significant phenotypic differences characteristic of HyperapoB are observed in the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice compared with normal littermates. If indeed ASP dysfunction does cause increased production of hepatic apoB lipoproteins, it is surprising that at least some elevation of apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100 was not observed in the ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient animals. In addition, plasma lipid clearance was not impaired in ASP(C3ades-Arg)-deficient mice as observed in HyperapoB patients (5Genest J. Sniderman A. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacholder S. Marcel Y. Kwiterovich Jr., P. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabezas M.C. de Bruin T.W. de Valk H.W. Shoulders C.C. Jansen H. Erkelens D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although ASP function has been found to be similar in mouse and human cells (20Murray I. Parker R.A. Kirchgessner T.G. Tran J. Zhang Z.J. Westerlund J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that mice may not be an ideal model system for these in vivo studies. However, our observations are consistent with other observations in humans. For example, several unrelated human families have been discovered with complete complement protein C3 deficiency (28Singer L. Colten H.R. Wetsel R.A. Pathobiology. 1994; 62: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); these C3-deficient individuals do not appear to display an increased predisposition to hyperlipidemia or to coronary artery disease. Moreover, a recent study indicates that elevated serum C3 levels are associated with an increased prevalence of myocardial infarction (29Muscari A. Bozzoli C. Puddu G.M. Sangiorgi Z. Dormi A. Rovinetti C. Descovich G.C. Puddu P. Am. J. Med. 1995; 98: 357-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This is the opposite of the expected effect of C3, the obligate ASP precursor, if functionally impaired ASP causes HyperapoB, which predisposes individuals to myocardial infarction. In conclusion, our observations indicate that ASP deficiency does not cause HyperapoB in mice and that the role of ASP in HyperapoB in humans needs to be reevaluated.

https://openalex.org/W1969234002,"ZF87/MAZ is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor that was cloned based on its ability to bind to a site within the c-myc P2 promoter. However, its role in the control of c-myc transcription has not yet been well established. Here we have analyzed the effect of ZF87/MAZ overexpression on transcription from the murine c-myc P2 promoter. It was found that when overexpressed in COS cells, ZF87/MAZ significantly represses transcription from P2. The repression is mediated through the ME1a2 element, located at position −86 relative to the P2 transcriptional start site, and is not mediated through either the E2F or the ME1a1 sites. ZF87/MAZ functions as a true transcriptional repressor since it can repress transcription independently of the c-myc promoter, as part of a fusion with the GAL4 protein. The repressive domain within ZF87/MAZ is located in the amino-terminal half of the protein, a region rich in proline and alanine residues. ZF87/MAZ therefore shares features (i.e.a Pro/Ala-rich region) with those of known transcriptional repressor proteins.

In particular, c-myc is known as a cooperating oncogene and is thought to be an important contributing factor to neoplastic transformation and the generation of many cancers (1Cole M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3713-3721PubMed Google Scholar, 3Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv.

Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). That c-myc plays such a key role in regulating cell proliferation and cell death is consistent with the observations that its expression is tightly controlled in normal cells. Expression of both c-myc mRNA and protein is extremely low in quiescent cells, and it increases in proliferating cells (1Cole M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3713-3721PubMed Google Scholar, 3Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv.

Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Since c-myc plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, much effort has gone into understanding how its expression is modulated. c-myc gene expression is controlled at least in part at the level of transcription initiation, and extensive research has gone into identifying the transcriptional control regions within the c-myc promoter. This has been complicated by the fact that c-myc has multiple promoters, which are termed P0, P1, P2, and P3 (4Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Potter M. Marcu K.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Yet in many normal and transformed cells, a majority of transcripts initiate at the P2 promoter (4Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev.

Additionally, some of these factors, such as Fos/Jun, Blimp-1, and CTCF, function to repress the transcription of c-myc. cis-Acting sequences more proximal to the P2 promoter are comprised of an initiator sequence at the start site, a well defined TATA sequence at position −29, and three elements termed ME1a1, E2F, and ME1a2 at positions −46, −64, and −85 relative to P2 (4Marcu K.B.

It has been demonstrated that growth factor induction of c-myc takes place at least in part through the E2F site (24Mudryj M. Hiebert S.W. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as does p53-mediated repression (25Moberg K.H. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. J. Cell.

Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar). The ME1a1 and ME1a2 elements have been shown to contribute positively to initiation at the P2 promoter (20Miller H. Asselin C. Dufort D.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better how the ME1a2 site controls transcription from P2, a novel transcription factor was cloned based on its ability to bind this element (28Pyrc J. Moberg K. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This factor termed ZF87/MAZ contains six zinc fingers of the Kruppel/TFIIIA type and was also found to bind the ME1a1 site (28Pyrc J. Moberg K. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). ZF87/MAZ also contains glutamine-, alanine-, and proline-rich regions (28Pyrc J. Moberg K. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) but appears to lack the KRAB-A/B domains present in many zinc finger proteins (30Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that full-length ZF87/MAZ can act as a low level activator of c-myc expression in certain cell lines devoid of p53 or pRb (7Marcu K.D. Patel A.J. Yang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a protein-related ZF87/MAZ, termed THZif-1, has been identified in HL60 cells that functions to suppress transcription from the c-myc promoter (31Sakatsume O. Tsutsue H. Wang Y. Gao H. Tang X. Yamauchi I. Murata T. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31322-31333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Kawasaki H. Machida M. Komatsu M.

Given that multiple members of the ZF87/MAZ family now appear to exist (33Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Logan T.J. Pyrc J.J. Hall D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1993; 192: 1204-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the data suggest that the ZF87/MAZ family of proteins may play an important role in controlling c-myctranscription, yet to date little is known of their exact role in c-myc transcription. To gain insight into the function of ZF87/MAZ, we have overexpressed it in COS cells. We find that ZF87/MAZ is a potent repressor of transcription from the c-myc P2, promoter acting through the ME1a2 element. COS and CV1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum or fetal calf serum. All transfection experiments were initiated on 50% confluent monolayer cultures. Plasmids (a total of 40 μg) were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (35$$Google Scholar). The cells were glycerol-shocked 5–6 h after DNA addition. The ZF87/MAZ cDNA construct was originally isolated by screening a λgt11 expression library (renatured protein immobilized on filters) with a 32P-radiolabeled ME1a2 element (28Pyrc J. Moberg K. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cDNA was then cloned into Bluescript KS just 3′ to a FLAG epitope tag sequence. The FLAG epitope tag was linked in frame to the open reading frame of ZF87/MAZ. A monoclonal antibody (M2, Eastman Kodak Co. and IBI) directed toward this epitope was used in the immunoblotting immunofluorescence and gel-shift experiments. For expression studies the tagged ZF87/MAZ gene was cloned into the pcDNA3 plasmid. All of the c-mycpromoter:CAT1 constructs used were as described previously (23Moberg K.H. Logan T.J. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar, 25Moberg K.H. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Extracts were generated by multiple freeze-thaw cycles approximately 48 h after the glycerol shock and then CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) and β-galactosidase activity was assayed from the soluble extracts. Equal amounts of protein were assayed for CAT activity by thin layer chromatography, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by a color reaction (35$$Google Scholar). All transfections were performed multiple times. A plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-long terminal repeat controlling expression of the β-galactosidase gene (RSVβ-gal) was included in all transfections (5 μg) of the CAT constructs so that the CAT activity could be normalized for differences in transfection efficiency. To determine if ZF87/MAZ induced apoptosis, COS cells were plated out onto glass coverslips and then transfected with the ZF87/MAZ expressing plasmid or a vector control. At 48 h after the glycerol shock, the coverslips were processed for fluorescent microscopy, using M2 as a primary antibody, followed by DAPI staining of the DNA. The altered nuclear morphology of an apoptotic cell, as assessed by DAPI staining, is represented by nuclear blebbing, DNA fragmentation, and DNA condensation (36Hann C. Evans D.L. Fertala J. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8425-8433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells to be processed for flow cytometry were rinsed twice in chilled PBS and then trypsinized and resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% serum. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 70% ethanol. The cells were kept on ice for 10 min, pelleted, and then treated with RNase A (1.8 μg) for 30 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for an additional 15 min at room temperature. Cell cycle analysis was then performed on a Coulter Profile 2 Flow Cytometer. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts for immunoblots and gel-shift assays were generated by lysing the cells on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, and the soluble fraction was termed “cytosol.” The nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer consisting of 0.42 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), benzamidine (1 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8 min to pellet the residual nuclear material. The supernatant fraction from this centrifugation spin was termed “nuclear extract.” For electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blots, the nuclear extract was diluted with extraction buffer minus NaCl to lower the salt concentration to approximately 0.1 m. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (23Moberg K.H. Logan T.J. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ng of a 32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts in the presence of 1.5 μg of sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA as a nonspecific competitor. The final buffer conditions for protein binding to the radiolabeled DNA were 16 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 16% glycerol, 80 mm KCl, 0.16 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reactions were then electrophoresed in a low ionic strength (7 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA) 4% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film, and the protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The double-stranded oligonucleotide representing the ME1a2 element used in the gel-shift assays is shown in Oligonucleotide 1.

To generate constructs containing mutant and wild type ME1a2 elements, the following sequences were cloned (as double-stranded oligonucleotides) 5′ to the minimal promoter-CAT construct containing only the P2 TATA box, extending from position −48 to +176 relative to P2. The sequences are as follows: ME1a2 wild type, GCCTCCTGAAGGGCAGGGCTTCGC; ME1a2 mutant 1, GCCTCCTGAATT GCAGGGCTTCGC; and ME1a2 mutant 2, GCCTCCTGAAGGGCATT GCTTCGC.

The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose, washed in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8); 150 mm NaCl; 0.05% Tween 20), blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with either the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (10 ng/ml) or polyclonal antiserum generated against ZF87/MAZ (1:5,000 dilution). The blots were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with a 1:7500 dilution of secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, or goat anti-rabbit Vector Laboratories) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at room temperature in TBST. The blots were washed three times with TBST and then stained using the Protoblot system from Promega. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes containing glass coverslips and transfected with the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid. The cells were washed once in PBS and the cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min followed by an additional rinse in PBS. To permeabilize the cells, the coverslips were then treated with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by three 5-min washes in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin (28Pyrc J. Moberg K. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The M2 monoclonal antibody (VWR Scientific/Kodak/IBI) was diluted in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. 50 μl of diluted antibody was added to a dish; coverslips containing the fixed and permeabilized cells were placed cell side down on the drop of diluted antibody and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) was diluted to 30 μg/ml in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. 50 μl of diluted antibody were placed in a dish and the coverslips placed cell side down and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin (10 min), PBS plus 0.2% gelatin plus 0.05% Tween 20 (10 min), and finally in PBS (10 min). The coverslips were rinsed in deionized water, dried, mounted, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. To begin functional studies on ZF87/MAZ, the protein was epitope-tagged (FLAG) at the very amino terminus by engineering the tag at the very 5′ end of the cDNA. This tagged construct was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector, suitable for high level of expression in eukaryotic cells. The M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI), directed to the epitope tag, was then used to detect the ectopically expressed protein. To initiate functional studies on ZF87/MAZ, the pcDNA3-ZF87/MAZ vector was transiently transfected into COS cells. At 48 h post-transfection the cells were harvested, and nuclear and cytosolic extracts were generated. These extracts were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was immunoblotted. Separate blots were incubated with either the M2 monoclonal antibody or ZF87/MAZ specific antiserum. As seen in Fig. 1, A andB, ectopically expressed ZF87/MAZ is detected by both antibodies. The protein is present almost exclusively in the nuclear extracts. The protein band under the ectopically expressed ZF87/MAZ in Fig. 1 A is a nonspecific band detected by the secondary antibody. Since the protein was present in the nuclear fraction, we next determined if the protein was actually targeted to the nucleus. COS cells cultured on glass coverslips were next transiently transfected with the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid. The cells were fixed at 48 h post-transfection and were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using M2 as the primary antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. As seen in Fig. 2 A, fluorescence microscopy reveals that the protein was targeted almost completely to the nucleus. To test whether ZF87/MAZ overexpression had an adverse affect on the COS cells, apoptosis was measured. Cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the ZF87MAZ expression vector and then processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described above at 48 h post-transfection. Following the addition of the second fluorescein-conjugated antibody, the DNA in the cells was stained with the DNA dye DAPI. Apoptosis was measured in the transfected and untransfected cells by determining the percentage of fluorescent-positive cells undergoing nuclear blebbing, DNA fragmentation, and condensation (as in Ref. 36Hann C. Evans D.L. Fertala J. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8425-8433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.2 B, ZF87/MAZ overexpression does not induce any significant apoptosis in these cells, compared with the untransfected control population. Since the transfection data indicated that ZF87/MAZ could be transiently expressed to detectable levels by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting in COS cells, it was next important to determine the functional consequences of this expression, by focusing on the c-mycpromoter. Transfection experiments were therefore initiated, using c-myc promoter-CAT constructs. The c-myc promoter has been analyzed in detail in a variety of cell lines, using deletion constructs with varying promoter sequences (20Miller H. Asselin C. Dufort D. Yang J.Q. Gupta K. Marcu K.B. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5340-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Asselin C. Nepveu A. Marcu K.B. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hall D.J.

However, transcription from the P2 promoter has not been analyzed in detail with these constructs in COS cells. The promoter constructs to be utilized are outlined in Fig. 3 A. These show the various combinations of P2 promoter elements, utilizing the c-myc P2 transcriptional start site in all constructs and extending to residue +176 (relative to P2) within the first exon. These promoter constructs were individually transfected into COS cells along with an RSV-LacZ construct. Extracts generated at 48 h post-transfection were used to assay for CAT activity. It is clear from the data in Fig. 3 B that optimal transcription from the promoter is dependent primarily on the ME1a1 and ME1a2 elements. Note that the −77CAT construct contains E2F, ME1a1, and TATA, whereas the −61CAT construct contains only the ME1a1 and TATA elements. Elimination of the ME1a2 element results in the greatest drop in promoter activity. Although the E2F element does not appear to affect greatly the overall level of transcription in COS cells, it has been shown to control c-myc transcription in nontransformed cells (24Mudryj M. Hiebert S.W. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The data indicate that the ME1a2 and ME1a1 elements contribute the most to transcription from P2 in COS cells. Dependence of P2 promoter strength on these elements in COS cells therefore appears nearly identical to that seen in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and U87mg glioblastoma cells (23Moberg K.H. Logan T.J. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar, 25Moberg K.H. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. J. Cell.

The constructs in Fig. 3 A were next used as a starting point in cotransfection experiments in COS cells along with the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid. First, the largest c-mycpromoter fragment (−1367CAT) was cotransfected along with increasing amounts of the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid. As seen below in Fig.4 A, ZF87/MAZ shows a dose-dependent repressive effect on transcription from this promoter construct. At the highest concentration used, a 10-fold repressive effect was evident. Optimal repression was seen at a 2:1 ratio of reporter to ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid. As controls, the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid at the high concentration had no effect on transcription from either the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat or on the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 4 B). An RSV-LacZ construct was used in all transfections to normalize for any differences in transfection efficiency, as described above since it is not affected by ZF87/MAZ (Fig. 4 C). As a control for these experiments, CV1 cells, the parental cell line of COS but lacking SV40 T antigen, were transfected with the −1367CAT and the −140CAT constructs in the presence and absence of the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid. As seen in Fig. 4 D, ZF87/MAZ significantly down-regulates transcription from these promoter constructs in CV1 cells. This indicates that the down-regulation in COS cells is not dependent on T antigen. Experiments were next performed to identify the site(s) within the P2 promoter that were affected by ZF87/MAZ. Cotransfections were therefore performed on the deletion constructs outlined in Fig. 3 A, namely −140CAT, −77CAT, −61CAT, −48CAT (containing only the TATA element and the P2 start site), and −24CAT(containing only the P2 start site). Since the high concentration of the ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid led to the greatest repression of expression from the −1367CAT construct in COS cells, this ratio of reporter to ZF87/MAZ expression plasmid was used to test whether repression could occur on smaller promoter fragments. Significant repression (>5-fold) occurred to the −140CAT construct by ZF87/MAZ as shown in Fig.5, which would indicate that ZF87/MAZ is acting through elements in the P2 promoter. However, as also shown in Fig. 5, the other constructs, which all lack the ME1a2 site, were not repressed by ZF87/MAZ. In fact the −77CAT construct is activated by ZF87/MAZ. Although ZF87/MAZ is known to bind the ME1a1 element (28Pyrc J. Moberg K. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the mechanisms responsible for this activation will be discussed below. However, the results would indicate that the repressive effect of ZF87/MAZ on P2 is primarily due to its action on the ME1a2 site and not on the E2F or ME1a1 sites. Also, since no repression was seen using a construct containing only the TATA box (−48CAT), it appears that ZF87/MAZ is not acting directly on the basal transcription machinery. To analyze more thoroughly the effect of ZF87/MAZ on the P2 promoter, additional promoter CAT constructs were used in the cotransfection assays. These constructs include ME1a2-E2FCAT, ME1a2-ME1a1CAT, ME1a2CAT, and 3E2FCAT. As shown in Fig.6, transcription from each promoter construct, except the 3E2FCAT, is inhibited by ZF87/MAZ.

The common substrate for alltrans-splicing reactions is the spliced leader (SL)1 RNA, also known as the mini-exon derived RNA, whose first 39 nt constitute the 5′ ends of both mono- and polycistronically synthesized mRNAs (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The polycistronic pre-mRNAs require trans-splicing to acquire the specialized “cap 4” structure on the SL RNA. The cap 4 consists of a 7mG attached to the first nucleotide (2Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), in addition to methylation of the first four and sixth nucleotides of the SL RNA (3Perry K.L. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8190-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Freistadt M.S. Cross G.A.M. Robertson H.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications are made to the primary SL RNA and spliced onto the mRNA as part of the 39-nt exon. The cap 4 may have roles in mRNA trans-splicing, transport, stability and translation. The SL RNA contains two functional domains as follows: the exon and the intron or snRNA-like domain (6Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 147-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The exon sequence is conserved among 38 different members of the order Kinetoplastida (7Ullu E. Tschudi C. Günzl A. Smith D.F. Parsons M. Molecular Biology of Parasitic Protozoa. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 115-133Google Scholar). Positions 1–9 and 20–39 of the exon are nearly identical, whereas positions 10–19 are relatively heterogeneous and characteristically A/T-rich. This conservation cannot be ascribed to internal promoter location inLeishmania (8Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was surprising that mutations within positions 20–39 permitted accurate trans-splicing in Leishmania tarentolaeand did not lower splicing efficiency (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) because these results contrasted with findings in Leptomonas (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the results in L. tarentolae more closely resemble the findings in worms as follows: in Ascaris, exon sequences are not necessary for trans-splicing in vitro (13Maroney P.A. Hannon G.J. Shambaugh J.D. Nilsen T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3869-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); inCaenorhabditis elegans, length, primary sequence, and composition of the SL are not critical parameters for essential embryonic function, although certain nucleotides may be essential forin vivo splicing of the SL1 RNA (14Xie H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1892-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the SL RNA intron is not conserved among the trypanosomatids (7Ullu E. Tschudi C. Günzl A. Smith D.F. Parsons M. Molecular Biology of Parasitic Protozoa. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 115-133Google Scholar); however, the secondary structure is consistent (16Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This structure has been confirmed by physical-chemical and enzymatic studies (17LeCuyer K.A. Crothers D.M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An equivalent structure is also conserved in the nematode SL RNAs (16Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A.

Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), an element found in the small nuclear RNAs of higher eukaryotes but apparently lacking in all U-RNAs of kinetoplastids (20Mottram J.

A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Sm-binding element is required for SL RNA trans-splicing in Ascaris (23Hannon G.J. Maroney P.A. Yu Y.T. Hannon G.E. Nilsen T.W. Science. 1992; 258: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but not in Leptomonas (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently that the T tract downstream of the SL RNA gene is a transcription termination element and that staggered T tract termination products are processed via nucleolytic cleavage to the base of stem-loop III (24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The signals for 3′-processing begin in the Sm-binding site at position 76 and include the structure, but not content, of stem-loop III. Studies in Leptomonas seymouridemonstrated that mutation of a variety of elements in the intron was acceptable for trans-splicing (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas inLeptomonas collosoma the loop portions of stem-loops II and III were tolerant to insertions but not to replacement with theTrypanosoma brucei intron (25Goncharov I. Xu Y. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). By contrast, the bulge of stem-loop II was critical for trans-splicing inAscaris (26Denker J.A. Maroney P.A. Yu Y.T. Kanost R.A. Nilsen T.W. RNA (NY). 1996; 2: 746-755PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we report that methylation of nucleotides in the cap 4 structure of the Leishmania SL RNA is influenced by formation of stem-loop III, the Sm-binding site, and specific sequences in stem-loop II. The methylation of the cap 4 structure correlates with correct 3′ end formation; defects in 3′ end processing and cap 4 formation result in failure of the mutated SL RNA to undergotrans-splicing. However, correct maturation of the SL RNA is not sufficient to obtain a positive splicing phenotype since mutation of nucleotides in the stem I region of the intron can also result in loss of function. Our data from L. tarentolae broadly reflect the results obtained in vitro in the nematodeAscaris, where nucleotides in stem-loop II and the Sm-binding site are necessary for splicing. Our data broadly contrast the results obtained in Leptomonas, where the structure and not the primary sequence of stem-loop II was necessary for splicing, and where the Sm-binding site and stem-loop III were not required for splicing. A model summarizing the features of the LeishmaniaSL RNA involved in maturation and trans-splicing is presented. Mutagenesis was performed using the Sculptor Mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or using PCR to generate mutagenized DNA fragments for subcloning into the transfection vector. Mutated fragments were cloned for transfection into a pX plasmid (27LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) containing an SL RNA gene (9Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by electroporation as described (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RNA was purified using TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was electrophoresed through 1.1% agarose-formaldehyde, blotted, and hybridized as described previously (28Sturm N.R. Kuras R. Büschlen S. Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6171-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To assay fortrans-splicing of mutant-SL RNAs, complementary oligonucleotides were hybridized to Arl mRNA (29Sturm N.R. Van Valkenburgh H. Kahn R. Campbell D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and extended by Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (RT) to produce templates for PCR analysis (RT-PCR (30Sturm N.R. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 61: 871-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) with a second, SL-specific oligonucleotide. The following oligonucleotides were used: Arl(−)68, 5′-TGCGGATCGCCTTCTGGCCACC; LtSL5′RI, 5′-GGGAATTCGCTTTCAACTAACGCTAT; 30/39–5′HI, 5′-GGGATCCTGTATCAGTTTCAGCCT. Amplification products were run in 1.5% agarose gels, denatured, blotted, and hybridized with 28/39-tag oligonucleotide (5′-ACTTCCTCGAGGCTGAA) to detect the exon tag or wild-type (5′-CAATAAAGTACAGAAACTGA) exon sequence (corresponding to positions 20–39). The expected product size is ∼300 bp. 5′ cap 4 methylation was assayed by primer extension of total RNA with an exon tag-specific oligonucleotide (28/39-tag) as described previously (9Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To localize specific elements within the intron of the SL RNA that play a role in the process of trans-splicing, a systematic mutagenesis approach was adopted (Fig. 1). To differentiate mutated, episomally derived SL RNA from the endogenous WT SL RNA population, an exon tagged at positions 28 and 30–39 (28/39), which was previously shown to trans-splice accurately and efficiently (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was used as a molecular tag (tSL RNA) for detection by hybridization. A series of linker scan (CTCGAGCTCA) mutations in the tSL RNA gene was created for transfection to L. tarentolae. Two mutations in the 40–49 region were created as follows: a mutant with alterations in bases 43 and 44 (43/44 = GTversus TG in WT) tested a postulated SL RNA-U6 snRNA interaction (31Xu G.L. Wieland B. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4565-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and a second mutant, altered at positions 42–48 (42/48), changed all but the splice donor site with the linker scan sequences. Subsequent intron mutations continued from position 50 (52/59) and proceeded through the end of the intron. Three mutations lay downstream of the mature 3′ end of the SL RNA transcript (position 96) and were included to identify potential adjacent expression elements (100/109, 110/119, 120/129; WT sequence not shown). Analysis of total RNA from the transfectants demonstrated tSL RNA (∼96 nt) in all the samples by low resolution formaldehyde-agarose gel blotting (Fig. 2 A). A broadened size range from the wild-type (WT) 96 nt to at least 175 nt was noted for the 100/109 tSL RNA, consistent with discrete higher molecular weight bands visible in higher resolution gel analyses (24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The presence of tagged precursor SL RNA indicated that all the mutants have the potential to trans-splice. An artifactual transcript (∼1.45 kb) that accumulated in each sample provided an internal control for transfection, should stability be disrupted. The presence of the exon tag in a range of high molecular weight RNA species (500 nt to 9 kb) in the tSL, 43/44, 100/109, 110/119, and 120/129 samples suggested that active trans-splicing was occurring in these transfectants (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Splicing of 43/44 is consistent with results from a similar study in Leptomonas (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conversely, splicing of the tagged exon was impaired in the 42/48, 52/59, 62/69, 70/79, 80/89, and 90/99 mutants, where only substrate tSL RNA and the artifactual transcripts accumulated. The levels of accumulating tSL RNAs varied relative to the artifactual transcripts and the episomally encoded drug selectable marker mRNA NEO (data not shown). The 52/59 mutant in particular showed an increased accumulation of substrate molecules relative to other non-splicing mutants. In addition, trans-splicing was assayed by RT-PCR (11Sturm N.R.

When “total” SL primer (i.e. will amplify from both WT and tSL exons) was used in the amplification, all samples showed the positive control WT amplification products, but the 28/39-tag oligonucleotide hybridized only to the tSL, 43/44, 100/109, 110/119, and 120/129 products, consistent with the total RNA blot analysis. However, using a tSL-specific primer for amplification, some level of splicing was detected in all but the 70/79 mutant. These experiments included WTL. tarentolae RNA, no reverse transcriptase, and no RNA reactions as negative controls for contamination and dependence on the use of RNA templates. Furthermore, a promoter knockout in combination with tSL (−67/−58 + tSL (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) was used as a control for spurious PCR amplification; this cell line resulted in an artifactual ∼1.45-kb transcript containing the 28/39-tag sequence but no mature tSL RNA (shown in Fig. 5 B) and did not yield a tSL PCR product. Previously determined phenotypes for cap 4 and 3′ end formation (24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) are also indicated in Fig. 2. Thus, trans-splicing was adversely affected in mutants 42/48, 52/59, 62/69, 80/89, and 90/99 and appeared to be abolished in mutant 70/79. Structural analyses of the SL RNA predict three stem-loop structures and a single-stranded region containing the Sm-binding site (Ref. 17LeCuyer K.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). Previously, it was demonstrated that stem-loop I is not required for trans-splicing in L. tarentolae(11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because trans-splicing was reduced or abolished in mutants 52/59, 62/69, 70/79, 80/89, and 90/99, we considered the effects of mutations in stem-loop II, the Sm-binding site, and stem-loop III on SL RNA trans-splicing with regard to the structural or sequence elements. The mutations described below are organized with regard to both these elements and the linker scan mutation results in the following order: structural features of stem-loop II, fine analysis of the 70–81 region which includes part of stem-loop II and the Sm-binding site, and features of stem-loop III. Two mutations, 52/59 and 62/69, disrupted stem-loop II (Fig. 3 A) and were not efficiently trans-spliced (Fig. 2). To address the importance of stem-loop II, 52/59 was further mutated to restore base pairing (52/59 + 65/72; Fig. 3 A); this replaced the stem structure but with a different sequence content than WT. A further mutation was designed (42/48 + 77/80) to restore a possible extension of stem-loop II in the 45–48 region, which was disrupted by mutations 42/48 and 70/79 (Fig. 3 A). 77/80 was also tested for independent effects due to its disruption of the conserved Sm-binding site. Neither of the compensatory base pairing mutations restoredtrans-splicing (Fig. 3 B). 77/80 alone or in combination with 42/48 resulted in extended, heterogeneous 3′ end formation (data not shown) consistent with the 70/79 phenotype (24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas 52/59 and 52/59 + 65/72 possessed correct 3′ ends (data not shown). 42/48 + 77/80, 52/59 + 65/72, and 77/80 showed undermethylated cap 4 structures (data not shown), as did 42/48, 52/59, and 70/79 (24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both the structure and sequence content of stem-loop II are thus important features in the maturation of the SL RNA precursor. The structure alone is not sufficient to direct either cap 4 methylation or splicing. The stem-loop II extension structure may play an intermediate role in the splicing pathway, but it is not sufficient to restore processing or splicing. Because 70/79 altered most of the Sm-binding site and resulted in no trans-splicing and defects in both 5′ and 3′ end formation, we examined the area in finer detail. A 2-bp transversion (TV) series was created from position 70 to 81; in addition, 70/79 and 75/81 TV mutations were made (Fig.4 A). It should be noted that 70/71 and 72/73 comprise part of stem-loop II (see Fig. 1) and that 74/75 TV may extend the Sm sequence (AAUCUUUUGG). The total RNA of these transfectants revealed a variety of phenotypes for trans-splicing and methylation. By formaldehyde-agarose gel analysis, only the 74/75-tSL RNA was an efficienttrans-splicing substrate, with low levels of splicing evident in 72/73 (Fig. 4 B). The presence of tSL RNA but lack of the 1.45-kb artifact RNA in mutants 76/77, 70/79 TV, and 75/81 suggested additional increased stability phenotypes. Primer extension revealed an intriguing gradient of SL RNA cap 4 methylation in the 70/71, 72/73, and 74/75 mutants (Fig. 4 C), which showed low (5%), medium (40%), and normal (75%) methylation, respectively, and were trans-spliced proportional to their methylation state. Thus, as a component of the Sm-binding consensus, A75 does not appear to be an essential nucleotide in Leishmania; alternatively, the 74/75 mutation is a biologically acceptable extension of the Sm site. Mutations 80/89 and 90/99 disrupted stem-loop III (Fig. 5 A) and resulted in 3′-extended, undermethylated tSL RNAs (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that were not efficientlytrans-spliced. To examine further the role of stem-loop III structure, a series of mutations was created that disrupted and then replaced 1 or 3 bp of the stem and that altered the loop sequence (Fig.5 A). The single base disruptions were expected to disrupt only one rung of the stem, and thus lead to a minor size difference in the tSL RNA, whereas the triple base mutations were designed to disrupt the stem completely. Formaldehyde-agarose gel analysis of total RNA showed that the single base pair-disrupted SL RNAs (83, 96) could be trans-spliced, but the triple base pair-disrupted SL RNAs (83/85, 94/96) were nottrans-spliced efficiently (Fig. 5 B). The base pairing compensated SL RNAs (83 + 96, 83/85 + 94/96) were both efficient splicing substrates. The 88/91 loop mutation SL RNA appeared to be spliced with lowered efficiency based on the reduced mRNA smear relative to the tSL RNA substrate levels. These experiments show that the structure, but not the primary sequence, of stem-loop III is necessary for trans-splicing. Primer extension analysis indicated that the cap 4 methylation patterns (Fig. 5 C) correlated with the levels oftrans-splicing. 83, 96, and 83 + 96 were methylated efficiently and trans-spliced relative to the abundance of free tSL RNA (Fig. 5 B) and by total SL RT-PCR assays; 83/85 and 94/96 showed less than 5% methylation and had splicing that was only detectable by the mutation-specific RT-PCR assay (data not shown). In mutant 83/85 + 94/96, the tSL RNA cap 4 was methylated to WT levels, thus the compensating mutations, which restored stem-loop III, also restored a structural signal for the cap 4 methylase. 88/91 showed approximately 50% methylation (Fig. 5 C) and displayed reduced splicing (Fig. 5 B); the intron tag previously used to follow SL RNA transcription (9Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was inserted into this loop and does not interfere with cap 4 methylation of tagged SL RNA (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, methylation is linked to the formation of a minimum of 4/5 bp stem in stem-loop III. We have made a series of mutations in the region downstream of the exon in the SL RNA gene to examine effects ontrans-splicing. We have assayed for the ability of mutated SL RNA to trans-splice, and we have correlated this with correct cap 4 formation, transcription termination, and 3′ end processing as determined here and elsewhere (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A summary of nine phenotypes associated with the intron mutations is presented in TableI. In the majority of mutants, reduction or loss of trans-splicing correlates with defects in cap 4 methylation and 3′ end maturation. Where cap 4 methylation and 3′ end formation are WT, primary catalytic elements may have been mutated (e.g. 42/48).Table ISummary of mutant phenotypestrans-Splicing5′ end, cap 43′ endMutants, +tSLAgaroseRT-PCRstlpIIIaNucleolytic processing to base of stem-loop III.T trackbStaggered T track termination products.+++++++++++++++tSL (≅WT), 43/44, 110/119, 120/129, 74/75, 83, 83/85 + 94/96, 106/107cSee Ref. 24.++++++++−100/109, 102/107,cSee Ref. 24. 104/107cSee Ref. 24.+++++++++++88/91+++++++++72/73−++++++++++42/48−+−++++++52/59, 62/69, 52/59 + 65/72, 70/71−+−−+++80/89, 90/99, 83/85, 94/96−−−++++80/81−−−−+++70/79, 75/81, 76/77, 78/79, 80/81The symbols used are: +++, WT activity; +, reduced activity; −, ≤5% activity.a Nucleolytic processing to base of stem-loop III.b Staggered T track termination products.c See Ref. 24Sturm N.R.

Open table in a new tab The symbols used are: +++, WT activity; +, reduced activity; −, ≤5% activity. The mutant phenotypes have allowed us to evaluate structures and elements that may be important for SL RNA maturation and to propose a possible pathway for discrete processing steps in L. tarentolae (Fig. 6). In this model, the T tract functions as a transcription termination element (24Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Sm-binding site and stem-loop III structure are required to allow precise 3′ end maturation. Formation of the mature 3′ end, along with elements within stem-loop II, are required for cap 4 synthesis, as is the 10-29 region of the exon (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nucleotides within the intron region of stem I are likely to be required for splicing catalysis. Transcription of the SL RNA gene in vivo terminates in a T tract of greater than six T residues (Fig. 6, step 1). Mutation of the Sm-binding site (e.g. 76/77) and stem-loop III (e.g. 90/99) yielded mutants with defects in the nucleolytic formation of the mature 3′ end of the SL RNA, demonstrating a cooperative function between these two elements (step 2). Structure rather than primary sequence of the stem-loop III stem was required for trans-splicing. Consistent with this, an 8-nucleotide insertion in the loop of stem-loop III in L. collosoma did not affect trans-splicing (25Goncharov I. Xu Y. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, in L. seymouri deletion of stem-loop III resulted in an actively trans-spliced and normally methylated SL RNA (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutants that do not terminate accurately due to the disruption of their downstream T tract show an intermediate cap 4 phenotype (e.g. 100/109) that we interpret as indicative of a temporal order of 3′-processing (step 2) followed by cap 4 methylation (step 3). Methylation alone is not sufficient to confer splicing potential, since the 42/48 mutant is normally methylated but a marginal trans-splicer (a phenotype similar to the Leptomonas Δstl II mutant (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). This suggests that the intron region of stem I may be involved in catalytic steps oftrans-splicing (step 4). Positions 43/44 are not implicated in the 42/48 splicing defect. Nucleotides 42 + 45–48 may interact with other splicing entities such as SLA1 RNA (32Roberts T.G. Sturm N.R. Yee B.K. Yu M.C. Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or U5 snRNA (21Dungan J.M. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Xu Y. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nucleotides +7 and +8 of the intron (equivalent to positions 46–47 in L. tarentolae) in L. collosoma can be mutated without affecting trans-splicing (22Xu Y. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The essential nature of the Sm-binding site for in vivo trans-splicing in L. tarentolae agrees with data fromAscaris, where in vitro studies showed that the Sm-binding site was required for SL RNA trans-splicing (23Hannon G.J. Maroney P.A. Yu Y.T. Hannon G.E. Nilsen T.W. Science. 1992; 258: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We are aware of the limitations in comparing in vitro trans-splicing assays with in vivo splicing phenotypes (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We generally interpret lack of splicing phenotypes as due to splicing catalysis or, when they are detected, to maturation-related defects, but at this level of analysis our studies cannot exclude other explanations, for example impaired nucleus-cytoplasm-nucleus shuttling of the SL RNA. In contrast, a Leptomonas Sm-binding site mutant (“sub-Sm” (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) that closely approximated a non-splicing, 3′-extended L. tarentolae counterpart (78/79) was viable for ribonucleoprotein assembly and splicing. Splicing in the 74/75 mutant, which has a transversion of the A of the Sm site, may reflect flexibility within the conserved Sm-binding site, as found in the U5 snRNA of Saccharomyces (33Jones M.H. Guthrie C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An additional experimental difference to be considered between the two studies in trypanosomatids is that the exon tag in L. tarentolae consisted of 11 mutated nucleotides, whereas that in Leptomonas consisted of one mutated nucleotide. The contradictory results for Sm-binding site and stem-loop III in the kinetoplastids may be informative in interpreting our results as follows: given that stem-loop III does not contain primary sequence necessary for trans-splicing inLeptomonas, our non-splicing phenotypes may be secondary effects (e.g. additional 3′-extended sequences may inhibit the folding of stem-loop II). As indicated by mutant 70/71, elements in stem-loop II are required for the intron component of cap 4 formation. In Leptomonas, deletion or substitution of stem-loop II above the bulge position did not affect cap 4 methylation (12Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that some of the methylation phenotypes that we observed may be secondary effects due to interference with secondary or tertiary structure formation within the SL RNA itself or between the SL RNA and other splicing components. Similar to L. tarentolae, nucleotides in stem-loop II of theAscaris SL RNA (positions 39–42 and 61–65) are essential for trans-splicing and include a single nt (U, position 62) bulge (26Denker J.A. Maroney P.A. Yu Y.T. Kanost R.A. Nilsen T.W. RNA (NY). 1996; 2: 746-755PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the L. tarentolae results and contrasting the Leptomonas results, deletion of nucleotides 59–68 in stem-loop II of the Leishmania amazonensis SL RNA (Δ1) resulted in either inefficient or no trans-splicing (8Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study we have identified how various structures within the intron of the SL RNA are interdependent in 3′ end formation and cap 4 methylation, and we provide a possible pathway to describe the processing steps. We distinguish among trans-splicing negative mutants that are defective for discrete steps in SL RNA maturation and a mutant that may be affected in catalytic steps. These and subsequent mutants will facilitate studies on the intracellular trafficking of SL RNA, the identification of newtrans-spliceosomal proteins and protein-RNA interactions, and allow testing of new models of interactions with other splicing RNA/ribonucleoproteins.

SecBF74I is tetrameric but binds ligand with a lower affinity. Substitutions at positions 76, 78, and 80 cause a shift in the equilibrium so that the SecB tetramer dissociates into dimers. We conclude that the tetramer is a dimer of dimers and that the residues Cys76, Val78, and Gln80 must be involved either directly or indirectly in forming the interface between dimers.

Like all chaperones it binds its ligands by virtue of their non-native state. The binding is highly selective for unstructured proteins; however, no motif among the ligands has been found that might serve as a recognition element for SecB (1Collier D.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 151-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutant strains of E. coli that produce altered species of SecB and are defective in protein export have been isolated by Kumamoto and co-workers (3Kimsey H.H. Dagarag M.D. Kumamoto C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22831-22835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analyses of complexes between SecB and a ligand, precursor maltose-binding protein, isolated by co-immunoprecipitation from these mutant strains led to the proposal that the aminoacyl residues in the region from 74 to 80 at the even numbered positions, i.e.Phe74, Cys76, Val78, and Gln80, are involved in interaction with the ligand (3Kimsey H.H. Dagarag M.D. Kumamoto C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22831-22835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Substitutions at the alternating positions, Leu75 and Glu77, had no effect on the efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation of SecB and ligand; thus, it seems that the effect on export observed in vivo is the result of a defective interaction with other components of the export pathway. Here we have further investigated the nature of the defects exhibited by the altered species of SecB and conclude that the region implicated in binding of the precursors is crucial in maintaining the quaternary structure of SecB. SecB is a tetramer of identical subunits, but the species with substitutions at the positions 76, 78, and 80 exist as dimers. We conclude that these residues must be involved either directly or indirectly in forming the interface of dimers that normally associate to form tetramers and that substitutions at these positions shift the equilibrium so that the tetramer dissociates.

The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using coefficients of extinction as follows: SecB and SecB variants, 47600 m−1cm−1 for the tetramer, and denatured precursor and mature galactose-binding proteins, 37410 m−1cm−1. Cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.4% maltose, and 4 μg/ml thiamine to an optical density at 560 nm of 0.8.

Soluble lysates were injected onto the TSK G3000SW as described above and fractions of 1 ml were collected and processed for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using an antibody to SecB. Soluble lysates were prepared (as above except that the growth temperature was 35 °C) from the following strains: CK1953 (10Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which carries thesecB::Tn5 mutation and issecBnull; BL21(DE3) pJW25 (6Weiss J.B. Ray P.H. Bassford J.P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8978-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which carries the wild-typesecB on the chromosome as well as on the plasmid; and CK2212 with two plasmids both containing either secBC76Y orsecBV78F. One of the two plasmids carries thesecB variant gene under its natural promoter, and the other plasmid carries the secB variant gene under control of the T7 promoter. When the optical density at 560 nm reached 0.3, expression of the secB gene was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after an additional 3 h of growth. The concentrations of SecB (expressed as tetrameric SecB) in lysates were determined by immunoblot analyses to be approximately 1 μm for SecBC76Y and 2 μm for SecBV78F. The concentration of SecB in the wild-type extract was adjusted to 2 μm by dilution with an extract from thesecBnull strain. To assess complex formation precursor galactose-binding protein in 1.0 m GnHCl, 10 mmHepes, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm KAc, pH 7.0, was diluted into soluble lysate to give a final concentration of 1 μm precursor galactose-binding protein in 0.16m GnHCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 275 m KAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. For analysis without the addition of ligand, GnHCl was added to make the conditions comparable. Chromatography on a TSK G3000SW column was carried out as described. A soluble lysate containing 35S-labeled SecBV78F was prepared from strain HK57 harboring a plasmid that contains the gene for SecBV78F (3Kimsey H.H. Dagarag M.D. Kumamoto C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22831-22835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 35 °C, and when the optical density at 560 nm reached 0.8, 15 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml (20 nm methionine) was added. The culture was harvested after an additional 10 min of growth, and a soluble lysate was prepared as described above. The lysate was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography as described above. SecBV78F was detected by immunoblotting, and the two fractions that eluted at the tetramer position (15–16 ml) and the two that eluted at the dimer position (20–21 ml) were pooled separately. A volume of unlabeled lysate containing SecBV78F was added to the pooled fractions that contained dimer so that the concentration of SecBV78F in the pool containing dimer would be similar to that in the original lysate. Each sample was then concentrated 10-fold using Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon) and chromatographed using a TSK G3000SW column. The protein in each of the 1-ml fractions was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, one-fifth of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected using a PhosphorImager. Calorimetric titrations were carried out using the OMEGA titration calorimeter from MicroCal, Inc. (Northampton, MA) and the Origin software supplied with the instrument. The system has been described in detail (11Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Precursor galactose-binding protein was unfolded in 1.0 n GnHCl, 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm KAc, pH 7.6, and diluted to give final concentrations of 5.5 μm precursor galactose-binding protein for experiments in Hepes buffer or 4 μm for experiments in Tris buffer, 0.1 nGnHCl, 0.4 mm EGTA, and either Tris or Hepes buffer as indicated at pH 7.6, immediately before loading into the cell (working volume, 1.35 ml). SecB tetramer (held in the syringe at 100 μm) in the same buffer was added in a sequence of 15 injections, each of 7 μl, spaced at 10-min intervals. The titration was carried out at the temperature indicated. All electrophoresis was carried out on 14% polyacrylamide gels (12Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Suciu D. Hardy S.J.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described (13Morgan D.G. Baumgartner J.W. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using antisera to SecB and to galactose-binding protein and the chromogenic dye 4-chloro-1-naphthol for detection. We purified SecB and three of the altered species of SecB, SecBL75Q, SecBE77K, and SecBF74I, to homogeneity and examined their binding to a natural ligand, the precursor form of the periplasmic galactose-binding protein. SecB only binds proteins as ligands if they are in a non-native state (14Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess interaction, the refolding of denatured precursor galactose-binding protein was initiated by dilution of the denaturant, guanidinium chloride, in the presence of the chaperone SecB. When the mixture was analyzed by size exclusion HPLC, the galactose-binding protein coeluted with SecB ahead of the position of free SecB (16 ml) and of free precursor galactose-binding protein (17.9 ml for unfolded and 20.8 ml for folded) as indicated by the absorbance profiles and analysis of the fractions by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). When applied in an equimolar mixture (Fig. 1 A, dotted line, 3 μm each) not all the galactose-binding protein remained in complex during the fractionation, whereas at a 2-fold molar excess of SecB tetramer (Fig. 1 B, dashed line, 6 μm SecB: 3 μm precursor galactose-binding protein) all the precursor galactose-binding protein was recovered in complex with SecB. Complexes were readily detected between the precursor and the altered SecB species, SecBL75Q (Fig.2 A), SecBE77K (Fig.2 B), and SecBF74I (Fig. 3). Comparison of the distribution of precursor galactose-binding protein chromatographed after mixing with the various species of SecB, indicates that SecBF74I has a lower affinity for precursor galactose-binding protein than does the wild-type SecB because when applied as an equimolar mixture (Fig. 3 A) or at a 2-fold molar excess of SecBF74I (Fig. 3 B) less precursor was bound than with wild-type SecB. The distribution of precursor galactose-binding protein chromatographed after incubation with either SecBL75Q or SecBE77K was similar to that seen with wild-type SecB, indicating similar affinity. Quantitative determination of the affinity by calorimetric titrations of precursor galactose-binding protein with SecBL75Q showed binding characterized by a dissociation constant that falls within the range previously published, i.e. from 17 ± 5 nm to 56 ± 13 nm (12Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Suciu D. Hardy S.J.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for the wild-type SecB (Table I). The one titration done with SecBF74I at the same concentrations as those used for the wild-type SecB and for SecBL75Q indicated that the affinity was lower by at least 10-fold. An accurate value for the dissociation constant could not be determined because it would have required use of the proteins at 10-fold higher concentration (i.e. 1 mm for SecB). As has been shown previously for the wild-type SecB (12Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Suciu D. Hardy S.J.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), SecBL75Q binds the mature form of galactose-binding protein with a higher affinity than it binds the precursor form. This was demonstrated by carrying out gel filtration chromotography on a solution containing a mixture of precursor and mature galactose-binding protein and a limiting quantity of SecB. When precursor and mature forms were present in equimolar quantities, the ratio of ligands recovered in complex with SecB, whether wild-type or SecBL75Q (Figs. 4 and5), showed an enrichment for the mature form. In the case of SecBF74I binding was too weak to make a definitive conclusion concerning relative affinities (data not shown). These results are consistent with the published results of Kimsey et al. (3Kimsey H.H. Dagarag M.D. Kumamoto C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22831-22835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar): SecBL75Q and SecBE77K bind ligand normally, whereas SecBF74I has a lower affinity.Figure 2Complexes between altered species of SecB and precursor galactose-binding protein.

When strains harboring plasmids encoding these proteins were grown under conditions to produce large quantities of SecB, the proteins aggregated and were recovered in inclusion bodies. Thus it seemed likely that the region of SecB that had been altered was involved in folding of the polypeptide or its assembly into tetramers. Because the original characterization of the SecB in these strains as defective in ligand binding was based on the inability of SecB to be co-immunoprecipitated with the ligand maltose-binding protein it was important to determine whether these variants of SecB existed in a folded, tetrameric state at the level of expression used in the original study. To address this question the strains used in Kimsey et al. (3Kimsey H.H. Dagarag M.D. Kumamoto C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22831-22835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were grown as described in that work, and a cellular lysate was prepared. The lysates were subjected to centrifugation to separate soluble protein from both the membrane and proteinaceous aggregates. Analysis of each fraction by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an antiserum raised to SecB showed that all the wild-type SecB and SecBV78F remained in the soluble fraction (Fig. 6, A andB). SecBC76Y (Fig. 6 C) and SecBQ80R (Fig.6 D) were found distributed between the soluble fraction and the pellet, usually approximately 50% in each. The soluble fraction from each of the strains was subjected to gel filtration chromatography, and the presence of SecB among the proteins eluted from the column was detected by SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The SecB in the lysate of a strain producing wild-type SecB was eluted at the same position as is the purified tetrameric protein (16 ml) (Fig. 6 A). To address the question of stability of the wild-type tetramer, the purified SecB was applied to the column at increasingly lower concentrations in an attempt to approach the dimer-tetramer equilibrium constant and to observe dissociation of the tetramer. At concentrations near the equilibrium constant the position of elution would reflect the weighted average molecular weight of all species present, and thus the elution position should increase as the equilibrium moves toward favoring the dimeric species. Even at the lowest concentration that could be detected using the intrinsic fluorescence of SecB (20 nm), the elution position did not change (data not shown). Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the wild-type SecB must be well below 20 nm. Analyses of lysates containing the species that remained soluble during purification, i.e. SecBL75Q, SecBE77K, and SecBF74I, indicated that these variant forms of SecB were also tetrameric (data not shown). In contrast, SecBV78F was distributed between two peaks, one eluting at 16 ml, the position of the tetrameric species, and a second peak eluting at 20 ml (Fig. 6 B). Native galactose-binding protein, which has a molecular mass of 33 kDa, elutes at 20 ml, and thus it seems that the species of SecB at that position is a dimer. Almost all of the SecBC76Y in the lysate eluted between 20 and 21 ml, indicating that it is entirely dimeric (Fig. 6 C). We were unsuccessful in expressing SecBQ80R in this strain in a quantity comparable with that of the other species, but what was detectable was distributed between dimeric and tetrameric species (Fig.6 D). Because of the difficulties in purifying these proteins, we assessed the ability of the variant forms of SecB to form complexes when unfolded precursor galactose-binding protein ligand was added to the lysates to give a final concentration of 1 μm precursor. Precursor galactose-binding protein eluted from the size exclusion column in the same position whether it was applied as pure protein (Fig. 7) or after mixing with a lysate prepared from a secBnull strain (Fig. 7), indicating that in the absence of SecB there are not other components that affect the elution. However, addition of the precursor to a lysate that contained the SecB tetramer at 2 μm (Fig. 7) or at 1 μm (data not shown) resulted in the appearance of a complex as demonstrated by the coelution of the precursor and SecB. In contrast when precursor galactose-binding protein was added to a lysate containing SecBV78F (at a concentration of 2 μm expressed as tetramer) only a small amount of the precursor galactose-binding protein coeluted with tetrameric SecB, indicating weak interaction (Fig. 7). No interaction was observed between SecBC76Y and precursor galactose-binding protein when lysates were used that contained SecBC76Y at 1 μm (expressed as tetramer), which was the highest concentration we were able to achieve (Fig. 7). Attempts to concentrate the lysate resulted in loss of the SecBC76Y through aggregation. SecBC76Y does not form any detectable tetramer. It is recovered predominantly in the position of dimer with a significant amount of the protein recovered as higher order species, probably nonspecific aggregates, that elute from the gel filtration column over a wide range from the void volume to the position of dimer. In contrast, SecBV78F eluted at the position of tetramer as well as dimer. When a radiolabeled lysate of cells expressing SecBV78F was fractionated (Fig.8 A) and the SecBV78F that eluted in the tetrameric position was reapplied to the column, the SecB redistributed between tetramer and dimer (Fig. 8 B). In addition when the protein that had eluted at the position of dimer was mixed with nonradioactive lysate so that the concentration of SecB was close to that in the original lysate, again the radioactive SecBV78F redistributed between tetramer and dimer (Fig. 8 C). Therefore, the observed distribution reflects a shift in the equilibrium between dimers and tetramers relative to that of the wild type and not a subpopulation of SecBV78F that cannot form tetramers. SecB, which functions as a homotetramer (16Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2728-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is the product of the secB gene that encodes a polypeptide of 155 amino acids (18Kumamoto C.A. Nault A.K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 75: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At physiological ionic strength and pH, the SecB tetramer is stable. The equilibrium constant is such that even at 20 nm, which is well below the concentration in vivo, estimated to be 4 μm (2Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2728-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), neither dimer nor monomer was detected when a solution was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Studies of the oligomeric state of SecB using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry optimized to study noncovalent association also detected a tetramer over a wide range of temperature and pH. The tetramer could be dissociated directly into monomers by heating at the atmosphere-vacuum interface of the mass spectrometer with no evidence of intermediate species. Thermal denaturation of the polypeptide probably occurs without first destroying specific interface contacts. In contrast, when disruption was effected by raising the pH to 11, a dimeric species was observed (16Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The observation of dimeric intermediates during dissociation indicates that the monomers within the tetramer interact through two different interfaces because the stability of one interacting interface is more sensitive to high pH than is the other. If all interfaces were the same the dimeric state would not be favored; one would see monomers, dimers, and trimers as well. Thus it was concluded that the SecB tetramer is a dimer of dimers (16Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This model for the structural organization is reinforced by the identification of single aminoacyl substitutions that shift the equilibrium to favor a dimeric form of SecB. The stretch of polypeptide spanning aminoacyl residues 76–80 must be involved in forming contacts at one of the two interfaces in the tetramer. These residues most likely are directly involved in contacts at the interface, but we cannot yet eliminate the possibility that the substitutions cause a conformational change that is propagated to the interface. In light of the observation that the changes in the aminoacyl residues at positions 76, 78, and 80 alter the oligomeric state of SecB, the original conclusion (3Kimsey H.H. Dagarag M.D. Kumamoto C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22831-22835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that they form the binding site for the ligand must be reassessed. Interaction between the SecB tetramer and its non-native polypeptide ligands, which is of high affinity but readily reversible, has been proposed to be the result of simultaneous occupancy of the subsites by different stretches of the polypeptide ligands (19Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Topping T.B. Smith V.F. Bruce J.E. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The subsites might be contained entirely within monomeric units or involve interactions at one or both of the interfaces between dimers. Even if neither interface were part of the binding site, a dimeric form of SecB would be expected to have low affinity for its ligands because it could provide only half of the binding energy that would result from interaction with the tetrameric form. Thus we cannot definitively conclude that the residues that were altered in the variants are involved directly in forming the binding site. However, SecBF74I, which is substituted at the position adjacent to those that define the interface, is tetrameric at the concentrations used in this study, and yet it binds ligand weakly. Thus, the interface of dimers is a likely candidate for the site of ligand binding. We thank Deborah L. Diamond for purification of SecB, SecBF74I, and SecBE77K."

The ability of thioesterases to regulate acyl-CoA concentration in the cell may provide a mechanism for the control of lipid metabolism. So far, the termination of chain elongation in fatty acid synthesis has been attributed to an acyl-CoA hydrolase/thioesterase in the mammary glands of certain species as well as the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (9Libertini L.J. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1393-13401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Knudsen J. Clark S. Dils R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thioesterases also control the acylation state of some proteins, such as signal transduction proteins, and their intracellular localization (11Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Thus, a recently cloned thioesterase, the acyl-protein thioesterase 1, deacylates α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and Ha-Ras in vivo (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and thereby regulates the membrane association of these proteins and their activation. Acyl-CoA and acyl-CoA thioesterases were also involved in intracellular traffic. The formation of transport vesicles from the cis to the medial Golgi was stimulated by long chain fatty acyl-CoA, and blocked by a nonhydrolyzable analog of palmitoyl-CoA, suggesting a role of acyl-CoA thioesterase(s) in vesicular budding (13Pfanner N.

Recent data have shown that association of human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef protein with an acyl-CoA thioesterase, called human thioesterase, is required for the Nef-induced down-regulation of CD4 (15Liu L.X.

The Eps15 protein is a recently identified component of plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits required for receptor-mediated endocytosis (17Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J.

Eps15 does not contain a characterized enzymatic site, and its function seems to rely on its ability to drive the formation of multimolecular complexes. Its C-terminal domain (DIII) contains binding sites for the AP-21 clathrin adaptor complex (20Benmerah A. Bègue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol.

To characterize new Eps15-associated proteins, 35S-labeled cell lysates were precipitated with a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Eps15 fusion protein. This approach led to the identification of a 48-kDa protein that specifically bound to fusion proteins derived from the central domain (DII) of Eps15. However, the association between Eps15 and p48 may be fortuitous, since it could not be confirmed in vivo. Characterization of p48 indicates that this protein belongs to a new family of acyl-CoA thioesterases. Tissue expression and intracellular distribution were analyzed. Human B cell line transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (a gift of F. Le Deist, Hôpital Necker, Paris, France), human 293T (a gift of J. P. De Villartay, Hôpital Necker, Paris, France), and murine NIH3T3 and human HeLa cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France). The production and characterization of the rabbit polyclonal antibody AC139 against mouse p48 is described below and under “Results.” Mouse monoclonal antibody P5D4 (IgG1) against the YTDIEMNRLGK epitope of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was a kind gift of Dr. T. Kreis (27Kreis T. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Green fluorescent mitochondrial probe MitoTraker™ Green FM (GFM) was purchased from Molecular Probes. The different Eps15-derived GST fusion proteins encoding the full-length protein (GST-Eps15), the N-terminal domain (GST-DI), the central domain (GST-DII), and the C-terminal domain (GST-DIII) were described previously (20Benmerah A.

The cDNA of humaneps15 subcloned in pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (28Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Bègue B. Mégarbané B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf- Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was used as a template to generate the different cDNA fragments encoding part of the central domain of Eps15 as described previously (20Benmerah A.

The cDNA fragments were subcloned between theBamHI and the XhoI site of the PGEX5.1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) in frame with the GST moiety. The cDNA of the two murine p48 isoforms corresponded to EST I.M.A.G.E. clone ID 514415 (GenBankTM accession numberAA061148) and EST I.M.A.G.E. clone ID 602142 (GenBankTMaccession number AA145599) (29Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) cloned in pBluescript SK and were obtained from the UK HGMP Resource Center (Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The EST clones were sequenced using the T3 and T7 primers and internal 18–20-mer primers. Sequencing reactions were performed using the double-stranded dideoxy termination method (Dye Terminator cycle sequencing Ready Reaction kit, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems). Exploitation of the obtained sequences was performed using the ABI PRISM program, and their alignment was performed using the Genjokey II program. The cDNA of murine clone 514415 was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction to generate the p48-derived constructs. For GST fusion proteins, EcoRI and XhoI sites were introduced into the upper and the lower primers, respectively, allowing subcloning of the polymerase chain reaction products in the PGEX5.1 vector. The VSV-tagged form of p48 was generated by introducing aSmaI site in the lower primer, replacing the stop codon of p48 and allowing the in frame introduction of the VSV-G epitope beginning at the C terminus of p48. The VSV-tagged p48 construct was subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands) and transfected in subconfluent HeLa cells for transient expression using the CalPhos Maximizer Transfection Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Murine multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg/lane of poly(A)+ RNA was first incubated with the hybridization solution (ExpressHyb, CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 30 min. A 1.5-kilobase pair probe, corresponding to the entire sequence of p48 (cDNA clone 514415), was randomly primed with [α-32P]dCTP using MegaprimeTM DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and added to fresh hybridation solution at a final concentration of 2 × 106 cpm/ml. The blot was further incubated with probe-containing hybridation solution with gentle shaking at 68 °C for 1 h and then washed four times, for a total of 40 min, with 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature and twice, for a total of 20 min, with 0.1× sodium chloride/sodium citrate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 °C. The blot was used for autoradiography at −70 °C for 60 h. GST fusion proteins derived from Eps15 were produced as described previously (20Benmerah A. Bègue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Bègue B. Mégarbané B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf- Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The protocol for production of GST fusion proteins derived from p48 was modified, since these fusion proteins proved to be insoluble, remaining in the bacterial pellet. First, a solubilization assay was attempted, shaking sonicated bacterial pellets in a 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm1,4-dithiothreitol solution for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized proteins were recovered after a 15,000 × gcentrifugation at 4 °C for 50 min and diluted 1:10 (v/v) to a final concentration of 0.6 m urea in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The second way to extract insoluble fusion proteins from the bacterial pellet consisted in growing bacteria at room temperature and increasing the number of sonication cycles. Before immunization, the rabbits were bled in order to obtain preimmune sera. For immunization, 200 μg of GST-p48 fusion proteins resolubilized in 0.6 murea solution were injected intradermically with complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) in the back of the rabbits. Successive injections were performed on day 15 (200 μg of fusion proteins in incomplete Freund's adjuvant), day 30 (same conditions), and day 31 (100 μg of fusion proteins injected intravenously). Rabbits were bled from the ear artery on day 45 to test the immune response by Western blot and then bled once a week for 4 weeks. Finally, rabbits were reboosted with an injection of 100 μg of fusion proteins and completely bled 2 weeks later. Partially purified IgG fractions were prepared from nonimmune and immune sera by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), containing a mix of protease inhibitors (4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma)). For precipitation, cell lysates were cleared with GST coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After removal of the beads, lysates were incubated 1 h with Eps15- or p48-derived GST fusion proteins (25 μg of fusion proteins/20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads/107 cells). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In biosynthetic labeling experiments with 35S-labeled amino acids (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the precipitates were washed six times with 100 mm borate buffer, pH 8.3 containing 1.3m NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100, twice with Hepes buffer, pH 8, containing 10% glycerol, twice with Hepes buffer, pH 8, containing 1 m urea, and twice with Hepes buffer, pH 8. For Western blotting, acrylamide gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, and 30% methanol. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween. Blots were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-p48 polyclonal antibody AC139 (1:1000) revealed using peroxidase-labeled pig anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antiserum (1:20,000), and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purification of the p48 protein was performed according to a modification of a published procedure (28Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Bègue B. Mégarbané B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf- Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton X-100 lysates of 1 × 108 NIH3T3 or 4 × 108 HeLa cells were cleared successively with GST and GST-DII Eps15-derived fusion protein deprived of the p48 interaction site (GST-DII308/471) and then precipitated for 2 h using a GST-DII Eps15-derived fusion protein containing the p48 interaction site (GST-DII471/538) (50 μg of fusion protein/20 μl of beads/1 × 108 cells). After extensive washes of beads, the precipitated proteins were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 20 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems) in CAPS buffer (Sigma) containing 10% methanol. Transferred proteins were revealed with Coomassie Blue. The bands to be analyzed were excised and directly processed for amino acid sequence determination in a sequencer (model 477A, Applied Biosystems) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (model 1201, Applied Biosystems). Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured at 22 °C using a spectrophotometric assay (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cell lysates obtained from 12 × 107 cells were successively precipitated with 50 μg of GST fusion proteins. After extensive washes (six times with 100 mm borate buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1.3 m NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100; twice with Hepes buffer, pH 8, containing 10% glycerol; and twice with Hepes buffer, pH 8), beads were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.05 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 0.1 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm of acyl-CoA of different lengths (C6-CoA, C10-CoA, C14-CoA, and C18-CoA from Sigma) as substrates. After a 7-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by a brief centrifugation to eliminate beads. Supernatants were immediately monitored spectrophotometrically by recording absorbance at 412 nm. For mitochondrial labeling, NIH3T3 or transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips. After a 1-day culture, cells were washed in 37 °C prewarmed serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with a green-labeled mitochondrial probe (GFM, Molecular Probes) at 200 μm in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After removing the medium containing nonincorporated probe, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and then washed five times in PBS. For intracellular immunofluorescence, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.03 m sucrose for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 30 min at room temperature. After quenching for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl-PBS, cells were washed in PBS and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (permeabilization buffer). Subsequent steps were performed at room temperature in permeabilizing buffer. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 45 min. After three washes, primary antibodies were revealed by incubating the cells for 45 min with Texas Red-coupled secondary antibodies. After three washes in permeabilizing buffer and one wash in PBS, cells were mounted on microscope slides in 100 mg/ml Mowiol (Calbiochem), 25 mg/ml DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, Sigma), 25% glycerol (v/v), 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Samples were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) or to a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). No immunofluorescence staining was observed when secondary antibodies were used without the first antibody or with an irrelevant first antibody. Eps15-derived GST fusion proteins were previously used to map the binding site for AP-2 (20Benmerah A. Bègue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and to study the binding specificity of Eps15 homology domains (24Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the present study, in order to identify new Eps15-associated proteins, GST fusion proteins encompassing the whole length of Eps15 or each of its three domains were used to precipitate35S-labeled cell lysates of murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.1 A), HeLa cells, or human Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells. As previously shown, a GST-Eps15 fusion protein (Fig. 1 A, lane 5) precipitated polypeptides of 100 (Fig. 1 A, a) and 50 kDa (Fig. 1 A, b) corresponding, respectively, to the α- and β-adaptins and to the μ2 subunit of AP-2. An additional band was observed that migrated just below μ2 with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 1 A, c). This 48-kDa polypeptide, p48, was also specifically precipitated by GST-DII but not by GST alone or by GST-DI or GST-DIII fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 3,2, and 4, respectively), showing that p48 specifically binds to the central domain of Eps15. To allow SDS-PAGE purification and subsequent NH2 terminus microsequencing of the 48-kDa polypeptide, a series of truncated forms of GST-DII were produced in order to obtain a fusion protein able to precipitate p48 but with a smaller molecular weight to permit its correct separation from the precipitating GST fusion proteins (not shown). Using a 35-kDa truncated form of GST-DII (GST-DII471/538) containing the p48 binding site, it was possible to precipitate sufficient amounts of the 48-kDa polypeptide from cell lysates of 108 murine NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B,lane 2) or 4 × 108 human HeLa cells (not shown) for microsequencing by Edman degradation. Microsequences of the N termini of murine and human p48 were obtained in one run and confirmed by three other runs (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). The amino acids at positions 14 and 16 of murine microsequence could not be determined and are represented byX in Fig. 1 C. N terminus sequences of both human and murine p48 were submitted to a set of protein data bases using the BLAST program. No homology with any known protein were found, indicating that p48 is a new protein. The sequences were then compared with GenBankTM EST data bases. In the human EST data base, one clone (EST 98062, GenBankTMaccession number AA384507) was found identical to the sequenced N terminus of human p48 but was incomplete. This clone shows high sequence similarity to murine p48 protein, indicating that the p48 polypeptides precipitated from both murine and human cells correspond to the same protein (not shown). However, since it was not possible to obtain a complete cDNA for the human p48 (see “Discussion”), our efforts were concentrated on murine p48. In murine EST data bases, two EST clones (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone ID 602142 and 514415) showed, respectively, 100 and 90% sequence identity with the sequenced N terminus of murine p48 (Fig.1 C and data not shown). Undetermined amino acids indicated by an X at positions 14 and 16 corresponded in both clones to a histidine residue. These two clones derived from a Stratagene mouse testis library had been obtained by unidirectional cloning using an oligo(dT) primer. Complete sequencing of the two clones revealed that they contained the entire coding region and encoded two isoforms sharing 95% identity at the nucleotide level. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for EST clones 514415 and 602142 are shown in Fig. 2. The cDNA clone 514415 contains a 5′-untranslated region of 97 nucleotides with a Kozak box upstream from the ATG (position 98) coding for the putative initial methionine, a coding region of 1317 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 143 nucleotides, for a total of 1557 nucleotides. The 3′-untranslated sequence contains several polyadenylation consensus sequences, AATAAA (positions 1470, 1497, 1504, 1508, and 1512), followed by a short poly(A)+ tail starting at position 1536. The cDNA clone 602142 contains a 5′-untranslated region of 110 nucleotides, a coding region of 1317 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 85 nucleotides including a polyadenylation sequence at position 1482 and a poly(A)+ tail starting at position 1503, for a total of 1512 nucleotides. The amino acid sequences deduced from both murine cDNA clones contain 439 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 50.6 kDa. These two isoforms share 96% identity and 98% similarity. The amino acid and nucleotide differences between clones 602142 and 514415 are indicated in Fig. 2. In both isoforms, the putative initial methionine is located 21 amino acids upstream of the beginning of the sequence obtained by microsequencing of the N terminus (Fig. 2,boldface residues). It is interesting to notice that a cleavage site is predicted between amino acids Gly21and Leu22, using the Signal PV1.1 cleavage site analysis program. Therefore, the initial 21 amino acids potentially constitute a leader peptide (see below), and the 48-kDa apparent size of the band observed on SDS-PAGE is in agreement with the size predicted for the expressed proteins after removal of the potential leader sequence (48.3 kDa). Northern blot analysis using the EST clone 514415 cDNA as a probe revealed in all mouse tissues a single mRNA transcript of approximately 2 kilobase pairs (Fig. 3 A), a result in keeping with the fact that EST clones corresponding to p48 were obtained from cDNA libraries of various cell types and organs (not shown). In order to study the tissue distribution of p48 at the protein level, a polyclonal antibody against murine p48 was produced. GST fusion proteins encoding the full length of the EST clone 514415 coding sequence or the same sequence deleted of the putative peptide leader sequence were constructed and used as immunogens. A partially purified IgG fraction derived from serum 139 was further used for biochemical studies. The AC139 antibody recognized a 48-kDa band in murine cell lysates (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) and in cell lysates precipitated with GST-DII471/538 (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). This 48-kDa band was observed neither when cell lysates were precipitated with GST-DII308/471 (Fig. 3 B,lane 2) nor when the preimmune serum was used instead of AC139 (data not shown). The AC139 antibody stained a 48-kDa band in GST-DII471/538 precipitates obtained from homogenates of all tested murine organs (Fig. 3 C and data not shown), confirming the ubiquitous expression of p48. Homology searches in the GenBankTM human EST data base using the murine coding sequence (EST clone 514415) led to the identification of a series of human EST clones in cDNA libraries derived from various tissues including thyroid, ovary, fetal liver, spleen, placenta, testis, and aorta. Nucleic acid alignment of all available EST clones led to a coding sequence starting at the same level as protein sequence obtained by microsequencing (not shown). This sequence was further confirmed by sequencing polymerase chain reaction products encompassing the alignment. The deduced protein sequence encompassed 418 amino acids (out of 439 for the complete murine sequence) and showed 85% amino acid identity and 92% similarity with the murine protein (Fig. 4 A), indicating that p48 is a conserved protein. Homology searches in other DNA data bases confirmed that p48 is a conserved protein and led to the identification of putative orthologs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes including Rattus norvegicus,Drosophilia melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans,Arabidopsis thaliana, Helicobacter pylori,Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli"
https://openalex.org/W1977878747,"We describe the primary structure of eukaryotic molybdopterin synthase small and large subunits and compare the sequences of the lower eukaryote, Aspergillus nidulans, and a higher eukaryote, Homo sapiens. Mutants in the A. nidulans cnxG (encoding small subunit) and cnxH(large subunit) genes have been analyzed at the biochemical and molecular level. Chlorate-sensitive mutants, all the result of amino acid substitutions, were shown to produce low levels of molybdopterin, and growth tests suggest that they have low levels of molybdoenzymes. In contrast, chlorate-resistant cnx strains have undetectable levels of molybdopterin, lack the ability to utilize nitrate or hypoxanthine as sole nitrogen sources, and are probably null mutations. Thus on the basis of chlorate toxicity, it is possible to distinguish between amino acid substitutions that permit a low level of molybdopterin production and those mutations that completely abolish molybdopterin synthesis, most likely reflecting molybdopterin synthase activity per se. Residues have been identified that are essential for function including the C-terminal Gly of the small subunit (CnxG), which is thought to be crucial for the sulfur transfer process during the formation of molybdopterin. Two independent alterations at residue Gly-148 in the large subunit, CnxH, result in temperature sensitivity suggesting that this residue resides in a region important for correct folding of the fungal protein. Many years ago it was proposed, from data showing that temperature-sensitivecnxH mutants had thermolabile nitrate reductase, that CnxH is an integral part of the molybdoenzyme nitrate reductase (MacDonald, D. W., and Cove, D. J. (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 47, 107–110). Studies of temperature-sensitivecnxH mutants isolated in the course of this study do not support this hypothesis. Homologues of both molybdopterin synthase subunits are evident in diverse eukaryotic sources such as worm, rat, mouse, rice, and fruit fly as well as humans as discussed in this article. In contrast, molybdopterin synthase homologues are absent in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Precursor Z and molybdopterin are undetectable in this organism nor do there appear to be homologues of molybdoenzymes. We describe the primary structure of eukaryotic molybdopterin synthase small and large subunits and compare the sequences of the lower eukaryote, Aspergillus nidulans, and a higher eukaryote, Homo sapiens.

W., and Cove, D. J. (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 47, 107–110). Studies of temperature-sensitivecnxH mutants isolated in the course of this study do not support this hypothesis. Homologues of both molybdopterin synthase subunits are evident in diverse eukaryotic sources such as worm, rat, mouse, rice, and fruit fly as well as humans as discussed in this article. In contrast, molybdopterin synthase homologues are absent in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Precursor Z and molybdopterin are undetectable in this organism nor do there appear to be homologues of molybdoenzymes. high performance liquid chromatography rapid amplification of cDNA ends kilobase pair(s) Molybdoenzymes play essential roles in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles in most organisms. For instance, in higher eukaryotes including humans, sulfite oxidase is required for the degradation of sulfur amino acids converting sulfite to sulfate (1Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In certain lower eukaryotes such as Aspergillus nidulans, another molybdoenzyme nitrate reductase is required for the important ecological process of nitrate assimilation to ammonium (2Cove D.J. Biol. Rev. 1969; 54: 291-303Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, a few molybdoenzymes exist in both eukaryotic groups, including xanthine dehydrogenase, which is important in the breakdown process of purines to uric acid (3Ichida K. Amaya Y. Kamatani N. Nishino T. Hosoya T. Sakai O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).For catalytic activity, these enzymes require the molybdenum cofactor, a prosthetic group that consists of a novel pterin called molybdopterin linked by its 6-alkyl side chain to a dithiolene group, which coordinates molybdenum. Its chemical structure and likely biosynthetic pathway were proposed by Rajagopalan (5Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar) and are shown in Fig. 1. The presence of molybdenum cofactor has been demonstrated indirectly in a variety of biological material, such as cow milk and rabbit or fowl liver, by its ability to assemble active holo-nitrate reductase in cell-free extracts of a nit-1 mutant from the related fungusNeurospora crassa (6Ketchum P.A. Cambier H.Y. Frazier W.A. Madanski C.H. Nason A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The nit-1 mutant lacks the cofactor but contains inactive apo-nitrate reductase. Similarly, the presence of the molybdenum cofactor has also been demonstrated indirectly in the fungus, A. nidulans (7Garrett R.G. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 147: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Pleiotropic loss of human molybdoenzymes, including sulfite oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase, results in a severe clinical disease for which no known therapy exists (8Mize C. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to this extreme phenotype, impaired molybdoenzymes in the lower eukaryotes such as A. nidulans result in differences in simple growth characteristics,vis à visthe inability to grow on nitrate or hypoxanthine as the sole nitrogen source. Such phenotypes are easily observable and permit convenient genetic analyses (9Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These features make the study of the molybdenum cofactor in A. nidulans attractive and indeed allowed Cove and Pateman (9Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Pateman et al. (10Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to isolate molybdenum cofactor-deficient mutants some 3 decades ago. Their genetic analyses of mutants, isolated on the basis of screening for the inability to grow on nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen, indicated the presence of five unlinked loci. The mutants were shown to lack nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase, and this suggested that these loci were involved in the synthesis of a cofactor common to both nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase, accordingly designated as cnx(common component for nitrate reductase andxanthine dehydrogenase) with the gene allocations,cnxABC, cnxE, cnxF, cnxG, and cnxH.In addition to screening for lack of growth on nitrate, improved methods were found to allow selection of cnx mutants. One procedure involved direct selection for nitrate non-utilization by the putrescine starvation technique (11Cove D.J. Heredity. 1976; 36: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Herman C. Clutterbuck A.J. Aspergillus Newsletter. 1966; 7: 13-14Google Scholar). Here a putrescine auxotrophic mutant strain (puA2) grown on minimal medium containing nitrate as the nitrogen source and a severely limiting concentration of putrescine produced small compact colonies. From these colonies, rapidly growing, spidery sectors of growth were observed which, on isolation, were found to result from a secondary mutation affecting nitrate utilization. Although the underlying mechanism and physiology of the putrescine starvation method are unclear, fortuitously a proportion of these sectors was found to be cnx mutants. In this way, cnx mutants could be easily and directly selected on the basis of nitrate non-utilization. A second selection technique involved the isolation of mutants resistant to the toxic substance, chlorate (13Aberg B. K. Lantbrukshögsk. Ann. 1947; 15: 37-107Google Scholar, 14Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of chlorate toxicity are unclear, this approach afforded the rapid and convenient isolation of large numbers of cnx mutants. Among the cnxmutants isolated on the basis of nitrate non-utilization (either by screening or by putrescine starvation selection), some were found to be chlorate-resistant, but intriguingly others were found to be sensitive to chlorate, both classes of mutants occurring in all fivecnx loci (11Cove D.J. Heredity. 1976; 36: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The study of the A. nidulans cnx mutants yielded limited biochemical information regarding the function of their gene products (2Cove D.J. Biol. Rev. 1969; 54: 291-303Crossref Google Scholar). Mutations in the cnxH gene were found that resulted in a temperature-sensitive phenotype on nitrate, but not hypoxanthine, as sole nitrogen source. Unexpectedly, these mutants were reported to possess thermolabile nitrate reductase, and this led MacDonald and Cove (15MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to propose that the cnxH gene produces a protein that is an integral part of the molybdoenzyme, nitrate reductase.In this article, we describe biochemical and molecular characteristics of cnxG and cnxH genes and their products as well as the characterization of chlorate-resistant, chlorate-sensitive, and temperature-sensitive mutants.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here show that the cnxG andcnxH gene products of the eukaryote, A. nidulans, are involved in the conversion of precursor Z to molybdopterin, the intermediate section of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic pathway. First, cnxG4 and cnxH3 mutant strains, most likely loss-of-function, have negligible molybdopterin compared with wild-type levels while having vastly increased levels of precursor Z. Second, amino acid sequence comparisons with prokaryotes indicate that the CnxG and CnxH proteins are the eukaryotic homologues of the small and large subunits, respectively, of molybdopterin synthase, which is required to synthesize molybdopterin from precursor Z (5Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar, 24Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Between the eukaryotic CnxG and E. coli MoaD (29Rivers S.L. McNairn E. Blasco F. Giordano G. Boxer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the small subunit, the overall similarity is low (23% identity) and concentrated mainly in the 13 C-terminal amino acid residues with 9 of 13 identical. Several amino acid substitutions in mutant strains (see below) locate either in this C-terminal conserved region or in the first 21 residues at the N terminus, in contrast a region of limited similarity. Although only a small number of mutants have been analyzed at the nucleotide level, such localization of mutations could possibly indicate functional domains of the protein. The human homologue, MOCO1-A (32Sloan J. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), is more similar to the A. nidulans CnxG protein with 39% identity, and there are residues in the central section, as well as the N and C termini, conserved in both eukaryotic proteins that might additionally be involved in function. In contrast to the molybdopterin synthase small subunit proteins, similarity of the large subunit proteins (around 29% identity between the three species) is distributed more or less evenly over their primary structure, the bacterial protein, MoaE (29Rivers S.L. McNairn E. Blasco F. Giordano G. Boxer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), being somewhat smaller than its eukaryotic counterparts, CnxH and MOCO1-B (32Sloan J. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).We have taken advantage of the ease of cnx mutant isolation in A. nidulans to identify amino acid residues important for function of molybdopterin synthase small and large subunits. Six amino acid residues were found to be essential in CnxG, the small subunit. Of these residues, three are conserved in the bacterial, fungal, and human proteins. Ala-10 and Glu-21 are within the region of low similarity near the N termini of the proteins. The third, the C-terminal residue of the small subunit, Gly-91, has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the conversion of precursor Z to molybdopterin. In the mechanism proposed from studies in E. coli, molybdopterin synthase adds dithiolene sulfur to the pterin side chain of precursor Z to form molybdopterin (5Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that molybdopterin formation requires molybdopterin synthase to be in a sulfur-charged state. This activation of the synthase is thought to occur when molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase, encoded by thecnxF gene in A. nidulans (22Appleyard M.V.C.L. Sloan J. Kana'n G.J.M. Heck I.S. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and moeBin E. coli (30Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3373-3378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Nohno T. Kasai Y. Saito T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4097-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), adds sulfur atoms to the molybdopterin synthase small subunit, i.e. CnxG in A. nidulans. The precise mechanisms are unclear but the proposed sulfur transfer might resemble the activation of ubiquitin by ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (35Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Central to this mechanism is the presence of a C-terminal Gly in CnxG, which forms a thioester with an internal Cys residue of CnxF and subsequently acts as the acceptor for reactive sulfur via a thiocarboxylate bond from an as yet unidentified sulfur donor (Fig. 7). The significance of the short region of identity between the three organisms, immediately upstream of this C-terminal Gly residue, is unknown but could be associated with this sulfur transfer process. It has been suggested (5Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar) that Gly-Gly may be required at the C terminus, but, whereas MOCO1-A and MoaD both have C-terminal Gly-Gly residues, Ser is the penultimate residue in the A. nidulans CnxG protein. Of the remaining three substitution mutations, which occur in residues conserved in both eukaryotes but not in the prokaryotic protein, Ile-85 is located in this region of high similarity toward the C terminus. Near the N terminus, replacement of Tyr-8 with a non-aromatic residue (Cys) in the short sequence Tyr-Phe-Ala, conserved between fungus and human and Phe-Phe-Ala in E. coli, suggests that an aromatic residue at this position is necessary for protein function. Finally Ala-12, present in fungal and human proteins, is not conserved in the prokaryotic protein.Figure 7Model for the interaction of molybdopterin synthase and CnxF. Sulfur is transferred from an unknown donor (X-S) by CnxF to the carboxyl group of the small subunit (CnxG) C-terminal Gly forming a reactive thiocarboxylate (5Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The sulfur is passed from CnxG to precursor Z, forming molybdopterin and allowing the small subunit to be recharged with sulfur by CnxF (22Appleyard M.V.C.L. Sloan J. Kana'n G.J.M. Heck I.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In organisms such as bacteria and higher plants, generation of mutants defective in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is usually achieved by selection for chlorate resistance. In A. nidulans, mutants can additionally be selected on the basis of nitrate non-utilization using the putrescine starvation technique, and a proportion of these mutants are sensitive to chlorate. Therefore, in A. nidulanstwo classes of cnx mutants with regard to chlorate toxicity can be obtained. Chlorate-resistant mutants cnxG4 andcnxH3 fail to produce molybdopterin and completely lack the ability to grow on nitrate even after prolonged incubation. In contrast, the chlorate-sensitive mutants cnxG2 andcnxH1 elaborate some molybdopterin and show slow but significant growth on nitrate after long incubation periods (7 days) probably reflecting low in vivo levels of nitrate reductase activity. Such results suggest that in order to become chlorate-resistant, a mutant requires the complete abolition of nitrate reductase activity, whereas the retention of some activity renders a mutant strain sensitive to chlorate. In this way, we can predict whichcnx mutants are leaky, producing low levels of molybdopterin, and which are loss-of-function, completely lacking molybdopterin, simply by testing for sensitivity or resistance to chlorate toxicity. Therefore, we would expect that low but detectable levels of molybdopterin are present in chlorate-sensitive strains,cnxG24 and cnxG20. On this basis, replacement of CnxG residues, Ala-10 or Ala-12, in these mutants leads to reduced molybdopterin synthase activity but not loss-of-function. By extension, in chlorate-resistant strains, cnxG141, cnxG100,cnxH89, and cnxH43, substitution of residues Tyr-7 or Glu-21 of CnxG, and Gly-74 or Glu-166 of CnxH, respectively, results in absence of molybdopterin due to inactivity of the molybdopterin synthase.Temperature-sensitive mutants cnxH255 and cnxH604affect the same location in the CnxH protein, cnxH255 having an addition of a Gly residue after Gly-148 and cnxH604 being an alteration in Gly-148 itself. This region of the protein does not appear to show similarity to the human or bacterial proteins. A likely interpretation is that the conformation of the CnxH protein in these mutant strains is altered substantially at the nonpermissive temperature leading to complete loss-of-function of the molybdopterin synthase. Because no molybdopterin is produced, no active nitrate reductase is formed, and hence the strains are chlorate-resistant. At the permissive temperature, the conformation of the CnxH polypeptide is such that a small but significant level of molybdopterin synthase activity is possible, molybdenum cofactor is synthesized permitting active nitrate reductase, and the strains are chlorate-sensitive. Strains cnxH35 and cnxH36 have a less extreme temperature-sensitive phenotype than cnxH255 andcnxH604. Replacement of Ala-108 therefore also effects reduced molybdopterin synthase efficiency due to alteration of protein conformation, although the structural perturbation is less severe than changes affecting Gly-148. In contrast to mutants cnxH255and cnxH604, at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C, strains cnxH35 and cnxH36 are chlorate-sensitive and thus probably produce a low level of molybdopterin. Finally, it is noteworthy that no temperature-sensitive mutations have been isolated in the cnxG gene despite fairly extensive searches previously (15MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in this study. The significance of this is unclear, but the lack of temperature-sensitive mutations may reflect the fact that cnxG is a small gene.A further point emerges from the study of the chlorate-sensitive mutants with regard to the interaction of the molybdopterin synthase subunits and the cnxF gene product, molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase. Previous analysis of pairwise double mutants between chlorate-sensitive strains, cnxH1, cnxG2, andcnxF11, showed that a cnxH1cnxF11 double mutant remains chlorate-sensitive (therefore producing molybdopterin), whereascnxG2cnxH1 and cnxG2cnxF11 double mutants become resistant (unable to produce molybdopterin) (14Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Study of combinations of mutations leading to chlorate sensitivity could therefore yield information on the tolerance of conformational changes during protein-protein interactions.The demonstration that temperature-sensitive cnxH mutants possessed thermolabile nitrate reductase led to the hypothesis advanced by MacDonald and Cove (15MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the CnxH protein is an integral part of the nitrate reductase molecule, a homodimer of around 180 kDa (36MacDonald D.W. Coddington A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Minagawa N. Yoshimoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) consisting of two identical 91-kDa polypeptide subunits (38Cooley R.N. Tomsett A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 831: 89-93Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because the validity of this proposal has never been resolved and the originalcnxH mutants with thermolabile nitrate reductase properties are lost or not available to us, two new temperature-sensitive strains,cnxH255 and cnxH604, were isolated in this study. These mutants were found to have nitrate reductase with wild-type thermolability. The cnxH gene encodes the molybdopterin synthase large subunit, and there is no evidence of nitrate reductase containing polypeptides other than the two subunits in any organism in which the enzyme has been purified including A. nidulans(38Cooley R.N. Tomsett A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 831: 89-93Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These observations, coupled with the wild-type thermal stability of nitrate reductase in our mutants, makes the proposition that CnxH is part of the nitrate reductase molecule appear less attractive.Chlorate-sensitive mutants, such as cnxG2 andcnxH1, grow better on nitrate than hypoxanthine after extended growth periods. This is also true for the temperature-sensitive mutant cnxH255 at the permissive temperature. Such mutants have been shown to produce low but measurable levels of molybdopterin. The reasons for the growth differences on nitrate and hypoxanthine are unclear, but it has been suggested that xanthine dehydrogenase has a more stringent requirement for the integrity of molybdenum cofactor than nitrate reductase (15MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or that nitrate reductase has a greater affinity for the cofactor than xanthine dehydrogenase (39Arst H.N. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1437Google Scholar).The study of the A. nidulans molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic genes may aid the identification of essential residues in other eukaryotic homologues. These are clearly observed in EST data bases including worm, rice, fruit fly, mouse, and human.2Until now, human molybdenum cofactor deficiency has been recognized as a rare disease that leads to fatality at a very young age (1Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ichida K. Amaya Y. Kamatani N. Nishino T. Hosoya T. Sakai O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but recently, late-onset symptoms have been described in two individuals who appear to have less severe forms of molybdenum cofactor deficiency (40Hughes E.F. Fairbanks L. Simmonds H.A. Robinson R.O. Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 1998; 40: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By extrapolation from the studies of A. nidulanschlorate-sensitive cnx mutants, these milder symptoms in humans could be the result of alteration of certain residues leading to low molybdopterin production with concomitant decrease in the elaboration of molybdoenzymes. The position of the A. nidulans CnxG residues which result in a leaky phenotype is conserved in the human protein. Reduced levels of molybdopterin due to residue changes may be less easily diagnosed in humans than severe deficiency and escape detection. Therefore, milder forms of human molybdenum cofactor deficiency could be more common in the population than originally thought.It is perhaps surprising that both cnxG and cnxHgenes are absent from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,2 an organism of immense technological interest as well as being a model eukaryote. Their absence however supports our inability to demonstrate the presence of precursor Z and molybdopterin in yeast. 3I. S. Heck, unpublished data. From the genome sequence, it is clear that S. cerevisiae does not possess nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase (or probably any molybdoenzyme) which reflects much earlier observations that the yeast cannot grow on nitrate or hypoxanthine as sources of nitrogen. Because molybdoenzymes and the molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic pathway are found in most organisms from bacteria to man, it seems likely that at some point during evolution S. cerevisiae has lost one of the cofactor biosynthetic genes, making redundant the genes encoding the remainder of the pathway and those specifying molybdoenzymes.Note Added in ProofThe half-life of nitrate reductase in temperature-sensitive mutants cnxH255 and cnxH604was reported to be approximately wild-type. However, the nitrate reductase assay used was that normally used for N. crassa(26Heck I.S. Ninnemann H. Phytochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To circumvent the unlikely possibility that this was the reason our results differed from MacDonald and Cove (15MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we repeated the analysis of cnxH604 and wild-type with the A. nidulans nitrate reductase assay procedure used by MacDonald and Cove (15MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The results are presented in the Fig. 8. Nitrate reductase activity in the wild-type was maximal after 2.5 min. In contrast, the maximum activity of cnxH604 was not reached until 10 min, after an initial increase in activity of 27%. The higher standard deviation values in the mutant result from variation in this initial increase (which was not observed in two of three experiments). The average half-life calculated for cnxH604 was 22.2 min compared with 19.25 min for wild-type. Even although formation of active nitrate reductase may not have a significant effect on the apparent rate of inactivation in the later stages of the experiment, there is a clear and significant superimposition of nitrate reductase formation and inactivation at the start of the incubation period. Consistent with the low specific activity of nitrate reductase from the mutant, these findings might be expolained by a kinetic limitation of nitrate reductase formation in vivo, resulting in accumulation of precursor form(s) that can form nitrate reductasein vitro. As discussed in the text, however, we can see no evidence that the half-life of nitrate reductase is significantly lower in our temperature-sensitive cnxH mutants than in the wi"

Each GroEL subunit comprises three domains; the equatorial domain containing the ATP binding pocket and most intra-ring and all inter-ring contacts, which is connected via the intermediate domain to the apical domain, which contains binding sites for unfolded proteins and GroES (7Weissman J.S. Fenton W.A. Braig K. Adams P.A. Horwich A.L. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 173-178Google Scholar). Folding substrate binding, ATP binding, GroES binding, folding substrate release, and ATP hydrolysis by GroEL subunits is a highly co-ordinated sequence of events (8Hayer-Hartl M.K. Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Science. 1995; 269: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and this, together with their forming the enclosed central folding cavity, is likely to make the double-toroidal structure formed by the GroEL subunits essential to most of the protein folding activities of this chaperonin in vivo (9Weber F. Keppel F. Georgopoulos C. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.-U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Quite recently, however, recombinant GroEL apical domain “minichaperones” proved to have molecular chaperone activities for a limited range of substrates in vitro (10Zahn R. Buckle A.M. Perrett S. Johnson C.M. Corrales R.J. Golbik R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15024-15029Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activity of these minichaperones in vivo suggests functionality in protein folding for single GroEL subunits (11Chatellier J. Hill F. Lund P.A. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15024-15029Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence at present for a function-related disassembly of the group I chaperonins other than to the single ring state of mitochondrial hsp60 (12Picketts D.J. Mayanil C.S.K. Gupta R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is also folding-competentin vivo and in vitro (13Nielsen K.L. Cowan N.J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4767-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar)), together with the archaebacterial chaperonins, constitute class II chaperonins. Apart from being defined by sequence homology (17Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), they are also characterized by having eight- or nine-membered rings within the double torus (18Waldmann T.

Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and by a unique helix-turn-helix motif in the apical domains of their component subunits, which might function as a GroES-type lid on the chaperonin cylinder (20Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.-O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S.

Biol. 1998; 5: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), thereby removing the requirement for a GroES-like co-chaperonin in class II chaperonins. The main function of CCT in the eukaryotic cytosol, as presently understood, is to promote the correct folding of actins and tubulins (23Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. Miklos D. Horwich A.L. Sternlicht M.L. Sternlicht H. Nature. 1992; 358: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 24Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M. Driscoll J.K. Willison K. Yaffe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). CCT is hetero-oligomeric and is unique among chaperonins in the complexity of its subunit composition. Its eight distinct but sequence-related subunits (14Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), each the product of an essential gene, are highly conserved across eukaryotes. The degree of sequence relatedness between subunit orthologues across species possibly argues for unique and conserved functions for each particular subunit type. These subunits are deployed as two eight-membered rings stacked back-to-back (18Waldmann T. Nimmesgern E. Nitsch M. Peters J. Pfeifer G. Muller S. Kellerman J. Engel A. Hartl F.-U. Baumeister W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Marco S. Carracosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and “nearest neighbor” analysis of subunit microcomplexes, containing two or three subunits, has provided evidence that within each ring a fixed order of subunits may prevail (26Liou A.F.K. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The current view of CCT-mediated protein folding, based on in vitro folding studies, is that a hetero-oligomeric particle containing all eight subunits is required and mechanisms similar to those for GroEL-ES mediated folding have been proposed (e.g. Ref. 27Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, a number of observations are not consistent with the subunits of group II chaperonins functioning only as components of the oligomeric chaperonin particle. Small amounts of CCT polypeptides exist as free subunits and microcomplexes containing two or three subunits, which can be detected after sized-based resolutions of cell extracts (26Liou A.F.K. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Incorporation of newly synthesized CCT subunits into chaperonin particles occurs via a single ring “template” generated by nucleotide-dependent disassembly to single rings and microcomplexes (29Liou A.K.F. McCormack E.M. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The folding cycle of an archaebacterial chaperonin appears to involve nucleotide-dependent disassembly to free subunits (30Quaite-Randall E. Trent J.D. Josephs R. Joachimiak A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28818-28823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The functional cycle of group II chaperonins is therefore likely to be more different from that of group I chaperonins than previously supposed (27Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A mechanistic difference between the two chaperonin types is also indicated by the recent electron microscopy study of Llorca et al. (31Llorca O. Smyth M.G. Marco S. Carracosa J.L. Willison K.R. Valpuesto J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10091-10094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which revealed very extensive loosening of both intra- and inter-ring contacts between subunits in just one of the two CCT rings upon binding of ATP or the non-hydrolyzable analog, AMP-PNP. No equivalent opening out occurs in GroEL upon ATP binding, but rather, large movements about hinge regions in the intermediate domain result in the movements of substrate binding sites on the apical domain up and away from the central cavity (3Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).Our own data, based on immunofluorescence microscopy and various biochemical analyses, utilizing antibodies specific to each of the eight CCT subunits, have consistently indicated that substantial amounts of CCT subunits are not always components of the hetero-oligomeric chaperonin particle in the environment of the cell (28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Roobol A. Holmes F.E. Hayes N.V.L. Baines A.J. Carden M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 33Roobol A. Sahyoun Z.P. Carden M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2408-2415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Initially, we interpreted these data as indicative of chaperonin particles of variable subunit composition, but we, and others, have consistently failed to demonstrate such particles by a variety of isolation procedures. We recently reported that, although immunoprecipitations targeted at the majority of CCT subunits from cell extracts yielded the “core” hetero-oligomeric particle, immunoprecipitation in the presence of intracellular levels of ATP tended to yield only the subunit targeted for precipitation (see Fig. 8 in Ref. 28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations were made in cell extracts prepared in a buffer containing 90 mm KCl. We report here that at intracellular levels of K+ ions and ATP, there is indeed substantial disassembly of the CCT chaperonin to free subunits contingent upon the K+-dependent hydrolysis of ATP. This disassembly is readily reversed upon removal of ATP and is dependent on (an) additional factor(s) present in cell extracts but removed during purification of the CCT particle.RESULTSThe data presented below were obtained from cell extracts and CCT prepared from the ND7/23 cell line unless otherwise stated. Many of these experiments were also carried out with P19 cell line with essentially the same results.Immunoprecipitation of CCT Subunits at Intracellular Levels of K+ and ATPThroughout, antibody concentrations used for immunoprecipitation were such that the targeted subunit was completely precipitated under denaturing conditions, as determined by immunoblot analysis of the residual supernatants (28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have recently reported (28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that immunoprecipitation of CCT subunits from cell extracts is dramatically dependent on the nucleotide content of the extract. Briefly, most CCT subunit-specific antibodies co-precipitated the other seven subunits of CCT from cell extracts prepared in the absence of added nucleotide, i.e. the “core” hetero-oligomeric chaperonin particle was immunoprecipitated. However, addition of 2 mm ATP to cell extracts tended to yield immune precipitates of the targeted subunit only, with the exception of the CCTγ-directed antibody, which still co-precipitated other CCT subunits, albeit to a lesser extent than in the absence of nucleotides (see Fig. 8 in Ref. 28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At this time we routinely used 90 mm KCl in our cell extraction buffer. We now report that this effect of nucleotide is highly dependent on the K+ ion content of the extract. There was co-precipitation of CCT subunits in the presence of 2 mm ATP in the absence of K+ions and this gradually diminished as K+ ion concentration was increased (e.g. Fig.1 A, upper panel), and at physiological levels of K+ ion (140 mm), immunoprecipitation of the single, targeted subunit prevailed. K+ ions could not be replaced by Na+ ions in this respect (e.g. Fig. 1 A, lower panel). At a KCl concentration of 140 mm and ATP concentrations in excess of 1 mm, i.e.physiological concentrations, all CCT subunit-specific antibodies immunoprecipitated the targeted subunit only, while in the absence of added ATP, co-immunoprecipitation of the core CCT particle prevailed (e.g. Fig. 1 B). Exceptions to this were the anti-CCTδ (Fig. 2) and anti-CCTθ (Fig. 1 B) antibodies, which, in the absence of ATP, only precipitated small amounts of the targeted subunit (presumably representing the small amounts of free CCT subunits present in cell extracts prepared under these conditions (28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It would therefore appear that within the chaperonin particle the CCTδ and CCTθ COOH termini were not accessible to antibody binding, but did become accessible once dissociated, either by ATP addition (e.g.Fig. 1 B) or by immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2). It can also be noted from the data in Fig.1 B that particular subunits dissociated more readily from the chaperonin particle as ATP levels increased, with CCTβ and CCTθ dissociating at much lower ATP concentrations than CCTγ, with other subunits showing intermediate sensitivities to ATP concentration.Figure 2A substantial proportion of cell extract content of each CCT subunit is immunoprecipitated as a single subunit in the presence of K+-ATP. The indicated CCT subunits were targeted for immunoprecipitation from 100-μl aliquots of radiolabeled ND cell extract (∼1 mg of protein/ml), in basic buffer (Fig. 1) + 0.5 (w/v) sodium deoxycholate plus 0.05% (w/v) SDS (left track of each panel), in basic buffer + 140 mm KCl (middle track of each panel), or in basic buffer + 140 mm KCl and 2 mm ATP (right track in each panel). Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 9% separation gels and detected by autoradiography. SDS-PAGE molecular size markers were 205, 116, 96, 66, 45, and 29 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The extent of K+-ATP-induced, free subunit immunoprecipitation was assessed in two ways. Immunoblot analysis of subunit content of original extracts and supernatants remaining after immunoprecipitation by anti-CCTα and by anti-CCTε antibodies (data not shown), indicated that, in the absence of ATP, 50% and 80%, respectively, of the targeted subunit were immunoprecipitated along with 40–80% of the remaining CCT subunits. At 2 mm ATP, 50% and 70%, respectively, of the targeted subunit were immunoprecipitated with 0% of the other CCT subunits. These data were confirmed and extended by a comparison of CCT subunits in immune complexes prepared under native conditions in the presence and absence of ATP with those precipitated under denaturing conditions and detected by autoradiography (Fig. 2). Taking the subunit content of immune precipitates prepared under denaturing conditions as 100% of the cell extract subunit content (28Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), quantitative analysis of the data in Fig.2 revealed that immune precipitates prepared in the presence of K+-ATP contained 100, 60, 50, 80, 60, and 100% of the extract content of CCTβ, CCTγ, CCTδ, CCTε, CCTζ, and CCTθ, respectively. From these data it would appear that a proportion of certain CCT subunits becomes inaccessible to immunoprecipitation by COOH-terminally directed antibodies in the presence of ATP, while the amounts of free CCT subunits were increased and in the cases of CCTβ and CCTθ, the addition of 2 mm ATP led to immunoprecipitation of the entire cell extract content of these two subunits. ATP-dependent liberation of immunoprecipitable free subunits was detected over a concentration range of 0.4–18.5 mg of extract protein/ml (Fig. 3).Figure 3Single subunit immunoprecipitation occurs over a range of extract protein concentrations. The indicated CCT subunits were targeted for immunoprecipitation from radiolabeled ND cell extract at 0.49 mg of protein/ml (upper panel) and 18.5 mg of protein/ml (lower panel) in basic buffer (Fig. 1) plus 140 mm KCl ± 4 mm ATP. Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 9% separation gels and detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The K+-ATP-induced increase in immunoprecipitable free CCT subunits was rapidly reversed on removal of ATP with apyrase, with restoration of core particle precipitation (Fig. 1 C). Other nucleotides were examined. 2 mm ADP addition to cell extracts led only to an overall decrease in core particle precipitated, with the possible exception of CCTζ-targeted immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Concentrations of GTP that yielded single subunit immunoprecipitates were approximately double the effective concentrations of ATP (compare upper (ATP) andmiddle (GTP) panels in Fig. 1 D). The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, was completely ineffectual in yielding single subunit immune precipitates (Fig. 1 D, lower panel), although a significant decrease in core particle precipitation was noted with increasing AMP-PNP concentrations. This last observation suggested that ATP hydrolysis might be required to generate the immunoprecipitable free CCT subunits.CCT ATPase Activity Is K+Ion-dependentCCT ATPase activity has been determined in a number of reports with quite a range of specific activities from 2.5 nmol/min/mg protein (15Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.-H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) to 25 nmol/min/mg protein (43Martin W.H. Creutz C.E. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) quoted, the adrenal medullary isoform of CCT, chromabindin A, being the most extensively characterized CCT ATPase (44Martin W.H. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2803-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Creutz C.E. Liou A. Snyder S. Brownawell A. Willison K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32035-32038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this present investigation, the ATPase activity of CCT purified from ND7/23 cells, by sucrose gradient fractionation followed by anion exchange chromatography, was measured. This preparation was free, as judged by immunoblot analysis (data not shown), of hsc70, a common contaminant of CCT preparations (46Melki R. Batelier G. Soulie S. Williams R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The CCT ATPase was highly dependent on K+ ion concentration (Fig. 4) and over the range of K+ ion concentration examined, the specific activities varied over the range reported in the literature for CCT ATPase activity (probably a reflection of the variation in K+ ion concentrations used in these reports). As with the K+ ion dependence of single subunit immunoprecipitation, Na+ ions could not effectively replace the K+requirement of the CCT ATPase (Fig. 4). The K m for KCl at 2 mm ATP was determined as 175 mm with aVm of 37.1 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 4). TheK m for ATP at 140 mm KCl was 129 μm with a Vm of 23.3 nmol/min/mg protein (data not shown). These latter figures are in good agreement with those quoted for chromabindin A (43Martin W.H. Creutz C.E. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Like chromabindin A (43Martin W.H. Creutz C.E. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the ND cell ATPase was inhibited by high (>1 mm) concentrations of Ca2+ ions, as was ATP-induced single-subunit immunoprecipitation (data not shown). In general, an excellent correlation existed between the level of CCT ATPase activity and the generation of immunoprecipitable free CCT subunits.Figure 4CCT ATPase is K+ion-dependent. The ATPase activity of purified ND cell CCT was measured by [32Pi] released by hydrolysis of γ-32P-labeled ATP. Assay buffer was 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and the indicated concentrations of KCl (■) or NaCl (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Size-exclusion Chromatography Shows K+-ATP-dependent Dissociation of CCT to Smaller Oligomer(s) and Free SubunitsThe generation of immunoprecipitable free CCT subunits at physiological levels of K+ and ATP could have reflected bona fidedisassembly under these conditions or could have been be consequent to ATP binding/hydrolysis weakening subunit binding within the chaperonin double torus, followed by complete dissociation of targeted subunit on antibody binding. Against this latter possibility was the observation that, while AMP-PNP, like ATP, is known to cause extensive loss of contacts between subunits in just one of the CCT rings (31Llorca O. Smyth M.G. Marco S. Carracosa J.L. Willison K.R. Valpuesto J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10091-10094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this non-hydrolyzable analog did not support the generation of immunoprecipitable free subunits (Fig. 1 D, lower panel). However, it was considered necessary to assess the extent of CCT disassembly in cell extracts by a second method. Gel filtration over a Superose 6 column readily resolved the ∼950-kDa chaperonin particle from the majority of the cell extract proteins (Fig.5 A, upper panel) including free CCT subunits and microcomplexes. The CCT polypeptides in ND cell extract prepared in extraction buffer containing 140 mm KCl co-eluted (Fig. 5 A, middle panel) just prior (fraction 14) to the thyroglobulin size marker (669 kDa) with very small amounts of some subunits, notably CCTβ, in the microcomplex size range (fractions 18 and 19). Prior exposure of this cell extract to 2 mm ATP (Fig. 5 B), followed by gel filtration in the same ATP-containing buffer, in addition to increasing the amounts of free subunits (fractions 19 and 20) rather than microcomplexes, also caused a consistent shift of the CCT oligomer from fraction 14 to fractions 15 plus 16. Since the apoferritin marker (443 kDa) eluted in fraction 16, this ATP-induced shift in oligomer elution position could well have been due to disassembly of the CCT double torus to single rings. The quantitation of subunit immunoprecipitation data had already indicated that, in the presence of ATP, a portion of CCT polypeptides becomes inaccessible to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of gel filtration fractions (Fig. 5, A and B, lower panels) confirmed that CCT COOH-terminal epitopes in the oligomeric species eluting in fractions 15 and 16 in the presence of ATP, were indeed much less accessible to immunoprecipitation than those in the nucleotide-free CCT double torus. As with the CCT ATPase activity, and with the generation of immunoprecipitable free subunits, Na+ ions could not replace K+ ions in increasing the amounts of free subunits, nor the shift to the smaller oligomeric species, detectable on gel filtration in the presence of ATP (data not shown).Figure 5Size-exclusion chromatography of ND cell extracts and of urea-treated rat testis CCT . 100 μl (0.5 mg of protein) (A and B) or 400 μl (2 mg of protein) (C) of ND cell extract prepared in basic buffer plus the indicated additions were resolved over a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated, and eluted with the same buffer as used for extract preparation at 0.5 ml/min, collecting 1-ml fractions. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie stain (A, upper panel) or by immunoblot (A, middle panel; B, upper panel; C) probed for CCTγ (upper band), CCTα (middle band), and CCTβ (lower band). For A and B (lower panels only), proteins in 100-μl aliquots of fractions were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-CCTε and the immunoblots of SDS-PAGE resolutions of the precipitated proteins probed with rat anti-CCTα. Buffer additions were as follows: A, 140 mm KCl; B and C, 140 mmKCl + 2 mm ATP. In D, purified rat testis CCT was exposed to 2.5 m urea for 1 h at 4 °C, then dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Dialysate was clarified by brief centrifugation and 100 μl (40 μg protein) loaded onto a Superose 6 column equilibrated and eluted with dialysis buffer at 0.5 ml/min, collecting 1-ml fractions. Immunoblots of SDS-PAGE resolutions of fractions were probed for: CCTγ (upper band), CCTθ (middle band), and CCTβ (lower band). Size exclusion chromatography molecular mass markers in (A, upper panel) were, from the left, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) and SDS-PAGE mass markers (A, upper panel) were as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This gel filtration analysis of cell extracts did not confirm the extent of disassembly of the CCT particle to free subunits which had been indicated by the immunoprecipitation experiments. Most notably, CCTγ remained entirely, and CCTα, δ, and ζ, largely, in oligomeric species. More extensive disassembly was observed when the gel filtration load, and therefore the spread of eluted peaks, was increased 4–5-fold (Fig. 5 C).

Contrary to previous reports that MAP2 is neural-specific, we recently identified MAP2 mRNA and protein in somatic and germ cells of rat testis, and showed the predominant testicular isoform is LMW. Although cytoplasmic in neural tissue, MAP2 appeared predominantly nuclear in germ cells using immunohistochemistry. We sought to determine whether this unexpected localization was due to the inclusion of exon 10 within novel LMW MAP2 isoforms. Normally excluded from the LMW MAP2c, exon 10 harbors a putative CcN motif, comprising a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) flanked by regulatory phosphorylation sites for protein kinase CK2 and cdc2 kinase. Characterization of MAP2 mRNA in adult and immature brain and testis, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction/Southern analysis and Northern blot, identified novel LMW forms containing exons 10 and 11, previously detected only in high molecular weight MAP2a and 2b. The MAP2 NLS targeted a large heterologous protein to the nucleus, as demonstrated using bacterially expressed MAP2-CcN-β-galactosidase fusion protein and an in vitro nuclear import assay. Antibodies raised against the fusion protein produced a testicular immunohistochemical staining pattern correlating with MAP2 protein distribution in the nucleus of most germ cells, and precipitated both ∼70-kDa and >220-kDa proteins recognized by the commercial MAP2-specific HM2 monoclonal antibody, supporting our hypothesis of a novel LMW MAP2 isoform. These results demonstrate the presence of a functional NLS in MAP2 and indicate that novel LMW MAP2 isoforms may be targeted to the nucleus in both neural and non-neuronal tissues.

These results demonstrate the presence of a functional NLS in MAP2 and indicate that novel LMW MAP2 isoforms may be targeted to the nucleus in both neural and non-neuronal tissues. microtubule-associated protein T-Ag CcN motif (forCK2 site, cdk site, and NLS) protein kinase CK2 cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) confocal laser scanning microscopy low molecular weight high molecular weight MAP2-CcN β-galactosidase fusion protein nuclear localization sequence cAMP-dependent protein kinase simian virus SV40 large tumor-antigen base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 5-iodacetamido-fluorescein Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2),1 the most abundant MAP in neurons (reviewed in Ref. 1Matus A. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 155-166Google Scholar), has recently been shown to be present in both somatic and germ cells of the rat testis (2Loveland K.L. Hayes T.M. Meinhardt A. Zlatic K. Parvinen M. de Kretser D.M. McFarlane J.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) forms are present in neural tissue, while in the adult rat testis the predominant MAP2 is a LMW form of ∼74 kDa, which correlates with the prevalence of transcripts that lack the projection arm coding sequences of the HMW MAP2 isoforms (2Loveland K.L.

The testis contains several MAP2 transcripts, with 6-kb mRNAs in the Sertoli and Leydig cells, and transcripts of ∼2.5 and 3.5 kb in the haploid spermatids. Each of these transcripts contain coding sequence from both the 5′ and 3′ ends of MAP2 (2Loveland K.L. Hayes T.M. Meinhardt A. Zlatic K. Parvinen M. de Kretser D.M. McFarlane J.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The initial descriptions of MAP2 indicated that three isoforms existed, with the ∼288- and 280-kDa MAP2a and MAP2b HMW isoforms containing a binding site for the regulatory RII subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a putative binding site for calmodulin, and three repeats of a tubulin binding motif (3Kindler S.

Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 155-166Google Scholar). Cloning of the cDNA encoding the ∼70-kDa MAP2c LMW isoform demonstrated that the PKA binding site and three tubulin repeats were present, but the calmodulin binding site was absent (3Kindler S. Schulz B. Goedert M. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19679-19684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a phosphatidylinositol binding site has been identified on HMW MAP2 that is absent from MAP2c (4Surridge C.D. Burns R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8051-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Burns R.G. Surridge C.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). With the report of the gene sequence and exon structure of human MAP2 (6Kalcheva N. Albala J. O'Guin K. Rubino H. Garner C. Shafit-Zagardo B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10894-10898Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it was shown that MAP2a and MAP2b differ from each other by the inclusion of exon 8 in MAP2a (7Chung W.J. Kindler S. Seidenbecher C. Garner C.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), while MAP2c lacks exons 9, 10, and 11, which encode the long projection arm of the HMW MAP2 isoforms. There are now several reports describing additional MAP2 mRNA splice variants in neuronal tissues (reviewed in Ref. 8Shafit-Zagardo B. Kalcheva N. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; see summary in Table I). The inclusion and exclusion of exons 1, 2, and 3, encoding 5′-untranslated regions, has been shown to vary (9Kalcheva N. Shafit-Zagardo B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1472-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which may conceivably impact on mRNA stability, translation, or localization. The inclusion of exon 16 yields MAP2 isoforms that contain four rather than three repeats of the tubulin binding motif (10Doll T. Meichsner M. Riederer B.M. Honegger P. Matus A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 633-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Forleo P. Couchie D. Chabas S. Nunez J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Langkopf A.

Funfschilling U. Matus A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar). An additional exon, exon 13, was identified through sequencing of the MAP2 gene (6Kalcheva N. Albala J. O'Guin K.

In contrast to MAP2 in neural tissue, testicular MAP2 appears to be abundant in the nucleus of testicular cells when examined by immunohistochemistry (2Loveland K.L. Hayes T.M. Meinhardt A. Zlatic K. Parvinen M. de Kretser D.M. McFarlane J.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An explanation for this surprising result was obtained with the identification of a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) encoded in exon 10. This sequence (Fig. 1) has the features of a typical bipartite NLS characterized by two clusters of positively charged amino acids separated by a spacer of 10–12 amino acid residues (14Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), as well as being flanked by consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase CK2 (CK2) and the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) cdc2, both of which are known to regulate NLS-dependent nuclear import of proteins such as the simian virus SV40 large tumor-antigen (T-Ag) (15Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and together with the NLS constitute the T-Ag CcN motif (forCK2 site, cdk site, and NLS). Exon 10 of MAP2 thus harbors a putative CcN motif, which may confer regulated nuclear import on MAP2. Our initial study of MAP2 in the testis demonstrated the presence of LMW mRNAs and protein, and so we hypothesized that this tissue may contain novel LMW MAP2 isoforms that include exon 10 containing the putative NLS. The present work describes the identification of novel transcripts encoding LMW MAP2 species, which contain either exon 11 or exon 10/11 in both juvenile and adult brain and testis. The functionality of this NLS is demonstrated using an in vitroassay system to measure nuclear import, and evidence for the expression of protein from these novel mRNAs based on immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections and immunoprecipitation is presented. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and female New Zealand White rabbits (6–7 weeks) were obtained from the Monash University Central Animal House. These investigations were approved by the Monash University Standing Committee on Ethics in Animal Experimentation and conform to the NHMRC/CSIRO/AAC Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes. Cells of the HTC rat hepatoma tissue culture (a derivative of Morris hepatoma 7288C) line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (17Jans D.A.

Isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the sulfhydryl labeling reagent 5-iodacetamido-fluorescein (IAF) from Molecular Probes. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed as described (22Munsie M. Schlatt S. deKretser D.M. Loveland K.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the avian myeloblastosis virus enzyme. First round polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples were prepared in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5 μl of the RT sample with Tth Plus enzyme (Biotech International, Bentleigh, Western Australia) as previously reported (22Munsie M. Schlatt S. deKretser D.M. Loveland K.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nested PCR using 1 or 0.1 μl of the first round PCR product as the template was performed in a 20-μl volume with 0.2 mmdNTPs, 1.1 units of Tth Plus, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1× Tth buffer. PCR extensions were at 58 °C for 30 s. The oligonucleotide primers and nucleotide positions listed below were based on the rat MAP2b sequence (RNMAP2R; Ref. 23Marechal D. Delapierre D. Dresse A.

Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), following transfer in 20× standard sodium citrate (SSC; Ref. 25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.S. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to MagnaCharge membrane (MSI, Westborough, MA) and fixation by UV treatment (5 min) and baking (80 °C for 30 min). Southern blot analysis followed transfer of DNA to MagnaCharge (as above) or Hybond N+ in 0.4 m NaOH (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prehybridization and hybridization with cDNAs (65 °C) and oligonucleotides (42 °C) were performed in Rapid Hyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were washed to 0.1× SSC (for Northern blots) or 0.2× SSC (for Southern blots) with 1% SDS at 65 °C. Radiolabeled cDNA was made from gel-purified PCR product (Wizard PCR Prep Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using a random primer kit (as in Ref. 22Munsie M. Schlatt S. deKretser D.M. Loveland K.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The exon 10/11 MAP2 cDNA used corresponded to 227 base pairs of the rat coding sequence (RNMAP2R; Ref. 23Marechal D. Delapierre D. Dresse A. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. 1988; 96: 231-236PubMed Google Scholar), from 4413 to 4643 bp, corresponding to amino acids 1441–1475 of rat MAP2 (see Fig. 1). It was produced as a product of RT-PCR from adult rat testis RNA using primers 26.1 and 27.1 (see above) and sequenced using dye terminator PCR on an ABI model 330 Gene Sequencer (Monash University Department of Microbiology). Oligonucleotide labeling was performed using 0.36 ng of oligonucleotide in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme (Promega) and 75 μCi of [32P]dCTP in 1× buffer supplied with the enzyme for 30 min at 37 °C. The plasmid expressing the MAP2-CcN-β-galactosidase fusion protein (MAP2-CcN-β-Gal) was derived by ligating a PCR fragment, generated using oligonucleotides 26.2 and 27.2 and encoding parts of exons 10 and 11, into the uniqueSmaI site of plasmid vector pPR2 (26Rihs H.-P. Peters R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fusion protein contains MAP2 amino acids 1441–1475 fused N-terminal to theEscherichia coli β-galactosidase (β-Gal) sequence (amino acids 9–1023; Refs. 15Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R.

The T-Ag-CcN-β-Gal fusion protein used as a control contains SV40 T-Ag amino acids 111–135, including the CcN motif (including CK2 and cdk phosphorylation sites and NLS) fused N-terminal to the β-Gal amino acids 9–1023. β-Gal fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and labeled with IAF as described previously (15Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J.

Protein concentrations were determined using the dye binding assay of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each of two rabbits received subcutaneous injections at multiple sites of approximately 400 μg of MAP2-CcN-β-Gal in 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (first immunization; Sigma) followed at 4 weeks in two weekly intervals with injections of approximately 100 μg of MAP2-CcN-β-Gal in 0.5 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). Serum was collected for testing after the third and fourth injections, and a final collection of serum was taken by cardiac puncture under anesthesia after the fifth injection. The serum used for further studies was designated DH-1. Immunohistochemistry with DH-1 was performed as described previously (22Munsie M. Schlatt S. deKretser D.M. Loveland K.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using rat tissues fixed in Bouin's fluid and embedded in paraffin. The DH-1 serum was applied at 1:2000 overnight at room temperature. Incubation with biotinylated sheep anti-rabbit (Silenus, Victoria, Australia; 1:500 dilution) for 1 h was followed by incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Silenus; 1:1000 dilution) for 30 min and development with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride to detect primary antibody binding as a brown precipitate. Harris hematoxylin was used as a blue counterstain. Application of the same protocol to MAP2 localization with the HM-2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma; in ascites fluid; recognizes HMW and LMW MAP2s) at dilutions of 1:100 to 1:400 yielded only a faint signal on testis sections. To obtain a distinct signal with this antibody, the Dako Catalyzed Signal Amplification system was employed according to the manufacturer's specification, with HM-2 at 1:400. Development and counterstaining were performed as above. Results were analyzed using an Olympus BX50 microscope and photographed using Ultra-50 Agfacolor film (Agfa-Gevaert AG, Leverkusen, Germany). A lysate of day 7 rat brain was prepared for immunoprecipitation by addition of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 kallikrien international units/ml Trasylol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to ∼310 mg/ml, followed by Dounce homogenization on ice. An equal volume of radioimmune precipitation buffer was added, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (∼13,000 rpm) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (100 μl) was precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (AMRAD Pharmacia Biotech, North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation, incubated with 10 μl of neat DH-1 immune or preimmune serum for 2 h, and then 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose added for another 90 min at 4 °C. Each sample was washed twice in 1 ml of 1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and once in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Each protein A-Sepharose pellet was boiled in 50 μl of 2× reducing sample buffer, and 10 μl of the supernatant loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with protein size standards (BenchMark; Life Technologies, Inc.). Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blocked by incubation in 3% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. All washes were in 1% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline. The HM-2 antibody was used at 1:10,000 at 37 °C for 90 min, and biotinylated anti-rabbit (1:10,000; 60 min at room temperature) and streptavidin-HRP (1:5000; 60 min at room temperature) as above. Antibody binding was detected using the ECL Plus chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Kodak X-Omat film. Analysis of nuclear import kinetics at the single cell level was performed using mechanically perforated HTC cells in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was as described previously (19Xiao C.-Y.

NLS-dependent nuclear protein import can be reconstituted in this system through the exogenous addition of cytosolic extract (reticulocyte lysate), an ATP-regenerating system, and transport substrate (0.2 mg/ml IAF-labeled fusion protein). In experiments where the ATP dependence of transport was tested, apyrase pretreatment was used to hydrolyze endogenous ATP in cytosolic extracts (10 min at room temperature with 800 units/ml) and perforated cells (15 min at 37 °C with 0.2 units/ml) (20Jans D.A.

LMW and HMW isoforms of MAP2 arise from alternative mRNA splicing, with the HMW isoforms containing the ∼3.7 kb of exon 9 sequence that encodes the large projection arm of about 150 kDa (Fig. 1). Thus, mRNAs encoding HMW and LMW isoforms can be distinguished on the basis of inclusion or exclusion of exon 9 sequences. The use of primer pairs designed to amplify mRNAs encoding HMW and LMW MAP2 isoforms (Fig.2 A) resulted in the production of multiple PCR products from both immature and mature brain and testis RNA samples (Fig. 2 B). The identity of these products as MAP2 was confirmed by DNA blot analysis using a MAP2c cDNA. Selective amplification of HMW MAP2 mRNAs was achieved using a 5′ primer in exon 9 (29Newmeyer D.D. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The predominant HMW MAP2 mRNA product sizes amplified varied between samples, with an ∼800-bp product amplified from adult testis, two products of ∼1120 and 1070 bp observed in day 15 testis, and a single prominent product of ∼1070 bp amplified from both day 25 and adult brain RNA samples. As the focus of this study is on the identification of novel LMW isoforms, the identity of these products was not investigated beyond the use of Southern blot analysis to confirm hybridization with a MAP2 probe. The 1120-bp product could correspond to a product consisting of exons 9–12, 14, 15, 17, and 18 (corresponding to MAP2a or 2b), while the 800- and 1070-bp products could derive from variants lacking exons 10 and 11 (800-bp product) or exon 11 (1070-bp product). Amplification of the LMW MAP2 transcripts using a 5′ primer in exon 6 yielded a ∼1040-bp product and a ∼760-bp product in all but the adult brain mRNA sample. These products were shown to encode MAP2 products by DNA blot analysis and were used for the subsequent amplification and characterization of novel mRNA isoforms described below. Nested PCR to achieve selective amplification of novel LMW MAP2 mRNAs from the products shown in Fig. 2 used a 3′ primer in exon 11 (Fig. 3 A), an exon not previously reported to be present in LMW MAP2 isoforms. Two products of approximately 320 and 520 bp were observed in testis and brain samples from both immature and mature animals (Fig. 3 B). These products were both recognized by the MAP2c cDNA in Southern hybridization experiments, but only the 520-bp band was bound by oligonucleotides specific to exon 10 (Fig. 3 C). The 320-bp band was purified and sequenced, which further identified it the product of a MAP2 mRNA spanning exon 6, 7, and 11, and excluding exons 9 and 10 (data not shown). Thus, the 320-bp band would encode a LMW MAP2 isoform (Fig. 3 D). The 200-bp size difference between the two PCR products corresponds to the size of exon 10 in the human MAP2 cDNA (6Kalcheva N. Albala J. O'Guin K. Rubino H. Garner C. Shafit-Zagardo B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10894-10898Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), consistent with the amplification of an mRNA spanning exons 6, 7, 10, and 11 (Fig. 3 D). Northern blot analysis was used to examine the relative abundance of these novel LMW mRNAs in brain and testis using a cDNA probe containing sequences present in exons 10 and 11 (Fig.4). This probe yielded a hybridization signal at >9 kb in the brain RNA samples at all ages, demonstrating, as expected, the presence of this sequence in HMW MAP2 mRNAs. The relative intensity of the >9-kb band appeared greatest in the day 9 post partum brain sample. In addition, the day 9 brain sample contained a ∼6-kb mRNA signal, which would correspond to one or more of the novel LMW MAP2 mRNAs lacking the 3.7-kb exon 9 sequence (Fig.4 B). In the testis, a very faint hybridization signal at >9 kb was detected in the adult sample, but distinct hybridiz"

To define the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we investigated the PDGF- and insulin-induced glucose uptake, translocation of glucose transporters, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity in 3T3-L1, 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC, and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. Insulin and PDGF stimulated glucose uptake by 9–10- and 5.5–6.5-fold, respectively, in both 3T3-L1 and 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes. Exogenous GLUT4MYC expression led to enhanced PDGF-induced glucose transport. In 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes, insulin and PDGF induced an 8- and 5-fold increase in GLUT4MYC translocation, respectively, determined in a cell-surface anti-c-MYC antibody binding assay. This PDGF-induced GLUT4MYC translocation was further demonstrated with fluorescent detection. In contrast, PDGF stimulated a 2-fold increase of GLUT1MYC translocation and 2.5-fold increase of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. The PDGF-induced GLUT4MYC translocation, glucose uptake, and PI 3-kinase activity were maximal (100%) at 5–10 min and thereafter rapidly declined to 40, 30, and 12%, respectively, within 60 min, a time when effects of insulin were maximal. Wortmannin (0.1 μm) abolished PDGF-induced GLUT4MYC translocation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes. These results suggest that PDGF can transiently trigger the translocation of GLUT4 and stimulate glucose uptake by translocation of both GLUT4 and GLUT1 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Translocation of GLUT41 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane is thought to be a major mechanism of glucose uptake in response to insulin in insulin-sensitive tissues (1Cushman S.W.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) activate many of the same signaling cascades as does insulin. One of the most prominent shared pathways is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Therefore, the question arose as to whether PDGF or EGF would trigger GLUT4 translocation by the activation of PI 3-kinase. We developed a sensitive immunological method that can detect c-MYC epitope-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4MYC) on the cell surface, directly and quantitatively (9Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using this method, we have found that PDGF and EGF did trigger the GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in CHO and 3T3-L1 adipocytes by a signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase, p85/p110 heterodimer type) (10Ishii K.

We considered that PDGF and EGF as well as insulin may have latent potential to trigger GLUT4 translocation by activation of PI 3-kinase in cultured cells. PDGF- or EGF-triggered GLUT4 translocation has been reported by other research groups (12Hardy R.W. Gupta K.B. McDonald J.M. Williford J. Wells A.

It was reported that PDGF has no significant effect or only a minimal effect on glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

They found that PDGF did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation even though PDGF did stimulate PI 3-kinase to an extent similar to that seen with insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes; they proposed that activation of PI 3-kinase alone is not sufficient to stimulate GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (14Wiese R.J.

To understand better the pathophysiology of insulin-resistant states, it is crucial to identify key molecular components necessary to mediate insulin signaling. Since insulin and PDGF are growth factors, there are overlaps between signal transduction pathways. Understanding the effect of PDGF on glucose transport may aid in identifying insulin signaling pathway mediating the glucose transport. Murine 3T3-L1 cells express both insulin and PDGF receptors and represent an in vitro model for insulin-induced glucose transport (19Czech M.P. Clancy B.M. Pession A. Woon C.-W. Harrison S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To extend our previous study on the effect of PDGF on glucose transport and the role of PI 3-kinase in the PDGF-induced glucose transport, we compared the effects of insulin and PDGF on the stimulation of glucose transport, translocations of glucose transporters and PI 3-kinase activity in 3T3-L1, 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC, and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. We found that 1) PDGF stimulated glucose uptake in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, 2) PDGF-induced glucose uptake was shared by GLUT4 and GLUT1, and 3) PDGF stimulated the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transiently by a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway.

The adipocytes were used between 7 and 9 days after the initiation of differentiation, a time when more than 90% of the cells had an adipocyte phenotype. Subcellular fractions from 3T3-L1, 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC, and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes were prepared as described (20Ishii K. Hayashi H. Todaka M. Kamohara S. Kanai F. Jinnouchi H. Wang L. Ebina Y.

Equal amounts of protein from the same fraction number of different cells were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies to the human c-MYC epitope of 14 amino acids (9E10), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to C terminus of GLUT4, or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to C terminus of GLUT1. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC or 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC cells in 24-well plates were incubated in 500 μl of Krebs-Ringer/Hepes (KRH) buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 37 °C and then with indicated concentrations of ligands for indicated periods at 37 °C. GLUTMYC translocation was measured, as described (9Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum medium with 24-well plates were washed once with KRH buffer and incubated for 30 min in KRH buffer and then treated with indicated concentrations of ligands for 10 min at 37 °C. 2-Deoxy[3H]glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells with the deoxy[3H]glucose for 10 min, as described (22Ebina Y.

Cells in a 6-well plate were incubated with 5 ml of 50% ethanol for 2 min at room temperature and then stained with 1 ml of 2% Sudan III in 70% ethanol for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing the cells once with 5 ml of 50% ethanol and twice with 5 ml of H2O at room temperature, photographs were taken. GLUTMYC protein staining was done using the tyramide signal amplification-direct procedure following the manufacturer's instructions (NEN Life Science Products). Briefly, 3T3-L1, 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC, and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC cells were grown in a 6-well plate and converted to adipocytes. The adipocytes were incubated in 1 ml of KRH buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, and then indicated concentrations of ligands were added for 10 min at 37 °C. After fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 20 min, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 100 mmglycine/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 15 min, and incubated with TNB blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Blocking Reagent supplied in a kit) at room temperature for 30 min. They were then incubated with the anti-c-MYC antibodies (1:20 dilution with TNB blocking buffer) at 37 °C for 30 min and then further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20 dilution with TNB blocking buffer) at 37 °C for 30 min. Each antibody incubation was followed by three washes for 5 min each with TNT buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), at room temperature. Cells then were incubated with fluorophore tyramide (1:50 dilution with amplification buffer) for 7 min at room temperature in a dark, moist chamber, washed three times for 10 min each in TNT buffer at room temperature and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX50). Preparation of cell lysates and PI 3-kinase assay were done as described (24Todaka M. Hayashi H. Imanaka T. Mitani Y. Kamohara S. Kishi K. Tamaoka K. Kanai F. Shichiri M. Morii N. Narumiya S. Ebina Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell lysates were prepared with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 after treatment with the indicated concentrations of insulin or PDGF and precipitated with the PY20 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to PI 3-kinase assay. The radioactive spots on TLC plates were quantified using a Bio-image analyzer BAS1500 (Fuji Film Institution). To determine whether PDGF has any effect on glucose uptake, PDGF-induced glucose uptake was investigated using both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The upper panel of Fig. 1 A shows the result of Sudan III staining. Few lipid droplets was seen in fibroblasts, and many lipid droplets appeared after induction, suggesting the cells were well differentiated into adipocytes. The lower panel of Fig.1 A shows the effects of PDGF and insulin on glucose uptake. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, a similar stimulation of glucose uptake was induced by PDGF (about 2-fold) and insulin (about 2-fold), an effect due to the translocation of GLUT1 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (25Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Harrison S.A. Buxton J.M. Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20106-20116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, however, PDGF exerted a 6-fold stimulation of glucose uptake, even though this stimulation reached only 60% of the maximal effect of insulin (10-fold). This suggested that another glucose transporter, probably GLUT4, may be involved in the PDGF-induced glucose uptake, in addition to GLUT1, since the translocation of GLUT1 only caused about 2-fold stimulation of glucose uptake (27Yang J. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the 3T3-L1 cells from different origins give different responses to PDGF, we also determined the PDGF-induced glucose uptake in another 3T3-L1 cell line (kindly provided by Dr. Morris Birnbaum, University of Pennsylvania). This 3T3-L1 cell line (named 3T3-L1-B) responded similarly to our 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm whether GLUT4 was responsible for the PDGF-induced glucose uptake, 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably overexpressing either GLUT4MYC or GLUT1MYC were evaluated. To examine which glucose transporter is responsible for the PDGF-induced glucose uptake, 3T3-L1 cell lines stably overexpressing either GLUT4MYC or GLUT1MYC were established and cell-surface anti-c-MYC antibody binding assay was done. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the overexpression of GLUT4MYC or GLUT1MYC in 3T3-L1 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-c-MYC antibodies. In 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes, the total expression of GLUT4 (endogenous GLUT4 plus GLUT4MYC) was approximately 2.5-fold over control (3T3-L1 adipocytes) as detected with antibodies C-terminal to GLUT4. In 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes, the total GLUT1 (endogenous GLUT1 plus GLUT1MYC) was increased by 7–10-fold compared with endogenous GLUT1 as determined with antibodies C-terminal to GLUT1. After transfection with GLUT4MYC or GLUT1MYC, the adipocytes showed an enhanced increase in insulin- or PDGF-induced glucose transport compared with parent 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 C, PDGF led to about a 5-fold increase of GLUT4MYC translocation in 3T3-L1 GLUT4MYC adipocytes and a 2-fold increase of GLUT1MYC translocation in 3T3-L1 GLUT1MYC adipocytes, whereas the parent 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed no response to either PDGF or insulin in the anti-c-MYC binding assay. These results suggest that PDGF can trigger the translocation of both GLUT4 and GLUT1 to the plasma membrane and exert the stimulation of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also, the PDGF-stimulated GLUT4MYC translocation and glucose uptake were in a dose-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 GLUT4MYC adipocytes. However, PDGF only induced about 60% maximal effect of insulin on glucose transport with 10 min stimulation (Fig.3).Figure 3Dose-dependent GLUTMYC translocation and glucose uptake in response to insulin or PDGF in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. Adipocytes were incubated with various concentrations of insulin or PDGF-BB for 10 min at 37 °C. The 2-deoxyglucose uptake (A and C) and GLUTMYC translocation (B and D) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent means ± S.E. of three separate experiments done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy were also used to determine further the effect of PDGF on translocation of glucose transporters in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. As shown in Fig.4, an increase in plasma membrane-associated fluorescence staining, as visualized as a ring around the cell, was induced by PDGF and insulin in both 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes, whereas the controls showed only nonspecific staining without a enhanced staining in plasma membrane, indicating that PDGF stimulated translocations of GLUT4MYC and GLUT1MYC to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 4,F and I, insulin triggered GLUT4MYC translocation in almost all the adipocytes. However, approximately 60% of cells showed positive staining with PDGF treatment, compared with findings in the case of insulin stimulation (Fig. 4, D–I) (see “Discussion”). These results were consistent with findings that PDGF induced approximately 60% of maximal effects of insulin on glucose uptake and translocation (Figs. 2 and 3). Taken together, these results suggested that PDGF does exert stimulation of the 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and the PDGF-induced glucose uptake was shared by GLUT4 and GLUT1 transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was reported that PDGF transiently activated PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (28Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We reported that PDGF triggered GLUT4 translocation by a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway in CHO cells (11Kamohara S. Hayashi H. Todaka M. Kanai F. Ishii K. Imanaka T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Ebina Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between glucose transport and PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by insulin and PDGF in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the time courses for insulin- and PDGF-induced glucose uptake, translocations of transporters, and PI 3-kinase activity were studied using 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC and 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. In 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes, as shown in Fig. 5, A, B and E, PDGF-induced glucose uptake, GLUT4MYC translocation, and PI 3-kinase activity were maximal (100% of maximal effects of PDGF) at 5–10 min and thereafter rapidly declined to 30, 40, and 12%, respectively, within 60 min, a time when maximal effects of insulin on glucose uptake, GLUT4MYC translocation, and PI 3-kinase activity were observed. On the other hand, even though the maximal activity of PI 3-kinase induced by PDGF was about 2.1-fold higher than that stimulated by insulin (Fig. 5 E), the PDGF stimulated less glucose uptake and GLUT4MYC translocation compared with that stimulated by insulin in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes (Figs. 2 and 3). This result suggested that the different ability of insulin and PDGF to activate PI 3-kinase and PI 3-kinase activation only is not sufficient to mediate the full effect of insulin on glucose transport (see “Discussion”). Some differences in GLUT1MYC translocation and glucose uptake were observed in case of 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 5,C and D, PDGF-induced GLUT1MYC translocation and glucose uptake reached maximal levels (100%) at 5–10 min and then declined slowly to 85 and 65%, respectively, within 60 min. In the insulin-stimulated state, the maximal levels of GLUT1MYC translocation and glucose uptake were observed to occur within 60 min, similar to findings in case of 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes. Therefore, there are some differences between insulin-induced and PDGF-induced translocations of glucose transporters and different regulations in recycling of GLUT4 and GLUT1 glucose transporters. PDGF stimulated the parallel translocations of glucose transporters and activation of PI 3-kinase in time courses, thereby suggesting the involvement of PI 3-kinase in PDGF-induced glucose transport. To confirm this, wortmannin was used in the experiments. Wortmannin is a specific and cell-permeable inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity and is used widely in PI 3-kinase-related research (29Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Tends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To determine if PI 3-kinase is involved in PDGF-induced GLUT4 translocation, wortmannin treatment was given prior to PDGF stimulation. As shown in Fig.6, pretreatment with 0.1 μmwortmannin abolished PDGF-induced GLUT4MYC translocation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes. Therefore, effects of PDGF on GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake depend on PI 3-kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake by a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. We and others (10Ishii K. Kamohara S. Hayashi H. Todaka M. Kanai F. Imanaka T. Ebina Y.

To investigate further the effect of PDGF on glucose transport, we examined glucose uptake and translocation of glucose transporters stimulated by PDGF in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that stably overexpressed either GLUT4MYC or GLUT1MYC. Our observations strongly support the conclusion that PDGF can stimulate the translocation of GLUT4 and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. First, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with PDGF, a 6.5-fold stimulation of the 2-deoxyglucose uptake was observed, whereas the translocation of GLUT1 caused only a 2–3-fold increase of glucose uptake (27Yang J. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we also found that only a 2.5-fold increase of the 2-deoxyglucose uptake was obtained by PDGF treatment in 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes (Fig. 2 B). To eliminate the possibility that 3T3-L1 cells from different origins give different responses to PDGF and PDGF obtained from different origins causes different reactions, the 3T3-L1 cells and PDGF-BB from other origins also were used in experiments. Similar results of glucose uptake induced by PDGF were obtained using our cells (3T3-L1) and those of other investigators (3T3-L1-B) (Fig. 1, A and B). A 5-fold stimulation of the glucose uptake was also induced by PDGF-BB obtained from another provider (Austral Biological) in our 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). These results confirmed that there was no problem in the 3T3-L1 cell line and the PDGF-BB product used in present study. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that GLUT4 is involved in PDGF-induced glucose uptake. Second, exogenous GLUT4MYC expression led to enhanced PDGF-induced glucose transport. About double the amount of glucose uptake was stimulated by PDGF in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes, compared with that observed in parent 3T3-L1 adipocytes(Fig.2 B). However, overexpressing GLUT4MYC did not increase the fold stimulation induced by PDGF or insulin. In 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes, PDGF stimulated a 5.7-fold increase in glucose uptake similar to that observed in parent 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which meant that the exogenous GLUT4MYC was translocated through the same mechanism by which the endogenous GLUT4 transporters were translocated. Furthermore, cell-surface anti-c-MYC antibody binding assay showed that PDGF induced a 5-fold increase of GLUT4MYC translocation in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes and a 2-fold increase of GLUT1MYC translocation in 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes (Fig. 2 C). Finally, immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy also showed an increase in plasma membrane-associated fluorescence staining after treatment with PDGF in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes (Fig. 4). These results strongly indicate that PDGF can stimulate the translocation of GLUT4 transporter and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present study suggested that the effect of PDGF on glucose uptake is transient and reaches the peak between 5 and 10 min after exposure to PDGF in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was reported that PDGF had only a limited effect on glucose uptake based on the experiments done with 15 min exposure to PDGF after 3 h incubation of KRBH/BSA buffer (14Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or 20 min exposure to PDGF after overnight starvation of serum-free medium (18Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It was possible to obtain more glucose uptake induced by PDGF in their cells if a shorter exposure to PDGF was performed. Furthermore, we only incubated the adipocytes with KRH buffer for 30 min before PDGF stimulation. The differences in the condition of the cell and the experimental procedure may contribute to the discrepancy in addition to the length of exposure to PDGF. Our present results are inconsistent with data that showed that PDGF had no detectable effect on GLUT4 translocation and stimulated glucose uptake only by activation of GLUT1 transporter in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Gould G.W. Merrall N.W. Martin S. Jess T.J. Campbell I.W. Calderhead D.M. Gibbs E.M. Holman G.D. Plevin R.J. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le-Marchand Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), determined using the sucrose density gradient method. With this method, we also detected no significant increase of GLUT4MYC translocation in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes; there was only a significant increase in GLUT1MYC translocation after treatment with PDGF in 3T3-L1GLUT1MYC adipocytes (data not shown). By using MYC-binding assay, however, we found that PDGF can transiently trigger the translocation of GLUT4MYC transporter and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1GLUT4MYC adipocytes. This transient effect of PDGF on glucose transport may be due to transient autophosphorylation of PDGFR and transient activation of PI 3-kinase induced by PDGF (28Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The time courses for PDGF-induced translocations of GLUT4MYC and GLUT1MYC showed that PDGF had a longer effect on the translocation of GLUT1 transporter (Fig. 5), which meant that there were some differences between the mechanisms by which PDGF stimulated the GLUT4 and GLUT1 redistribution. The GLUT1 transporters may have a slower endocytosis rate. Because fractionation procedures are time-consuming and relatively insensitive, it seems difficult to detect the transient GLUT4 translocation induced by PDGF by using this method. But PDGF-induced GLUT1 translocation can be detected, even using this method, for the reason mentioned above. Differences in time after PDGF treatment, detection methods of GLUT4 translocation, and the days after differentiation of adipocytes may account for the discrepancy between the results. Evidence suggests that PI 3-kinase is both necessary and sufficient for the metabolic effects of insulin (30Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 31Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase also is strongly activated by PDGF. In the present study, PDGF led to similar time courses of glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, and the activation of PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 5). Wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, abolished the PDGF-induced GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 6). These results confirmed that PDGF-induced GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake are mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was suggested that PDGF-induced translocation of GLUT1 is also PI 3-kinase-dependent, based on the result that PDGF-induced glucose uptake was completely inhibited by wortmannin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our previous study indicated that PDGF-stimulated GLUT4MYC translocation was mediated by PI 3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ pathways and that the PDGF-stimulated GLUT4MYC translocation remained a little after treatment with wortmannin in CHO-GLUT4MYC-PDGFR cells. The expression level of PDGFR is very high in the CHO-GLUT4MYC-PDGFR cells and markedly decreased in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes (32Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13642-13648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Huppertz C. Schwartz C. Becker W. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). So the discrepancy between present and previous results may be accounted for by different expression levels of PDGFR in CHO-PDGFR cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As to why PDGF only induced about 60% of the maximal effect of insulin on glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we think there are at least two possible explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility is that PI 3-kinase activation only is not sufficient to mediate the full effect of insulin on glucose transport, a notion supported by findings that a thiophosphotyrosine peptide treatment (34Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26000-26005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (35Frevert E. Kahn B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) stimulated glucose uptake less than the treatment with insulin, even though the same levels of PI 3-kinase activation were induced. The other possibility is that the decreased expression of PDGF receptors is responsible for the inability of PDGF to exert a full insulin effect on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Evidence showed that levels of mRNA and protein of PDGF receptors are markedly decreased after differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes (32Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13642-13648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Huppertz C. Schwartz C. Becker W. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, insulin receptor number was increased after differentiation (36Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We considered that 3T3-L1 adipocytes are heterogeneous concerning the number of PDGF receptors on the cell surface; approximately 40% of the adipocytes have few PDGF receptors and do not visibly respond to PDGF. This may explain why PDGF triggered GLUT4MYC translocation only in 60% of adipocytes (Fig. 4,E and H). To confirm this further, we wanted to detect the expression levels of PDGF receptors on the surface of single 3T3-L1 adipocyte with immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. However, this approach was not feasible as antibody to the extracellular domain of mouse PDGFR was not available. One or both of the above possibilities may account for the different stimulations of glucose transport induced by PDGF and insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was demonstrated that PDGF or EGF can activate Akt and PKCλ through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (37Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Subsequently, studies indicated that activation of Akt and PKCλ was involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (40Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J.

These results also support the possibility that PDGF can stimulate glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation through activation of Akt or PKCλ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Growth factors, such as insulin, PDGF, and EGF, may exert effects on glucose transport in cells through a common signaling pathway. Both insulin and PDGF can stimulate GLUT4 translocation through a wortmannin-sensitive pathway, without the involvement of insulin receptor substrate-1 (42Van Horn D.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. J.

Cross-talk between the signaling pathways stimulated by PDGF and insulin have been reported (44Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, B cell development in Igβ−/− mice appears to be compromised as early as the pro-B stage when VH-DJH rearrangements are occurring, thereby suggesting an Igβ role in B lymphopoiesis even prior to μHC synthesis. Although pro-B cell lines from humans also produce Igα and Igβ, expression of these as components of cell surface receptors has not been demonstrable (4Nakamura T. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the ψLC in human pro-B cells were found exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi compartments, where they transiently associated with 40-, 60-, and 98-kDa proteins before undergoing intracellular degradation (7Lassoued K.

In this analysis of human B lineage cells, we have compared Igα and Igβ expression, heterogeneity, and molecular association in pro-B cells versus their more mature pre-B and B cell offspring. The results reveal a remarkable progressive complexity of the Igα and Igβ glycoproteins during B lineage differentiation, an unanticipated intracellular association with a Src family protein-tyrosine kinase in pro-B cells, and late stage Igα/Igβ union with assembled IgM molecules to form the BCR on B cells.DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we observed a remarkable diversity of the Igα and Igβ glycoproteins, the nature of which is altered as a function of B lineage progression. Igα species of 44, 40, and 33 kDa were produced by pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines, whereas Igβ was found in a single 36-kDa form. The 40- and 30-kDa Igα species represented transient immature forms that did not associate with Igβ, whereas the 44-kDa Igα and 36-kDa Igβ were found to be relatively stable and to associate with each other to form heterodimers. The formation of Igα/Igβ heterodimers and the complexity of their glycosylation patterns were shown to increase dramatically as a function of B cell differentiation.Two Igα protein backbones of approximately 25 and 21.5 kDa were revealed in deglycosylation studies, and two types of mb1(Igα) gene transcripts were identified that could account for these. The smaller, less-abundant variant, which lacked 114 bp as a consequence of alternative splicing of the Igα mRNA, maintains the same reading frame as the full-length transcript. It has the potential to give rise to a 4-kDa deleted protein that likely corresponds to the truncated Igα detected in B lineage cells. The predicted product of this small mb1 transcript would lack the cysteine residue involved in forming disulfide-linked heterodimers with Igβ, but would maintain many N-linked glycosylation sites. Similarly, two B29 (Igβ) transcripts were identified. The smaller one has the potential to encode a 11-kDa protein that could not covalently bind Igα and would lack glycosylation sites. All of the representative pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines expressed identical patterns of Igα and Igβ transcripts, and deglycosylation withN-glycanase revealed the truncated 21-kDa Igα molecule in cells representative of each differentiation stage. In mature human B cells, a post-transcriptional regulation of mb1 and B29 gene expression has been suggested. In particular, activation of mature B cells with anti-IgM antibody, interleukin 4, or lipopolysaccharide was shown to induce alternative splicing of mb1 and B29 (45Koyama M. Nakamura T. Higashihara M. Herren B. Kuwata S. Shibata Y. Okumara K. Kurokawa K. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 47: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The molecular interactions and functional potential of the truncated Igα and Igβ molecules are poorly understood. The predicted amino acid sequences of the truncated human Igα and Igβ proteins suggest they would not covalently associate with each other, and therefore would not be incorporated into either the BCR or pre-BCR complexes. Accordingly, fibroblast co-transfection of human μHC and κLC genes with mb1 and B29 variants failed to reconstitute the BCR (45Koyama M. Nakamura T. Higashihara M. Herren B. Kuwata S. Shibata Y. Okumara K. Kurokawa K. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 47: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the mouse, a C-terminally truncated Igβ product was detectable only in activated B cells (38Freidrich J. Campbell K.S. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2814-2822PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated murine Igα product has been found to be preferentially associated with IgD, whereas the predicted full-length Igα product associated primarily with IgM (39Vasile S. Coligan J.E. Yoshida M. Seon B.K. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In late stage murine pre-B cells, a truncated 23 kDa protein has been identified with a monoclonal antibody against an extracellular Igα epitope (5Ishihara K. Wood Jr., W.J. Wall R. Sakaguchi N. Michnoff C. Tucker P.W. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2253-2262PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that truncated Igα and Igβ proteins may be differentially expressed according to the stage of B lineage differentiation in the mouse. Truncated Igα variants may also be secreted by bovine B lymphocytes (58Youn H.Y. Goitsuka R. Okuda M. Watari T. Tsujimoto H. Hasegawa A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5127-5132PubMed Google Scholar).A functional potential for the Igβ homodimers that we observed in human B lineage cells was not revealed in these studies. The Igβ homodimers were not found to associate with either μHC or Igα, nor were they detected on the surface of pre-B and B cells. It is theoretically possible that Igβ homodimers play an undefined role inside the cell or, less likely, on the cell surface in levels below our detection threshold.The Igα and Igβ interactions and glycosylation heterogeneity increased progressively in representative pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines. The Igα and Igβ molecules in pro-B cells were found largely in separate pools, with only a minor fraction forming disulfide-bonded Igα/Igβ heterodimers. In contrast to the Igα/Igβ status in pro-B cells, Igα readily associated with Igβ in pre-B cells and in B cells. Variable glycosylation of the Igα/Igβ heterodimers occurred during their progression through the Golgi to reach the cell surface in association with μHC to form pre-B receptors (pre-BCR) and B cell receptors (BCR), respectively. While the final Igα/Igβ glycosylation spectra in the cell surface pre-BCR and BCR were indistinguishable, a restricted fraction of mature glycosylated molecules was observed in the Igα/Igβ pool in pre-B cells relative to that seen in B cell lines. This striking feature, which is also evident in data obtained in prior studies (4Nakamura T. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They mediate B cell activation by interaction with Syk and Src family tyrosine kinases and also serve as pre-BCR signal-transducing components to promote pre-B cell differentiation and allelic exclusion (59Manz J.

Science. 1996; 272: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Much less is known about functional Igα/Igβ potential before VDJH gene rearrangement. One important clue, however, is provided by the demonstration that mice lacking in Igβ exhibit a block at the pro-B cell stage in differentiation prior to the completion of V-DJHrearrangements (18Gong S. Nussenszweig M.C. Science. 1996; 272: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast, V-DJH rearrangement proceeds normally in mice that have a cμ mutation that prevents membrane-bound μHC expression (63Kitamura D. Rajewsky K. Nature. 1992; 356: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the Igα/Igβ molecules may play an important biological role during the pro-B cell stage in differentiation before μHCs are expressed. A recent study suggests that Igα/Igβ heterodimers may be expressed with calnexin on the surface of pro-B cells from RAG-2-deficient mice (20Nagata K. Nakamura T. Kitamura F. Kuramochi S. Taki S. Campbell K.S. Karasuyama H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ligation of this Igα/Igβ cell surface complex induced rapid, transient phosphorylation of Igα and associated tyrosine kinase to promote pro-B differentiation. However, these findings in mice may not be directly applicable to humans, given that Igα/Igβ heterodimers apparently do not reach the cell surface of human pro-B cells. Instead, our analysis of human pro-B cells indicates the intracellular association of Igα/Igβ with Lyn, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family. The possibility that the association of Igα/Igβ with Lyn is artifactual, occurring after pro-B cell lysis, is unlikely since Igα/Igβ binding to other phosphoproteins was not observed in the pro-B cells. Specifically, phosphorylated Fyn and Syk, which are also abundant in pro-B cell lines, were not found to be associated with Igα and Igβ. Our findings in human pro-B cells thus indicate that, although Igα and Igβ molecules exist primarily in separate pools in the ER/early Golgi compartments, do not associate with surrogate light chains, and fail to reach the cell surface, a minor population of intracellular Igα and Igβ molecules associate with the Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase with potentially functional consequences.The Igα/Igβ heterodimers are known to be essential for transport of the pre-BCR and BCR components to the cell surface, as well as for their subsequent mediation of signal transduction. Our observation that Igα/Igβ heterodimers in B cells were associated with the (μHC)2/(LC)2 units, but not with the precursor μHC/LC subunits, indicates that the Igα/Igβ-IgM association represents one of the terminal events in BCR assembly. In view of the possibility that the BCR complex includes two Igα/Igβ heterodimers, one Igα/Igβ heterodimer associated with each μHC in the BCR complex (1Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it may be important to determine whether when the Igα/Igβ-μHC association occurs immediately before or after assembly of the membrane-bound IgM subunits. Membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules are non-covalently bound to the transmembrane Igα (CD79a) and Igβ (CD79b) proteins, respectively the products of the mb1 and B29genes, to form the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)1 complex (1Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Igα/Igβ heterodimers are also integral components of pre-BCR complexes composed of surrogate light chain (ψLC) and μ heavy chains (HC) on the surface of pre-B cells (2Iglesias A. Kopf M.

Ligation of BCR and pre-BCR initiates cytoplasmic signals via the Igα and Igβ molecules whose cytoplasmic domains contain immunoregulatory tyrosine-based activation motifs. BCR aggregation thereby promotes interaction with protein-tyrosine kinases and resultant immunoregulatory tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylation, hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, sustained intracellular calcium elevation (9Bossy D.

Expression of Igα and Igβ transcripts begins very early in B lineage differentiation prior to the onset of DH-JH rearrangements in the μHC locus (16Li Y.S. Wasserman R. Hayakawa K. Hardy R.R. Immunity. 1996; 5: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,17Boekel E.T. Melchers F. Rolink A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and Igβ-deficient mice are unable to generate μHC-producing pre-B cells (18Gong S. Nussenszweig M.C. Science. 1996; 272: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, B cell development in Igβ−/− mice appears to be compromised as early as the pro-B stage when VH-DJH rearrangements are occurring, thereby suggesting an Igβ role in B lymphopoiesis even prior to μHC synthesis. Although pro-B cell lines from humans also produce Igα and Igβ, expression of these as components of cell surface receptors has not been demonstrable (4Nakamura T. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the ψLC in human pro-B cells were found exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi compartments, where they transiently associated with 40-, 60-, and 98-kDa proteins before undergoing intracellular degradation (7Lassoued K. Illges H. Benlagha K. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Lassoued K. Nunez C.A. Billips L. Kubagawa H. Monteiro R.C. LeBien T.W. Cooper M.D. Cell. 1993; 73: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In murine pro-B cells, however, Igα/Igβ heterodimers have recently been found on the cell surface, perhaps in association with calnexin (19Koyama M. Ishihara K. Karasuyama H. Cordell J.L. Iwamoto A. Nakamura T. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Nagata K. Nakamura T. Kitamura F. Kuramochi S. Taki S. Campbell K.S. Karasuyama H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The physiological role of Igα and Igβ during the earliest stages in B lineage differentiation thus remains unclear, and may differ in mice and humans. In this analysis of human B lineage cells, we have compared Igα and Igβ expression, heterogeneity, and molecular association in pro-B cells versus their more mature pre-B and B cell offspring. The results reveal a remarkable progressive complexity of the Igα and Igβ glycoproteins during B lineage differentiation, an unanticipated intracellular association with a Src family protein-tyrosine kinase in pro-B cells, and late stage Igα/Igβ union with assembled IgM molecules to form the BCR on B cells. DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we observed a remarkable diversity of the Igα and Igβ glycoproteins, the nature of which is altered as a function of B lineage progression. Igα species of 44, 40, and 33 kDa were produced by pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines, whereas Igβ was found in a single 36-kDa form. The 40- and 30-kDa Igα species represented transient immature forms that did not associate with Igβ, whereas the 44-kDa Igα and 36-kDa Igβ were found to be relatively stable and to associate with each other to form heterodimers. The formation of Igα/Igβ heterodimers and the complexity of their glycosylation patterns were shown to increase dramatically as a function of B cell differentiation.Two Igα protein backbones of approximately 25 and 21.5 kDa were revealed in deglycosylation studies, and two types of mb1(Igα) gene transcripts were identified that could account for these. The smaller, less-abundant variant, which lacked 114 bp as a consequence of alternative splicing of the Igα mRNA, maintains the same reading frame as the full-length transcript. It has the potential to give rise to a 4-kDa deleted protein that likely corresponds to the truncated Igα detected in B lineage cells. The predicted product of this small mb1 transcript would lack the cysteine residue involved in forming disulfide-linked heterodimers with Igβ, but would maintain many N-linked glycosylation sites. Similarly, two B29 (Igβ) transcripts were identified. The smaller one has the potential to encode a 11-kDa protein that could not covalently bind Igα and would lack glycosylation sites. All of the representative pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines expressed identical patterns of Igα and Igβ transcripts, and deglycosylation withN-glycanase revealed the truncated 21-kDa Igα molecule in cells representative of each differentiation stage. In mature human B cells, a post-transcriptional regulation of mb1 and B29 gene expression has been suggested. In particular, activation of mature B cells with anti-IgM antibody, interleukin 4, or lipopolysaccharide was shown to induce alternative splicing of mb1 and B29 (45Koyama M. Nakamura T. Higashihara M. Herren B. Kuwata S. Shibata Y. Okumara K. Kurokawa K. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 47: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The molecular interactions and functional potential of the truncated Igα and Igβ molecules are poorly understood. The predicted amino acid sequences of the truncated human Igα and Igβ proteins suggest they would not covalently associate with each other, and therefore would not be incorporated into either the BCR or pre-BCR complexes. Accordingly, fibroblast co-transfection of human μHC and κLC genes with mb1 and B29 variants failed to reconstitute the BCR (45Koyama M. Nakamura T. Higashihara M. Herren B. Kuwata S. Shibata Y. Okumara K. Kurokawa K. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 47: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the mouse, a C-terminally truncated Igβ product was detectable only in activated B cells (38Freidrich J. Campbell K.S. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2814-2822PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated murine Igα product has been found to be preferentially associated with IgD, whereas the predicted full-length Igα product associated primarily with IgM (39Vasile S. Coligan J.E. Yoshida M. Seon B.K. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In late stage murine pre-B cells, a truncated 23 kDa protein has been identified with a monoclonal antibody against an extracellular Igα epitope (5Ishihara K. Wood Jr., W.J. Wall R. Sakaguchi N. Michnoff C. Tucker P.W. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2253-2262PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that truncated Igα and Igβ proteins may be differentially expressed according to the stage of B lineage differentiation in the mouse. Truncated Igα variants may also be secreted by bovine B lymphocytes (58Youn H.Y. Goitsuka R. Okuda M. Watari T. Tsujimoto H. Hasegawa A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5127-5132PubMed Google Scholar).A functional potential for the Igβ homodimers that we observed in human B lineage cells was not revealed in these studies. The Igβ homodimers were not found to associate with either μHC or Igα, nor were they detected on the surface of pre-B and B cells. It is theoretically possible that Igβ homodimers play an undefined role inside the cell or, less likely, on the cell surface in levels below our detection threshold.The Igα and Igβ interactions and glycosylation heterogeneity increased progressively in representative pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines. The Igα and Igβ molecules in pro-B cells were found largely in separate pools, with only a minor fraction forming disulfide-bonded Igα/Igβ heterodimers.

While the final Igα/Igβ glycosylation spectra in the cell surface pre-BCR and BCR were indistinguishable, a restricted fraction of mature glycosylated molecules was observed in the Igα/Igβ pool in pre-B cells relative to that seen in B cell lines. This striking feature, which is also evident in data obtained in prior studies (4Nakamura T. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our findings in human pro-B cells thus indicate that, although Igα and Igβ molecules exist primarily in separate pools in the ER/early Golgi compartments, do not associate with surrogate light chains, and fail to reach the cell surface, a minor population of intracellular Igα and Igβ molecules associate with the Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase with potentially functional consequences.The Igα/Igβ heterodimers are known to be essential for transport of the pre-BCR and BCR components to the cell surface, as well as for their subsequent mediation of signal transduction. Our observation that Igα/Igβ heterodimers in B cells were associated with the (μHC)2/(LC)2 units, but not with the precursor μHC/LC subunits, indicates that the Igα/Igβ-IgM association represents one of the terminal events in BCR assembly. In view of the possibility that the BCR complex includes two Igα/Igβ heterodimers, one Igα/Igβ heterodimer associated with each μHC in the BCR complex (1Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it may be important to determine whether when the Igα/Igβ-μHC association occurs immediately before or after assembly of the membrane-bound IgM subunits. In these studies, we observed a remarkable diversity of the Igα and Igβ glycoproteins, the nature of which is altered as a function of B lineage progression. Igα species of 44, 40, and 33 kDa were produced by pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines, whereas Igβ was found in a single 36-kDa form. The 40- and 30-kDa Igα species represented transient immature forms that did not associate with Igβ, whereas the 44-kDa Igα and 36-kDa Igβ were found to be relatively stable and to associate with each other to form heterodimers. The formation of Igα/Igβ heterodimers and the complexity of their glycosylation patterns were shown to increase dramatically as a function of B cell differentiation. Two Igα protein backbones of approximately 25 and 21.5 kDa were revealed in deglycosylation studies, and two types of mb1(Igα) gene transcripts were identified that could account for these. The smaller, less-abundant variant, which lacked 114 bp as a consequence of alternative splicing of the Igα mRNA, maintains the same reading frame as the full-length transcript. It has the potential to give rise to a 4-kDa deleted protein that likely corresponds to the truncated Igα detected in B lineage cells. The predicted product of this small mb1 transcript would lack the cysteine residue involved in forming disulfide-linked heterodimers with Igβ, but would maintain many N-linked glycosylation sites. Similarly, two B29 (Igβ) transcripts were identified. The smaller one has the potential to encode a 11-kDa protein that could not covalently bind Igα and would lack glycosylation sites. All of the representative pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines expressed identical patterns of Igα and Igβ transcripts, and deglycosylation withN-glycanase revealed the truncated 21-kDa Igα molecule in cells representative of each differentiation stage. In mature human B cells, a post-transcriptional regulation of mb1 and B29 gene expression has been suggested. In particular, activation of mature B cells with anti-IgM antibody, interleukin 4, or lipopolysaccharide was shown to induce alternative splicing of mb1 and B29 (45Koyama M. Nakamura T. Higashihara M. Herren B. Kuwata S. Shibata Y. Okumara K. Kurokawa K. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 47: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The molecular interactions and functional potential of the truncated Igα and Igβ molecules are poorly understood. The predicted amino acid sequences of the truncated human Igα and Igβ proteins suggest they would not covalently associate with each other, and therefore would not be incorporated into either the BCR or pre-BCR complexes. Accordingly, fibroblast co-transfection of human μHC and κLC genes with mb1 and B29 variants failed to reconstitute the BCR (45Koyama M. Nakamura T. Higashihara M. Herren B. Kuwata S. Shibata Y. Okumara K. Kurokawa K. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 47: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the mouse, a C-terminally truncated Igβ product was detectable only in activated B cells (38Freidrich J. Campbell K.S. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2814-2822PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated murine Igα product has been found to be preferentially associated with IgD, whereas the predicted full-length Igα product associated primarily with IgM (39Vasile S. Coligan J.E. Yoshida M. Seon B.K. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In late stage murine pre-B cells, a truncated 23 kDa protein has been identified with a monoclonal antibody against an extracellular Igα epitope (5Ishihara K. Wood Jr., W.J. Wall R. Sakaguchi N. Michnoff C. Tucker P.W. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2253-2262PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that truncated Igα and Igβ proteins may be differentially expressed according to the stage of B lineage differentiation in the mouse. Truncated Igα variants may also be secreted by bovine B lymphocytes (58Youn H.Y. Goitsuka R. Okuda M. Watari T. Tsujimoto H. Hasegawa A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5127-5132PubMed Google Scholar). A functional potential for the Igβ homodimers that we observed in human B lineage cells was not revealed in these studies. The Igβ homodimers were not found to associate with either μHC or Igα, nor were they detected on the surface of pre-B and B cells. It is theoretically possible that Igβ homodimers play an undefined role inside the cell or, less likely, on the cell surface in levels below our detection threshold. The Igα and Igβ interactions and glycosylation heterogeneity increased progressively in representative pro-B, pre-B, and B cell lines. The Igα and Igβ molecules in pro-B cells were found largely in separate pools, with only a minor fraction forming disulfide-bonded Igα/Igβ heterodimers. In contrast to the Igα/Igβ status in pro-B cells, Igα readily associated with Igβ in pre-B cells and in B cells. Variable glycosylation of the Igα/Igβ heterodimers occurred during their progression through the Golgi to reach the cell surface in association with μHC to form pre-B receptors (pre-BCR) and B cell receptors (BCR), respectively. While the final Igα/Igβ glycosylation spectra in the cell surface pre-BCR and BCR were indistinguishable, a restricted fraction of mature glycosylated molecules was observed in the Igα/Igβ pool in pre-B cells relative to that seen in B cell lines. This striking feature, which is also evident in data obtained in prior studies (4Nakamura T. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Brouns G.S. de Vries E. van Noesel C.J.M. Mason D.Y. van Lier R.A.W. Borst J. Eur. J.

Igα/Igβ heterodimers are essential elements in pre-B and B receptor signaling (1Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bossy D. Salamero J. Olive D. Fougereau M.

They mediate B cell activation by interaction with Syk and Src family tyrosine kinases and also serve as pre-BCR signal-transducing components to promote pre-B cell differentiation and allelic exclusion (59Manz J.

Science. 1996; 272: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Much less is known about functional Igα/Igβ potential before VDJH gene rearrangement. One important clue, however, is provided by the demonstration that mice lacking in Igβ exhibit a block at the pro-B cell stage in differentiation prior to the completion of V-DJHrearrangements (18Gong S. Nussenszweig M.C. Science. 1996; 272: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast, V-DJH rearrangement proceeds normally in mice that have a cμ mutation that prevents membrane-bound μHC expression (63Kitamura D. Rajewsky K. Nature. 1992; 356: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the Igα/Igβ molecules may play an important biological role during the pro-B cell stage in differentiation before μHCs are expressed. A recent study suggests that Igα/Igβ heterodimers may be expressed with calnexin on the surface of pro-B cells from RAG-2-deficient mice (20Nagata K. Nakamura T. Kitamura F. Kuramochi S. Taki S. Campbell K.S. Karasuyama H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ligation of this Igα/Igβ cell surface complex induced rapid, transient phosphorylation of Igα and associated tyrosine kinase to promote pro-B differentiation. However, these findings in mice may not be directly applicable to humans, given that Igα/Igβ heterodimers apparently do not reach the cell surface of human pro-B cells. Instead, our analysis of human pro-B cells indicates the intracellular association of Igα/Igβ with Lyn, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family. The possibility that the association of Igα/Igβ with Lyn is artifactual, occurring after pro-B cell lysis, is unlikely since Igα/Igβ binding to other phosphoproteins was not observed in the pro-B cells. Specifically, phosphorylated Fyn and Syk, which are also abundant in pro-B cell lines, were not found to be associated with Igα and Igβ. Our findings in human pro-B cells thus indicate that, although Igα and Igβ molecules exist primarily in separate pools in the ER/early Golgi compartments, do not associate with surrogate light chains, and fail to reach the cell surface, a minor population of intracellular Igα and Igβ molecules associate with the Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase with potentially functional consequences. The Igα/Igβ heterodimers are known to be essential for transport of the pre-BCR and BCR components to the cell surface, as well as for their subsequent mediation of signal transduction. Our observation that Igα/Igβ heterodimers in B cells were associated with the (μHC)2/(LC)2 units, but not with the precursor μHC/LC subunits, indicates that the Igα/Igβ-IgM association represents one of the terminal events in BCR assembly. In view of the possibility that the BCR complex includes two Igα/Igβ heterodimers, one Igα/Igβ heterodimer associated with each μHC in the BCR complex (1Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it may be important to determine whether when the Igα/Igβ-μHC association occurs immediately before or after assembly of the membrane-bound IgM subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2086619055,"We have reported that bovine DNase I, a secretory glycoprotein, acquires mannose 6-phosphate residues on 12.6% of its Asn-linked oligosaccharides when expressed in COS-1 cells and that the extent of phosphorylation increases to 79.2% when lysines are placed at positions 27 and 74 of the mature protein (Nishikawa, A., Gregory, W., Frenz, J., Cacia, J., and Kornfeld, S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19408–19412). We now demonstrate that murine DNase I, which contains Lys27 and Lys74, is phosphorylated only 20.9% when expressed in the same COS-1 cell system. This difference is mostly due to the absence of three residues present in bovine DNase I (Tyr54, Lys124, and Ser190) along with the presence of a valine at position 23 that is absent in the bovine species. We show that Val23inhibits phosphorylation at the Asn18 glycosylation site, whereas Tyr54, Lys124, and Ser190enhance phosphorylation at the Asn106 glycosylation site. Tyr54 and Ser190 are widely separated from each other and from Asn106 on the surface of DNase I, indicating that residues present over a broad area influence the interaction with UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which is responsible for the formation of mannose 6-phosphate residues on lysosomal enzymes. We have reported that bovine DNase I, a secretory glycoprotein, acquires mannose 6-phosphate residues on 12.6% of its Asn-linked oligosaccharides when expressed in COS-1 cells and that the extent of phosphorylation increases to 79.2% when lysines are placed at positions 27 and 74 of the mature protein (Nishikawa, A., Gregory, W., Frenz, J., Cacia, J., and Kornfeld, S.

UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase mannose 6-phosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In a previous report, we demonstrated that bovine DNase I, a secretory glycoprotein of the pancreas and the salivary gland, acquires mannose 6-phosphate moieties on its Asn-linked oligosaccharides (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), confirming the findings of Cacia et al. (2Cacia J. Quan C. Frenz J. Glycobiology. 1995; 4: 99Google Scholar) with human DNase I. However, the level of oligosaccharide phosphorylation (12.6%) was considerably less than that observed with lysosomal hydrolases (usually 50% or greater). This indicated that DNase I is a weak substrate for UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase),1 the enzyme that synthesizes the Man-6-P recognition marker for targeting to lysosomes. Phosphotransferase is known to recognize a conformation-dependent protein determinant that is present in lysosomal hydrolases, but absent in most secretory glycoproteins (3Reitman M.L. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11977-11980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This determinant has been shown to involve a broad surface patch that includes critical lysine residues (4Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding of lysosomal hydrolases to phosphotransferase is followed by the transfer of GlcNAc-P from UDP-GlcNAc to selected mannose residues on the Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharides of the hydrolases. TheN-acetylglucosamine is then removed byN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester-α-N-acetylglucosaminidase to generate the phosphomannosyl recognition determinant that allows binding to the mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi and subsequent targeting to lysosomes (12Kornfeld S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The basal level of phosphorylation of bovine DNase I was shown to be dependent on three residues (Lys50, Lys124, and Arg27), consistent with the finding that lysine residues are important components of the phosphotransferase recognition determinant on lysosomal hydrolases (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When Arg27 was replaced with a lysine, oligosaccharide phosphorylation increased to 54%, demonstrating that phosphotransferase prefers lysine residues over arginines. Furthermore, mutation of Asn74 to a lysine also increased phosphorylation to 50.3%, and the double mutant (R27K/N74K) was phosphorylated 79.2%, equivalent to the values observed with authentic lysosomal hydrolases. Interestingly, the lysine at position 27 specifically stimulated phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn18, whereas the lysine at position 74 selectively stimulated phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn106. The R27K and N74K bovine constructs were initially prepared because the murine DNase I sequence has lysine residues at these positions, along with a lysine at position 50 (a glutamate is present at position 124). Yet in preliminary experiments we found that the murine DNase I was phosphorylated only 21% when expressed in the standard COS-1 cell system. We reasoned that this relatively poor phosphorylation might indicate that murine DNase I either lacks amino acids present in bovine DNase I that are necessary for efficient phosphorylation or contains amino acids that impair mannose phosphorylation. We also considered the possibility that both situations might hold. Our first clue that particular amino acid residues may impair phosphorylation came from the finding that substitution of Lys117 with an alanine in the bovine DNase I molecule enhanced phosphorylation by greater than 50% (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identify five amino acids that modulate the phosphorylation of murine DNase I to a large extent. Two residues (Val23 and Lys117) are present in the murine sequence and impair phosphorylation. The other three residues (Tyr54, Lys124, and Ser190) are found in bovine DNase I but not murine DNase I and stimulate phosphorylation. Together these findings provide new insight into the nature of the phosphotransferase recognition domain. COS-1 cells were obtained from ATCC. [2-3H]Mannose was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. QAE-Sephadex, Concanavalin A-Sepharose, and the pSVK3 expression vector were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant endoglycosidase H fused to maltose-binding protein and protein A-agarose beads were from New England Biolabs and Repligen, respectively. Bovine calf serum, Lipofectin, and Opti-MEM were from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bovine DNase I cDNA lacking a signal sequence (13Worrall A.F. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21889-21895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Suck (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). This cDNA was inserted into the pSVK3 expression vector behind the signal sequence of human DNase I as described (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding murine DNase I was obtained from Dr. Susan Spencer (Genentech). The constructs encoding chimeric proteins between bovine and murine DNase I were prepared using the sequential polymerase chain reaction procedure (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Brooklyn, NY1989Google Scholar). The expression vectors containing the various mutations in the murine DNase I were also constructed by this procedure. All plasmids used for transfections were purified with the Qiagen plasmid kit. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells were transfected with purified plasmid DNA using the Lipofectin reagent and then labeled with [2-3H]mannose in the presence of 10 mm NH4Cl as described (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-bovine DNase I serum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with bovine DNase I purchased from Sigma and purified one additional step on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column. Rabbit anti-murine DNase I was provided by Dr. Jerry Cacia (Genentech). The harvested COS-1 culture medium containing the [2-3H]mannose-labeled secreted proteins was incubated with 2 μl of antisera overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Then, 100 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose bead suspension was added. After 1 h of additional rotation, the bead suspension was transferred to a fresh tube. The beads were washed three times with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin. The immunoprecipitated protein was eluted from the beads in 50 μl of 0.5% SDS-10 mm β-mercaptoethanol by heating at 78 °C for 10 min and rinsing the beads with 50 μl of water. Analysis of the oligosaccharides of the immunoprecipitated DNase I and the calculation of the percent of the oligosaccharides phosphorylated with one or two phosphate groups was carried out according to the previously described methods (8Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected with the various plasmid DNAs as described (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours posttransfection, the cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine/cysteine containing 10% dialyzed calf serum, 10 mm NH4Cl, and 0.2 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Pro-mix [35S]). Four hours later, 0.5 ml of medium containing methionine/cysteine, 10% calf serum, and 10 mm HN4Cl was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected and the DNase I immunoprecipitated as above. One-half of the washed protein A-agarose beads were used for SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 50 μl of 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol by boiling for 5 min. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 13% acrylamide SDS gels. Following electrophoresis, the gels were rinsed with 7% acetic acid/10% methanol for 15 min, soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min, and dried. Autoradiography was then carried out, and the intensity of the bands corresponding to DNase I was quantitated with a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). The other half of the beads were used to assay DNase I activity following the procedure of Sinicropi et al.(15Sinicropi D. Baker D.L. Prince W.S. Shiffer K. Shak S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of the reaction mixture was added to the beads and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The units of DNase I activity were determined by comparing the values to those obtained with a standardized vial of DNase I (Sigma). Cells transfected with an empty plasmid served as control. The specific activity was obtained by dividing the units of activity by the relative intensity units obtained by scanning the autoradiograms. The phosphorylation of the two Asn-linked oligosaccharides of bovine and murine DNase I secreted by COS-1 cells is shown in TableI. The bovine DNase I had 12.6% of its oligosaccharides phosphorylated, mostly with a single Man-6-P residue, whereas 20.9% of the oligosaccharides on the murine enzyme were phosphorylated, including 7.7% with two Man-6-P residues. Whereas the murine DNase I is clearly better phosphorylated than the bovine enzyme, its level of phosphorylation is much less than that achieved by a bovine enzyme containing a R27K/N74K double mutation (Table I). Because the murine enzyme contains lysine residues at both of these positions (Fig. 1), it was surprising that it was phosphorylated so much less than the mutant bovine enzyme. We considered two possibilities to explain this difference. The first is that the murine DNase I, but not the bovine enzyme, contains amino acids that impair the interaction with phosphotransferase, thereby decreasing the level of phosphorylation. Alternatively, the bovine enzyme could have amino acids that are required for optimal phosphorylation that are absent in the murine form of the enzyme. The difference in the level of phosphorylation of the two forms of the enzyme could also result from both of these mechanisms being operative. The subsequent experiments were designed to test these possibilities.Table IPhosphorylation of murine and bovine DNase ISpeciesOligosaccharide phosphorylationHM + 1 PMHM + 2 PMTotal%Murine13.27.720.9BovineaFrom Ref. 1.11.21.412.6Bovine R27K/N74KaFrom Ref. 1.43.735.579.2COS-1 cells transfected with the various constructs were labeled with [2-3H]mannose, and the secreted DNase I was immunoprecipitated from the medium.

The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed to determine the content of high mannose oligosaccharides with one phosphomonoester (HM + 1 PM) and two phosphomonoesters (HM + 2 PM). We first constructed a series of plasmids encoding various chimeras between the R27K/N74K mutant bovine enzyme and the murine enzyme. The R27K/N74K double mutant was used so that all the chimeras had these two stimulatory amino acids. These chimeras were expressed in COS-1 cells and their level of oligosaccharide phosphorylation determined. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig.2. It is apparent that when murine sequences derived from either the amino, middle, or carboxyl regions of the protein were substituted into the bovine sequence, a lower level of phosphorylation resulted (compare CP1, CP2, and CP3 to bovine DNase I, Fig. 2). When additional murine sequences were introduced, the extent of phosphorylation decreased further (CP4-CP8). These results indicated that multiple amino acids distributed throughout the linear sequence of murine DNase I influenced the level of phosphorylation. In the next set of experiments, a number of amino acids in the murine DNase I sequence that differed from those found in the bovine sequence were replaced by the equivalent bovine residues. These were selected on the basis that the two corresponding amino acids differed significantly in structure. The effect of the amino acid substitution on oligosaccharide phosphorylation was then determined using the COS-1 cell expression system. As shown in Fig.3, six mutations (V23S, E54Y, D61N, K117A, E124K, and P190S) resulted in 30% or more enhanced phosphorylation, whereas four mutations (R64H, I191T, V204A, and H208N) had no significant effect on the level of phosphorylation. Interestingly, the V23S mutation primarily enhanced the formation of oligosaccharides with one phosphate, whereas the E54Y and P190S substitutions stimulated the synthesis of oligosaccharides with two phosphates. The substitutions that enhanced phosphorylation could be doing so by the removal of an inhibitory amino acid or the addition of a stimulatory amino acid. To distinguish between these possibilities, Val23, Glu54, and Pro190 were replaced with alanine residues (the V23A, E54A, and P190A constructs) and analyzed for the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 3). The E54A substitution did not enhance phosphorylation suggesting that Tyr54 is a stimulatory residue. The V23A construct was phosphorylated to the same extent as the V23S mutant, indicating that Val23 inhibits phosphorylation. The P190A construct was phosphorylated somewhat better than wild type murine DNase I, although not nearly as well as the P190S construct. This suggests that Pro190 may impair phosphorylation to a small extent, whereas Ser190 has a stimulatory effect as well. Because Lys124 has been shown to be a stimulatory residue in bovine DNase I (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we assume that the enhanced phosphorylation obtained with the E124K substitution is due to the stimulatory effect of the lysine at this position. In addition, the K117A construct showed a markedly enhanced phosphorylation, consistent with Lys117 being an inhibitory residue in the context of the murine sequence, just as it is in the bovine sequence (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The effect of combinations of mutations on DNase I oligosaccharide phosphorylation is shown in TableII. Construct 1, which has four mutations (V23S, E54Y, E124K, and P190S) was phosphorylated 70.1% compared with 18.9% for the wild type murine DNase I analyzed in the same experiment. Thus mutation of these four residues brings the level of phosphorylation of the murine DNase I close to that obtained with the bovine enzyme containing the R27K/N74K mutations (79.2%). The extent of phosphorylation increased to 84.2% when a fifth residue (Lys117) was mutated to alanine (construct 2).Table IIEffect of combinations of mutations on oligosaccharide phosphorylationConstructResidueOligosaccharide phosphorylation2 PM:1 PM ratio235474117124190%I.

The results are the average of two to four separate determinations. PM, phosphomonoester. Murine DNase I, like its bovine counterpart, contains two Asn-linked glycosylation sites, one at position 18 and the other at position 106 (Fig. 1). In our previous study of bovine DNase I, we established that the oligosaccharide at Asn18primarily acquired a single Man-6-P residue, whereas the oligosaccharide at Asn106 mostly acquired two Man-6-P residues (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that a R27K substitution selectively stimulated the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at position 18. Because Val23 is positioned nearby Lys27, and its substitution with either serine or alanine resulted in a selective increase in oligosaccharides with one Man-6-P residue, we postulated that Val23 was impairing the phosphorylation of the Asn18 oligosaccharide. To pursue this, a construct was prepared in which the Asn106glycosylation site was deleted (construct Δ106). The Val23 residue in this construct was then mutated to either a serine or an alanine (the V23S Δ106 and V23A Δ106 constructs). In this way, the effect of the Val23 mutations on the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn18 could be directly examined. As shown in Fig. 4, substitution of Val23 with either an alanine or a serine residue doubled the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at position 18. Almost all of this increase was in oligosaccharides with a single Man-6-P residue. Because the V23A and V23S mutations in the wild type murine DNase I (with both oligosaccharides intact) result in a 26 and a 31% increase in total phosphorylation, respectively, it is likely that the inhibitory effect of Val23 is selective for the oligosaccharide at position 18. The murine and bovine DNase I sequences also differ at positions 22 and 30, which are in the vicinity of Lys27. Therefore, two additional constructs were prepared in which the bovine residue was substituted for the murine residue in the Δ106 context (constructs S22A Δ106 and S30R Δ106). When expressed in COS-1 cells, neither mutation resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at position 18 (Fig. 4). Thus, of the three nonconservative differences in the amino-terminal 34 residues of bovine and murine DNase I, only Val23 impairs phosphorylation (Fig. 1). The E54Y, E124K, and P190S single mutations resulted in a marked increase in oligosaccharides with two Man-6-P residues, consistent with a selective stimulation of the phosphorylation of the Asn106 oligosaccharide. To test this directly, a construct was prepared in which the Asn18glycosylation site was deleted (construct Δ18). Residues 54, 124, and 190 were then mutated in various combinations, and the different constructs were expressed in COS cells and analyzed for the extent and type of phosphorylation (Table II). The murine Δ18 DNase I was phosphorylated 36.6%, with slightly more than half of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides containing two Man-6-P residues. Substitution of Glu124 with a lysine increased the level of phosphorylation to 45.9% (construct 3), whereas substitution of Glu54 with a tyrosine resulted in 60.7% phosphorylation (construct 4). Construct 5, which has two mutations (E54Y and P190S), was phosphorylated 72.4% whereas construct 6 (E54Y, E124K, and P190S) was 90.9% phosphorylated. It is also apparent that the proportion of oligosaccharides with two Man-6-P residues increased along with the extent of phosphorylation. Thus, mutation of only three residues results in almost complete phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn106. In a complementary experiment, Tyr54 and Ser190were mutated to alanines in a bovine DNase I construct containing Lys74 and only Asn106 (Bwt (Δ18, Lys74)). As shown in Table II, mutation of Tyr54 to alanine caused phosphorylation at Asn106 to decrease from 85.9 to 62% (construct 7). Mutation of both Tyr54 and Ser190 to alanines caused a further decline in the level of phosphorylation to 23.1% (construct 8). These mutations also resulted in a decrease in the proportion of oligosaccharides with two Man-6-P residues, from 92.4 to 60%. Our initial experiments using single amino acid changes showed that substitution of Glu54 with tyrosine stimulated phosphorylation, whereas substitution with alanine had no effect (Fig. 2). To determine whether other bulky hydrophobic residues could substitute for tyrosine, constructs were prepared with Glu54 changed to either phenylalanine or methionine. Both residues stimulated phosphorylation at the Asn106 site, with methionine being equivalent to tyrosine and phenylalanine being somewhat less effective (TableIII). These findings suggest that it is the hydrophobic character of the residue at position 54 that is most essential for stimulating phosphorylation at Asn106.Table IIIEffect of various amino acid substitutions at position 54 on phosphorylation at Asn 106Glycosylation siteConstructOligosaccharide phosphorylationHM + 1 PMHM + 2 PMTotal%Asn106Mwt19.619.939.5E54Y19.751.170.8E54F22.938.060.9E54M22.446.869.2COS-1 cells transfected with the various constructs were labeled with [2-3H]mannose, and the secreted DNase I was immunoprecipitated from the medium and analyzed as in Table I.

The results are the average of two determinations. Because phosphotransferase binds to a conformation-dependent protein determinant present on its substrates, the various amino acid substitutions could influence the level of phosphorylation by altering the proper folding of the DNase I. One indication of proper folding is the retention of enzymatic activity. Therefore, we expressed seven of the constructs in COS cells, collected the secreted protein, and determined the specific activity relative to that of the wild type enzyme. As shown in Fig. 5, the proteins encoded by four of the constructs exhibited endonuclease activity equal to or greater than that observed with the wild type enzyme. The construct with four mutations (V23A, E54Y, K117A, and P190A) has the lowest activity (55% of wild type level), but this protein was extremely well phosphorylated (65.2%), indicating that it is an excellent substrate for phosphotransferase. The two other constructs with small decreases in enzymatic activity (K117A and Δ106V23S) were also well phosphorylated. These data indicate that DNase I can tolerate many amino acid substitutions without major impairment of its endonuclease activity. This is consistent with the findings of Lazarus and co-workers (16Pan C.P. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Pan C.P. Dodge T.H. Baker D.L. Prince W.S. Sinicropi D.V. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), who have reported the preparation of numerous mutants of human DNase I that have wild type or enhanced endonuclease activity. Our previous study of bovine DNase I identified four lysine residues (Lys27, Lys50, Lys74, and Lys124) that determine high level phosphorylation (79%) by phosphotransferase (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among these residues, Lys27 and Lys74 were most important, with Lys27 causing the selective phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn18 and Lys74 causing the selective phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn108. The current study was stimulated by the observation that murine DNase I is phosphorylated only 20.9% despite having Lys27 and Lys74 as well as Lys50. We reasoned that murine DNase I either lacked other residues present in the bovine enzyme that are essential for high level phosphorylation or contained inhibitory residues not found in the bovine species. Our experiments show that both postulates are correct. Furthermore, these data provide new insight into the nature of the phosphotransferase recognition domain. Starting with the analysis of chimeric proteins containing elements of both bovine and murine DNase I and then proceeding to amino acid substitution experiments, we have identified four residues at positions 23, 54, 124, and 190 that account for the majority of the difference in the phosphorylation of the two forms of DNase I. The valine in position 23 of the murine sequence impairs phosphorylation because its replacement with either an alanine or a serine (as in the bovine species) enhances phosphorylation about 30%. Replacement of the glutamic acid at position 124 of the murine sequence with a lysine stimulated phosphorylation to about the same extent. This was expected because this residue was known to facilitate phosphorylation of the bovine DNase I. The unexpected and most dramatic effects were observed when the glutamic acid at position 54 and the proline at position 190 of the murine sequence were replaced with tyrosine and serine, respectively. Each of these substitutions stimulated phosphorylation about 75%. Because substitution of alanines at these positions had little (position 190) or no (position 54) effect, we conclude that Tyr54 and Ser190 function as positive elements. When these four changes were combined the resultant murine DNase I was phosphorylated 70%, close to the 79% value obtained with bovine DNase I containing Lys27 and Lys74. These values are equivalent to that observed with authentic lysosomal acid hydrolases. The experiments using a mutant DNase I with the Asn106glycosylation site deleted demonstrated that the effect of Val23 is primarily on the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn18. As shown in the space filling model of DNase I (Fig. 6), Val23 is located close to Asn18 and is adjacent to Lys27, which is a key residue in the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide attached to Asn18. Thus, we predict that Val23 inhibits the interaction of Lys27with phosphotransferase. In contrast to Val23, the residues Tyr54, Lys124, and Ser190 function primarily to facilitate the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide attached to Asn106. Substitution of these three residues increased phosphorylation from 36.6 to 90.9% at this site. In addition, there was a strong enhancement of the formation of oligosaccharides with two Man-6-P residues. The importance of Tyr54 and Ser190 for phosphorylation at the Asn106 site was confirmed by the finding that replacement of these residues with alanines in bovine DNase I resulted in a decline in phosphorylation from 85.9 to 23.1%. These results provide additional evidence that amino acids other than lysines are involved in the generation of the phosphotransferase recognition domain (5Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is apparent from Fig. 6 that Tyr54 and Pro190 are located a considerable distance from each other and from Asn106. Tyr54 is adjacent to Lys50, which has also been shown to stimulate phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn106 (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), so these two residues may act together. When these results with murine DNase I are compared with those previously obtained with bovine DNase I, a number of interesting differences emerge with regard to their phosphotransferase recognition domains. The bovine DNase I is missing the two most potent stimulatory residues (Lys27 and Lys74) but also lacks the Val23 inhibitory residue. Murine DNase I, on the other hand, has Lys27 and Lys74, but it also contains Val23 and is missing the stimulatory residues Tyr54, Lys124, and Ser190. Both species have the stimulatory residue Lys50, as well as the inhibitory residue Lys117. The net result is that both bovine and murine DNase I are relatively poor substrates for phosphotransferase, but each can be converted into an excellent substrate by changing just a few amino acids. It is curious that these two forms of DNase I should differ so much in the manner in which they attenuate oligosaccharide phosphorylation by phosphotransferase. It is also interesting to speculate whether other secretory glycoproteins might contain potential phosphotransferase recognition elements that are either blocked by strategically located inhibitory amino acids or lack key stimulatory residues. This may have been a mechanism for controlling the compartmentalization of such proteins during evolution. The finding that the optimal phosphorylation of DNase I requires widely spaced residues is consistent with our previous studies of cathepsin D (6Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Parastar A. Gieselmann V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3651-3658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We found that the minimal components of a phosphotransferase recognition patch in the carboxyl lobe of cathepsin D consisted of two noncontinuous primary sequences (Lys203 and amino acids 265–293) that come together in three-dimensional space. However, phosphorylation was enhanced by the presence of other regions of cathepsin D, including amino lobe elements, indicating that the optimal recognition domain involves a larger surface area. Consistent with these findings, Lukong et al. (21Lukong K.E. Elsliger M.-A. Mort J.S. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) recently reported that peptides derived from several regions of cathepsin D, including one located on the side opposite to the phosphorylated oligosaccharide, inhibit lysosomal enzyme phosphorylation by phosphotransferase. Schierau et al. (20Schierau A. Dietz F. Lange H. Schestag F. Parastar A. Gieselmann V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3651-3658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) came to a similar conclusion using a totally different approach (20Schierau A. Dietz F. Lange H. Schestag F. Parastar A. Gieselmann V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3651-3658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These investigators prepared monoclonal antibodies that bind to at least six different epitopes at different locations on the surface of arylsulfatase A. All of the antibodies were shown to bind outside the lysine-rich recognition domain, yet Fab fragments of these antibodies inhibited interaction of arylsulfatase A with phosphotransferase. The authors concluded that their results support a model in which phosphotransferase interacts with a large surface area of arylsulfatase A. In the lysosomal enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase, three lysine residues and a tyrosine located in three spatially distinct regions of the structure have been found to be necessary for full phosphorylation (11Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of these residues indicates that they function in a cooperative manner, with all three sites being required for optimal phosphorylation. If one accepts that phosphotransferase interacts with a large surface area on its target glycoproteins, it is still necessary to explain the striking finding that Lys27 and Lys74selectively stimulate the phosphorylation of different oligosaccharides on DNase I. We have noted previously that Lys27 and Lys74 are located relatively close to the oligosaccharide the phosphorylation of which they affect and a considerable distance from the other oligosaccharide (1Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on this fact, we suggested that these lysines serve to orient phosphotransferase in a manner that facilitates the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide in the vicinity of the critical lysine. In the context of the current discussion, we would envisage phosphotransferase interacting with a broad surface of the protein with key lysines serving to orient the catalytic site toward the oligosaccharide. Sahagian and co-workers (22Cuozzo J.W. Tao K.T. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have suggested a simpler model for the recognition signal. They have proposed that the signal consists of just two lysine residues spaced about 34 Å apart with a particular orientation relative to the oligosaccharide. They also suggest that each lysine may be situated in specific microenvironments. This proposal is based on the finding that two lysines, spaced 34 Å apart, are necessary for full phosphorylation of cathepsin L and cathepsin D. However, in the case of cathepsin D, mutation of both lysines (Lys203 and Lys293) to alanines inhibits phosphorylation by only 70%. Because 30% of normal phosphorylation remains, other residues must be involved, consistent with the proposal that a large surface area is required for the generation of an optimal recognition determinant. Phosphotransferase has been shown to be a very large 540-kDa complex composed of disulfide-linked homodimers of 166 and 51 kDa subunits and two 56-kDa subunits (23Bao M. Booth L. Elmendorf B. Canfield W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As such, it should have the capability to contact a large surface area on its glycoprotein substrates. The ultimate explanation for how phosphotransferase interacts with its substrate may only come with the determination of the tertiary structure of this enzyme bound to its substrate."

Over the last 2 decades, several studies have attempted to establish a general rule leading to thermostability, but no overall consensus explanation could be formulated (1Jaenicke R. Schurig H. Beaucamp N. Ostendorp R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 48: 181-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, although the composition of thermophilic proteins shows that certain amino acids are preferred to ones present in mesophilic homologues, no general trends emerge. Studies have demonstrated the need to place the analysis of primary structure in a three-dimensional structural context (2Russel R.J. Tylor G.L. Curr. Opin.

All of them, individually or in combination, enable thermophilic proteins to adapt to extreme temperatures.

This fold consists of eight parallel β-strands forming a barrel, surrounded by eight α-helices (11Farber G.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The active site of TIM lies at the carboxyl-terminal end of the β-barrel, and the catalytic residues belong to loops connecting the β-strands to the following α-helices (Lys10, His94, and Glu166; B. stearothermophilus TIM numbering). At present, the three-dimensional structures of 11 TIMs are known: those of chicken (12Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Philips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman J.D.

B. stearothermophilus TIM (bTIM) is reported to display moderately thermophilic enzymatic properties (22Rentier-Delrue F. Mande S.C. Moyens S. Terpstra P. Mainfroid V. Goraj K. Hol W.G.J. Martial J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Resolution of its crystallographic structure has made it possible to propose certain features as responsible for its increased thermostability, such as higher content of proline residues at the N1 position in helices, smallest number and volume of cavities, and more buried hydrophobic surfaces upon dimerization than E. coli TIM (17Delboni L.F. Mande S.C. Rentier-Delrue F. Mainfroid V. Turley S. Vellieux M.D. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). T. maritima TIM (tTIM), described by Schurig et al. (23Schurig H. Beaucamp N. Ostendorp R. Jaenicke R. Adler E. Knowles J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is an extremely thermophilic protein resistant to temperatures above 90 °C. Surprisingly, it is produced as a fusion protein jointly with phosphoglycerate kinase, another glycolytic enzyme. Recently, it has been proposed that the tetrameric quaternary structure adopted by the polyprotein permits conservation of the dimeric form necessary for TIM activity and increases slightly the thermal stability of tTIM (24Beaucamp N. Hofmann A. Kellerer B. Jaenicke R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although many TIM sequences have been reported, few of these proteins have been fully characterized in terms of thermal stability. Alignment of these sequences reveals a particular pair substitution in one of the conserved regions of “thermophilic TIMs” (bTIM and tTIM), an N12H/G13K replacement. Residues 12 and 13 belong to a region of variable length named loop 1, joining strand β1 to helix α1 and located at the TIM dimer interface. The presence of the His12-Lys13 pair is also present in the TIM of a Synechocystis sp. strain, a mesophilic cyanobacterium (25Kaneko T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Kotani H. Sazuka T. Miyajima N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). His12 has been found in the TIMs of Pseudomonas syringae 3J. J. Rich and D. K. Willis, nucleotide sequence of Pseudomonas syringae TIM, ID TPIS-PSESY, Swiss-Prot Data Bank code (AC) P95576. andBorrelia burgdorferi (27Gebbia J.A. Backenson P.B. Coleman J.L. Anda P. Benach J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and Lys13 has been found in Bacillus subtilis TIM (28Leyva-Vazquez M.A. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3903-3910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but there is no available information on the enzymatic properties and stability of these TIMs. The high conservation of Asn12 in most TIMs can be explained by the ability of the Asn side chain amide nitrogen to interact with residues Trp9 and Met11 of the same loop, thereby stabilizing the catalytic Lys10 of the active site (17Delboni L.F. Mande S.C. Rentier-Delrue F. Mainfroid V. Turley S. Vellieux M.D. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). At high temperature, an Asn residue at the edge of the protein's dimeric interface (partially solvent-exposed) is susceptible to deamidation leading to irreversible heat inactivation of the enzyme (29Yuan P.M. Talent J.M. Gracy R.W. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1981; 17: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In solution, deamidation occurs through intra- molecular nucleophilic attack by the backbone amide nitrogen on the γ-carbonyl carbon of the Asn side chain, resulting in conversion of Asn residues to aspartate or isoaspartate and release of ammonia (30Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of deamidation in proteins depends on the pH, ionic strength, temperature, sequence, and structure (30Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3086-3091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of Asn residues is used in protein engineering to thermostabilize proteins: inAspergillus awamori glucoamylase, for instance, it was possible to increase its thermostability severalfold (33Chen H. Ford C. Reilly P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Asn residues followed by Gly appear considerably more sensitive to deamidation (34Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1988; 240: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wright H.T. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) because Gly has more freedom in its main chain torsion angles. This effect was measured by altering Asn-Gly sequences in lysozyme; substitution of Ala for Gly in these sequences protected the enzyme against irreversible heat inactivation (37Tomizawa H. Yamada H. Hashimoto Y. Imoto T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In human and yeast TIMs, two deamidation-sensitive regions have been identified, one in loop 1 and one in loop 3 (29Yuan P.M. Talent J.M. Gracy R.W. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1981; 17: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Gracy R.W. Lu H.S. Yuan P.M. Talent J.M. Adelman R.C. Roth G.S. Altered Proteins and Ageing. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983: 27-34Google Scholar, 39Casal J.I. Ahern T.J. Davenport R.C. Petsko G.A. Klibanov A.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Considering all of these factors, it has been proposed that the N12H and G13K replacements in bTIM could be deamidation-preventing molecular adaptations of the enzyme (17Delboni L.F. Mande S.C. Rentier-Delrue F. Mainfroid V. Turley S. Vellieux M.D. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since the same replacements are also observed in tTIM, it was interesting to see whether this might be part of a general thermostabilization process in TIM. In the present work we have produced double mutants by reintroducing Asn and Gly residues at positions 12 and 13, respectively, in thermophilic bTIM and tTIM. We have measured the activity and structural stability of the mutant enzymes and resolved the three-dimensional structure of the bTIM double mutant. We discuss the individual role of each residue in bTIM and tTIM stability. The E. colistrain HB101 (SupE44 hsd S20 rB-mB recA13ara-14 pro A2 lacY1 gal K2rpsL20xyl-5mtl-l) was used for DNA cloning. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (hsd S gal cIts 857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV-T7, gene 1) was used for protein production. The tTIM gene was overexpressed in the pARAE vector (40L'Hoir C. Renard A. Martial J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a derivative of pAR3040 (41Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.S. Lin S.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). T. maritima genomic DNA was kindly provided by N. Glansdorff (Research Institute of the CERIA-COOVI, Brussels, Belgium). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on T. maritima genomic DNA, using degenerated primers corresponding to conserved regions of TIM (5′-GGNAAYTGGAA-3′ and 5′-NGTNCCNATNGCCCA-3′) (22Rentier-Delrue F. Mande S.C. Moyens S. Terpstra P. Mainfroid V. Goraj K. Hol W.G.J. Martial J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A 500-base pair fragment of the TIM gene was obtained. The entire TIM gene sequence was obtained by inverse PCR (42Ochman H. Medhora M.M. Garza D. Hartl D.L. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 219-227Google Scholar). Briefly, T. maritima genomic DNA was cut withEcoRI, and fragments were recircularized by ligation. The ligated fragments were used as templates for PCR, using primers complementary to sequences located near the ends of the 500-base pair TIM fragment. The amplification reaction resulted in a head-to-tail arrangement of the sequences originally flanking the target region. This product was cloned and sequenced. To obtain the complete TIM gene, we performed another PCR starting with T. maritimachromosomal DNA, using primers corresponding to regions flanking the TIM gene. The tTIM gene PCR product was cloned into the pCRII plasmid (TA cloning system, Invitrogen Corp.). Several clones were sequenced in both directions in order to find clones without errors potentially introduced by Taq polymerase. The correct clone was called gTm10. The tTIM gene was isolated from the gTm10 vector by PCR, using the following primers: 5′-GCTCTAGAGGCATATGATAACTCGTAAACTG-3′, containing XbaI and NdeI restriction sites (underlined), followed by the first five codons encoding the first five amino acid residues of tTIM, and 5′-TGTTTCTCCTTCGTTTCTCT-3′, complementary to the tTIM nucleotide sequence located 466–485 base pairs downstream from the ATG. The PCR product was cut withXbaI and AvaI, purified and ligated to the digested gTm10 plasmid, and finally sequenced. This new plasmid was then cut with NdeI and BamHI to isolate the entire TIM gene, which was subsequently ligated into theNdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pARAE. The plasmid obtained was called pT7-Ther. The expression vector used for bTIM production (named pT7im-Bac) was from Rentier-Delrue et al.(22Rentier-Delrue F. Mande S.C. Moyens S. Terpstra P. Mainfroid V. Goraj K. Hol W.G.J. Martial J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pT7-Ther and pT7im-Bac vectors using the Chameleon Kit (Stratagene). Double mutants of tTIM and bTIM, containing the H12N and K13G replacements, were constructed using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGAGATCGTGCCGTTCATCTTCCAGTTCC-3′ (for tTIM) and 5′-CCGCTAATGTGCCGTTCATTTTCCAGTTGCC-3′ (for bTIM) (mutated codons are underlined). The individual mutations produced in the bTIM gene were incorporated using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGCTAATGTTTTGTTCATTTTCCAGTTGCCTGC-3′ (for the H12N replacement) and 5′-CCGCTAATGTGCCATGCATTTTCCAGTTGCCTGC-3′ (for the K13G replacement). The oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec, S. A. (Seraing, Belgium). The proteins were overproduced using the T7 system (43Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar).E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the expression vectors were grown for 16 h at 37 °C in L broth medium containing 100 mg/l ampicillin. Induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was unnecessary for protein production. Under these conditions, the proteins were produced in a soluble form. The cultures were centrifuged for 15 min at 4500 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The cells were disrupted in a high pressure cell (Inceltech, S. A.), and the cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation (45 min, 10,000 ×g). The supernatants were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the TIM-containing fractions were dialyzed overnight at room temperature against 20 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The dialyzed samples were then applied to a Mono Q ion exchange column (HR 10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted from the column with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient, and the TIM-containing fractions were pooled. Samples containing wild-type TIM were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. Sample purity was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. TIM activity assays were performed as described by Misset and Opperdoes (44Misset O. Opperdoes F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.24 mm NADH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 20 μg/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 9.75 mmd-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Sigma), and 100 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The assay was started by the addition of the following enzyme: 0.8 ng of tTIM, 8.9 ng of bTIM, 4.2 ng of the H12N/K13G bTIM double mutant, 32 ng of the H12N/K13G tTIM double mutant, 11 ng of the H12N bTIM mutant, or 7.4 ng of the K13G bTIM mutant. The thermal stability of each protein was tested by incubating the reaction mixtures at temperatures ranging from 25 to 95 °C in a Trio-thermoblock TB-1 (Biometra BAU). Residual activity after incubation was measured at 25 °C. The inactivation rate constant at each temperature (k inact, expressed in s−1) is defined as the slope of the ln(A t/A o) versus the incubation time (22Rentier-Delrue F. Mande S.C. Moyens S. Terpstra P. Mainfroid V. Goraj K. Hol W.G.J. Martial J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry was performed in a Micro Calorimetry System differential scanning calorimetric unit (MicroCal, Inc.). The protein concentration was adjusted to 1.5 mg/ml for all proteins. Scanning was from 25 to 110 °C (tTIM and H12N/K13G tTIM) and from 25 to 90 °C (bTIM and its mutants) at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. Crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique under conditions similar to those used to crystallize the wild-type enzyme. The protein solution contained 7 mg/ml protein in 5 mm MES (pH 6.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, 2 mm 2-phosphoglycolate (an inhibitor of the protein). Drops were prepared by mixing 4 μl of protein solution with 3 μl of reservoir solution composed of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 8% isopropyl alcohol, 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Needle-shaped crystals were formed. Data were collected to 2.4 Å from one crystal at 20 °C on a Big Mar image plate at station 9.5 of the Daresbury synchrotron source. A wavelength of 1.1 Å was used. The data set was processed with DENZO (45Otwinowski Z. DENZO: An Oscillation Data Processing Program for Macromolecule Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Scaling, merging, and reduction of the integrated intensities were done with SCALEPACK (45Otwinowski Z. DENZO: An Oscillation Data Processing Program for Macromolecule Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and TRUNCATE (46Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19823) Google Scholar). The crystal lattice is primitive orthorhombic with a = 78.13 Å,b = 107.91 Å, and c = 70.98 Å. Because the cell parameters were the same as for native bTIM, the same packing as in the native cell was expected, belonging to space group P21212. Hence, no molecular replacement was done. The coordinates of native bTIM (1BTM; Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) were immediately used for rigid body refinement. The R-factor for data between 9 and 3.0 Å dropped to 26.6% for this solution.

Open table in a new tab A few rounds of visual inspection and improvement followed by computer refinement took place. On the one hand, the model was optimized with the program O (47Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar) running on an SGI workstation, to improve its fit into a 2Fo-Fc density map. On the other hand, refinement was pursued by combining simulated annealing x-ray refinement and conventional positional and thermal factor refinement, using the X-PLOR (48Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) package. For refinement, a subset of 5% of the data (the test set) was used for R-free calculations. A bulk solvent correction was applied. In one of the first rounds, the sequence was changed to the mutated one in both monomers. Electron density maps indicated a closed conformation for loop 6, which was manually rebuilt into the density map. In addition and as expected, the 2-phosphoglycolate molecule was found in the active site of each subunit. Its coordinates were included in the model. The final refinement stages were carried out with crystallography and NMR system (49Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore M.G. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16989) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added at sites displaying a peak larger than three S.D. values above the mean in an Fo-Fc map and having a potential hydrogen bonding partner. A total of 121 water molecules were identified. The final R-factor is 17.5%, and R-free is 22.0% for all data in the resolution range from 30 to 2.40 Å. The quality of the structure was analyzed with the programs PROCHECK (50Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) and WHAT IF (51Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3379) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in TableI. Energy minimizations (molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics) were performed with the Discover program DM1 (Discover User Guide, Molecular Simulations, San Diego), using the cvff force field. Graphical displays were generated with the InsightII molecular modeling system DM2 (InsightII User Guide, Molecular Simulations, San Diego). Computations were done on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation running Irix 5.3. The three-dimensional coordinates of bTIM, tTIM, and H12N/K13G bTIM were taken from the corresponding crystallographic structures for bTIM (1BTM; Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), tTIM,2and the double mutant bTIM (this work). Three-dimensional structures of the single mutants H12N bTIM and K13G bTIM were generated with the Builder interface of the InsightII program, starting with the experimental structure of bTIM. The coordinates of the ligand (2-phosphoglycolate in bTIM and a sulfate ion in tTIM) were retained in the structures, while water molecules were removed. Hydrogens were automatically assigned. A distance-dependent (1.r) dielectric constant was used. For simulations, a subset was defined for each structure, containing all amino acids of the protein within 18 Å of the active site. All coordinates (main chain and lateral chain) were fixed except those of loop 1 (residues 9–20 and 11–22 in bTIM and tTIM, respectively). A combination of molecular mechanic runs (steepest descent + conjugated gradient + Newton-Raphson) was first applied to the structures in order to define equivalent inputs for the molecular dynamics simulations. This was done as the starting structures were obtained at different levels of precision (different resolutions). Molecular dynamics ensued at 300 K for a total of 100 ps (20 runs of 5000 fs), generating 20 geometries for each structure. The geometries were further minimized (annealing to a final derivative cut-off of 0.05 kcal/mol) and analyzed. By in vitro site-directed mutagenesis we replaced the residues His12 and Lys13 of bTIM and tTIM with Asn and Gly, respectively, these two residues being often found in mesophilic TIMs. The two single poi"
