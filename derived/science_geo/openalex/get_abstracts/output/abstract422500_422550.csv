https://openalex.org/W2136272779,"The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase nucleates a pathway that promotes cell growth and proliferation and is the target of rapamycin, a drug with many clinical uses. mTORC1 regulates messenger RNA translation, but the overall translational program is poorly defined and no unifying model exists to explain how mTORC1 differentially controls the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we use high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1 (ref. 2). Our data reveal a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost entirely of transcripts with established 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 and Ybx1, with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs that we identified. We find no evidence to support proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased 5' untranslated region length or complexity. mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA translation is unknown. Remarkably, loss of just the 4E-BP family of translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1 substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation resistant to Torin 1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E and eIF4G1. Loss of this interaction diminishes the capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their translation. Our results clarify the translational program controlled by mTORC1 and identify 4E-BPs and eIF4G1 as its master effectors."

Different combinations of external stimuli lead to distinct polarized activation patterns, resulting in a spectrum of possible macrophage activation phenotypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that can repress the expression of many target genes. We hypothesized that miRNAs play a role in macrophage polarization. miRNA expression profiles were determined in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) incubated in conditions causing activation toward M1, M2a, M2b, or M2c phenotypes. One miRNA guide strand and seven miRNA passenger strands were significantly altered. Changes were confirmed in MDMs from six separate donors. The amplitude of miRNA expression changes in MDMs was smaller than described studies of monocytes responding to inflammatory stimuli. Further investigation revealed this correlated with higher basal miRNA expression in MDMs compared with monocytes. The regulation of M1- and M2b-responsive miRNAs (miR-27a, miR-29b, miR-125a, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-222) was similar in differentiated THP-1 cells and primary MDMs. Studies in this model revealed cross-talk between IFNγ- and LPS-associated pathways regulating miRNA expression. Furthermore, expression of M1-associated transcripts was increased in THP-1 cells transfected with mimics of miR-29b, miR-125a-5p, or miR-155. The apparent inflammatory property of miR-29b and miR-125a-5p can be at least partially explained by repression of TNFAIP3, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Overall, these data suggest miRNAs can contribute to changes in macrophage gene expression that occur in different exogenous activating conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1966361951,"Several protein conformational disorders (Parkinson and prion diseases) are linked to aberrant folding of proteins into prefibrillar oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Although prefibrillar oligomers are more toxic than their fibrillar counterparts, it is difficult to decouple the origin of their dissimilar toxicity because oligomers and fibrils differ both in terms of structure and size. Here we report the characterization of two oligomers of the 42-residue amyloid β (Aβ42) peptide associated with Alzheimer disease that possess similar size and dissimilar toxicity. We find that Aβ42 spontaneously forms prefibrillar oligomers at Aβ concentrations below 30 μm in the absence of agitation, whereas higher Aβ concentrations lead to rapid formation of fibrils. Interestingly, Aβ prefibrillar oligomers do not convert into fibrils under quiescent assembly conditions but instead convert into a second type of oligomer with size and morphology similar to those of Aβ prefibrillar oligomers. Strikingly, this alternative Aβ oligomer is non-toxic to mammalian cells relative to Aβ monomer. We find that two hydrophobic peptide segments within Aβ (residues 16-22 and 30-42) are more solvent-exposed in the more toxic Aβ oligomer. The less toxic oligomer is devoid of β-sheet structure, insoluble, and non-immunoreactive with oligomer- and fibril-specific antibodies. Moreover, the less toxic oligomer is incapable of disrupting lipid bilayers, in contrast to its more toxic oligomeric counterpart. Our results suggest that the ability of non-fibrillar Aβ oligomers to interact with and disrupt cellular membranes is linked to the degree of solvent exposure of their central and C-terminal hydrophobic peptide segments."
https://openalex.org/W2114835551,"The in utero availability of methyl donors, such as choline, may modify fetal epigenetic marks and lead to sustainable functional alterations throughout the life course. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates cortisol production and is sensitive to perinatal epigenetic programming. As an extension of a 12-wk dose-response choline feeding study conducted in third-trimester pregnant women, we investigated the effect of maternal choline intake (930 vs. 480 mg/d) on the epigenetic state of cortisol-regulating genes, and their expression, in placenta and cord venous blood. The higher maternal choline intake yielded higher placental promoter methylation of the cortisol-regulating genes, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH; P=0.05) and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1; P=0.002); lower placental CRH transcript abundance (P=0.04); lower cord blood leukocyte promoter methylation of CRH (P=0.05) and NR3C1 (P=0.04); and 33% lower (P=0.07) cord plasma cortisol. In addition, placental global DNA methylation and dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) were higher (P=0.02) in the 930 mg choline/d group, as was the expression of select placental methyltransferases. These data collectively suggest that maternal choline intake in humans modulates the epigenetic state of genes that regulate fetal HPA axis reactivity as well as the epigenomic status of fetal derived tissues."

Mutations in the gene encoding NOD2 are associated with inherited inflammatory disorders, including Crohn disease and Blau syndrome. NOD2 is a member of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein gene (NLR) family. Nucleotide binding is thought to play a critical role in signaling by NLR family members. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying signal transduction by these proteins remain largely unknown. Mutations in the nucleotide-binding domain of NOD2 have been shown to alter its signal transduction properties in response to muramyl dipeptide in cellular assays. Using purified recombinant protein, we now demonstrate that NOD2 binds and hydrolyzes ATP. Additionally, we have found that the purified recombinant protein is able to bind directly to muramyl dipeptide and can associate with known NOD2-interacting proteins in vitro. Binding of NOD2 to muramyl dipeptide and homo-oligomerization of NOD2 are enhanced by ATP binding, suggesting a model of the molecular mechanism for signal transduction that involves binding of nucleotide followed by binding of muramyl dipeptide and oligomerization of NOD2 into a signaling complex.

https://openalex.org/W2009842820,"Although serum albumin has an established function as a transport protein, evidence is emerging that serum albumin may also have a role as a molecular chaperone. Using established techniques to characterize chaperone interactions, this study demonstrates that bovine serum albumin: 1) preferentially binds stressed over unstressed client proteins; 2) forms stable, soluble, high molecular weight complexes with stressed client proteins; 3) reduces the aggregation of client proteins when it is present at physiological levels; and 4) inhibits amyloid formation by both WT and L55P transthyretin. Although the antiaggregatory effect of serum albumin is maintained in the presence of physiological levels of Ca(2+) and Cu(2+), the presence of free fatty acids significantly alters this activity: stabilizing serum albumin at normal levels but diminishing chaperone-like activity at high concentrations. Moreover, here it is shown that depletion of albumin from human plasma leads to a significant increase in aggregation under physiologically relevant heat and shear stresses. This study demonstrates that serum albumin possesses chaperone-like properties and that this activity is maintained under a number of physiologically relevant conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2124377923,"Many functions of galectin-3 entail binding of its carbohydrate recognition site to glycans of a glycoprotein, resulting in cross-linking thought to be mediated by its N-terminal noncarbohydrate-binding domain. Here we studied interaction of galectin-3 with the model glycoprotein asialofetuin (ASF), using a fluorescence anisotropy assay to measure the concentration of free galectin carbohydrate recognition sites in solution. Surprisingly, in the presence of ASF, this remained low even at high galectin-3 concentrations, showing that many more galectin-3 molecules were engaged than expected due to the about nine known glycan-based binding sites per ASF molecule. This suggests that after ASF-induced nucleation, galectin-3 associates with itself by the carbohydrate recognition site binding to another galectin-3 molecule, possibly forming oligomers. We named this type-C self-association to distinguish it from the previously proposed models (type-N) where galectin-3 molecules bind to each other through the N-terminal domain, and all carbohydrate recognition sites are available for binding glycans. Both types of self-association can result in precipitates, as measured here by turbidimetry and dynamic light scattering. Type-C self-association and precipitation occurred even with a galectin-3 mutant (R186S) that bound poorly to ASF but required much higher concentration (∼50 μM) as compared with wild type (∼1 μM). ASF also induced weaker type-C self-association of galectin-3 lacking its N-terminal domains, but as expected, no precipitation. Neither a monovalent nor a divalent N-acetyl-D-lactosamine-containing glycan induced type-C self-association, even if the latter gave precipitates with high concentrations of galectin-3 (>∼50 μM) in agreement with published results and perhaps due to type-N self-association."
https://openalex.org/W2004916086,"MicroRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and have emerged as critical regulators of skeletal muscle development. Here, we identified miR-148a as a novel myogenic microRNA that mediated myogenic differentiation. The expression levels of miR-148a increased during C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Overexpression of miR-148a significantly promoted myogenic differentiation of both C2C12 myoblast and primary muscle cells. Blocking the function of miR-148a with a 2'-O-methylated antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor repressed C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), a known inhibitor of myogenesis, as a target of miR-148a. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to demonstrate that miR-148a directly targeted the 3'-UTR of ROCK1. In addition, the overexpression of miR-148a decreased the protein expression of ROCK1 in C2C12 myoblast and primary muscle cells. Furthermore, ROCK1 inhibition with specific siRNA leaded to accelerated myogenic differentiation progression, underscoring a negative regulatory function of ROCK1 in myogenesis. Therefore, our results revealed a novel mechanism in which miR-148a positively regulates myogenic differentiation via ROCK1 down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2039206013,"Through a rational design approach, we generated a panel of HLA-A*0201/NY-ESO-1(157-165)-specific T cell receptors (TCR) with increasing affinities of up to 150-fold from the wild-type TCR. Using these TCR variants which extend just beyond the natural affinity range, along with an extreme supraphysiologic one having 1400-fold enhanced affinity, and a low-binding one, we sought to determine the effect of TCR binding properties along with cognate peptide concentration on CD8(+) T cell responsiveness. Major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) expressed on the surface of various antigen presenting cells were peptide-pulsed and used to stimulate human CD8(+) T cells expressing the different TCR via lentiviral transduction. At intermediate peptide concentration we measured maximum cytokine/chemokine secretion, cytotoxicity, and Ca(2+) flux for CD8(+) T cells expressing TCR within a dissociation constant (K(D)) range of ∼1-5 μM. Under these same conditions there was a gradual attenuation in activity for supraphysiologic affinity TCR with K(D) < ∼1 μM, irrespective of CD8 co-engagement and of half-life (t(1/2) = ln 2/k(off)) values. With increased peptide concentration, however, the activity levels of CD8(+) T cells expressing supraphysiologic affinity TCR were gradually restored. Together our data support the productive hit rate model of T cell activation arguing that it is not the absolute number of TCR/pMHC complexes formed at equilibrium, but rather their productive turnover, that controls levels of biological activity. Our findings have important implications for various immunotherapies under development such as adoptive cell transfer of TCR-engineered CD8(+) T cells, as well as for peptide vaccination strategies."

Dysregulation of this system is often associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, resulting in hyperglycemia in mammals. Here, we show that the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) is a novel downstream mediator of glucagon action in hepatic gluconeogenesis and demonstrate a beneficial impact of the inverse agonist GSK5182. Hepatic ERRγ expression was increased by fasting-dependent activation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein-CRTC2 pathway. Overexpression of ERRγ induced Pck1 and G6PC gene expression and glucose production in primary hepatocytes, whereas abolition of ERRγ gene expression attenuated forskolin-mediated induction of gluconeogenic gene expression. Deletion and mutation analyses of the Pck1 promoter showed that ERRγ directly regulates the Pck1 gene transcription via ERR response elements of the Pck1 promoter as confirmed by ChIP assay and in vivo imaging analysis. We also demonstrate that GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRγ, specifically inhibits the transcriptional activity of ERRγ in a PGC-1α dependent manner. Finally, the ERRγ inverse agonist ameliorated hyperglycemia through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis in db/db mice.

Control of hepatic glucose production by an ERRγ-specific inverse agonist is a new potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Glucose homeostasis is tightly controlled by hormonal regulation during fasting and feeding periods. As an initial response to fasting, the pancreatic hormone glucagon triggers the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver via glycogenolysis. In times of prolonged fasting, however, glucagon stimulates de novo synthesis of additional glucose through gluconeogenesis in the liver (1Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K.

Male 7–12-week-old C57BL/6J and db/db mice (Charles River Laboratories) were maintained on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum. GSK5182 (40 mg/kg/day as a final dose) and corn oil emulsion were sonicated again immediately before injection of db/db mice. After 14 h of fasting, intraperitoneal injections were performed for 5 days. After the injections, blood glucose levels were monitored after 4 h of fasting. All experiments were conducted following the guidelines of the Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care And Use Committee. C57BL/6J mice were infected with Ad-Pck1 WT-Luc (−2371/+73) or Ad-Pck1 ERRE mut-Luc via tail vein injections. Three days postinjection, mice were either fasted for 16 h or fasted for 16 h and refed for 4 h. Mice were imaged using an IVIS 100 imaging system (Xenogen) as described previously (30Lee M.W.

Twenty-four hours after seeding of rat primary hepatocytes, the medium were replaced with Krebs-Ringer buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 m MgCl2, 1.2 mm NAH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mm lactate and 1 mm pyruvate. The cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin for 12 h, 100 nm insulin for 18 h, and/or 10 μm GSK5182 for 18 h. The glucose level in the medium was measured using a QuantiChrom glucose assay kit (Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a CRE site on ERRγ promoter or the ERRγ binding sites (ERREs) on Pck1 promoter were generated and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: sense 5′-GGGGCGGCTCGCGTCGCCTCCCTCC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGGGGGAGGGAGGCGACGCGAGCCG-3′ for CRE; sense 5′-GGGGTGGACCTCCAGGTCATTTCGT-3′ and antisense 5′-GGGGACGAAATGACCTGGAGGTCCA-3′ for ERRE1; and sense 5′-GGGGGCCTCCCTGACCTAAGGGA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGGGTCCCTTAGGTCAGGGAGGC-3′ for ERRE2. Underlined sequences were substituted to AA for mutant CRE and TT for mutant ERRE1 and ERRE2. Purified recombinant protein for CREB or ERRγ was generated by in vitro translation using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Unprogrammed TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate was used as a negative control, and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the ERRγ binding site on DAX-1 promoter were used as a positive control (31Park Y.Y. Ahn S.W. Kim H.J. Kim J.M. Lee I.K. Kang H. Choi H.S.

Unlabeled oligonucleotides were added as cold competitors at 50–100-fold molar excess where indicated. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. The gels were dried and then analyzed by autoradiography. The dissociation constant of GSK5182 with ERRγ ligand binding domain was determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare). The surface carboxyl group of a CM5 sensor chip was activated with a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide in flow cells 3 and 4 to generate the reactive succinimide ester on the CM5 chip. ERRγ ligand binding domain (100 μg/ml in 10 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0) was passed through flow cell 4 (5200 resonance units) and immobilized via amide bond formation with succinimide ester on the CM5 chip. The remaining succinimide ester on flow cells 3 and 4 was quenched by an injection of 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.0. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a running buffer throughout the immobilization process. After the immobilization, various concentrations of GSK5182 ranging from 50 nm to 5 μm were injected for 60 s with a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and the dissociation of GSK5182 from ERRγ ligand binding domain immobilized on the sensor chip surface was monitored for 600 s at the same flow rate. The running buffer was 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 containing 5% DMSO, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.005% P20. The binding events were measured at 25 °C, and a DMSO correction was performed during the binding assay. The data were analyzed using Biacore T100 Evaluation software. Final sensorgrams were obtained by eliminating responses from flow cell 3 and buffer-only control. The dissociation constant (KD) was calculated by fitting the sensorgrams to a 1:1 binding model. Total RNA from either primary hepatocytes or liver was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). cDNA generated by Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) was analyzed by Q-PCR using a SYBR Green PCR kit and a TP800 Thermal Cycler DICE Real Time system (Takara). All data were normalized to ribosomal L32 expression. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance between mean values was evaluated by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. It has been reported that hepatic expression of ERRγ rhythmically oscillates in the daily light/dark cycle and is induced during fasting (21Yang X. Downes M. Yu R.T. Bookout A.L. He W. Straume M.

Endocrinol. 2007; 264: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could be regulated by nutritional status. Because glucagon stimulates hepatic glucose production mainly through the cAMP signaling pathway under fasting (33Montminy M. Transcriptional regulation by cyclic AMP.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether ERRγ expression is induced by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (FSK) in AML12 cells and rat primary hepatocytes. The mRNA and protein levels of ERRγ were rapidly increased 1 and 3 h, respectively, after the addition of FSK (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the induction of Pck1 mRNA occurred after 1-h treatment with FSK. However, expression of ERRα was not significantly changed (Fig. 1A). Notably, the expression of Pck1 and G6PC occurred after 30 and 45 min, respectively, whereas the induction of ERRγ mRNA was only increased after 1-h treatment with FSK (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that FSK stimulation led to the initial induction of Pck1 and G6PC, which is faster than that of ERRγ. To further test the correlation between ERRγ and gluconeogenic gene expression in vivo, we analyzed mRNA levels for these genes in wild type mice under fasting over time. Similar to the results in cultured cell lines, Pck1 and G6PC mRNA levels were rapidly induced after 1-h of fasting and were strongly induced after 6-h fasting conditions, whereas ERRγ gene expression was only enhanced 3 h after fasting and further elevated until 12 h post-food deprivation (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that, in addition to the initial induction of gluconeogenic gene expression by fasting, ERRγ expression precedes that of additional gluconeogenic gene expression in vivo. In an attempt to determine whether ERRγ expression is involved in the additive effect of cAMP on Pck1 gene expression, H4IIE cells were treated with cAMP alone or cAMP plus cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, in a time-dependent manner. Pck1 gene expression was significantly increased by cAMP stimulation for 1 h and was further enhanced by 6-h stimulation with cAMP (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, Pck1 gene induction by 1-h treatment with cAMP was not affected by CHX treatment, whereas the additional Pck1 gene induction by 6-h treatment with cAMP was blocked by CHX treatment, clearly suggesting that cAMP-mediated ERRγ expression contributes to the additional pathway of cAMP-mediated Pck1 gene expression. We next explored the potential mechanisms underlying the induction of ERRγ by cAMP during fasting. We first investigated the role of CRTC2, a mediator of the cAMP-dependent transcriptional program in hepatocytes (6Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W.

https://openalex.org/W1986868297,"Technological applications of liquid crystals have generally relied on control of molecular orientation at a surface or an interface. Such control has been achieved through topography, chemistry and the adsorption of monolayers or surfactants. The role of the substrate or interface has been to impart order over visible length scales and to confine the liquid crystal in a device. Here, we report results from a computational study of a liquid-crystal-based system in which the opposite is true: the liquid crystal is used to impart order on the interfacial arrangement of a surfactant. Recent experiments on macroscopic interfaces have hinted that an interfacial coupling between bulk liquid crystal and surfactant can lead to a two-dimensional phase separation of the surfactant at the interface, but have not had the resolution to measure the structure of the resulting phases. To enhance that coupling, we consider the limit of nanodroplets, the interfaces of which are decorated with surfactant molecules that promote local perpendicular orientation of mesogens within the droplet. In the absence of surfactant, mesogens at the interface are all parallel to that interface. As the droplet is cooled, the mesogens undergo a transition from a disordered (isotropic) to an ordered (nematic or smectic) liquid-crystal phase. As this happens, mesogens within the droplet cause a transition of the surfactant at the interface, which forms new ordered nanophases with morphologies dependent on surfactant concentration. Such nanophases are reminiscent of those encountered in block copolymers, and include circular, striped and worm-like patterns."

Dystrophic muscles exhibit activated immune cell infiltrates, up-regulated inflammatory gene expression, and increased NF-κB activity, but the contribution of the skeletal muscle cell to this process has been unclear. The aim of this work was to study the pathways that contribute to the increased resting calcium ([Ca2+]rest) observed in mdx myotubes and its possible link with up-regulation of NF-κB and pro-inflammatory gene expression in dystrophic muscle cells. [Ca2+]rest was higher in mdx than in WT myotubes (308 ± 6 versus 113 ± 2 nm, p < 0.001). In mdx myotubes, both the inhibition of Ca2+ entry (low Ca2+ solution, Ca2+-free solution, and Gd3+) and blockade of either ryanodine receptors or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors reduced [Ca2+]rest. Basal activity of NF-κB was significantly up-regulated in mdx versus WT myotubes. There was an increased transcriptional activity and p65 nuclear localization, which could be reversed when [Ca2+]rest was reduced. Levels of mRNA for TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 were similar in WT and mdx myotubes, whereas inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression was increased 5-fold. Reducing [Ca2+]rest using different strategies reduced iNOS gene expression presumably as a result of decreased activation of NF-κB. We propose that NF-κB, modulated by increased [Ca2+]rest, is constitutively active in mdx myotubes, and this mechanism can account for iNOS overexpression and the increase in reactive nitrogen species that promote damage in dystrophic skeletal muscle cells.

https://openalex.org/W2036530526,"Sox9 plays a critical role in early chondrocyte initiation and promotion as well as repression of later maturation. Fellow Sox family members L-Sox5 and Sox6 also function as regulators of cartilage development by boosting Sox9 activation of chondrocyte-specific genes such as Col2a1 and Agc1; however, the regulatory mechanism and other target genes are largely unknown. MicroRNAs are a class of short, non-coding RNAs that act as negative regulators of gene expression by promoting target mRNA degradation and/or repressing translation. Analysis of genetically modified mice identified miR-140 as a cartilage-specific microRNA that could be a critical regulator of cartilage development and homeostasis. Recent findings suggest Sox9 promotes miR-140 expression, although the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proximal upstream region of pri-miR-140 has chondrogenic promoter activity in vivo. We found an L-Sox5/Sox6/Sox9 (Sox trio) response element and detailed binding site in the promoter region. Furthermore, detailed analysis suggests the DNA binding and/or transactivation ability of Sox9 as a homodimer is boosted by L-Sox5 and Sox6. These findings provide new insight into cartilage-specific gene regulation by the Sox trio."
https://openalex.org/W2058203865,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by bone erosion and cartilage destruction in the joints. Many of the conventional antiarthritic drugs are effective in suppressing inflammation, but they do not offer protection against bone damage. Furthermore, the prolonged use of these drugs is associated with severe adverse reactions. Thus, new therapeutic agents that can control both inflammation and bone damage but with minimal side effects are sought. Celastrus is a Chinese herb that has been used for centuries in folk medicine for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. However, its utility for protection against inflammation-induced bone damage in arthritis and the mechanisms involved therein have not been examined. We tested celastrus and its bioactive component celastrol for this attribute in the adjuvant-induced arthritis model of RA. The treatment of arthritic rats with celastrus/celastrol suppressed inflammatory arthritis and reduced bone and cartilage damage in the joints as demonstrated by histology and bone histomorphometry. The protective effects against bone damage are mediated primarily via the inhibition of defined mediators of osteoclastic bone remodeling (e.g. receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)), the deviation of RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio in favor of antiosteoclastic activity, and the reduction in osteoclast numbers. Furthermore, both the upstream inducers (proinflammatory cytokines) and the downstream effectors (MMP-9) of the osteoclastogenic mediators were altered. Thus, celastrus and celastrol controlled inflammation-induced bone damage by modulating the osteoimmune cross-talk. These natural products deserve further consideration and evaluation as adjuncts to conventional therapy for RA."

https://openalex.org/W2059461233,"Metastasis requires numerous biological functions that jointly provide tumor cells from a primary site to seed and colonize a distant organ. Some of these activities are selected for in the primary site, whereas others are acquired at the metastatic niche. We provide molecular evidence showing that the BMP inhibitor, NOG, provides metastatic breast cancer cells with the ability to colonize the bone. NOG expression is acquired during the late events of metastasis, once cells have departed from the primary site, because it is not enriched in primary tumors with high risk of bone relapse. On the contrary, breast cancer bone metastatic lesions do select for high levels of NOG expression when compared with metastasis to the lung, liver, and brain. Pivotal to the bone colonization functions is the contribution of NOG to metastatic autonomous and nonautonomous cell functions. Using genetic approaches, we show that when NOG is expressed in human breast cancer cells, it facilitates bone colonization by fostering osteoclast differentiation and bone degradation and also contributes to metastatic lesions reinitiation. These findings reveal how aggressive cancer cell autonomous and nonautonomous functions can be mechanistically coupled to greater bone metastatic potential."

https://openalex.org/W1969340160,"Ca(2+) is an integral component of the Mn(4)O(5)Ca cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II (PS II). Its removal leads to the loss of the water oxidizing functionality. The S(2)' state of the Ca(2+)-depleted cluster from spinach is examined by X- and Q-band EPR and (55)Mn electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. Spectral simulations demonstrate that upon Ca(2+) removal, its electronic structure remains essentially unaltered, i.e. that of a manganese tetramer. No redistribution of the manganese valence states and only minor perturbation of the exchange interactions between the manganese ions were found. Interestingly, the S(2)' state in spinach PS II is very similar to the native S(2) state of Thermosynechococcus elongatus in terms of spin state energies and insensitivity to methanol addition. These results assign the Ca(2+) a functional as opposed to a structural role in water splitting catalysis, such as (i) being essential for efficient proton-coupled electron transfer between Y(Z) and the manganese cluster and/or (ii) providing an initial binding site for substrate water. Additionally, a novel (55)Mn(2+) signal, detected by Q-band pulse EPR and ENDOR, was observed in Ca(2+)-depleted PS II. Mn(2+) titration, monitored by (55)Mn ENDOR, revealed a specific Mn(2+) binding site with a submicromolar K(D). Ca(2+) titration of Mn(2+)-loaded, Ca(2+)-depleted PS II demonstrated that the site is reversibly made accessible to Mn(2+) by Ca(2+) depletion and reconstitution. Mn(2+) is proposed to bind at one of the extrinsic subunits. This process is possibly relevant for the formation of the Mn(4)O(5)Ca cluster during photoassembly and/or D1 repair."

We here examined the involvement of this receptor in defense against infection by Staphylococcus aureus. Flies lacking integrin βν died earlier than control flies upon a septic but not oral infection with this bacterium. A loss of integrin βν reduced the phagocytosis of S. aureus and increased bacterial growth in flies. In contrast, the level of mRNA of an antimicrobial peptide produced upon infection was unchanged in integrin βν-lacking flies. The simultaneous loss of integrin βν and Draper, another receptor involved in the phagocytosis of S. aureus, brought about a further decrease in the level of phagocytosis and accelerated death of flies compared with the loss of either receptor alone. A strain of S. aureus lacking lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component serving as a ligand for Draper, was susceptible to integrin βν-mediated phagocytosis. In contrast, a S. aureus mutant strain that produces small amounts of peptidoglycan was less efficiently phagocytosed by larval hemocytes, and a loss of integrin βν in hemocytes reduced a difference in the susceptibility to phagocytosis between parental and mutant strains. Furthermore, a series of experiments revealed the binding of integrin βν to peptidoglycan of S. aureus. Taken together, these results suggested that Draper and integrin βν cooperate in the phagocytic elimination of S. aureus by recognizing distinct cell wall components, and that this dual recognition system is necessary for the host organism to survive infection.

Here we have characterized a PR-1-like protein, Fpr1, from Fusarium oxysporum, an ubiquitous fungal pathogen that causes vascular wilt disease on a wide range of plant species and can produce life-threatening infections in immunocompromised humans. Fpr1 is secreted and proteolytically processed by the fungus. The fpr1 gene is required for virulence in a disseminated immunodepressed mouse model, and its function depends on the integrity of the proposed active site of PR-1-like proteins. Fpr1 belongs to a gene family that has expanded in plant pathogenic Sordariomycetes. These results suggest that secreted PR-1-like proteins play important roles in fungal pathogenicity."

Genetic disruption of KCNQ1-KCNE2 causes hypothyroidism in mice, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy, dwarfism, alopecia, and prenatal mortality. Here, we investigated the mechanistic requirement for KCNQ1-KCNE2 in thyroid hormone biosynthesis, utilizing whole-animal dynamic positron emission tomography. The KCNQ1-specific antagonist (—)-[3R,4S]-chromanol 293B (C293B) significantly impaired thyroid cell I− uptake, which is mediated by the Na+/I− symporter (NIS), in vivo (dSUV/dt: vehicle, 0.028±0.004 min−1; 10 mg/kg C293B, 0.009±0.006 min-1) and in vitro (EC50: 99±10 μM C293B). Na+-dependent nicotinate uptake by SMCT, however, was unaffected. Kcne2 deletion did not alter the balance of free vs. thyroglobulin-bound I− in the thyroid (distinguished using ClO4−, a competitive inhibitor of NIS), indicating that KCNQ1-KCNE2 is not required for Duox/TPO-mediated I− organification. However, Kcne2 deletion doubled the rate of free I− efflux from the thyroid following ClO4− injection, a NIS-independent process. Thus, KCNQ1-KCNE2 is necessary for adequate thyroid cell I− uptake, the most likely explanation being that it is prerequisite for adequate NIS activity.—Purtell, K., Paroder-Belenitsky, M., Reyna-Neyra, A., Nicola, J.

We found that 9-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinal or 9-cis-retinol, is able to restore light-dependent ipRGC activity after bleaching. Melanopsin was highly resistant to both visible-spectrum photic bleaching and chemical bleaching with hydroxylamine under conditions that fully bleach rod and cone photoreceptor cells. These results suggest that the melanopsin photocycle can function independently of both rod and cone photocycles, and that apo-melanopsin has a strong preference for binding cis-retinal to generate functional pigment. The data support a model in which retinal is continuously covalently bound to melanopsin and may function through a reversible, bistable mechanism."

Ligand binding in AChBPs and in nAChRs occurs at the interface between two adjacent protomers, with one of the subunits contributing to the principal face and the second subunit contributing to the complementary face of the ligand binding site (7Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Binding specificity to different nAChR subtypes is known to arise at least in part from subpockets located at the apical or basal regions of the binding site (17Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T.

Such subpockets are accessible to relatively large ligands, but not necessarily to smaller nicotinic ligands, likely to display affinity differences when binding to nAChRs. Nicotine is a plant alkaloid responsible for the addictive properties of tobacco. Among others, nicotine binding to brain nAChRs results in dopamine release, which is critically involved in reward mechanisms and in the reinforcing effect of the drug (19Dwoskin L.P. Smith A.M. Wooters T.E. Zhang Z. Crooks P.A. Bardo M.T. Nicotinic receptor-based therapeutics and candidates for smoking cessation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction are complex and have been extensively reviewed (e.g. Ref. 20Benowitz N.L. Nicotine addiction.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 2295-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Nicotine replacement therapies constitute a clean and safer mode of delivery of this compound compared with smoking tobacco. Nicotine binds with high affinity to the α4β2 nAChRs (Ki 1 nm), where it acts as a full agonist, as opposed to low affinity binding to the α7 receptor (Ki 1600 nm) (21Daly J.W. Nicotinic agonists, antagonists, and modulators from natural sources.Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 25: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Nicotine application provides a high level of occupancy at α4β2 nAChRs, maintaining them in a desensitized state associated with a reduced nicotinic functional activity (19Dwoskin L.P. Smith A.M. Wooters T.E. Zhang Z. Crooks P.A. Bardo M.T. Nicotinic receptor-based therapeutics and candidates for smoking cessation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A novel treatment option in smoking cessation is the use of nAChR partial agonists. Partial agonists may have a therapeutic effect due to two critical molecular actions, which are to desensitize α4β2 nAChRs and to induce channel opening with higher affinity but with lower efficacy than a full agonist at equal receptor occupancy. This diminishes nicotine reinforcement and reduces the pleasure from smoking, thus aiding the continued adherence to therapy (19Dwoskin L.P. Smith A.M. Wooters T.E. Zhang Z. Crooks P.A. Bardo M.T. Nicotinic receptor-based therapeutics and candidates for smoking cessation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the α4β2 nAChR partial agonists used for smoking cessation is cytisine, a toxic plant alkaloid isolated from Cytisus laburnum (22Lancaster T. Stead L. Cahill K. An update on therapeutics for tobacco dependence.Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2008; 9: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This natural product has been used as a lead compound in the development of varenicline (23Coe J.W. Brooks P.R. Vetelino M.G. Wirtz M.C. Arnold E.P. Huang J. Sands S.B. Davis T.I. Lebel L.A. Fox C.B.

Varenicline also functions as a partial agonist at the α4β2 nAChRs, and both cytisine and varenicline display high affinities, with Ki values of 0.17 and 0.06 nm, respectively, for this receptor subtype, whereas they bind with lower affinity to the α7 nAChR, with Ki values of 4200 and 322 nm, respectively (21Daly J.W. Nicotinic agonists, antagonists, and modulators from natural sources.Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 25: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Coe J.W. Brooks P.R. Vetelino M.G.

In smoking cessation therapies, application of these molecules provides a 1.5–3-fold increase in chances for quitting smoking compared with the use of placebos (19Dwoskin L.P. Smith A.M. Wooters T.E. Zhang Z. Crooks P.A. Bardo M.T. Nicotinic receptor-based therapeutics and candidates for smoking cessation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To understand the basis for subtype-selective and high affinity binding of partial agonists to nAChRs, we have structurally characterized complexes of Aplysia californica AChBP (AcAChBP) with the small α4β2 partial agonists cytisine and varenicline and compare these to an LsAChBP complex with the α4β2 agonist nicotine. We have complemented these structural studies with ligand binding studies to determine affinities. and we discuss the thermodynamic profiles of these compounds when binding to AcAChBP. These three ligands display differences in affinity when binding to different nAChR subtypes. They indeed bind to α4β2 receptors with higher affinity compared with the α7 subtype. We, therefore, assessed cytisine binding to wild type and mutant AcAChBPs engineered to reflect either α7 or α4β2 ligand binding sites to learn about selectivity properties for these receptors. Our data may contribute to further design efforts aiming at the generation of optimized subtype-specific (partial) agonists targeting nAChRs. AcAChBP used in crystallization or in ITC assays was expressed as untagged protein in Sf21 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified from growth medium as described previously (24Edink E.

A synthetic gene, codon optimized for expression in mammalian cells, coding for AcAChBP downstream of a preprotrypsin signal peptide, was purchased (Genscript) and was cloned into a pTT3 vector using BamHI and HindIII as restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was transfected into attached HEK293 cells, and medium harvested 4 days after transfection was processed as above for purifying wild type and mutant AcAChBP variants. Untagged AcAChBP concentrated to 3 mg/ml was incubated on ice for 1 h with 1 mm ligand before vapor diffusion crystallization trials were set up. Co-crystals for the different ligands grew in similar conditions at room temperature in 0.6–1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m MMT buffer at a pH ranging between 6.5 and 8.5. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol and 1 mm ligand before they were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on beamlines ID14-4 or on beamline PX1 at SLS (Switzerland) (Table 1). Cytisine and varenicline co-crystals were in spacegroup I23 and diffracted to resolutions of 2.9 and 3.2 Å, respectively (Table 1). Data reduction was done either using XDS and XSCALE (24Edink E.

Iterative structure refinement was performed using either REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr.

Thanks to this use of 5-fold symmetry restraints, electron density maps are much better than usual at these resolutions. One TLS group per chain was used in refinement, and both the x-ray weight and B-factor restraint weight were optimized to reduce the Rwork/Rfree gap during refinement. Refinement was interspersed with manual rebuilding in COOT (33Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

All protomer-protomer interfaces enclosed a ligand molecule that was built into the electron density only in later refinement stages. All ligand molecules were well defined in electron density. Refined structures were validated using the Molprobity server (34Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

AcAChBP used in these experiments was dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm TRIS-Cl, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl. The ligands investigated were dissolved in the same buffer. For a typical experiment, 100 μm concentrations of ligand were titrated into 10 μm AcAChBP. Titration of ligands into buffer alone was performed to determine the change in enthalpy generated by the dilution of the ligands, and this background was subtracted from the actual ligand binding experiments. Corrected data were analyzed using manufacturer supplied software and were fitted using a non-linear least squares method with a single-site binding model. Radioligand binding assays through either classical saturation experiments or through homologous competition were performed with AcAChBP in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween) in a final assay volume of 100 μl in Optiplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). [3H]Cytisine concentration (PerkinElmer; specific activity, ∼40 Ci/mmol) was around the Kd value for the target protein. The amount of protein (4–300 ng) was chosen such that a clear window in the homologous saturation curve was obtained with sufficient events in scintillation counting and a radioligand depletion of less than 10%. WGA-YSI SPA beads (PerkinElmer) were added at 2 mg/ml final concentration. Plates were incubated at room temperature under continuous shaking and protected from light for 1.5 h. SPA beads were allowed to settle for 3 h in the absence of light before counting. The label-bead complex was counted in a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta (PerkinElmer). All radioligand binding data were fitted to a one site homologous competitive binding model using Graphpad Prism® (Version 5, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). At least three independent repeats were performed for the experiments. We have validated the binding of three different high affinity α4β2 ligands (Fig. 1A) currently used as smoking cessation aids, namely (−)-nicotine, (−)-cytisine, and (meso)-varenicline to AcAChBP. We then proceeded with the structural characterization of complexes of AcAChBP with cytisine and varenicline refined to resolutions of 2.9 and 3.2 Å, respectively (Table 1). Cytisine and varenicline co-crystals grew in similar conditions in space group I23 with one pentamer in the asymmetric unit (see “Experimental Procedures”) and display similar homopentameric organization as previously solved AChBP structures (for review, see Ref. 1Rucktooa P. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Insight in nAChR subtype selectivity from AChBP crystal structures.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The electron density maps for these structures were much better than expected for such resolutions thanks to the use of 5-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints during refinement, and we could confidently build the ligands in the binding sites (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1). All protomer-protomer interfaces in these complexes encompassed their respective ligands (Fig. 1, B and C) with the C loop closed over the ligand binding site. Tips of the C-loops from different protomers were not involved in crystal packing. All the ligands above are enclosed in the characteristic aromatic cage constituted of residues Tyr-91, Trp-145, Tyr-186, and Tyr-193 from the principal face and residue Tyr-53 from the complementary face. Hydrophobic interactions from disulfide-bonded Cys-188 and Cys-189 from loop C further stabilized the ligands in the binding site. We further compared binding modes of α4β2 partial agonists cytisine and varenicline with that of nicotine in complex with LsAChBP (14Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K.

Cytisine is a plant alkaloid that acts as a partial agonist at the α4β2 subtype nAChRs, with an EC50 of ∼1 μm (22Lancaster T. Stead L. Cahill K.

Our co-crystal structure of AcAChBP with cytisine was solved with a resolution of 2.9 Å and contains one AcAChBP pentamer per asymmetric unit. All five binding sites in the pentamer are occupied by cytisine, and the ligand adopts the same orientation in all sites (Fig. 2B). The piperidine ring of cytisine is oriented toward the basal side of the ligand binding site, whereas the pyridone ring is oriented toward the apical side. On top of the hydrophobic interactions involving the binding site aromatic cage residues (Tyr-91, Trp-145, Tyr-186, and Tyr-193), the tip of loop C (Cys-188 and Cys-189), and complementary face residues Met-114 and Ile-116, cytisine is stabilized through hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl group of Trp-145 and the pyridone ring N2 as well as between the piperidine ring N1 and the hydroxyl moiety of Tyr-91 or the Trp-145 backbone carbonyl. The cytisine oxygen is also hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule (W1) stabilized by the carbonyl backbone of Ile-104, the Ile-116 backbone amide from the complementary face, and a second water molecule (W2). This binding mode involving water molecules is highly reminiscent of nicotine binding in LsAChBP (Fig. 2A) (14Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

Further hydrophobic interactions from the side chains of Val-146 from the principal face and Met-114 and Ile-116 from the complementary face also stabilize the ligand. Ring-substituted cytisine derivatives have been generated previously to further investigate affinity and/or selectivity variations in binding to the α4β2 receptor subtype (36Chellappan S.K. Xiao Y.

In a rare variant of myositis, muscle fibers are similarly attacked by CD8-negative T cells expressing the γδ-TCR (γδ-T cell-mediated myositis). We investigated the antigen specificity of a human γδ-TCR previously identified in an autoimmune tissue lesion of γδ-T cell-mediated myositis. We show that this Vγ1.3Vδ2-TCR, termed M88, recognizes various proteins from different species. Several of these proteins belong to the translational apparatus, including some bacterial and human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AA-RS). Specifically, M88 recognizes histidyl-tRNA synthetase, an antigen known to be also targeted by autoantibodies called anti-Jo-1. The M88 target epitope is strictly conformational, independent of post-translational modification, and exposed on the surface of the respective antigenic protein. Extensive mutagenesis of the translation initiation factor-1 from Escherichia coli (EcIF1), which served as a paradigm antigen with known structure, showed that a short α-helical loop around amino acids 39 to 42 of EcIF1 is a major part of the M88 epitope. Mutagenesis of M88 showed that the complementarity determining regions 3 of both γδ-TCR chains contribute to antigen recognition. M88 is the only known example of a molecularly characterized γδ-TCR expressed by autoaggressive T cells in tissue.

Although γδ-T cells serve a wide range of physiological functions, they may also be involved in autoimmunity (5Wucherpfennig K.W. Newcombe J. Li H. Keddy C. Cuzner M.L.

This γδ-TCR was isolated from muscle of a unique but well characterized patient with γδ-T cell-mediated myositis. In contrast to other forms of myositis where oligoclonally expanded CD8+ αβ-T cells attack muscle fibers (9Dalakas M.C.

To search for the target antigen(s), we expressed M88 on the surface of a T hybridoma cell line and as soluble single-chain Fv fragment excreted from COS-7 cells (11Wiendl H. Malotka J. Holzwarth B.

Neuroimmunol. 2004; 152: 168-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In earlier experiments, we found that presumably several target antigens may be recognized. All contain a protein component and a conformational rather than a linear epitope. Antigens were present in several species ranging from human muscle cells to bacteria. Moreover, we were unable to express M88 in the cytosol of any cell line, and we could not generate transgenic mice. Even bacteria stopped growing when M88 was induced in the cytosol. We therefore reasoned that M88 might bind to an intracellular proteinaceous motif that is essential for cell growth. Here, we show that the target epitope of M88 is present on several structurally and functionally diverse proteins, including human and bacterial proteins of the translational apparatus. By extensive site-specific mutagenesis of a small paradigmatic protein, EcIF-1, we obtained evidence that part of the epitope is exposed in a short α-helix on the protein surface. Furthermore, we found that several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AA-RS) were recognized. Although their structures are unknown, and they are quite large proteins, which impedes mutagenesis experiments, they are of particular interest because some of these are known targets of autoantibodies in several forms of human myositis (13Plotz P.H. The autoantibody repertoire: Searching for order.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Levine S.M. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase immune responses: Insights into the pathogenesis of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2003; 15: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although it is still unknown how the B cell responses to AA-RS evolve during pathogenesis, these autoantibodies are used as diagnostic markers of myositis. Our observation that AA-RS are targeted by autoaggressive γδ-T cells therefore reveals a surprising link between early, semi-innate immune responses mediated by γδ-T cells, and late responses mediated by mature, complement-activating autoantibodies. The host strain E. coli BL21-Star-DE3 (Invitrogen) was stably transfected with a described single chain Fv construct of our Vγ1.3Vδ2+-TCR M88 (12Dornmair K. Schneider C.K. Malotka J. Dechant G.

The VN(D)NJ regions of the γ- and δ-chains were connected by a 15-amino acid linker, but the construct used here did not contain a signal sequence. Bacteria were grown in the presence of 2 mm glucose and 50 μg/ml kanamycin unless stated otherwise to suppress γδ-TCR expression. After washing the bacteria by centrifugation, they were resuspended in medium without glucose, and expression of M88 was induced by adding 2 mm isopropylthiogalactoside (Merck). Growth curves were recorded by determining the optical density of the bacterial suspension culture at 600 nm. A cDNA expression library was constructed from mRNA of E. coli MG1655 (ATCC) and inserted into the expression plasmid pET21c(+) (Novagene). To this end, we first replaced the NdeI restriction site of pET21c(+) with a SmaI site by amplifying the sequence between the BglII and the NheI sites using the primer pair pET-BglII (5′-TAGAGGATCGAGATCTCGATCC-3′) and pET-Sma-Mut-rev (5′-AGTCATGCTAGCCCCGGGTATATCTCCTTC-3′) and pET21c(+) as template for PCR. Then, the parent BglII-NheI fragment was replaced by the new fragment, which contained the replacement NdeI to SmaI. This plasmid was digested with SmaI and NotI, and the former insert was removed. In parallel, a cDNA expression library from E. coli MG1655 was established. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed by DNase I treatment. E. coli mRNA was amplified using the ExpressArt Bacterial mRNA amplification kit (AmpTec), which yields amplified cDNA. In the final synthesis step, cDNA was synthesized according to the protocol for second round amplification with the exception that primer C was replaced by a primer that contained a NotI restriction site (5′-ATAGTTTAgcggccgcGGGAGATTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. (The NotI site is underlined.) This product was finally digested with NotI. Due to the enzymes contained in the amplification kit, the library contains a blunt end on the other side. It was finally inserted into the plasmid pET21c(+) digested previously with SmaI and NotI. M88-transfected E. coli BL21-Star-DE3 cells were supertransfected by electroporation at 2.5 kV, 200 ohm, 25 μF in 2-mm electrode gap cuvettes with the cDNA library in pET21c(+) and grown for 30 min in LB medium with 2 mm glucose. Then ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. After 30 min, kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After another 30 min, the bacteria were washed by centrifugation, resuspended in LB medium without glucose, and grown for a further 30 min. Then, expression was induced by adding isopropylthiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 30 min, bacteria were grown on agar plates that contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. After incubation for 40 h at 37 °C, the biggest colonies were picked and grown in suspension cultures in the presence of ampicillin and glucose, and plasmids were prepared and sequenced by standard methods. As a control experiment, we plated the bacteria on plates that contained 1% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, but without isopropyl thiogalactoside to shut down the promoter. Colonies of similar size became visible already after 18 h at 37 °C. The synthetic peptide EcIF1(33–46), which represents amino acids 33–46 of EcIF1, was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversed phase HPLC. Its correct sequence was verified by mass spectrometry. The purified recombinant human proteins His-, Thr-, and Ala-tRNA synthetases hH-RS (Jo-1), hT-RS (PL-7), hA-RS (PL-12), human formimidoyltransferase-cyclodeaminase (hLC1) and human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (hPCNA) were purchased from Diarect (Freiburg). All human proteins were produced identically in a baculovirus expression system and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The polyclonal anti-Jo-1 human Ig fraction BP2040 was purchased from Acris, the monoclonal mouse α-Jo-1 IgG1 antibody HARSA6 was from GenWay, and the isotype control monoclonal mouse IgG1 Pure antibody X40 was from BD Biosciences. The anti-mouse CD3ϵ antibody 145–2C11 (BD Biosciences) was used as control for γδ-TCR activation. All bacterial proteins are contained in the PUREexpress in vitro translation kit (New England Biolabs). They were expressed in the cytosol of E. coli and purified by IMAC as described (15Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nature Biotech. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). In contrast to the kit, where the proteins are pooled, here, all proteins were expressed and tested individually. Total RNA from E. coli SG13009 (Qiagen) was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit and RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared using the clone-specific primer IF1wt-rev and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). E. coli IF1 wild-type cDNA was amplified using the primers IF1wt-for and IF1wt-rev. See supplemental Table S1 for all primer sequences. The PCR reaction was carried out for 40 cycles at 94 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C for 1 min each. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1. TOPO (Invitrogen), which served as a template for all further experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based method: nucleotides coding for the amino acid of choice were introduced into forward (Mut-for) and reverse (Mut-rev) PCR primers (supplemental Table S1) that span the selected positions. In addition, these primers contained silent nucleotide exchanges to introduce unique restriction sites at positions that closely flanked the desired mutation. Two fragments were amplified. For the first fragment we used the primer IF1-wt-for-BamHI together with one of the reverse primers IF-X-rev-Y, where X denoted the amino acid to be exchanged, and Y denoted the restriction site to be inserted. For the second fragment, we used the primer IF1-wt-rev-HindIII together with one of the forward primers IF-X-for-Y. The conditions of the PCR reactions were as described above. The PCR fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes Y, purified, and ligated, and a second PCR was performed using primers IF1wt-for-BamHI and IF1wt-rev-HindIII only. The PCR products encoding the full-length sequences of IF1 wild-type and mutants were cloned into the plasmid pCR2.1.-TOPO, digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen), which carries a sequence coding for a His6 tag at the N terminus. Therefore, the expressed proteins are extended for the N-terminal sequence, MRGS-His6-GS. Plasmids were transfected into E. coli strain DH5α-F́IQ (Invitrogen). As negative control, we used E. coli DH5α-F́IQ transfected with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (16Amor S. Groome N. Linington C. Morris M.M. Dornmair K. Gardinier M.V. Matthieu J.M. Baker D. Identification of epitopes of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL and Biozzi AB/H mice.J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4349-4356PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). Protein expression was induced at a cell density of 0.4–0.5 A600 nm by adding isopropylthiogalactoside to a final concentration of 2 mm. Bacteria were harvested after 4 h by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Bacterial pellets from a 250-ml culture were resuspended in 70 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05 mg/ml DNase (Sigma) 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication on ice for 15 min at 30 W using a Branson 450 sonifier. After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g the supernatants were purified by IMAC. The supernatants were loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The columns were washed with 10–15 column volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and stored at −80 °C. Bacteria expressing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were treated identically. Because this protein precipitates quantitatively in inclusion bodies, this mock preparation contains only co-purifying contaminating bacterial proteins. Protein concentrations were measured according to Peterson et al. (17Peterson G.L. A simplification of the protein assay method of Lowry et al. which is more generally applicable.Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar). Purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% tris-glycine polyacrylamid Novex protein gels (Invitrogen). Gels were stained by Coomassie Blue (Fluka) or with silver (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). We confirmed the native secondary structure of EcIF1 by measuring circular dichroism spectra at 25 °C in the range from 195 to 250 nm using a Jasco J-715 spectrometer. The protein concentration was 18.3 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The spectrum of the buffer was subtracted prior to data analysis. The experimental curves were fitted to a set of standard proteins using the program Spectra Manager CDProAnalysis Contin SMP56 (Jasco). For some experiments, proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography. We used a 7.8 mm × 30 cm TSK-Gel G2000SWXL 5–150 kDa column with a particle size of 5.0 μm (Tosoh Bioscience) and HP1100 HPLC equipment (Agilent). Chromatography was performed in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 200 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. 27–30 μg of protein were injected, and >12 fractions in a time range of 5–21 min were collected. The cDNAs of M88 wild-type chains and chains carrying a set of mutated γ- and δ-chains with altered V-, N(D)N(J)-, or Cγ- regions were cloned into expression plasmids, and expressed on the surface of the T hybridoma cell line 58α−β− (19Blank U. Boitel B. Mège D. Ermonval M. Acuto O. Analysis of tetanus toxin peptide/DR recognition by human T cell receptors reconstituted into a murine T cell hybridoma.Eur. J.

Individual clones were picked and analyzed independently. All selected clones expressed the heterodimeric γδ-TCR on their surface and were capable of IL-2 secretion after TCR activation by antigens. For all T cell activation experiments, the candidate and control proteins were coated to flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar). EcK-RS and the anti-CD3ϵ control antibody 145-2C11 were coated for 3 h at 37 °C at 20 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively, in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Samples from the HPLC columns were coated directly in HPLC buffer and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. For testing antigen recognition of wild-type M88-transfectants or mutants with altered TCR γ-or δ-chains, 10 μg/well wild-type EcIF1 was coated for 3 h at 37 °C. To detect direct M88 activation by human recombinant proteins and for the antibody blocking assay, the candidate proteins were coated at 0.5 μg/well in 50 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, the plates were washed with buffer. For the antibody blocking assay, 50 μl of antibody solution in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 to 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (lot 075K3398 (Sigma)), 1.5 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) and 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the coated candidate proteins. The polyclonal anti-Jo-1 human Ig fraction BP2040 was used at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100, and the monoclonal mouse α-Jo-1 IgG1 antibody HARSA6 at 10 μg/ml final concentration. The monoclonal mouse IgG1 Pure antibody X40 served as isotype control at 10 μg/ml. To test recognition of the synthetic peptide EcIF1(33–46), it was coated at concentrations between 5.0 × 102 and 5.0 × 10−5 μg/well for 3 h at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. To test competition of EcIF1(33–46) with wild-type EcIF1, EcIF1 was coated at 0.5 μg/well for 3 h at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. After washing the wells with buffer, EcIF1(33–46) was added at concentrations between 666.0 and 3.3 × 10−4 μg/ml together with M88 transfected hybridoma cells. For investigating recognition of denatured EcIF1, recombinant EcIF1 was coated at 0.5 μg/well for 3 h at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Then, the wells were washed with buffer, and the samples were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 6 m guandinium thiocyanate, 2 m HCl, 5 m NaOH, or 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche). EcIF1 was digested in solution with 1 μg/ml trypsin (Merck) in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, for 3 h at 37 °C and coated thereafter. For the dose-response experiments, EcIF1 wild-type and mutant proteins were centrifuged before use in 30-kDa spin columns (Amicon, Millipore) for 20 min at 3,000 × g. After centrifugation, the protein concentration of the flow-through was measured. Proteins were coated at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 μg/well in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, for 3 h at 37 °C. For all experiments, the coated plates were washed with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), except for the antibody-blocking experiments, where the plates were not washed. Then, 40,000 M88 transfectants were added to each well at a final volume of 150 μl in medium as described above and incubated for 17 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Finally, 50 μl of supernatant were removed, and mouse IL-2 was measured by ELISA (eBioscience). Background signals from samples without antigens were subtracted, and absolute IL-2 concentrations were determined using a standard curve. As an initial step toward identification of the target antigen of the γδ-TCR M88, we “rescued” E. coli cells from the growth-inhibiting effects of M88 by supertransfecting the bacteria with a cDNA library. Growth of bacteria was halted when the expression of a single-chain Fv construct (12Dornmair K. Schneider C.K. Malotka J. Dechant G. Wiendl H. Hohlfeld R. Antigen recognition properties of a Vγ1.3Vδ2-T-cell receptor from a rare variant of polymyositis.J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 152: 168-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of M88 was induced in the cytosol of E. coli BL21 (Fig. 1A). Because there were no reasons to assume that M88 was toxic (the protein is not particularly hydrophobic or charged and presumably has no enzymatic activity), we surmised that M88 might bind and neutralize a bacterial compound that is essential for cell growth. We further knew from previous experiments that a protein moiety is at least part of the antigen (11Wiendl H. Malotka J. Holzwarth B. Weltzien H.U. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. Dornmair K. An autoreactive γδ TCR derived from a polymyositis lesion.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we supertransfected M88-expressing bacteria with a cDNA library from E. coli to rescue them from growth inhibition by M88. Clones expressing library coded proteins that contain the antigen would be expected to bind to M88 and neutralize it. Such bacteria would grow in big colonies, whereas clones that contain irrelevant transcripts would yield small colonies or would not grow at all. Indeed, after supertransfection with the Fv-M88 and the library and induction of M88 and library expression, we observed many very small bacterial clones but also a few clones that grew to very big colonies (Fig. 1B). Under conditions where M88 expression was prevented, all colonies were of the same size (Fig. 1C). We picked some of the biggest colonies and sequenced the inserts of the plasmids coding for the library. In two clones, we identified E. coli lysyl-tRNA synthetase (EcK-RS) as a candidate antigen. To confirm that EcK-RS contains the antigenic epitope, we coated purified, recombinant EcK-RS (15Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nature Biotech. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) to a microtiter plate, added T hybridoma cells that expressed M88 (11Wiendl H. Malotka J. Holzwarth B. Weltzien H.U. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. Dornmair K. An autoreactive γδ TCR derived from a polymyositis lesion.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and measured secreted IL-2 in the supernatant. We found that M88 indeed recognizes EcK-RS (Fig. 1D). Because we surmised that M88 might recognize an epitope present on several proteins, we tested other proteins from the translation apparatus of E. coli (15Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nature Biotech. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Several proteins were indeed recognized. Although all proteins were highly purified, some minor contaminations were detectable in some of the preparations (supplemental Fig. S1A). To exclude that such contaminations were recognized, we subjected some of the samples to size-exclusion HPLC and tested all eluted fractions for M88-activating capacity (Fig. 2). We found that in addition to EcK-RS, the E. coli AA-RS for asparagine (EcN-RS) and the EcIF1 1 (E. coli translation initiation factor) specifically activated M88 because M88 activation was observed only with fractions that contained the respective proteins. By contrast, AA-RS for aspartic acid (EcD-RS) was not recognized (Fig. 2). Together, these data show that M88 recognizes several functionally and structurally different bacterial proteins. Because we knew that M88 may also recognize proteins from human muscle cell extracts (11Wiendl H. Malotka J. Holzwarth B. Weltzien H.U. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. Dornmair K. An autoreactive γδ TCR derived from a polymyositis lesion.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we tested recombinant human AA-RS for histidine and alanine (hH-RS, hA-RS), which are also known as myositis antigens “Jo-1” and “PL-12”. As above, we performed size-exclusion HPLC to exclude that contaminations were recognized (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1B). M88 activation was observed only in fractions containing hH-RS and hA-RS, providing evidence that these proteins were recognized directly. M88 activation was not limited to AA-RS because also hLC1 (20Mao Y. Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Chen D.H. Ludtke S.J. Chiu W. Quiocho F.A.

The control protein hPCNA, which was identically produced and purified, was not recognized. Activation of hH-RS was specific, as it was blocked completely by a polyclonal anti-serum and by a monoclonal antibody against hH-RS (Fig. 4). Recognition of hA-RS and of the hu"

The intestinal barrier is established by highly regulated cell-cell contacts between epithelial cells. The goal of these studies was to define the role for the chemokine CXCL12 in regulating E-cadherin during collective sheet migration during epithelial restitution. Mechanisms regulating E-cadherin were investigated using Caco2(BBE) and IEC-6 model epithelia. Genetic knockdown confirmed a critical role for E-cadherin in in vitro restitution and in vivo wound repair. During restitution, both CXCL12 and TGF-β1 tightened the monolayer by decreasing the paracellular space between migrating epithelial cells. However, CXCL12 differed from TGF-β1 by stimulating the significant increase in E-cadherin membrane localization during restitution. Chemokine-stimulated relocalization of E-cadherin was paralleled by an increase in barrier integrity of polarized epithelium during restitution. CXCL12 activation of its cognate receptor CXCR4 stimulated E-cadherin localization and monolayer tightening through Rho-associated protein kinase activation and F-actin reorganization. These data demonstrate a key role for E-cadherin in intestinal epithelial restitution."

Structure-specific endonucleases are widespread enzymes that incise DNA as components of most DNA repair and recombination pathways. The activity of these enzymes needs to be tightly regulated since they might otherwise inadvertently fragment DNA (1Fagbemi A.F. Orelli B. Schärer O.D. Regulation of endonuclease activity in human nucleotide excision repair.DNA Repair. 2011; 10: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One of the most important pathways depending on the action of endonucleases is nucleotide excision repair (NER), 3The abbreviations used are: NERnucleotide excision repairICLinterstrand crosslinkHhHhelix-hairpin-helixHLDhelicase like domain. which addresses lesions induced by UV light, environmental mutagens and certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In NER, an oligonucleotide of 24–32 nucleotides in length containing the damage is removed and the original DNA sequence restored using the non-damaged strand as a template (2Gillet L.C. Schärer O.D. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian global genome nucleotide excision repair.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 253-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).

The two structure-specific endonucleases involved in NER, XPG and ERCC1-XPF, are multifunctional proteins, with diverse roles in NER and other pathways. XPG is a latent endonuclease, fulfilling first a structural and subsequently a catalytic role in NER. It has additional roles in transcription in conjunction with TFIIH (1Fagbemi A.F. Orelli B. Schärer O.D. Regulation of endonuclease activity in human nucleotide excision repair.DNA Repair. 2011; 10: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

We investigated the role of four C-terminal DNA binding domains by mutational analysis in the context of full-length ERCC1-XPF. Our studies show that DNA binding mutations in any single domain are insufficient to abolish NER in vitro and in vivo. Instead, we report that mutations in multiple domains are necessary to disrupt NER and that there is a hierarchy of importance of the individual domains. Our studies are consistent with the notion that multiple weak interactions among proteins and DNA substrates drive progress through the NER reaction (2Gillet L.C. Schärer O.D.

Bacmid DNA was generated in DH10Bac cells and transfected into the Sf9 insect cells to obtain baculoviruses according to a standard protocol (Bac-to-Bac, Invitrogen). The following combination of ERCC1 and XPF proteins were co-expressed in Sf9 cells for 60 to 65 h with an MOI of 5: ERCC1-XPF, ERCC1-XPFR678A, ERCC1-XPFK850A/R853A, ERCC1-XPFR678A/K850A/R853A, ERCC1K247A/K281A-XPF, ERCC1N110A-XPF, ERCC1N110A/K247A/K281A-XPF, ERCC1K247A/K281A-XPFR678A, ERCC1N110A-XPFR678A, and ERCC1K247A/K281A-XPFK850A/K853A. Cells were lysed and proteins purified over a 1 ml Nickel (His Trap) column (Amersham Biosciences), a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and a 1 ml Hitrap Heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) as described in (30Enzlin J.H.

For each reaction, 2 μl of repair buffer (200 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 10 mm ATP, 110 mm phosphocreatine (di-Tris salt, Sigma), and 1.8 mg/ml BSA), 0.2 μl of creatine phosphokinase (2.5 mg/ml, sigma), 3 μl of XPF-deficient cell extract (about 10 mg/ml), NaCl (to a final concentration of 70 mm), and different amounts of purified ERCC1-XPF in a total volume of 9 μl were pre-warmed at 30 °C for 10 min. 1 μl plasmid containing dG-AAF or cis-Pt (50 ng/μl) was added to each reaction, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. After adding 0.5 μl of 1 μm of an oligonucleotide complementary to the excision product with a 4G overhang for either dG-AAF (5′ GGGGCATGTGGCGCCGGTAATAGCTACGTAGCTCp-3′) or cis-Pt (5′-GGGGGAAGAGTGCACAGAAGAAGACCTGGTCGACCp-3′), the mixtures were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. After cooling at room temperature for 15 min, 1 μl of sequenase mixture (0.13 units of sequenase (USB), and 2.0 μCi [α-32P]dCTP for each reaction) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, followed by addition of 1.2 μl dNTP mixture (50 μm dCTP, 100 μm dTTP, 100 μm dATP, and 100 μm dGTP). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 12 min and stopped by addition of 8 μl of 80% formamide/10 mm EDTA. After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, samples were placed on ice and analyzed on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were exposed to a phosphor screen and visualized by Phosphorimager (Typhoon 9400, Amersham Biosciences Biosciences). For the anisotropy experiments, the protein storage buffer was exchanged to 25 mm KH2PO4 pH 7.6, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl. Increasing concentrations of protein were incubated with the splayed arm substrate (10 nm) which was made by annealing the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTTTCGAACATCCAGGAGAGCACGGCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT with an FAM label at the 3′-end and 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCCGTGCTCTCCTGGATGTTCGAAAG. 100 nm of competitor double-stranded DNA (5′-TCAAAGTCACGACCTAGACACTGCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGAGTGACCTC and 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAGTGTCTAGGTCGTGACTTTGA) were used in each reaction.

The experiments were conducted at least four times and measured on Infinite M1000 plate reader (Tecan). The data were fitted using the grafit4 program to the equation f = y + a × x^b/(c^b + x^b), where x is the protein concentration, f is the fluorescent anisotropy and c is the Kd value. Human XP-F mutant fibroblasts XP2YO, Chinese hamster ovary cells UV20 (with a mutation in ERCC1), and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose 1× (GIBCO), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humid incubator. Wild-type or mutant XPF cDNA with an hemaglutinin (HA) tag at C-terminal was inserted into the pWPXL vector, which was co-transfected with the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelop plasmid pMD2G into 293T cells to generate lentiviral particles. The particles were transduced into XP2YO cells to produce cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant XPF proteins according to established procedures (48Salmon P. Kindler V. Ducrey O.

They were washed first with PBS and then with PBS plus 0.05% Triton X-100 and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (XP2YO cells) or washed first with PBS and then with PBS plus 0.1% triton X-100, and fixed by 3% paraformaldehyde plus 0.2% triton X-100 (UV20 cells). After fixation, cells were washed with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. To stain for (6–4)PPs, cells were treated with 0.07 m NaOH in PBS for 5 min, followed by washing with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking with PBS plus 5 mg/ml BSA and 1.5 mg/ml glycine, cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-(6–4)PP antibody (Cosmo Bio) 1:400, rabbit polyclonal anti-ERCC1 antibody (FL-297, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:100, or rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (ChIP grade, Abcam) 1:2000 for 1.5 h, and washed with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100.

https://openalex.org/W2070324328,"SHARPIN (SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein) is part of a large multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex called LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex), which catalyzes the formation of linear ubiquitin chains and regulates immune and apoptopic signaling pathways. The C-terminal half of SHARPIN contains ubiquitin-like domain and Npl4-zinc finger domains that mediate the interaction with the LUBAC subunit HOIP and ubiquitin, respectively. In contrast, the N-terminal region does not show any homology with known protein interaction domains but has been suggested to be responsible for self-association of SHARPIN, presumably via a coiled-coil region. We have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal portion of SHARPIN, which adopts the highly conserved pleckstrin homology superfold that is often used as a scaffold to create protein interaction modules. We show that in SHARPIN, this domain does not appear to be used as a ligand recognition domain because it lacks many of the surface properties that are present in other pleckstrin homology fold-based interaction modules. Instead, it acts as a dimerization module extending the functional applications of this superfold. SHARPIN (SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein) is part of a large multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex called LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex), which catalyzes the formation of linear ubiquitin chains and regulates immune and apoptopic signaling pathways. The C-terminal half of SHARPIN contains ubiquitin-like domain and Npl4-zinc finger domains that mediate the interaction with the LUBAC subunit HOIP and ubiquitin, respectively. In contrast, the N-terminal region does not show any homology with known protein interaction domains but has been suggested to be responsible for self-association of SHARPIN, presumably via a coiled-coil region.

A low-calorie, high-fiber, fruit-based nutrient-dense bar of defined composition (e.g., vitamins and minerals, fruit polyphenolics, β-glucan, docosahexaenoic acid) appropriate for deconstruction and mechanistic studies is described and evaluated in a pilot trial. The bar was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Changes in cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk biomarkers were measured after 2 wk twice-daily consumption of the bar, and compared against baseline controls in 25 healthy adults. Plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) increased 6.2% (P=0.001), due primarily to a 28% increase in large HDL (HDL-L; P<0.0001). Total plasma homocysteine (Hcy) decreased 19% (P=0.017), and glutathione (GSH) increased 20% (P=0.011). The changes in HDL and Hcy are in the direction associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline; increased GSH reflects improved antioxidant defense. Changes in biomarkers linked to insulin resistance and inflammation were not observed. A defined food-based supplement can, within 2 wk, positively impact metabolic biomarkers linked to disease risk. These results lay the groundwork for mechanistic/deconstruction experiments to identify critical bar components and putative synergistic combinations responsible for observed effects."

However, these experiments could not tell much about what else is required for signal transduction from STIM1 to Orai1 in naïve cells when both molecules are expressed at the normal endogenous levels, which are significantly lower than that in heterologous systems. Thus, the question remains open on how closely endogenous SOCE mechanism may be represented by SOCE created in heterologous systems, and if there are any features of endogenous SOCE pathway that may be lost when Orai1 and/or STIM1 are overexpressed. This question is particularly important as additional molecules and mechanisms have been shown to participate intimately in endogenous SOCE (20Bolotina V.M. Orai, STIM1, and iPLA2β: A view from a different perspective.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but their role in SOCE was questioned in view of a direct conformational coupling model established for overexpressed Orai1 and STIM1. One such essential component is Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β or PLA2G6A). Its important role in endogenous SOCE was demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells (24Ross K. Whitaker M.

In all of these studies, inhibition of the catalytic activity or molecular knockdown of iPLA2β caused dramatic impairment of endogenous SOCE, leaving little doubt about its important role in the SOCE process (for review, see Ref. 20Bolotina V.M. Orai, STIM1, and iPLA2β: A view from a different perspective.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Importantly, results of a genetic screen of Drosophila melanogaster (5Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. CRACM1 is a plasma membrane protein essential for store-operated Ca2+ entry.Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), which identified STIM1 and Orai1 as essential components of SOCE, also picked up an ortholog of iPLA2β encoded by the CG6718 gene, which is highly homologous to the human PLA2G6 (up to 85% in the main structural domains). Knockdown of the iPLA2β ortholog (CG6718) showed a significant impact on SOCE activation, which was identical to that of STIM1 (see supplemental data in Ref. 5). This result clearly confirmed the role of iPLA2β as one of the major molecular determinants of endogenous SOCE. However, the importance of iPLA2β for SOCE was questioned by the finding that functional inhibition of iPLA2β with bromoenole lactone (BEL, a suicidal inhibitor of catalytic activity) failed to inhibit CRAC current in HEK293 cells overexpressing Orai1 and STIM1 (29Derler I. Fritsch R. Schindl R. Romanin C. CRAC inhibitors: identification and potential.Exp. Opin. Drug Discov. 2008; 3: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result pointed to the possibility that overexpressed Orai1 and STIM1 create SOCE that may not fully reflect the properties of the endogenous process. The current study presents new evidence that some properties of endogenous SOCE indeed change in response to overexpression of STIM1 and Orai1. We also tested a novel idea that there may be a cross-talk between expression levels of the major molecular determinants of endogenous SOCE and found that expression of endogenous Orai1 determines and depends upon expression levels of a specific plasma membrane variant of iPLA2β but not STIM1. These findings highlight the complexity of the SOCE mechanism and the role of its endogenous mediators, which may be lost in overexpression systems. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using jetPEI (PolyPlus) or with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In experiments that required down-regulation of one protein along with overexpression of another protein, Lipofectamine 2000 was used for co-transfection of siRNA and plasmid DNA. Transfection factors were used according to the protocols suggested by the manufacturers. The standard transfection rate was ∼70–90%, 24 h after transfection. Constructs encoding human Orai1 (GenBankTM accession no. NM032790) and STIM1 (GenBankTM accession no. NM003156) tagged with green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were described previously (30Gwozdz T. Dutko-Gwozdz J. Zarayskiy V. Peter K. Bolotina V.M. How strict is the correlation between STIM1 and Orai1 expression, puncta formation, and ICRAC activation?.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C1133-C1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs of Orai1 and STIM1 were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the pEGFP-N1 and/or pmCherry-N1 vectors (Clontech) using BglII and EcoRI restriction sites. To down-regulate STIM1, Orai1, or iPLA2β, HEK293 cells were transfected with following stealth siRNAs (100 nm): 5′-AGAAGGAGCUAGAAUCUCAuu-3′ (IDT) for STIM1 and 5′-CCCUUCGGCCUGAUCUUUAUCGUCU-3′ (Invitrogen) for Orai1 and 5′-GGAUCUCAUGCACAUCUCAtt-3′ (Ambion, catalog no. 4390825) for iPLA2β. The siRNA for iPLA2β was targeted to the common part of short (iPLA2β-S) and long (iPLA2β-L) variants. Scrambled siRNA (Ambion) was used in each experiment as a control. Cells were studied 24–72 h after transfection. Total RNA was purified from HEK293 cells with a High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science), and reverse transcription to cDNA was performed using a high capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). The concentration of RNA during isolation was determined by a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Protein extracts were isolated from the cells 96 h after transfection with scrambled RNA or siRNA against iPLA2β, separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. Briefly, membranes were blocked in 5% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Custom-made rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the long variant of human iPLA2β, (1:1000) was used for iPLA2β detection, and monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma, clone AC-15, 1:2000) was used for actin staining. Secondary antibodies were HRP-linked anti-rabbit (1:2000, Cell Signaling, catalog no. 7074) or IRDye® 800CW conjugated anti-mouse (1:20,000, LI-COR Bioscience, catalog no. 926-32210), respectively. Expression of iPLA2β-L, iPLA2β-S, STIM1, and Orai1 was determined by quantitative real-time PCR with a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems): Hs00895670_m1 (iPLA2β-S), Hs00899715_m1 (iPLA2β-L), Hs00963373_m1 (STIM1), Hs00385627_m1 (Orai1), and 4333767F (human glucouronidase β, GUSB). Samples for the analysis were collected before (0 h), 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection. mRNA levels of housekeeping gene (GUSB) were always determined for each target in the same experiment. Data were analyzed with StepOne Software (version 2.0) using the relative standard curve method and normalized to the GUSB and control samples (cells transfected with scrambled siRNA). Data are presented as an average (S.E.) of three to four independent experiments. A Nikon TE2000 wide field system with a 60× oil immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture) was used to image individual cells as previously described (30Gwozdz T. Dutko-Gwozdz J. Zarayskiy V. Peter K. Bolotina V.M. How strict is the correlation between STIM1 and Orai1 expression, puncta formation, and ICRAC activation?.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C1133-C1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Prior to the imaging experiments, cells were passed onto glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek) and studied 24–36 h after transfection. During imaging experiments cells were maintained in extracellular buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 1.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) at room temperature. Fluorescence was monitored using following filter sets (Chroma): 1) ET470/40 (excitation), ET525/50 (emission) and T495LP (dichroic) for GFP, and 2) ET560/40 (excitation), ET630/75 (emission), and T585LP (dichroic) for mCherry. Stacks of images were taken at Z intervals of 0.3 μm and then deconvolved using the AutoQuant Module Media Cybernetics) in NIS-Elements software (Nikon). HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded with fura2/AM (Invitrogen), and changes in intracellular Ca2+ (measured as F340/F380 ratio) were monitored as described previously (30Gwozdz T. Dutko-Gwozdz J. Zarayskiy V. Peter K. Bolotina V.M. How strict is the correlation between STIM1 and Orai1 expression, puncta formation, and ICRAC activation?.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C1133-C1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, a dual-excitation fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging) was used for studies of individual cells. The changes in intracellular Ca2+ were expressed as Δratio, which was calculated as the difference between the peak values of the ratio after extracellular Ca2+ was added and ratio right before Ca2+ addition. After transfection, the cells were plated on the coverslips and kept in culture. 72 h after transfection, Ca2+ was recorded simultaneously from 20–40 cells from each coverslip, which after transfection represented a mixed population of GFP-positive (transfected) and GFP-negative (non-transfected) cells. To determine the effect of (S)-BEL and MCD on Ca2+ influx, the cells on each coverslip were pretreated with 50 μm (S)-BEL or 10 mm MCD for 30 min at 37 °C, and the drugs were washed away prior to the Ca2+ experiment. Data were summarized from the large number of individual cells (as indicated on the bar graphs): 10–40 cells were analyzed in each single run (representative traces are shown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 3), repeated in three to five independent experiments for each condition using at least three different cell transfections. In each experiment, GFP-positive (transfected) and GFP-negative (non-transfected) cells were analyzed and presented separately.FIGURE 1Inhibition of iPLA2β with (S)-BEL impairs TPEN-induced SOCE in naïve HEK293 cells but not in cells overexpressing either STIM1 or Orai1. Results of the comparative analysis of TPEN-induced SOCE in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP (+GFP; A), Orai1 (+Orai1−GFP; B), or STIM1 (+STIM1−GFP; C). Left panels show representative traces of intracellular Ca2+ changes (measured as F340/F380) in cells overexpressing GFP, Orai1, or STIM1 pretreated with vehicle (control) or (S)-BEL (+(S)-BEL, 50 μm for 30 min at 37 °C). Cells were treated with TPEN (1 mm for 5 min) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ followed by addition of 2 mm Ca2+ at the time indicated on the figures. Middle panels summarize the results of experiments shown in left panels and show average TPEN-induced Ca2+ influx (measured as Δratio ± S.E.) in GFP-positive cells. Right panels show summary data from adjacent GFP-negative cells from the same experiments.

As in our earlier studies (24Ross K. Whitaker M. Reynolds N.J. Agonist-induced calcium entry correlates with STIM1 translocation.J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Boittin F.X. Petermann O. Hirn C. Mittaud P. Dorchies O.M. Roulet E. Ruegg U.T. Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 enhances store-operated Ca2+ entry in dystrophic skeletal muscle fibers.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), inhibition of iPLA2β activity was achieved by pretreatment of the cells with (S)-BEL (31Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. Suicide inhibition of canine myocardial cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2. Mechanism-based discrimination between calcium-dependent and -independent phospholipases A2.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to a wide variety of cells (for review, see Ref. 20Bolotina V.M. Orai, STIM1, and iPLA2β: A view from a different perspective.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), pretreatment of HEK293 with (S)-BEL (50 μm for 30 min) resulted in 86.6 ± 1.9% and 83.8 ± 8.2% inhibition of endogenous SOCE induced by TPEN (1 mm for 5 min) and TG (5 μm for 5 min), respectively. Surprisingly, we noticed that when either Orai1GFP or STIM1GFP was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, treatment with (S)-BEL produced virtually no effect. To assess this phenomenon in detail and to exclude the possibility that mere transfection of the cells may change their sensitivity to (S)-BEL, we systematically investigated effects of (S)-BEL on SOCE in HEK293 cells transfected with either GFP or Orai1GFP or STIM1GFP. In each cell preparation, we simultaneously recorded Ca2+ responses in transfected (GFP-positive) and non-transfected (GFP-negative) cells. We found that transfection of the cells with plain GFP did not change SOCE sensitivity to (S)-BEL, and Fig. 1A shows that TPEN-induced SOCE was inhibited by ∼80% in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells. In contrast, in cells overexpressing either Orai1GFP (Fig. 1B) or STIM1GFP (Fig. 1C), (S)-BEL failed to inhibit SOCE in GFP-positive (transfected) cells. Importantly SOCE in adjacent GFP-negative cells (that did not express Orai1GFP or STIMGFP) was inhibited, respectively, by 85.3 ± 3.3% and 82.5 ± 1.9%, which was similar to what was observed in naïve cells (Fig. 1A). Simultaneous study of control cells and cells overexpressing Orai1GFP ensured that both cell types were treated and investigated under the same conditions, and yet, endogenous SOCE in control cells was inhibited, whereas SOCE in Orai1/STIM1-overexpressing cells remained untouched. Similar results were obtained when SOCE was triggered by TG, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. In HEK293 cells overexpressing GFP, pretreatment with (S)-BEL inhibited SOCE by 84.4 ± 3.7% (Fig. 2A), whereas in cells overexpressing Orai1GFP or STIM1GFP (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively), it had no effect. Again, in GFP-negative cells adjacent to those expressing Orai1GFP or STIM1GFP, pretreatment with (S)-BEL resulted in profound inhibition of TG-induced SOCE: 68.5 ± 3.9% for Orai1GFP-negative and 76.9 ± 4.0% for STIM1GFP-negative cells (data not shown). Moreover, pretreatment with (S)-BEL had no visible effect on the dynamics of overexpressed STIM1mCherry and Orai1GFP, which formed puncta even in the cells in which catalytic activity of iPLA2β was inhibited (Fig. 3). To determine whether overexpression of Orai1/STIM1 impairs only SOCE dependence on functional activity of iPLA2β or may change some other features of endogenous SOCE, we have tested SOCE dependence on plasma membrane cholesterol abundance. β-Methylcyclodextran (β-MCD) is used widely to deplete plasma membrane cholesterol and was shown to inhibit SOCE in RBL-2H3 cells"
https://openalex.org/W1984326283,"Several point mutations in rhodopsin cause retinal diseases including congenital stationary night blindness and retinitis pigmentosa. The mechanism by which a single amino acid residue substitution leads to dysfunction is poorly understood at the molecular level. A G90D point mutation in rhodopsin causes constitutive activity and leads to congenital stationary night blindness. It is unclear which perturbations the mutation introduces and how they can cause the receptor to be constitutively active. To reveal insight into these mechanisms, we characterized the perturbations introduced into dark state G90D rhodopsin from a transgenic mouse model expressing exclusively the mutant rhodopsin in rod photoreceptor cells. UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy revealed hydroxylamine accessibility to the chromophore-binding pocket of dark state G90D rhodopsin, which is not detected in dark state wild-type rhodopsin but is detected in light-activated wild-type rhodopsin. Single-molecule force spectroscopy suggested that the structural changes introduced by the mutation are small. Dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopy revealed that, compared with dark state wild-type rhodopsin, the G90D mutation decreased energetic stability and increased mechanical rigidity of most structural regions in the dark state mutant receptor. The observed structural, energetic, and mechanical changes in dark state G90D rhodopsin provide insights into the nature of perturbations caused by a pathological point mutation. Moreover, these changed properties observed for dark state G90D rhodopsin are consistent with properties expected for an active state."
https://openalex.org/W2000487817,"The Gram-positive bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes produces a C3 family ADP-ribosyltransferase designated SpyA (S. pyogenes ADP-ribosyltransferase). Our laboratory has identified a number of eukaryotic protein targets for SpyA, prominent among which are the cytoskeletal proteins actin and vimentin. Because vimentin is an unusual target for modification by bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases, we quantitatively compared the activity of SpyA on vimentin and actin. Vimentin was the preferred substrate for SpyA (kcat, 58.5 ± 3.4 min−1) relative to actin (kcat, 10.1 ± 0.6 min−1), and vimentin was modified at a rate 9.48 ± 1.95-fold greater than actin. We employed tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify sites of ADP-ribosylation on vimentin. The primary sites of modification were Arg-44 and -49 in the head domain, with several additional secondary sites identified. Because the primary sites are located in a domain of vimentin known to be important for the regulation of polymerization by phosphorylation, we investigated the effects of SpyA activity on vimentin polymerization, utilizing an in vitro NaCl-induced filamentation assay. SpyA inhibited vimentin filamentation, whereas a catalytic site mutant of SpyA had no effect. Additionally, we demonstrated that expression of SpyA in HeLa cells resulted in collapse of the vimentin cytoskeleton, whereas expression in RAW 264.7 cells impeded vimentin reorganization upon stimulation of this macrophage-like cell line with LPS. We conclude that SpyA modification of vimentin occurs in an important regulatory region of the head domain and has significant functional effects on vimentin assembly.

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen responsible for a number of human diseases, the most common being mild skin infections and pharyngitis, though more serious infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, can occur (1Martin J.M. Green M. Group A streptococcus.Semin. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. 2006; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes produces numerous toxins, including superantigens, proteases, and potent cytolysins. Recently, we described a novel NAD+ glycohydrolase and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT), 2The abbreviations used are:ADPRTADP-ribosyltransferaseϵ-NAD+etheno-NAD+ϵ-AMPetheno-AMPECDelectron capture dissociationIFintermediate filament.

Although ADPRTs serve diverse functions, they all maintain a similar mechanism of action, the covalent transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety, donated from NAD+, onto a target protein, modifying target activity. Endogenous eukaryotic ADPRTs function as regulatory enzymes and can modify both intra- and extracellular proteins.

ADPRTs also represent a class of potent bacterial toxins. Among them are cholera, diphtheria, and pertussis toxins. The clostridial C2 and C3 toxin families represent a class of bacterial ADPRTs that target cytoskeletal proteins. The actin cytoskeleton is a well characterized target of the C2 toxins; ADP-ribosylated actin subunits are sterically unable to form filaments and furthermore act as capping proteins on existing filaments, leading to the eventual collapse of the actin cytoskeleton (13Margarit S.M.

Finally, the promiscuous bacterial effector protein ExoS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to ADP-ribosylate numerous targets, including the intermediate filament vimentin (25Coburn J.

Previously, we identified vimentin as a substrate for SpyA (2Coye L.H. Collins C.M. Identification of SpyA, a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase of Streptococcus pyogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vimentin is an intermediate filament (IF) protein found in cells of mesenchymal origin and forms filaments 10 nm in diameter. Like other IF proteins, vimentin is composed of a globular “head” domain at the N terminus followed by two coiled-coil regions and a globular “tail” domain. Although the role of vimentin is currently being fully elucidated, it is known to be important in cellular stability to mechanical stress, cell movement during wound healing, and leukocyte adhesion and migration (26Eckes B.

There is also evidence for an important role of vimentin in organelle positioning and membrane protein trafficking (30Styers M.L. Kowalczyk A.P. Faundez V. Intermediate filaments and vesicular membrane traffic. The odd couple's first dance?.Traffic. 2005; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Like other cytoskeletal proteins, vimentin appears to have a role in cell signal transduction, potentially as a scaffold for signaling molecules, and caspase-cleaved vimentin promotes apoptosis (31Pallari H.M.

The effects of SpyA on vimentin function have not been described; however, vimentin was recently identified as a target in a screen of endogenously ADP-ribosylated proteins (37Dani N. Stilla A.

Although the effect of ADP-ribosylation on actin by bacterial ADPRTs has been studied extensively, the effect of this modification on vimentin has not been previously elucidated. However, ADP-ribosylation of the related IF protein desmin by an endogenous muscle ADPRT has been reported and was found to cause impairment in IF formation (4Huang H.Y. Graves D.J. Robson R.M.

Although SpyA was shown to be a promiscuous ADPRT, modifying a number of proteins in a two-dimensional gel analysis, vimentin appeared to be a major target (2Coye L.H. Collins C.M. Identification of SpyA, a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase of Streptococcus pyogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We present enzyme kinetic data for SpyA modification of vimentin and actin, which supports the hypothesis that vimentin is an important target of SpyA. To understand the nature of the ADP-ribosylation of vimentin, we determined primary sites of modification using tandem mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the effect of SpyA-mediated ADP-ribosylation on the ability of vimentin to form filaments in vitro and the in vivo effects of SpyA on the vimentin cytoskeleton in HeLa cells and activated RAW 264.7 macrophages.

The PCR product was digested with NcoI and HindIII and ligated into NcoI/HindIII-digested pET21d (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was designated pET21Vim and transformed into competent E. coli Rosetta (DE3) using the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection of HeLa cells, transfection plasmids pCMV-myc-SpyA and pCMV-myc-SpyA-E187A were constructed by PCR-amplifying the spyA and spyA-E187A using pET15b-SpyA and pET15b-SpyAE187A template, respectively, and primers GAGAGAGAGAATTCTGGTCTGTGAGCACTATGAGCGGGC (forward primer) and GAGAGAGACTCGAGTTACAAACTGCCCTTGAAATACGCTTC (reverse primer). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-myc (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) also digested with EcoRI and XhoI and transformed into E. coli. A second SpyA expression plasmid utilizing the bicistronic expression plasmid pEF1α-IRES-DsRed-Express2 (Clontech) was created for use in the RAW 264.7 cells. The spyA and spyA-E187A inserts were created as described above, using forward primer GAGAGAGAGAATTCGCCACCATGGTCTGTGAGCACTATGAGCGG and reverse primer GAGAGAGAGGATCCTCACAAACTGCCCTTGAAATACGCTTCTATG. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, ligated into similarly digested pEF1α-IRES-DsRed-Express2, and transformed into E. coli. The resulting plasmids were pEF1α-IRES-DsRed-Express2-SpyA and pEF1α-IRES-DsRed-Express2-SpyAE187A. For expression and purification of SpyA and the catalytic site mutant SpyAE187A, the expression plasmids pET15bSpyA and pET15bSpyA-E187A were utilized as described (2Coye L.H. Collins C.M. Identification of SpyA, a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase of Streptococcus pyogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All enzymes were subsequently assayed for activity via a vimentin modification assay. 877 nm vimentin, 100 mm biotinylated NAD, 0.5 μm SpyA, 100 μm biotinylated NAD+ in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, was reacted for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Biotinylated samples were analyzed via Western blot against biotinylated ADP-ribose using streptavidin-HRP (1:10,000) (Pierce). To express human vimentin, E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta was transformed with pET21Vim and grown in LB with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) overnight with aeration at 37 °C. The transformed cells were subcultured and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Vimentin was expressed for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4,400 × g at 4 °C and then frozen at −20 °C. The pellets were defrosted and passed through a French press to lyse cells. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4,400 × g at 4 °C, and pelleted inclusion bodies were collected. The inclusion bodies were then washed twice in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The final pellet was dissolved overnight in 8 m urea in vimentin subunit buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.4). This and all subsequent steps were done at 4 °C with stirring. The urea was removed by stepwise dialysis, beginning with dialysis against 4 m urea in vimentin subunit buffer for 4 h. The vimentin solution was subsequently dialyzed against 2, 1, and 0.5 m and finally 0 m urea in vimentin subunit buffer, each for a minimum of 4 h. Unless otherwise stated, all constants were expressed as averaged values ± S.D. of three independent experiments, each done in triplicate. To determine the kinetic constants, the fluorescent NAD+ analog, ϵ-NAD+, was used as described (41Visschedyk D.D. Perieteanu A.A. Turgeon Z.J. Fieldhouse R.J. Dawson J.F. Merrill A.R. Photox, a novel actin-targeting mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase from Photorhabdus luminescens.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13525-13534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The ADP-ribosylation reaction was performed as follows: 8.77 μm human vimentin or actin was added to 0.085 μm SpyA in 100 mm HEPES buffer at 37 °C. Nine concentrations of ϵ-NAD+ were added for final concentrations of 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 1, or 0 μm. Control experiments were also performed in the absence of vimentin or actin to determine the rate of NAD+-glycohydrolysis. To create a standard calibration curve, concentrations of ϵ-AMP identical to those used for ϵ-NAD+ were also analyzed under the same conditions. Reactions were then run on an Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 300-nm excitation and 415-nm emission. Readings were taken for a minimum of 30 min. Prior to data analysis, the background glycohydrolase activity was subtracted from the ADP-ribosylation reactions. Fluorescence intensity was converted to micromolar of product formed using the ϵ-AMP calibration curve as previously described (42Armstrong S. Merrill A.R.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The linear range, 0–5 min, was determined, and the rates of the reactions were measured for each concentration of ϵ-NAD+. These rates were subsequently analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis by Prism software. The data were fit to a standard Michaelis-Menten model. Statistical significance was measured by an unpaired t test, and the two-tailed p value was reported as less than 0.0001 (GraphPad). Equimolar amounts of hamster vimentin and actin (877 nm) were added to 0.5 μm SpyA, 100 μm biotinylated NAD+ or [32P]NAD+ in 100 mm HEPES. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and 20-μl aliquots were taken at 0, 0.25, 5, 10, 30, and 90 min. Proteins were then resolved via SDS-PAGE, and biotinylated samples were assessed by Western blot as described under “Recombinant Protein Expression, Purification, and Activity.” Radiolabeled samples, in triplicate, were subjected to phosphorimaging using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using ImageJ software (44Abramoff M.D. Magalhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Image processing with ImageJ.Biophotonics International. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and mercuric chloride (HgCl2) were used to probe the chemical sensitivity of SpyA-modified vimentin. SpyA (0.5 μm) was reacted with 4.5 μm hamster vimentin and 100 μm biotinylated NAD+ in 100 mm HEPES for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min, and samples were incubated with either 0.5 m NaCl (control), 1 mm HgCl2, or 0.5 m NH2OH for 90 min at 30 °C. Samples were then resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed via Western blot as describe under “Competition Assay.” A time course, with time points at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min, was run to determine ADP-ribose incorporation into vimentin. 2.3 μm hamster vimentin was incubated at 37 °C with 0.3 μm SpyA and a 100 μm mixture of NAD+ and [32P]NAD+ in 100 mm HEPES. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer with β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed and dried, and vimentin bands were excised and subjected to scintillation counting. A calibration curve was created using serial dilutions of the NAD+/[32P]NAD+ mixture, and counts/min were converted to μm radiolabeled ADP-ribose incorporated/μm vimentin. An 877 nm concentration of either hamster or human vimentin was incubated with SpyA (1, 0.5, or 0.2 μm) and 100 μm NAD+ in 100 mm HEPES buffer for 5, 15, or 30 min. Following protein incubation with SpyA, urea was added to a final concentration of 6 m, and 1.5 μl of 1.5 m Tris, pH 8.8, was added to maintain a basic pH during reduction. Proteins were reduced for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Alkylation of cysteine residues was performed with 30 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, followed by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 30 mm and a 1-h incubation at room temperature. Samples were then diluted with 900 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or GluC (Roche Applied Science) was added at a protein/enzyme ratio of 1:50. Digestion proceeded overnight at room temperature. Samples were desalted using a Vydac silica C18 macrospin column (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA). ADP-ribosylated peptides were analyzed using the “marker ion” approach previously described by Hengel et al. (45Hengel S.M. Shaffer S.A. Nunn B.L. Goodlett D.R.

Briefly, peptides were analyzed using electrospray ionization in a linear ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer or linear ion trap Orbitrap (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA). HPLC columns were packed in house (0.75-μm inner diameter × 11 cm; 100 Å Magic C18AQ: Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA), and separations were performed with an inline Agilent 1100 binary HPLC pump or nanoAcquity (Waters, Milford, MA), using a linear gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile over 60 min. Electrospray ionization voltage was applied with a liquid junction prior to the analytical column using a gold wire and a micro-tee junction (47Yi E.C"
https://openalex.org/W2062074705,"Breast tumor kinase (Brk) was originally isolated from a human metastatic breast tumor, but also is found expressed in other epithelial tumors and in a subset of normal epithelia. Brk is a tyrosine kinase and its expression in breast carcinoma has been linked to tumor progression. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one of the substrate targets of Brk, and elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is known to contribute to oncogenesis. Conventional activation of STAT3 occurs in response to cytokine stimulation of Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK). One of the negative regulators discovered in cytokine signaling of the JAK-STAT pathway is the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). In this report we describe the finding that SOCS3 can also inhibit the unconventional target, Brk. Investigation of the mechanism by which SOCS3 inhibits Brk reveals the SOCS3 protein binds to Brk primarily via its SH2 domain, and its main inhibitory effect is mediated by the SOCS3 kinase inhibitory region (KIR). SOCS3 has only a modest effect on promoting Brk degradation, and this requires the C-terminal SOCS box domain. SOCS3 is the only known inhibitor of Brk, and knowledge of the mechanisms by which SOCS3 inhibits Brk may lead to methods that block Brk in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2134389474,"Sorting of membrane proteins into intracellular organelles is crucial for cell function. Viruses exploit intracellular transport and retention systems to concentrate envelope proteins at the site of virus budding. In pestiviruses, a group of important pathogens of pigs and ruminants closely related to human hepatitis C virus, the E(rns) protein translated from the viral RNA is secreted from the infected cells and found in the serum of infected animals. Secretion of the protein is regarded as crucial for its function as a viral virulence factor associated with its RNase activity. However, ∼95% of the E(rns) molecules are retained within the infected cell. Fusion of different E(rns) fragments to the C terminus of CD72 allowed identification of a retention signal within the C-terminal 65 aa of the viral protein. This C-terminal sequence represents its membrane anchor and folds into an amphipathic helix binding in-plane to the membrane surface. Residues L183, I190, and L208 are important for intracellular location of E(rns). Presentation of the retention signal on the cytoplasmic instead of the luminal face of the ER membrane in CD8α fusion proteins still led to retention. Thus, E(rns) contains in its C-terminal amphipathic helix an intracellular retention signal that is active on both faces of the membrane."

To investigate the protective function of CDC48 against accumulated ubiquitinated proteins during neurodevelopment, we developed an in vivo bioassay technique that detects expression and accumulation of fluorescent proteins with a polyubiquitination signal at the N terminus. When we introduced CDC48 antisense morpholino oligonucleotides into zebrafish embryos, the morphant embryos were lethal and showed defects in neuronal outgrowth and neurodegeneration, and polyubiquitinated fluorescent proteins accumulated in the inner plexiform and ganglion cell layers, as well as the diencephalon and mesencephalon, indicating that the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system was blocked. These abnormal phenotypes in the morphant were rescued by CDC48 or human valosin-containing protein overexpression. Therefore, the protective function of CDC48 is essential for neurodevelopment."

At the same time, enhanced activation of phospho-Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8), which is a downstream mediator of canonical Bmp signaling, was observed in Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J embryonic calvaria. Therefore, we generated Gli3;Runx2 compound mutant mice to study the effects of decreasing Runx2 dosage in a Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J background.

https://openalex.org/W2022474043,"The Gli transcription factors are key downstream mediators of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. How the activities of Gli transcription factors are regulated by upstream Hh signaling events and protein modifications are not fully understood.

The level of GLI2 sumoylation is reduced by either mutations in six serine residues that are normally phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) or stimulation by HH. This suggests that PKA phosphorylation enhances GLI2 sumoylation, whereas HH signaling inhibits it. In addition, mutation of these two lysines into arginine residues significantly increases GLI2 transcriptional activity in a cell-based reporter assay. The same mutations in the GLI2 locus also result in an increase in GLI2 activity in the mouse. Interestingly, GLI2 can interact with HDAC5 (histone deacetylase 5), but the GLI2 mutant cannot.

It is there that tumor cells encounter cellular and non-cellular constituent elements that make up the lymph node parenchyma. Our work shows that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines are able to bind to laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and hyaluronic acid, which are extracellular matrix elements within the lymph node parenchyma. HNSCC cell lines bound to laminin under lymphodynamic low shear stress (0.07 dynes/cm(2)), consistent with lymph flow via β1 integrins, including α2β1, α3β1, and α6β1. Binding occurred in the presence of shear stress and not in the absence of flow. Additionally, tumor cell binding to laminin under flow did result in calcium signaling. Our data indicate a novel role for β1 integrin-mediated binding of HNSCC cells to laminin under conditions of lymphodynamic flow that results in intracellular calcium signaling within the cancer cell."
https://openalex.org/W2034912626,"O-Linked glycosylation is a functionally and structurally diverse type of protein modification present in many tissues and across many species. α-Dystroglycan (α-DG), a protein linked to the extracellular matrix, whose glycosylation status is associated with human muscular dystrophies, displays two predominant types of O-glycosylation, O-linked mannose (O-Man) and O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc), in its highly conserved mucin-like domain. The O-Man is installed by an enzyme complex present in the endoplasmic reticulum. O-GalNAc modifications are initiated subsequently in the Golgi apparatus by the UDP-GalNAc polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAc-T) enzymes. How the presence and position of O-Man influences the action of the ppGalNAc-Ts on α-DG and the distribution of the two forms of glycosylation in this domain is not known. Here, we investigated the interplay between O-Man and the addition of O-GalNAc by examining the activity of the ppGalNAc-Ts on peptides and O-Man-containing glycopeptides mimicking those found in native α-DG. These synthetic glycopeptides emulate intermediate structures, not otherwise readily available from natural sources. Through enzymatic and mass spectrometric methods, we demonstrate that the presence and specific location of O-Man can impact either the regional exclusion or the site of O-GalNAc addition on α-DG, elucidating the factors contributing to the glycosylation patterns observed in vivo. These results provide evidence that one form of glycosylation can influence another form of glycosylation in α-DG and suggest that in the absence of proper O-mannosylation, as is associated with certain forms of muscular dystrophy, aberrant O-GalNAc modifications may occur and could play a role in disease presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2084234591,"We examined the regulatory importance of interactions between regulatory light chain (RLC), essential light chain (ELC), and adjacent heavy chain (HC) in the regulatory domain of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin. After mutating the HC, RLC, and/or ELC to disrupt their predicted interactions (using scallop myosin coordinates), we measured basal ATPase, V(max), and K(ATPase) of actin-activated ATPase, actin-sliding velocities, rigor binding to actin, and kinetics of ATP binding and ADP release. If unphosphorylated, all mutants were similar to wild type showing turned-off behaviors. In contrast, if phosphorylated, mutation of RLC residues smM129Q and smG130C in the F-G helix linker, which interact with the ELC (Ca(2+) binding in scallop), was sufficient to abolish motility and diminish ATPase activity, without altering other parameters. ELC mutations within this interacting ELC loop (smR20M and smK25A) were normal, but smM129Q/G130C-R20M or -K25A showed a partially recovered phenotype suggesting that interaction between the RLC and ELC is important. A molecular dynamics study suggested that breaking the RLC/ELC interface leads to increased flexibility at the interface and ELC-binding site of the HC. We hypothesize that this leads to hampered activation by allowing a pre-existing equilibrium between activated and inhibited structural distributions (Vileno, B., Chamoun, J., Liang, H., Brewer, P., Haldeman, B.

We propose that an important structural function of RLC phosphorylation is to promote or assist in the maintenance of an intact RLC/ELC interface. If the RLC/ELC interface is broken, the off-state structures are no longer destabilized by phosphorylation."

The 364-amino acid N-terminal part (mini-TyrRS) is the catalytic aminoacylation domain and is active without the C-terminal domain (CTD) (10Wakasugi K. Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P.

At the evolutionary stage of insects, an ELR tripeptide was incorporated into the mini-TyrRS domain and has been retained in higher organisms. The ELR motif is the recognition element within CXC chemokines such as interleukin-8, which mediates the innate immune response as well as angiogenesis (12Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M.

Simultaneously, the CTD, which is a structural and functional homolog of human endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II), was appended to TyrRS. Previous work established that mini-TyrRS and the CTD have distinct cytokine activities associated with hematological and inflammatory pathways, whereas full-length TyrRS is inactive as a cytokine (14Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Two distinct cytokines released from a human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Wakasugi K. Schimmel P.

The crystal structures of mini-TyrRS and the CTD have separately been determined (16Yang X.L. Skene R.J. McRee D.E. Schimmel P. Crystal structure of a human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase cytokine.Proc.

Crystal structure of an EMAP-II-like cytokine released from a human tRNA synthetase.Helv. Chim. Acta. 2003; 86: 1246-1257Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the mini-TyrRS domain, the ELR motif is masked by the terminal α-helix 14, which is tethered by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of the Tyr-341 side chain and the main chain carbonyl of Gly-46 (Fig. 1B). Ablation of this hydrogen bond by a Y341A substitution confers IL-8-like cytokine activity on the full-length TyrRS without proteolysis at the interdomain linker (18Yang X.L. Kapoor M. Otero F.J. Slike B.M. Tsuruta H. Frausto R. Bates A. Ewalt K.L. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine.Chem.

These results stimulated our interest in understanding the structural relationships of TyrRS, Y341A TyrRS, and mini-TyrRS in the light of the cytokine activity. Our goal was to figure out whether the mini-TyrRS cytokine activity could be explained by specific unmasking of the critical ELR motif or whether more dramatic changes occur that result in additional surfaces being perturbed and provide an important context for ELR signaling. In previous work, we used mutational analysis to establish that the cytokine activity was dependent on the ELR motif (11Kapoor M. Otero F.J. Slike B.M. Ewalt K.L. Yang X.L.

Yang X.L. Schimmel P. Dissociating quaternary structure regulates cell-signaling functions of a secreted human tRNA synthetase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11563-11568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further, we used a low resolution protease mapping procedure to show that the ELR-dependent activity was associated with a specific conformational change (18Yang X.L. Kapoor M. Otero F.J. Slike B.M. Tsuruta H. Frausto R. Bates A. Ewalt K.L. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1323-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we could not definitively prove (with the methods used) that this conformational change affected the exposure of ELR. To address this question, we took advantage of Y341A TyrRS and surmised that, at the least, the disposition of the ELR motif must be altered by the Y341A mutation. As it turned out, TyrRS and Y341A TyrRS were both recalcitrant to extensive efforts to obtain crystals, possibly because of the flexibility of the long interdomain linker. In addition, because both proteins are too large for straightforward assignment of peak assignments and NOE signals by NMR, we turned instead to methods that could survey the entire protein and give specific information about the disposition of the ELR motif. For this purpose, we used quantitative hydrogen/deuterium exchange of amide protons by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) (22Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Determination of amide hydrogen exchange by mass spectrometry: a new tool for protein structure elucidation.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) solution methods for our structural analysis. All variants of TyrRS were cloned in the pET-20b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction cut sites. Full-length TyrRS is composed of residues 1–528 and mini-TyrRS spans residues 1–364. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (0.2 mm) at room temperature for 16 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and cells were lysed through an M-110L pneumatic Microfluidizer (Microfluidics). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and anion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). Samples were buffer-exchanged into 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and concentrated. Aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. HDX FT-ICR methods have been described previously (23Zhang H.M. Kazazic S. Schaub T.M. Tipton J.D. Emmett M.R. Marshall A.G. Enhanced digestion efficiency, peptide ionization efficiency, and sequence resolution for protein hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.Anal.

Mass Spectrom. 2009; 20: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of sample (30 μm) was mixed with 45 μl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl in D2O to initiate each HDX reaction. HDX incubation periods were 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min followed by simultaneous quench and proteolysis (25Zhang H.M. McLoughlin S.M. Frausto S.D. Tang H. Emmett M.R. Marshall A.G. Simultaneous reduction and digestion of proteins with disulfide bonds for hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 1450-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched by 1:1 (v/v) addition of protease type XIII solution in 1% formic acid to reduce the pH to ∼2.3 and to initiate the 2 min of proteolysis. The digested peptide fragments were separated by a fast LC gradient through a ProZAP C18 column (Grace Davison, 1.5 μm, 500 Å, 2.1 × 10 mm) to minimize back exchange. A post-column splitter reduced the LC eluent flow rate to ∼400–500 nl/min for efficient microelectrospray ionization. Microelectrosprayed HDX samples were directed to a custom-built hybrid linear trap quadrupole 14.5-tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) (26Schaub T.M. Hendrickson C.L. Horning S. Quinn J.P. Senko M.W. Marshall A.G. High performance mass spectrometry: Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance at 14.5 teslas.Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The total data acquisition period for each sample was 6 min. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed by an in-house analysis package (27Kazazic S. Zhang H.M. Schaub T.M. Emmett M.R. Hendrickson C.L. Blakney G.T. Marshall A.G. Automated data reduction for hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments, enabled by high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2010; 21: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Time-course deuterium incorporation levels were generated by a maximum entropy method fitting method (28Zhang Z. Li W. Logan T.M. Li M. Marshall A.G. Human recombinant [C22A] FK506-binding protein amide hydrogen exchange rates from mass spectrometry match and extend those from NMR.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2203-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Just prior to SAXS experiments, protein samples were purified by gel filtration to remove aggregates in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3% (v/v) glycerol. SAXS data were collected at beamline 4-2 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). Measurements on protein samples at 2, 3, 5, and 10 mg/ml at 10 °C were collected on a MarCCD 165 detector. No systematic differences were detected across concentrations, indicating the absence of interparticle interference. Data were processed by SasTool (MarParse) and PRIMUS (29Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were estimated from the Guinier approximation under that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg); the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0)exp(−(sRg)2/3). Maximum particle dimensions Dmax were computed by use of the indirect transform package GNOM, which also gives the distance distribution function P(r). Ab initio free atom modeling was performed with GASBOR (30Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Determination of domain structure of proteins from x-ray solution scattering.Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). 35 independent simulations were carried out for TyrRS and Y341A TyrRS using 2-fold symmetry. Superposition, averaging, and filtering with DAMAVER (31Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) generated the final reconstructions, and envelopes were constructed using the Situs software (32Wriggers W. Chacón P. Using Situs for the registration of protein structures with low resolution bead models from X-ray solution scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We scanned the solvent-accessible regions of TyrRS and Y341A TyrRS by HDX-MS. Interestingly, both full-length proteins showed no differences in deuterium uptake in nearly all regions (Fig. 2A). In particular, the HDX-MS profiles of the 172-amino acid CTD of Y341A TyrRS were similar to that of TyrRS within −10% to +10% difference. Most of the HDX-MS profiles of the mini-TyrRS portions were similar, although the additional changes that did occur suggest a mild relaxation, or loosening, of Y341A TyrRS. Although inclusion of CTD was shown to stabilize the dimer interaction of TyrRS that is mediated through the mini-TyrRS portion of the protein (18Yang X.L. Kapoor M. Otero F.J. Slike B.M. Tsuruta H. Frausto R. Bates A. Ewalt K.L. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1323-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the interaction between mini-TyrRS and the CTD is observed neither computationally (33Yesylevskyy S.O. Savytskyi O.V. Odynets K.A. Kornelyuk A.I. Interdomain compactization in human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase studied by the hierarchical rotations technique.Biophys. Chem. 2011; 154: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) nor by a direct test in solution; e.g. the two domains do not associate and assemble into a stable complex in solution and presumably roll around freely when tethered by the interdomain linker (supplemental Fig. S1), further explaining the equivalent CTD HDX-MS profiles. In contrast, a hexapeptide spanning the ELR motif at positions 90–95 in the sequence showed 64% increased HDX, consistent with a specific unmasking of ELR (Fig. 2B). Mapping the increased deuterium uptake differences onto the structure of the mini-TyrRS showed that the main relaxation of the structure is localized to regions immediately surrounding the ELR motif (Fig. 2C). In addition, we investigated the HDX-MS profiles for mini-TyrRS and compared them with the equivalent portion of native TyrRS. This experiment was meant to test from a structural perspective whether the ELR-associated activity of mini-TyrRS mimicked the changes of Y341A TyrRS. This is of particular interest because of the dramatically different ways in which cytokine activity is activated: by removal of an entire CTD in the case of mini-TyrRS or solely by a single point mutation as in Y341A TyrRS. Remarkably, the HDX profile of mini-TyrRS closely matched that of Y341A TyrRS, with the hexapeptide encompassing the ELR motif showing the greatest exchange (Fig. 2A). Thus, the functional equivalence of Y341A TyrRS and mini-TyrRS appears to be entirely due to the similar way in which they each achieve, by different mechanisms, a pinpointed exposure of the ELR motif. We reinvestigated the shapes of TyrRS and Y341A TyrRS in solution by calculating molecular envelopes using SAXS profiles. Previous work had only described the pairwise distribution function, but no shapes were calculated (18Yang X.L. Kapoor M. Otero F.J. Slike B.M. Tsuruta H. Frausto R. Bates A. Ewalt K.L. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1323-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) because the data were influenced by aggregation and therefore not ideal. At first glance, the experimental scattering curves as well as the pairwise distribution functions of each protein look identical (supplemental Fig. S2). A total of 35 individual reconstructions were calculated and merged to generate envelopes of TyrRS and Y341A TyrRS. Both molecules are organized with mini-TyrRS in the center and two CTDs protruding from opposite sides to form puckered S-shaped molecules (Fig. 3A). However, a subtle difference was observed between TyrRS and Y341A TyrRS at the interdomain linker region, where the CTDs point in opposite directions and thereby alter the respective pucker of each molecule. Strikingly, the ELR area is masked by the CTD in TyrRS, but is exposed in Y341A TyrRS (Fig. 3B). Although the handedness of SAXS envelopes cannot be resolved (34Putnam C.D. Hammel M. Hura G.L. Tainer J.A. X-ray solution scattering (SAXS) combined with crystallography and computation: defining accurate macromolecular structures, conformations, and assemblies in solution.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2007; 40: 191-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), the translocation of the CTDs in these models corroborates well with the localized HDX-MS uptake values at the ELR motif. Although mini-TyrRS contains the Tyr-341 gatekeeper residue, it possesses ELR-dependent cytokine activity (11Kapoor M. Otero F.J. Slike B.M. Ewalt K.L. Yang X.L. Mutational separation of aminoacylation and cytokine activities of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase.Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An explanation is that the temperature factors of the helices that contain the ELR motif and Tyr-341 residue are relatively high in the solved mini-TyrRS crystal structure (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, these regions are disposed to greater conformational flexibility by which the ELR motif is revealed as observed by HDX-MS (Fig. 2D). Despite having high temperature factors in these helices, because TyrRS is inactive as a cytokine, it is likely that the interdomain linker and the CTD occlude the ELR motif, as observed by the SAXS envelopes. Our results demonstrate a remarkable specificity and convergence to the location of the structural change caused by the designed Y341A mutation and by the natural proteolytic product of TyrRS; using solution techniques, we demonstrated that the structural effect on the disposition of the ELR motif of Y341A TyrRS closely mimics that caused by removal of the CTD from TyrRS. Interestingly, mini-TyrRS is active in aminoacylation and can even sustain cell growth as the sole source of an aminoacylation activity for tyrosine (10Wakasugi K. Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P. Genetic code in evolution: switching species-specific aminoacylation with a peptide transplant.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent work showed that the ELR-associated activity of mini-TyrRS is also dependent on its dimeric structure (21Vo M.N. Yang X.L. Schimmel P. Dissociating quaternary structure regulates cell-signaling functions of a secreted human tRNA synthetase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11563-11568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During the long evolutionary history of this protein, neither the introduction of the ELR motif nor the CTD adversely affected the viability of aminoacylation. However, the two apparently coincident events, introduction of the ELR and the CTD, appear to have been designed so that the CTD would regulate the new activity brought in by the ELR in the N-terminal part of the protein. This change in TyrRS was done in a way that did not disturb its capacity for aminoacylation, and that constraint may have necessitated that the architecture of the protein be especially amenable to accommodating a pinpointed exposure of ELR.
