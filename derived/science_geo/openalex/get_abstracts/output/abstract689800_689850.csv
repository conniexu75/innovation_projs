https://openalex.org/W4220827000,"Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies on unrelated individuals have shown that, for human traits and diseases, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs. However, it is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular whether the causal variants are rare, or whether it is overestimated due to bias in inference from pedigree data. Here we estimated heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) from whole-genome sequence data on 25,465 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. The estimated heritability was 0.68 (standard error 0.10) for height and 0.30 (standard error 0.10) for body mass index. Low minor allele frequency variants in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with neighboring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein-altering variants, consistent with negative selection. Our results imply that rare variants, in particular those in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, are a major source of the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220830275,"Long Covid is a public health concern that needs defining, quantifying, and describing. We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life.We collected self-reported data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling. The survey enrolled adults who reported lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 who were not hospitalised in the first two weeks of illness. This analysis was restricted to those with self-reported Long Covid. Univariate comparisons between those with and without confirmed COVID-19 infection were carried out and agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic and functional correlates.We analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.6 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.1-7.9). 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress, and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties. Acute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n = 2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n = 305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n = 2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n = 283, 11.2%) exhibiting more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup.This is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst this is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study prevalence, predictors and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population sample using standardised case definitions."
https://openalex.org/W4221013526,"In this work, we find that CD8+ T cells expressing inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the human equivalent of Ly49+CD8+ regulatory T cells in mice and are increased in the blood and inflamed tissues of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. Moreover, these CD8+ T cells efficiently eliminated pathogenic gliadin-specific CD4+ T cells from the leukocytes of celiac disease patients in vitro. We also find elevated levels of KIR+CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ regulatory T cells, in COVID-19 patients, correlating with disease severity and vasculitis. Selective ablation of Ly49+CD8+ T cells in virus-infected mice led to autoimmunity after infection. Our results indicate that in both species, these regulatory CD8+ T cells act specifically to suppress pathogenic T cells in autoimmune and infectious diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4220958064,"Single-nuclei RNA sequencing characterizes cell types at the gene level. However, compared to single-cell approaches, many single-nuclei cDNAs are purely intronic, lack barcodes and hinder the study of isoforms. Here we present single-nuclei isoform RNA sequencing (SnISOr-Seq). Using microfluidics, PCR-based artifact removal, target enrichment and long-read sequencing, SnISOr-Seq increased barcoded, exon-spanning long reads 7.5-fold compared to naive long-read single-nuclei sequencing. We applied SnISOr-Seq to adult human frontal cortex and found that exons associated with autism exhibit coordinated and highly cell-type-specific inclusion. We found two distinct combination patterns: those distinguishing neural cell types, enriched in TSS-exon, exon-polyadenylation-site and non-adjacent exon pairs, and those with multiple configurations within one cell type, enriched in adjacent exon pairs. Finally, we observed that human-specific exons are almost as tightly coordinated as conserved exons, implying that coordination can be rapidly established during evolution. SnISOr-Seq enables cell-type-specific long-read isoform analysis in human brain and in any frozen or hard-to-dissociate sample."

https://openalex.org/W4220698312,"Totipotency emerges in early embryogenesis, but its molecular underpinnings remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we employed DNA fiber analysis to investigate how pluripotent stem cells are reprogrammed into totipotent-like 2-cell-like cells (2CLCs). We show that totipotent cells of the early mouse embryo have slow DNA replication fork speed and that 2CLCs recapitulate this feature, suggesting that fork speed underlies the transition to a totipotent-like state. 2CLCs emerge concomitant with DNA replication and display changes in replication timing (RT), particularly during the early S-phase. RT changes occur prior to 2CLC emergence, suggesting that RT may predispose to gene expression changes and consequent reprogramming of cell fate. Slowing down replication fork speed experimentally induces 2CLCs. In vivo, slowing fork speed improves the reprogramming efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Our data suggest that fork speed regulates cellular plasticity and that remodeling of replication features leads to changes in cell fate and reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W4221101080,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered an enormous number of discussion topics on social media Twitter. It has an impact on the global health system and citizen responses to the pandemic. Multiple responses (replies, favorites, and retweets) reflect the followers' attitudes and emotions towards these tweets. Twitter data such as these have inspired substantial research interest in sentiment and social trend analyses. To date, studies on Twitter data have focused on the associational relationships between variables in a population. There is a need for further discovery of causality, such as the influence of sentiment polarity of tweet response on further discussion topics. These topics often reflect the human perception of COVID-19. This study addresses this exact topic. It aims to develop a new method to unveil the causal relationships between the sentiment polarity and responses in social media data. We employed sentiment polarity, i.e., positive or negative sentiment, as the treatment variable in this quasi-experimental study. The data is the tweets posted by nine authoritative public organizations in four countries and the World Health Organization from December 1, 2019, to May 10, 2020. Employing the inverse probability weighting model, we identified the treatment effect of sentiment polarity on the multiple responses of tweets. The topics with negative sentiment polarity on COVID-19 attracted significantly more replies (69±49) and favorites (688±677) than the positive tweets. However, no significant difference in the number of retweets was found between the negative and positive tweets. This study contributes a new method for social media analysis. It generates new insight into the influence of sentiment polarity of tweets about COVID-19 on tweet responses."
https://openalex.org/W4220703760,"The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) created an unprecedented environmental exposure to aerosolized dust, gases and potential carcinogens. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is defined as the acquisition of somatic mutations in blood cells and is associated with smoking and exposure to genotoxic stimuli. Here we show that deep targeted sequencing of blood samples identified a significantly higher proportion of WTC-exposed first responders with CH (10%; 48 out of 481) when compared with non-WTC-exposed firefighters (6.7%; 17 out of 255; odds ratio, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.64-6.03; P = 0.0006) after controlling for age, sex and race/ethnicity. The frequency of somatic mutations in WTC-exposed first responders showed an age-related increase and predominantly affected DNMT3A, TET2 and other CH-associated genes. Exposure of lymphoblastoid cells to WTC particulate matter led to dysregulation of DNA replication at common fragile sites in vitro. Moreover, mice treated with WTC particulate matter developed an increased burden of mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartments. In summary, the high burden of CH in WTC-exposed first responders provides a rationale for enhanced screening and preventative efforts in this population."

https://openalex.org/W4220694835,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Saudi Arabia has been rising. Although the health burden of excess weight is well established, little is known about the economic burden.To assess the economic burden-both direct medical costs and the value of absenteeism and presenteeism-resulting from overweight and obesity in Saudi Arabia.The cost of overweight and obesity in Saudi Arabia was estimated from a societal perspective using an epidemiologic approach.Data were obtained from previously published studies and secondary databases.Overweight/obesity-attributable costs were calculated for six major noncommunicable diseases; sensitivity analyses were conducted for key model parameters.The impact of overweight and obesity for these diseases is found to directly cost a total of $3.8 billion, equal to 4.3 percent of total health expenditures in Saudi Arabia in 2019. Estimated overweight and obesity-attributable absenteeism and presenteeism costs a total of $15.5 billion, equal to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2019.Even when limited to six diseases and a subset of total indirect costs, results indicate that overweight and obesity are a significant economic burden in Saudi Arabia. Future studies should identify strategies to reduce the health and economic burden resulting from excess weight in Saudi Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W4220913003,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 has resulted in the death of nearly 4 million people within the last 18 months. While preventive vaccination, and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization with a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV-2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcαR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (FcγRIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, not only supports the therapeutic use of currently available antibody-based treatment, including the continuation of CCP transfusion strategies, but also the use of various vaccine platforms in a prophylactic approach."
https://openalex.org/W4220860443,"Monocarboxylate transporter 7 (MCT7) is an orphan transporter expressed in the liver, brain, and in several types of cancer cells. It has also been reported to be a survival factor in melanoma and breast cancers. However, this survival mechanism is not yet fully understood due to MCT7's unidentified substrate(s). Therefore, here we sought to identify MCT7 substrate(s) and characterize the transport mechanisms by analyzing amino acid transport in HEK293T cells and polarized Caco-2 cells. Analysis of amino acids revealed significant rapid reduction in taurine from cells transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged MCT7. We found that taurine uptake and efflux by MCT7 was pH-independent and that the uptake was not saturated in the presence of taurine excess of 200 mM. Furthermore, we found that monocarboxylates and acidic amino acids inhibited MCT7-mediated taurine uptake. These results imply that MCT7 may be a low-affinity facilitative taurine transporter. We also found that MCT7 was localized at the basolateral membrane in polarized Caco-2 cells and that the induction of MCT7 expression in polarized Caco-2 cells enhanced taurine permeation. Finally, we demonstrated that interactions of MCT7 with ancillary proteins basigin/CD147 and embigin/GP70 enhanced MCT7-mediated taurine transport. In summary, these findings reveal that taurine is a novel substrate of MCT7 and that MCT7-mediated taurine transport might contribute to the efflux of taurine from cells."

https://openalex.org/W4220802359,"The aggressive nature and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer (PC) results in poor prognosis and high mortality. A better understanding of the underlying biology of PC and the ability of tumor cells to spread to distant sites is needed to advance the treatment of PC. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been heavily implicated in the spread and mobility of many solid cancers based on its role in cancer cell chemotaxis as well as increased metastatic potential. To better elucidate CXCR4's role in the metastatic spread of PC, we examined its expression on various tumor associated cells (TACs) in the peripheral blood of PC patients, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), epithelial to mesenchymal transition cells (EMTs), and cancer associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs). In this pilot study, blood samples were procured from 30 PC patients prior to the start of therapeutic intent. CXCR4 expression was analyzed on TACs captured from the blood samples and evaluated in relation to cell migration as well as patient clinical outcomes. In total, CTCs, EMTs, and CAMLs were found in 27%, 60%, and 97% of PC patients, respectively. High CXCR4 expression in CTCs, CAMLs, and EMTs was found to significantly relate to their increased numbers in circulation. Further, higher expression of CXCR4 in CAMLs and EMTs was significantly related to faster progression and worse survival. These data suggest that CXCR4 expression in PC is strongly related to the intravasation and presence of TACs into circulation, as well as being a possible biomarker for aggressive metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W4214836719,"Almost all proteins that reside in the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria contain a membrane-spanning segment that folds into a unique β barrel structure and inserts into the membrane by an unknown mechanism. To obtain further insight into outer membrane protein (OMP) biogenesis, we revisited the surprising observation reported over 20 years ago that the Escherichia coli OmpA β barrel can be assembled into a native structure in vivo when it is expressed as two noncovalently linked fragments. Here, we show that disulfide bonds between β strand 4 in the N-terminal fragment and β strand 5 in the C-terminal fragment can form in the periplasmic space and greatly increase the efficiency of assembly of ""split"" OmpA, but only if the cysteine residues are engineered in perfect register (i.e., they are aligned in the fully folded β barrel). In contrast, we observed only weak disulfide bonding between β strand 1 in the N-terminal fragment and β strand 8 in the C-terminal fragment that would form a closed or circularly permutated β barrel. Our results not only demonstrate that β barrels begin to fold into a β-sheet-like structure before they are integrated into the OM but also help to discriminate among the different models of OMP biogenesis that have been proposed."
https://openalex.org/W4220749605,"Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal enzyme in the electron transfer chain in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It contains four metal redox centers, two of which, CuB and heme a3, form the binuclear center (BNC), where dioxygen is reduced to water. Crystal structures of CcO in various forms have been reported, from which ligand-binding states of the BNC and conformations of the protein matrix surrounding it have been deduced to elucidate the mechanism by which the oxygen reduction chemistry is coupled to proton translocation. However, metal centers in proteins can be susceptible to X-ray-induced radiation damage, raising questions about the reliability of conclusions drawn from these studies. Here, we used microspectroscopy-coupled X-ray crystallography to interrogate how the structural integrity of bovine CcO in the fully oxidized state (O) is modulated by synchrotron radiation. Spectroscopic data showed that, upon X-ray exposure, O was converted to a hybrid O∗ state where all the four metal centers were reduced, but the protein matrix was trapped in the genuine O conformation and the ligands in the BNC remained intact. Annealing the O∗ crystal above the glass transition temperature induced relaxation of the O∗ structure to a new R∗ structure, wherein the protein matrix converted to the fully reduced R conformation with the exception of helix X, which partly remained in the O conformation because of incomplete dissociation of the ligands from the BNC. We conclude from these data that reevaluation of reported CcO structures obtained with synchrotron light sources is merited."
https://openalex.org/W4220814724,"The observation and assessment of animal biodiversity using acoustic technology has developed considerably in recent years. Current eco-acoustic research focuses on automatic audio recorder arrays and acoustic indices, which may be used to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of local animal communities in high resolution. While such soundscapes have often been studied above ground, their applicability in soils has rarely been tested. For the first time, we applied acoustic and statistical methods to explore the spatial, diurnal, and seasonal dynamics of the soundscape in soils. We studied the dynamics of acoustic complexity in forest soils in the alpine Pfynwald forest in the Swiss canton of Valais and related them to meteorological and microclimatic data. To increase microclimatic variability, we used a long-term irrigation experiment. We also took soil samples close to the sensors on 6 days in different seasons. Daily and seasonal patterns of acoustic complexity were predicted to be associated with abiotic parameters—that is, meteorological and microclimatic conditions—and mediated by the dynamics of the diversity and activity of the soil fauna. Seasonal patterns in acoustic complexity showed the highest acoustic complexity values in spring and summer, decreasing in fall and winter. Diurnal acoustic complexity values were highest in the afternoon and lowest during the night. The measurement of acoustic diversity at the sampling site was significantly associated with soil communities, with relationships between taxa richness or community composition and acoustic complexity being strongest shortly before taking the soil samples. Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial dynamics of the diversity and community composition of soil organisms can be predicted by the acoustic complexity of soil soundscapes. This opens up the possibility of using soil soundscape analysis as a noninvasive and easy-to-use method for soil biodiversity monitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W4221024865,"Object Although many patients report clinical improvement after surgery due to degenerative cervical myelopathy, the aim of intervention is to stop progression of spinal cord dysfunction. We wanted to provide estimates and assess achievement rates of Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) at 3- and 12-month follow-up for Neck Disability Index (NDI), Numeric Rating Scale for arm pain (NRS-AP) and neck pain (NRS-NP), Euro-Qol (EQ-5D-3L), and European Myelopathy Score (EMS). Methods 614 degenerative cervical myelopathy patients undergoing surgery responded to Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) prior to, 3 and 12 months after surgery. External criterion was the Global Perceived Effect Scale (1–7), defining MCID as “slightly better”, “much better” and “completely recovered”. MCID estimates with highest sensitivity and specificity were calculated by Receiver Operating Curves for change and percentage change scores in the whole sample and in anterior and posterior procedural groups. Results The NDI and NRS-NP percentage change scores were the most accurate PROMs with a MCID of 16%. The change score for NDI and percentage change scores for NDI, NRS-AP and NRS-NP were slightly higher in the anterior procedure group compared to the posterior procedure group, while remaining PROM estimates were similar across procedure type. The MCID achievement rates at 12-month follow-up ranged from 51% in EMS to 62% in NRS-NP. Conclusion The NDI and NRS-NP percentage change scores were the most accurate PROMs to measure clinical improvement after surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy. We recommend using different cut-off estimates for anterior and posterior approach procedures. A MCID achievement rate of 60% or less must be interpreted in the perspective that the main goal of surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy is to prevent worsening of the condition."
https://openalex.org/W4221059685,"Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is widely studied in inflammatory models. Its effects on malignant progression have been documented mainly from the perspective of the microenvironment. However, its role in leukemia has not been established. Here we used MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse models with IRF7 knockout or overexpression and xenograft mouse models to explore the intrinsic effects of IRF7 in AML. AML-IRF7-/- mice exhibited accelerated disease progression with intracerebral invasion of AML cells. AML-IRF7-/- cells showed increased proliferation and elevated leukemia stem cell (LSC) levels. Overexpression of IRF7 in AML cells decreased cell proliferation and LSC levels. Furthermore, overexpression of transforming growth-interacting factor 1 (TGIF1) rescued the enhanced proliferation and high LSC levels caused by IRF7 deficiency. Moreover, upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), which correlated with high LSC levels, was detected in AML-IRF7-/- cells. In addition, blocking VCAM1-very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) axis delayed disease progression and attenuated intracerebral invasion of AML cells. Therefore, our findings uncover the intrinsic effects of IRF7 in AML and provide a potential strategy to control central nervous system myeloid leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W4220677722,"This study applied the extended parallel process model (EPPM) to investigate the factors affecting people’s preventive behaviors against COVID-19, and thereby, draw relevant policy implications for current and future other epidemics. The EPPM was used to examine the danger control and fear control responses, along with the separate effects of their sub-factors (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy) on personal hygiene behaviors, social distancing measures, and fatalism. In total, data from an online survey of 813 adults were analyzed. The results of multiple regression analysis showed a strong effect of self-efficacy on danger control ( ß = 0.23 for personal hygiene behaviors, β = 0.26 for social distancing) and fear control responses ( ß = -0.13 for fatalism). However, based on the type of control response, the effect of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity, which were the main factors in threat appraisal, was insignificant or marginally significant. Further, a higher perceived severity was associated with higher fatalism in the fear control response ( ß = 0.09). Those who were currently employed performed fewer social distancing measures compared to those who did not ( ß = -0.11), whereas there was no difference in personal hygiene behaviors. These results suggest that risk communication in emerging infectious disease crises should provide customized information on people who are hard to comply with social distancing. Besides delivering the message of self-efficacy, policies should be implemented to create a social environment in which individuals can practice social distancing without constraints."
https://openalex.org/W4220846523,"Increasing numbers of cancer stem cell markers have been recently identified. It is not known, however, whether a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ), can function to regulate cancer stem cell (CSC) activity. Using anaplastic thyroid cancer cells (ATC) as a model, we highlight the role of TRβ in CSC activity. ATC is one of the most aggressive solid cancers in humans and is resistant to currently available therapeutics. Recent studies provide evidence that CSC activity underlies aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance of ATC. Here we show that TRβ inhibits CSC activity by suppressing tumor-sphere formation of human ATC cells and their tumor-initiating capacity. TRβ suppresses the expression of CSC regulators, including ALDH, KLF2, SOX2, b-catenin, and ABCG2, in ATC cell-induced xenograft tumors. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis shows that TRβ reduces CSC population in ATC-induced xenograft tumors. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database demonstrates that the inhibition of CSC capacity by TRβ contributes to favorable clinical outcomes in human cancer. Our studies show that TRβ is a newly identified transcription regulator that acts to suppress CSC activity and that TRβ could be considered as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention of ATC."
https://openalex.org/W4221005853,"Catatonia is a psychomotor abnormality caused by neurological, medical or severe psychiatric disorders and substances. Its prevalence ranges from less than 10% to just above 60%. Diagnosis may be influenced by the screening tools used. Screening of new admissions to a mental health unit for catatonia was undertaken using three instruments to determine prevalence of catatonia. Participants ranged from age 16 years and over. Recruitment took place from September 2020 to August 2021. The setting was a mental health unit within a general hospital in Nelson Mandela Metro, South Africa. Five assessors were trained by the principal investigator to apply the Bush Francis Screening Instrument (BFCSI), the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5), to assess participants. Clinical and demographic data were collected using a specially designed datasheet. Data analysis was performed to identify significant associations between presence or absence of catatonia and clinical and demographic data. Up to 241 participants were screened and 44 (18.3%) had catatonia. All 44 cases were identified through the BFCSI while the DSM-5 identified only 16 (6.6%%) of the 44 cases even though the remaining 28 (63.6%) participants still required treatment for catatonic symptoms. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria excluded staring, which was the commonest sign of catatonia identified through the BFCSI [n = 33 (75%)]. Close to half (21; 47.7%) of those with catatonia on the BFCSI had schizophrenia. The rest had bipolar disorder (12; 27.3%), substance-induced psychotic disorder (7; 15.9%) and no specified diagnosis in one (1; 2.6%). The BFCSI was very effective at identifying catatonia while the DSM-5 was inadequate, missing close to 64% (28 of 44) of cases. Predictors of catatonia in this sample were a younger age and being male. A prevalence of 18.3%, indicates that assessment for catatonia should be routinely conducted in this and similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W4220676933,"Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of inflammation and is mediated by inflammatory factors that signal through G protein-coupled receptors including protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1). PAR1, a receptor for thrombin, signals via the small GTPase RhoA and myosin light chain intermediates to facilitate endothelial barrier permeability. PAR1 also induces endothelial barrier disruption through a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway, which does not integrate into the RhoA/MLC pathway; however, the PAR1-p38 signaling pathways that promote endothelial dysfunction remain poorly defined. To identify effectors of this pathway, we performed a global phosphoproteome analysis of thrombin signaling regulated by p38 in human cultured endothelial cells using multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified 5491 unique phosphopeptides and 2317 phosphoproteins, four distinct dynamic phosphoproteome profiles of thrombin-p38 signaling, and an enrichment of biological functions associated with endothelial dysfunction, including modulators of endothelial barrier disruption and a subset of kinases predicted to regulate p38-dependent thrombin signaling. Using available antibodies to detect identified phosphosites of key p38-regulated proteins, we discovered that inhibition of p38 activity and siRNA-targeted depletion of the p38α isoform increased basal phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, resulting in amplified thrombin-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 phosphorylation that was dependent on PAR1. We also discovered a role for p38 in the phosphorylation of α-catenin, a component of adherens junctions, suggesting that this phosphorylation may function as an important regulatory process. Taken together, these studies define a rich array of thrombin- and p38-regulated candidate proteins that may serve important roles in endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4220861774,"On their way to the oocyte, sperm cells are subjected to oxidative stress, which may trigger the oxidation of phospholipids (PL). Applying MALDI-TOF MS, HPTLC and ESI-IT MS, we comparatively analyzed the PL compositions of semen and blood of species differing in their reproductive systems and types of nutrition (bull, boar, stallion, lion and man) with regard to the sensitivity to oxidation as well as the accumulation of harmful lyso-PL (LPL), transient products of lipid oxidation. In addition, the protective capacity of seminal fluid (SF) was also examined. The PL composition of erythrocytes and blood plasma is similar across the species, while pronounced differences exist for sperm and SF. Since the blood function is largely conserved across mammalian species, but the reproductive systems may vary in many aspects, the obtained results suggest that the PL composition is not determined by the type of nutrition, but by the relatedness of species and by functional requirements of cell membranes such as fluidity. Sperm motion and fertilization of oocytes require a rather flexible membrane, which is accomplished by significant moieties of unsaturated fatty acyl residues in sperm lipids of most species, but implies a higher risk of oxidation. Due to a high content of plasmalogens (alkenyl ether lipids), bull sperm are most susceptible to oxidation. Our data indicate that bull sperm possess the most effective protective power in SF. Obviously, a co-evolution of PL composition and protective mechanisms has occurred in semen and is related to the reproductive characteristics. Although the protective capacity in human SF seems well developed, we recorded the most pronounced individual contaminations with LPL in human semen. Probably, massive oxidative challenges related to lifestyle factors interfere with natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4221035802,"Humans naturally perceive and move to a musical beat, entraining body movements to auditory rhythms through clapping, tapping, and dancing. Yet the accuracy of this seemingly effortless behavior varies widely across individuals. Beat perception and production abilities can be improved by experience, such as music and dance training, and impaired by progressive neurological changes, such as in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we assessed the effects of music and dance experience on beat processing in young and older adults, as well as individuals with early-stage Parkinson's disease. We used the Beat Alignment Test (BAT) to assess beat perception and production in a convenience sample of 458 participants (278 healthy young adults, 139 healthy older adults, and 41 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease), with varying levels of music and dance training. In general, we found that participants with over three years of music training had more accurate beat perception than those with less training (p < .001). Interestingly, Parkinson's disease patients with music training had beat production abilities comparable to healthy adults while Parkinson's disease patients with minimal to no music training performed significantly worse. No effects were found in healthy adults for dance training, and too few Parkinson's disease patients had dance training to reliably assess its effects. The finding that musically trained Parkinson's disease patients performed similarly to healthy adults during a beat production task, while untrained patients did not, suggests music training may preserve certain rhythmic motor timing abilities in early-stage Parkinson's disease."

There are few reports on the effect of PRP in the treatment of osteoarthritis in the hand. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of PRP-injections on pain and functional outcome in the short-term for osteoarthritis in the thumb basal joint and scaphoidtrapeziotrapezoidal (STT) joint. A retrospective analysis was performed of 29 patients treated with intra-articular PRP injection for painful osteoarthritis in the thumb basal joint (21 patients) or STT joint (eight patients). The patients received two consecutive, radiologically guided PRP injections at an interval of 3-4 weeks. Pain at rest and on load (numerical rating scale (NRS) 0-10), Patient-rated Wrist and Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) score (0-100), grip strength (Jamar) and key pinch were recorded pre-injection and 3 months after the second injection. Mean age was 63 (range 34-86) years and 17 patients were women. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to analyze the effect on the outcome variables. Possible predictors were included in the model (high pain level pre-injection, gender, age, manually demanding work, affected joint (thumb base or STT) and use of analgesic). The GEE analysis showed that PRP injections had no effect on reported pain, PRWHE score, grip strength or key pinch. 16/28 patients experience a positive effect according to a yes/no question. The short-term effect of PRP for osteoarthritis in the thumb base and STT-joint is doubtful and needs to be properly investigated in placebo-controlled studies."
https://openalex.org/W4221129945,"Renalase is a secreted flavoprotein with anti-inflammatory and pro-cell survival properties. COVID-19 is associated with disordered inflammation and apoptosis. We hypothesized that blood renalase levels would correspond to severe COVID-19 and survival. In this retrospective cohort study, clinicopathologic data and blood samples were collected from hospitalized COVID-19 subjects (March-June 2020) at a single institution tertiary hospital. Plasma renalase and cytokine levels were measured and clinical data abstracted from health records. Of 3,450 COVID-19 patients, 458 patients were enrolled. Patients were excluded if <18 years, or opted out of research. The primary composite outcome was intubation or death within 180 days. Secondary outcomes included mortality alone, intensive care unit admission, use of vasopressors, and CPR. Enrolled patients had mean age 64 years (SD±17), were 53% males, and 48% non-whites. Mean renalase levels was 14,108·4 ng/ml (SD±8,137 ng/ml). Compared to patients with high renalase, those with low renalase (< 8,922 ng/ml) were more likely to present with hypoxia, increased ICU admission (54% vs. 33%, p < 0.001), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (10% vs. 4%, p = 0·023). In Cox proportional hazard model, every 1000 ng/ml increase in renalase decreased the risk of death or intubation by 5% (HR 0·95; 95% CI 0·91-0·98) and increased survival alone by 6% (HR 0·95; CI 0·90-0·98), after adjusting for socio-demographics, initial disease severity, comorbidities and inflammation. Patients with high renalase-low IL-6 levels had the best survival compared to other groups (p = 0·04). Renalase was independently associated with reduced intubation and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Future studies should assess the pathophysiological relevance of renalase in COVID-19 disease."

Contact hubs have a much larger number of contacts than the average in the population, and play a key role on the effectiveness of vaccination strategies. By using an age-structures compartmental SEIAHRV (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected symptomatic, Asymptomatic, Hospitalized, Recovered, Vaccinated) model, calibrated from available demographic and COVID-19 incidence, and considering separately those individuals with a much greater number of contacts than the average in the population, we show that carefully choosing who will compose the first group to be vaccinated can impact positively the total death toll and the demand for health services. This is even more relevant in countries with a lack of basic resources for proper vaccination and a significant reduction in social isolation. In order to demonstrate our approach we show the effect of hypothetical vaccination scenarios in two countries of very different scales and mitigation policies, Brazil and Portugal."

There are increasing reports of the parasite in countries where it is not endemic. A study of the survival drug-treated immature stage (STIM) of Gnathostoma spinigerum recovered from infected patients focused on their integument surface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). STIM displayed a specific, characteristic head bulb, with a pair of large thick equal-sized trilobulated lips in the centre. Cephalic spines had eight transverse rows on the head bulb with single-ended tips curved posteriorly. Body cuticular spines on the anterior half of the STIM were not sharp-pointed but distributed more densely, with multi-dentated-cuticular spines, irregularly arranged in a lining pattern of velvety cuticular folds. The length of cuticular spines increased caudally. The size of spines became gradually smaller, and numbers decreased towards the posterior end. Spines were still widely dispersed posteriorly as their density dropped. The morphology of STIM of G. spinigerum are described in detail for the first time. These specimens showed structural adaptation based on changes on integument surfaces, probably to protect against damage induced by the toxic effects of albendazole."
https://openalex.org/W4220829328,"Direct assessment of patient samples holds unprecedented potential in the treatment of cancer. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in liquid biopsies are a rapidly evolving source of primary cells in the clinic and are ideal candidates for functional assays to uncover real-time tumor information in real-time. However, a lack of routines allowing direct and active interrogation of CTCs directly from liquid biopsy samples represents a bottleneck for the translational use of liquid biopsies in clinical settings. To address this, we present a workflow for using a microfluidic vortex-assisted electroporation system designed for the functional assessment of CTCs purified from blood. Validation of this approach was assessed through drug response assays on wild-type (HCC827 wt) and gefitinib-resistant (HCC827 GR6) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. HCC827 cells trapped within microscale vortices were electroporated to sequentially deliver drug agents into the cytosol. Electroporation conditions facilitating multi-agent delivery were characterized for both cell lines using an automatic single-cell image fluorescence intensity algorithm. HCC827 GR6 cells spiked into the blood to emulate drug-resistant CTCs were able to be collected with high purity, demonstrating the ability of the device to minimize background cell impact for downstream sensitive cell assays. Using our proposed workflow, drug agent combinations to restore gefitinib sensitivity reflected the anticipated cytotoxic response. Taken together, these results represent a microfluidics multi-drug screening panel workflow that can enable functional interrogation of patient CTCs in situ , thereby accelerating the clinical standardization of liquid biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W4220885941,"Health insurance coverage is critical for persons living with chronic conditions such as heart failure. Lack of health insurance may affect the ability to access regular healthcare appointments, pay for medication refills which can result in frequent hospitalization that is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In scarce resource locations such as sub-Saharan Africa, where uptake of health insurance is still suboptimal, the effect of health insurance on chronic conditions such as heart failure is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the association of health insurance on the severity of heart failure for patients attending outpatient clinics at tertiary hospitals in Mwanza, Tanzania.As part of a larger cohort study, patients with heart failure were recruited from Bugando Medical Center (BMC) and Sekou Toure Regional Hospital (STRH) in Mwanza City, Tanzania. Heart failure was based on Framingham criteria and the severity was determined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to describe the study participants and to assess the association between health insurance status and the severity of heart failure at baseline.418 patients were enrolled, and majority were female (n = 264, 63%), small scale farmers (n = 278, 66.5%) and were from Mwanza City (n = 299, 71.5%). More than two-thirds of patients did not have health insurance (n = 295, 70.6%) and the majority were in the NYHA I and II classification (n = 267, 64.7%). There was no association between health insurance status and the severity of heart (aOR 0.97; 95% CI 0.84-1.60). Being male, small-scale businessperson and those seen at STRH was associated with higher odds of being in NYHA Class III/IV (aOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.21-3.17), (aOR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.27-5.34) and (aOR 1.91 95% CI: 1.17-3.13) respectively. Having secondary and college education was associated with lower odds of being in Class III/IV (0.42; 95% CI: 0.18-0.98) and (aOR = 0.23 95% CI: 0.06-0.86) respectively.In this study, only a third of the patients had health insurance. Health insurance was not associated with the severity of heart failure. Since heart failure is a chronic condition patients who do not have health insurance may incur out of pocket expenses, future research should focus on the effect of out-of-pocket expenditures on clinical outcomes."

All of them likely crossed the interspecific barrier between animals and humans and are of zoonotic origin, respectively. The origin and evolution of viruses and their phylogenetic relationships are of great importance for study of their pathogenicity and development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. The main objective of the presented study was to compare two methods for identifying relationships between coronavirus genomes: phylogenetic one based on the whole genome alignment followed by molecular phylogenetic tree inference and alignment-free clustering of triplet frequencies, respectively, using 69 coronavirus genomes selected from two public databases. Both approaches resulted in well-resolved robust classifications. In general, the clusters identified by the first approach were in good agreement with the classes identified by the second using K -means and the elastic map method, but not always, which still needs to be explained. Both approaches demonstrated also a significant divergence of genomes on a taxonomic level, but there was less correspondence between genomes regarding the types of diseases they caused, which may be due to the individual characteristics of the host. This research showed that alignment-free methods are efficient in combination with alignment-based methods. They have a significant advantage in computational complexity and provide valuable additional alternative information on the genomes relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4220902785,"Eidolon helvum bats are reservoir hosts for highly pathogenic lyssaviruses often showing limited disease upon natural infection. An enhanced antiviral interferon (IFN) response combined with reduced inflammation might be linked to the apparent virus tolerance in bats. Lyssavirus phosphoproteins inhibit the IFN response with virus strain-specific efficiency. To date, little is known regarding the lyssavirus P-dependent anti-IFN countermeasures in bats, mainly due to a lack of in vitro tools. By using E. helvum bat cell cultures in a newly established bat-specific IFN-promoter activation assay, we analyzed the IFN-ß inhibitory activity of multiple lyssavirus P in E. helvum compared to human cells. Initial virus infection studies with a recently isolated E. helvum-borne Lagos bat virus street strain from Ghana showed enhanced LBV propagation in an E. helvum lung cell line compared to human A549 lung cells at later time points suggesting effective viral countermeasures against cellular defense mechanisms. A direct comparison of the IFN-ß inhibitory activity of the LBV-GH P protein with other lyssavirus P proteins showed that LBV-GH P and RVP both strongly inhibited the bat IFN-β promotor activation (range 75-90%) in EidLu/20.2 and an E. helvum kidney cell line. Conversely, LBV-GH P blocked the activation of the human IFN-β promoter less efficiently compared to a prototypic Rabies virus P protein (range LBV P 52-68% vs RVP 71-95%) in two different human cell lines (HEK-293T, A549). The same pattern was seen for two prototypic LBV P variants suggesting an overall reduced LBV P IFN-ß inhibitory activity in human cells as compared to E. helvum bat cells. Increased IFN-ß inhibition by lyssavirus P in reservoir host cells might be a result of host-specific adaptation processes towards an enhanced IFN response in bat cells."
https://openalex.org/W4221026887,"Chinese commercial pedestrian streets have developed rapidly in recent years. However, people’s preferences were not sufficiently considered and reflected in the outdoor space and landscape design. With the outdoor landscapes along commercial pedestrian streets in the region south of the Five Ridges as the research objects, this study revealed the public’s different preference evaluations of the landscapes under the reciprocal effects of street characteristics. The main results were as follows: (a) When arcade spaces were available, people prefer streets with taller trees and a lower planting density (50 plants/km or less). Conversely, they preferred streets with relatively low trees (3–6 m), a higher planting density (100–200 plants/km) and two or more vertical layers of plants. People did not like the way that plants are lined in the middle of a street. (b) When there were only one or two types of signage hanging, people preferred streets with a moderate planting density (50–100 plants/km); and there were three or more types of signage hanging, people preferred the plants with low linear density (50 plants/km or less) and that were arranged along one or two sides of the street. (c) When benches were available, people preferred streets with plants on one or both sides, fewer plant colours (one or two kind of colours) and better plant growth status. Specifically, the richer the vertical structure and the bigger number of colours were, the higher the preference score. This study provided design schemes to enhance the visual quality of landscapes by improving landscape characteristics in similar outdoor spaces."
https://openalex.org/W4214889119,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF-1A) is a transcription factor expressed in several embryonic and adult tissues, modulating the expression of numerous target genes. Pathogenic variants in the HNF1A gene are known to cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3 or HNF1A MODY), a disease characterized by dominant inheritance, age of onset before 25 to 35 years of age, and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. A precise diagnosis can alter management of this disease, as insulin can be exchanged with sulfonylurea tablets and genetic counseling differs from polygenic forms of diabetes. Therefore, more knowledge on the mechanisms of HNF-1A function and the level of pathogenicity of the numerous HNF1A variants is required for precise diagnostics. Here, we structurally and biophysically characterized an HNF-1A protein containing both the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, and determined the folding and DNA-binding capacity of two established MODY3 HNF-1A variant proteins (P112L, R263C) and one variant of unknown significance (N266S). All three variants showed reduced functionality compared to the WT protein. Furthermore, while the R263C and N266S variants displayed reduced binding to an HNF-1A target promoter, we found the P112L variant was unstable in vitro and in cells. Our results support and mechanistically explain disease causality for these investigated variants and present a novel approach for the dissection of structurally unstable and DNA-binding defective variants. This study indicates that structural and biochemical investigation of HNF-1A is a valuable tool in reliable variant classification needed for precision diabetes diagnostics and management."

https://openalex.org/W4220790710,"The intensity and scale of wildfires has increased throughout the Pacific Northwest in recent decades, especially within the last decade, destroying vast amounts of valuable resources and assets. This trend is predicted to remain or even magnify due climate change, growing population, increased housing density. Furthermore, the associated stress of prolonged droughts and change in land cover/land use puts more population at risk. We present results of a multi-phase Extension Fire Program Initiative combining fire model results based on worst-case meteorological conditions recorded at 50 weather stations across Oregon with spatially distinct valuations of resources and assets based on regional ecological and socio-economic conditions. Our study focuses on six different Fire Service Areas covering the state of Oregon. We used a geostatistical approach to find weather stations that provide worst-case meteorological input data on record for representative sub-domains. The results provide regionally distinct assessments of potential value loss by wildfire and show that, depending on the region, 12% to 52% of the highest relative risk areas are on private land. This underscores the need to unite strategies and efforts on the landscape scale by including different landowners, managers, and stakeholders of public land and private land efficiently address wildfire damage protection and mitigation. Our risk assessments closely agreed with risks identified during landscape-scale ground projects."
https://openalex.org/W4220871709,"Product category management (PCM) plays a pivotal role in today's large stores. PCM manages to answer questions such as assortment planning (AP) and shelf space allocation (SSA). AP problem seeks to determine a list of products and suppliers, while SSA problem tries to design the layout of the selected products in the available shelf space. These problems aim to maximize the retailer sales under different constraints, such as limited purchasing budget, limited space of classes for displaying the products, and having at least a certain number of suppliers. This paper makes an attempt to develop an integrated mathematical model to optimize integrated AP, SSA, and inventory control problem for the perishable products. The objective of the model is to maximize the sales and retail profit, considering the costs of supplier contracting/selecting and ordering, assortment planning, holding, and procurement cost. GAMS BARON solver is hired to solve the proposed model in small and medium scales. However, because the problem is NP-hard, an evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA), and an efficient local search vibration damping optimization (VDO) algorithm are proposed. A real case study is considered to evaluate the effectiveness and capabilities of the model. Besides, some test problems of different sizes are generated and solved by the proposed metaheuristic solvers to confirm the efficient performance of proposed algorithms in solving large-scale instances."
https://openalex.org/W4220927304,"The significant effect of enterprise social media (ESM) usage has been extensively researched. However, recent studies and analysis have also emphasized the importance of understanding the negative aspects of ESM’s use. By applying uses and gratifications theory (UGT), this study proposes a research model that tests how employees’ ESM usage (hedonic, social, and information values) leads to ESM-related strain through perceived information overload. The study collected data from 315 Chinese employees using a survey method and analyzed the results using AMOS 21.0 software. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the proposed hypothesis. The results indicate that perceived hedonic, social, and information values are significant predictors of perceived information overload. Such overload is also significantly associated with ESM-related strain. The results also indicate that ESM visibility strengthens the significant relationship between perceived information overload and ESM-related strain. Furthermore, managers can also train individuals to use ESM appropriately. We recommend that employees can better control and manage their ESM usage by recognizing the causes of excessive use."

It has long been recognised that some patients have such significant clinical and/or risk needs that those needs cannot be adequately met within standard service delivery models, resulting in a pressing need to consider the best models for this group of people. This paper shares a protocol for a mixed methods study that aims to understand: the profile and history of service users described as having complex needs; the decision-making processes by clinicians that lead to complex needs categorisation; service users and carers experience of service use; and, associated economic impact. This protocol describes a comprehensive evaluation that aims to inform an evidence-based service delivery model for people with complex needs.We will use a mixed methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative methods using in-depth descriptive and inferential analysis of patient records, written medical notes and in-depth interviews with service users, carers, and clinicians. The study will include five components: (1) a quantitative description and analysis of the demographic clinical characteristics of the patient group; (2) an economic evaluation of alternative patient pathways; (3) semi-structured interviews about service user and carer experiences; (4) using data from components 1-3 to co-produce vignettes jointly with relevant stakeholders involved in the care of service users with complex mental health needs; and, (5) semi-structured interviews about clinical decision-making by clinicians in relation to this patient group, using the vignettes as example case studies.The study's key outcomes will be to: examine the resource use and cost-impact associated with alternative care pathways to the NHS and other sectors of the economy (including social care); explore patient health and non-health outcomes associated with alternative care pathways; and, gain an understanding of a complex service user group and how treatment decisions are made to inform consistent and person-centred future service delivery."

Objective To estimate the siponimod cost-effectiveness profile and its relative budget impact compared with other DMTs, by using the Italian National Healthcare System perspective. Methods We performed: 1) a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) vs interferon beta-1b using an analytical Markov model and a life time-horizon, and 2) a budget impact analysis by using 3-years time-horizon. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net-monetary benefit (NMB) for CEA, using a willingness to pay threshold of €40,000 per QALY gained, and as difference in the overall budget (Euro) between the scenario with and without siponimod for budget impact. Results In the base case scenario siponimod resulted cost-effective compared with interferon beta-1b 28,891€ per QALY. Overall, the market access of siponimod was associated to an increased budget of about 3€ millions (+0.9%) in the next 3 years simulated. Conclusion Compared to interferon beta-1b, siponimod seems to be cost-effective in SPMS patients and sustainable, with less than 1% overall budget increased in the next 3 years. Future studies need to confirm our results in the real word setting and in other countries."

We explored the utility of machine learning to determine whether the catabolic stress hormone cortisol and the anabolic, anti-stress hormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), as well as the cortisol to DHEA-S ratio relate to near misses in emergency medicine residents during active duty in a trauma 1 emergency department. Compared to statistical models better suited for inference, machine learning models allow for prediction in situations that have not yet occurred, and thus better suited for clinical applications. This exploratory study used multiple machine learning models to determine possible relationships between biomarkers and near misses. Of the various models tested, support vector machine with radial bias function kernels and support vector machine with linear kernels performed the best, with training accuracies of 85% and 79% respectively. When evaluated on a test dataset, both models had prediction accuracies of around 80%. The pre-shift cortisol to DHEA-S ratio was shown to be the most important predictor in interpretable models tested. Results suggest that interventions that help emergency room physicians relax before they begin their shift could reduce risk of errors and improve patient and physician outcomes. This pilot demonstrates promising results regarding using machine learning to better understand the stress biology of near misses. Future studies should use larger groups and relate these variables to information in electronic medical records, such as objective and patient-reported quality measures."

Given growing urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a critical need to assess the successes and challenges of implementing HIV testing, prevention and treatment interventions in these contexts.We randomly selected a household-based sample of 1528 adult men (18-35) and women (18-24) living in 18 randomly selected communities in KZN, South Africa. After the baseline interview, communities were randomized to one of three intervention rollout arms in a stepped wedge design. At approximately 8-month intervals, the Asibonisane Community Responses Program (and in particular the implementation of Stepping Stones, a participatory HIV prevention program focused on strengthening relationships and communication) was rolled at by intervention phase. Using data from this evaluation, we describe levels and trends in HIV testing and treatment during follow-up, and we use fixed effects models to estimate the effects of participation in the program on testing.Study respondents reported high levels of economic insecurity and mobility, and men report various HIV risk behaviors including about 50% reporting multiple partnerships. About two-thirds of respondents (73% of women, 63% of men) had been tested for HIV in the last six months. Among those living with HIV, treatment levels were high at baseline, and almost universal by endline in 2019. Program participation led to a 17% increase in the probability of testing for women (p<0.05) but had no effect on testing for men due, in part, to the fact that the program did not reach men who were least likely to be tested, including those who had migrated recently, and those who had never been tested at baseline.Near universal HIV treatment use demonstrates positive trends in access to some HIV services (including treatment as prevention) in these communities. Stepping Stones had positive effects on HIV testing for women, yet barriers to HIV testing remain, especially for men. Redoubled efforts to reach men with testing are vital for improving HIV outcomes for both men and their partners."

This study was aimed at investigating the genomic miscellany, allele frequencies, and MOI of P. falciparum infection.A total of 85 P. falciparum confirmed isolates out of 100 were included in this study that were collected from P. falciparum patients aged 4 months to 60 years in nine districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Parasite DNA was extracted from 200µL whole blood samples using the Qiagen DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The polymorphic regions of msp-1, msp-2 and glurp loci were genotyped using nested PCR followed by gel electrophoresis for amplified fragments identification and subsequent data analysis.Out of 85 P. falciparum infections detected, 30 were msp-1 and 32 were msp-2 alleles specific. Successful amplification occurred in 88.23% (75/85) isolates for msp-1, 78.9% (67/85) for msp-2 and 70% (60/85) for glurp gene. In msp-1, the K1 allelic family was predominantly prevalent as 66.66% (50/75), followed by RO33 and MAD20. The frequency of samples with single infection having only K1, MAD20 and RO33 were 21.34% (16/75), 8% (6/75), and 10.67% (8/75), respectively. In msp-2, both the FC27 and 3D7 allelic families revealed almost the same frequencies as 70.14% (47/67) and 67.16% (45/67), respectively. Nine glurp RII region alleles were identified in 60 isolates. The overall mean multiplicity of infection for msp genes was 1.6 with 1.8 for msp-1 and 1.4 for msp-2, while for glurp the MOI was 1.03. There was no significant association between multiplicity of infection and age groups (Spearman's rank coefficient = 0.050; P = 0.6) while MOI and parasite density correlated for only msp-2 allelic marker.The study showed high genetic diversity and allelic frequency with multiple clones of msp-1, msp-2 and glurp in P. falciparum isolates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. In the present study the genotype data may provide valuable information essential for monitoring the impact of malaria eradication efforts in this region."

However, the detailed mechanism by which Abl regulates HCV replication remained unclear. In this study, we established Abl-deficient (Abl-) cells through genome editing and compared HCV production between Abl- cells expressing WT or kinase-dead Abl and parental Huh-7.5 cells. Our findings revealed that Abl expression was not required from the stages of virus attachment and entry to viral gene expression; however, the kinase activity of Abl was necessary for the assembly of HCV particles. Reconstitution experiments using human embryonic kidney 293T cells revealed that phosphorylation of Tyr412 in the activation loop of Abl was enhanced by coexpression with the viral nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and was abrogated by the substitution of NS5A Tyr330 with Phe (Y330F), suggesting that NS5A functions as a substrate activator of Abl. Abl-NS5A association was also attenuated by the Y330F mutation of NS5A or the kinase-dead Abl, and Abl Tyr412 phosphorylation was not enhanced by NS5A bearing a mutation disabling homodimerization, although the association of Abl with NS5A was still observed. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Abl forms a phosphorylation-dependent complex with dimeric NS5A necessary for viral particle assembly, but that Abl is capable of complex formation with monomeric NS5A regardless of tyrosine phosphorylation. Our findings provide the foundation of a molecular basis for a new hepatitis C treatment strategy using Abl inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4220696349,"Reproductive seasonality is a phenomenon common to human and animal populations and driven by, among others, climatic variables. Given the currently changing climate and its impacts on both the environment and human lives, the question arises of its potential effects on reproductive seasonality. Few studies have specifically explored the seasonality of reproduction among hunter-gatherers and anyone investigated how current climate change might affect this phenomenon. In this study we addressed reproductive seasonality in the Baka Pygmy living in African rain forests. Since reproductive seasonality can be linked to weather patterns, we explore this possibility. However, climatic variables driving weather patterns have changed over the years, so we assessed whether this has influenced the Baka reproductive pattern. Based on 34 years of written birth records and oral questionnaires from 13 years of systematic fieldwork, we observed a bimodal birth pattern with two birth peaks at 6-month intervals. Our results demonstrate that precipitation at conception or at birth potentially has effects, respectively negative and positive on the monthly number of births; and temperature has a role in controlling other variables that do affect the reproductive pattern. Changing weather patterns appear to be affecting the reproductive seasonality in the Baka, suggesting that attention needs to be given to the influence of global climate change on forager societies."
