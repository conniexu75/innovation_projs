https://openalex.org/W2764376840,"Earth models selected by a Monte Carlo procedure were tested against geophysical data; 5 million models were examined and six have passed all tests. Common features of successful models are an increased core radius and a chemically inhomogeneous core consistent with Fe-Ni alloy (20 to 50 percent Fe) for the solid portion and Fe-Si alloy (15 to 25 percent Fe) for the fluid core. The inhomogeneous mantle is consistent with an increase in the FeO:FeO + MgO ratio by a factor of 2 in the deep mantle. The transition zone is a region of not only phase change but also composition change; this condition would inhibit mantlewide convection. The upper-mantle solutions show large fluctuations in density; this state implies insufficient constraint on solutions for this region, or lateral variations in mantle composition ranging from pyrolite to eclogite."
https://openalex.org/W2045640064,"Sodium plagioclase and small amounts of potassium feldspar are common constituents of silicate inclusions in the Weekeroo Station and Colomera iron meteorites; flamboyant x-ray antiperthite is unique to Kodaikanal silicate inclusions. Enrichment of potassium, sodium, silicon, and aluminum in these inclusions indicates a higher degree of chemical differentiation than in other meteorites."

https://openalex.org/W1963937311,The distribution of alpha-radioactivity in the vicinity of uranium and of certain variant radioactive halos in biotite was investigated by the fossil alpharecoil method. Within the limits of the method I could not confirm a previously proposed hydrothermal mechanism for the origin of certain variant halo types due to polonium isotopes.

https://openalex.org/W2071953877,"Flint pebbles and nodules from the Upper Cretaceous chalks of Europe occur offshore and at many seaports along the Atlantic coast of North America, where they were brought as ship's ballast. Isolated pieces imported from Europe as gunflints also are present."

https://openalex.org/W2093308865,"Argillites of the Permian Mount Glossopteris Formation were analyzed for clay minerals, trace elements, and phosphate paleosalinity. Mainly degraded and stripped illites occur. The determined salinity range, 29 to 33 parts per mille is designated the ""paleosalinity signature"" of the formation. Analysis of trace elements supports phosphate paleosalinity determinations. Data from Leaia-bearing beds indicate a salinity range of 30 to 31 parts per mille that persisted some 137 years. Subsequent increase to 33 parts per mille corresponded to termination of leaiid occupancy of the area. These findings confirm and extend Nelson's study of phasphate paleosalinity."
