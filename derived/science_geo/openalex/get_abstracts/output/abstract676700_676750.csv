https://openalex.org/W3174747632,"A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), which was originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate-based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies."

Recent emerging viral variants have raised concern because of their potential to escape antibody neutralization. Wang et al . identified four antibodies from early-outbreak convalescent donors that are potent against 23 variants, including variants of concern, and characterized their binding to the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Yuan et al . examined the impact of emerging mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on binding to the host receptor ACE2 and to a range of antibodies. These studies may be helpful for developing more broadly effective vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. —VV"

Xiang et al. demonstrate that the entire system, the laser-pumping system and the comb-generating microresonators, can be combined into an integrated silicon-based platform. Compatibility with foundry fabrication methods will enable this innovation to have a major impact on coherent communications, optical interconnects, and low-noise microwave generation.

However, unlike materials such as silicon, there are few tools for large-scale patterning of monolithic devices. Zheng et al. developed an optical lithography technique for the high-throughput fabrication of transistor circuitry on stretchable substrates. In this method, ultraviolet light is used to control the local solubility of the polymer, which makes it possible to fabricate transistors on the micrometer scale. These devices can be made with high yield and excellent uniformity without compromising their electronic and mechanical characteristics. Science , abh3551, this issue p. 88"
https://openalex.org/W3176766013,"Spatial patterns of gene expression manifest at scales ranging from local (e.g., cell-cell interactions) to global (e.g., body axis patterning). However, current spatial transcriptomics methods either average local contexts or are restricted to limited fields of view. Here, we introduce sci-Space, which retains single-cell resolution while resolving spatial heterogeneity at larger scales. Applying sci-Space to developing mouse embryos, we captured approximate spatial coordinates and whole transcriptomes of about 120,000 nuclei. We identify thousands of genes exhibiting anatomically patterned expression, leverage spatial information to annotate cellular subtypes, show that cell types vary substantially in their extent of spatial patterning, and reveal correlations between pseudotime and the migratory patterns of differentiating neurons. Looking forward, we anticipate that sci-Space will facilitate the construction of spatially resolved single-cell atlases of mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W3174858190,"No missing sink Estimates of the flux of microplastics from rivers, in the context of the mass of plastic that has been observed in the ocean, have made it appear that a large, unidentified sink of plastics must exist there. Weiss et al. show that there may not be a missing sink after all. By reformulating how mass fluxes are calculated from observations of particle numbers, they demonstrate that those mass fluxes were overestimated by two to three orders of magnitude. This explains why the residence time of plastics in the ocean seemed so puzzlingly short and implies that ocean plastics may persist and degrade over longer periods than previously thought.

There is thus great interest in understanding how genes predispose individuals to, or protect individuals from, obesity. Akbari et al. sequenced more than 600,000 exomes from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Mexico and identified 16 rare coding variants (see the Perspective by Yeo and O'Rahilly). Some of the alleles associated with body mass index (BMI) were brain-expressed G protein–coupled receptors. One variant allele was found in Mexican populations at low frequency and was associated with lower BMI. Deletion of this gene in mice resulted in a resistance to weight gain, suggesting that this gene provides an avenue of study for the prevention or treatment of obesity.

https://openalex.org/W3173898417,"The plant male germline undergoes DNA methylation reprogramming, which methylates genes de novo and thereby alters gene expression and regulates meiosis. Here, we reveal the molecular mechanism underlying this reprogramming. We demonstrate that genic methylation in the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm, is established by 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from transposons with imperfect sequence homology. These siRNAs are synthesized by meiocyte nurse cells (tapetum) through activity of CLSY3, a chromatin remodeler absent in other anther cells. Tapetal siRNAs govern germline methylation throughout the genome, including the inherited methylation patterns in sperm. Tapetum-derived siRNAs also silence germline transposons, safeguarding genome integrity. Our results reveal that tapetal siRNAs are sufficient to reconstitute germline methylation patterns and drive functional methylation reprogramming throughout the male germline."
https://openalex.org/W3176735405,"Macrophages: key mediators of fat storage Recent work has suggested that macrophages may regulate adiposity, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain unresolved. Cox et al. report that a macrophage-derived growth factor, Pvf3, and its receptor on fat body cells are needed for lipid storage in fruit fly larvae (see the Perspective by O'Brien and Domingos). The mouse Pvf3 ortholog, PDGFcc, was similarly required to store fat in newborn and adult mice. When PDGFcc was blocked or deleted, food intake and absorption were normal, but mice increased their energy expenditure partly due to enhanced brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. PDGFcc was produced exclusively by fat-resident macrophages rather than by those mediating inflammation and insulin resistance. This work may inform future treatments for lipodystrophy, cachexia, and obesity. Science , abe9383, this issue p. eabe9383 ; see also abj5072, p. 24"

Closure of the critical period stabilizes the circuits. Looking at development in the mouse visual cortex, Ribot et al. found that astrocytes increase their expression of the gap junction channel subunit connexin 30, which in turn inhibits expression of a matrix-degrading enzyme (see the Perspective by Kofuji and Araque). As the matrix stabilizes, inhibitory interneurons mature, and the unusual flexibility of the critical period comes to an end. Science , abf5273, this issue p. 77 ; see also abj6745, p. 29"

Imada et al. found that a narrow-line tunable laser combined with a scanning tunneling microscope was able to generate photoluminescence spectra of the electronic and vibrational states of single molecules with micro–electron volt energy resolution and submolecular spatial resolution. The authors also discovered a way to tune the energy levels through a linear Stark effect and plasmon-exciton coupling in the tunneling junction.

https://openalex.org/W3175127916,"An ability to build structured mental maps of the world underpins our capacity to imagine relationships between objects that extend beyond experience. In rodents, such representations are supported by sequential place cell reactivations during rest, known as replay. Schizophrenia is proposed to reflect a compromise in structured mental representations, with animal models reporting abnormalities in hippocampal replay and associated ripple activity during rest. Here, utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tasked patients with schizophrenia and control participants to infer unobserved relationships between objects by reorganizing visual experiences containing these objects. During a post-task rest session, controls exhibited fast spontaneous neural reactivation of presented objects that replayed inferred relationships. Replay was coincident with increased ripple power in hippocampus. Patients showed both reduced replay and augmented ripple power relative to controls, convergent with findings in animal models. These abnormalities are linked to impairments in behavioral acquisition and subsequent neural representation of task structure."

Cells linking visual processing to person memory have been proposed but not found. Here, we report the discovery of such cells through recordings from an area in the macaque temporal pole identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These cells responded to faces that were personally familiar. They responded nonlinearly to stepwise changes in face visibility and detail and holistically to face parts, reflecting key signatures of familiar face recognition. They discriminated between familiar identities, as fast as a general face identity area. The discovery of these cells establishes a new pathway for the fast recognition of familiar individuals."

The fundamental connectivity patterns of cell-cell communication networks that enable pathological dynamics to emerge remain unknown. Here, we studied epileptic circuits using a newly developed computational pipeline that leveraged single-cell calcium imaging of larval zebrafish and chronically epileptic mice, biologically constrained effective connectivity modeling, and higher-order motif-focused network analysis. We uncovered a novel functional cell type that preferentially emerged in the preseizure state, the superhub, that was unusually richly connected to the rest of the network through feedforward motifs, critically enhancing downstream excitation. Perturbation simulations indicated that disconnecting superhubs was significantly more effective in stabilizing epileptic circuits than disconnecting hub cells that were defined traditionally by connection count. In the dentate gyrus of chronically epileptic mice, superhubs were predominately modeled adult-born granule cells. Collectively, these results predict a new maximally selective and minimally invasive cellular target for seizure control."

However, a robust computerized respiratory sound analysis algorithm has not yet been validated in practical applications. In this study, we developed a lung sound database (HF_Lung_V1) comprising 9,765 audio files of lung sounds (duration of 15 s each), 34,095 inhalation labels, 18,349 exhalation labels, 13,883 continuous adventitious sound (CAS) labels (comprising 8,457 wheeze labels, 686 stridor labels, and 4,740 rhonchi labels), and 15,606 discontinuous adventitious sound labels (all crackles). We conducted benchmark tests for long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), bidirectional GRU (BiGRU), convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM, CNN-GRU, CNN-BiLSTM, and CNN-BiGRU models for breath phase detection and adventitious sound detection. We also conducted a performance comparison between the LSTM-based and GRU-based models, between unidirectional and bidirectional models, and between models with and without a CNN. The results revealed that these models exhibited adequate performance in lung sound analysis. The GRU-based models outperformed, in terms of F1 scores and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, the LSTM-based models in most of the defined tasks. Furthermore, all bidirectional models outperformed their unidirectional counterparts. Finally, the addition of a CNN improved the accuracy of lung sound analysis, especially in the CAS detection tasks."

Methane is highly abundant and is both produced and consumed by microbes through well understood biochemical pathways. Less well understood is how ethane, also a major natural component of gaseous hydrocarbons, is metabolized. To understand how microbes take advantage of this energy and carbon source, Hahn et al. solved the x-ray crystal structures of an enzyme they call ethyl coenzyme-M reductase, which converts ethane into the thioether ethyl-coenzyme M as the entry point for catabolism. They found an expanded active site and, using a xenon gas derivatization experiment, a distinctive tunnel through the protein that is proposed to permit access of the gaseous substrate.

https://openalex.org/W3175983114,"Neuropsychiatric disorders are often accompanied by cognitive impairments/intellectual disability (ID). It is not clear whether there are converging mechanisms underlying these debilitating impairments. We found that many autism and schizophrenia risk genes are expressed in the anterodorsal subdivision (AD) of anterior thalamic nuclei, which has reciprocal connectivity with learning and memory structures. CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown of multiple risk genes selectively in AD thalamus led to memory deficits. While the AD is necessary for contextual memory encoding, the neighboring anteroventral subdivision (AV) regulates memory specificity. These distinct functions of AD and AV are mediated through their projections to retrosplenial cortex, using differential mechanisms. Furthermore, knockdown of autism and schizophrenia risk genes PTCHD1, YWHAG, or HERC1 from AD led to neuronal hyperexcitability, and normalization of hyperexcitability rescued memory deficits in these models. This study identifies converging cellular to circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in a subset of neuropsychiatric disease models."

We undertook a survey among Australian women to examine patterns of use of galactagogues and perceptions regarding their safety and effectiveness. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was distributed between September and December 2019 via national breastfeeding and preterm birth support organisations, and networks of several research institutions in Australia. Women were eligible to participate if they lived in Australia and were currently/previously breastfeeding. The survey included questions about galactagogue use (including duration and timing), side effects and perceived effectiveness (on a scale of 1 [Not at all effective] to 5 [Extremely effective]). Results Among 1876 respondents, 1120 (60%) reported using one or more galactagogues. Women were 31.5 ± 4.8 years (mean ± standard deviation) at their most recent birth. Sixty-five percent of women were currently breastfeeding at the time of the survey. The most commonly reported galactagogues included lactation cookies (47%), brewer’s yeast (32%), fenugreek (22%) and domperidone (19%). The mean duration of use for each galactagogue ranged from 2 to 20 weeks. Approximately 1 in 6 women reported commencing galactagogues within the first week postpartum. Most women reported receiving recommendations to use herbal/dietary galactagogues from the internet (38%) or friends (25%), whereas pharmaceutical galactagogues were most commonly prescribed by General Practitioners (72%). The perceived effectiveness varied greatly across galactagogues. Perceived effectiveness was highest for domperidone (mean rating of 3.3 compared with 2.0 to 3.0 among other galactagogues). Over 23% of domperidone users reported experiencing multiple side effects, compared to an average of 3% of women taking herbal galactagogues. Conclusions This survey demonstrates that galactagogues use is common in Australia. Further research is needed to generate robust evidence about galactagogues’ efficacy and safety to support evidence-based strategies and improve breastfeeding outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3175946299,"Introduction Pelvic floor disorders (PFD) are gynecologic health problems containing a wide variety of clinical problems; the most prevalent problems are pelvic organ prolapse, fecal incontinence, and urinary incontinence. It is a significant women’s health problem for both developed and developing countries. One in five women in Ethiopia experiences at least one major type of pelvic floor disorders. Despite the severity of the problem, due attention was not given, and no study has been conducted on pelvic floor disorders in the Gurage Zone. Objective To determine the prevalence and associated factors of symptomatic pelvic floor disorders among women living in Gurage Zone, SNNPR, Ethiopia, 2020. Methodology Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2020 among 542 women residing in the Gurage Zone. A multi-stage sampling method was used to select the participants. Interviewer administered, pretested questionnaires containing questions related to pelvic organ prolapse, urinary, and fecal incontinence was used. The urinary incontinence severity index questionnaire was used to assess the severity of urinary incontinence. Epi-Info x7 was used to record data, and SPSS was used to analyze the data. Binary logistic regression with 95% CI was used to explore the relationship between PFD and other independent variables. After multivariable logistic regression analysis variables with P-value less than 0.05 was used to determine significant association. Result A total of 542 participants were included in this study. Overall, 41.1% of the participants reported one or more symptoms of pelvic floor disorders. Urinary incontinence had the highest prevalence (32.8%), followed by pelvic organ prolapse (25.5%) and fecal incontinence (4.2%). History of weight lifting &gt;10 Kg (AOR = 3.38; 95% CI: 1.99, 5.72), ≥5 vaginal delivery (AOR = 11.18; 95% CI: 1.53, 81.58), and being in menopause (AOR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.40, 8.07) were identified as possible contributing factors in the development of a pelvic floor disorders. Conclusion The prevalence of symptomatic PFD was higher compared to other similar studies in Ethiopia. Heavy weight lifting, repetitive vaginal deliveries and menopause were factors significantly associated with PFD. Expansion of technologies and building basic infrastructures, health education on kegel exercise and promotion of family planning should be considered as a prevention strategy."

As for much new technology, their development and proliferation occurred with little consideration for their impacts, but now it is impossible to deny their dark side as we confront a rapidly growing plastic pollution problem. In this special issue, we examine a range of topics related to plastics, from their distribution in the environment to their development into an evolutionary trap for animals to ways we can rethink them to create a better future. A series of Reviews discusses how plastics are best understood as novel geomaterials, the evolutionary and ecological dimensions of plastic ingestion by wildlife, the accumulation and effects of plastic pollution in the environment, and how innovations in upcycling and recycling may affect the fate of plastics and drive advances in next-generation materials design. Complementing these Reviews, a Policy Forum and a pair of Perspectives discuss efforts to develop a global agreement to combat plastic pollution, provide an overview of the history of environmental bioplastics and their implications, and offer suggestions for designing plastics for a circular bioeconomy. Finally, a brace of News Features explores how enzymes are being used to aid in plastic recycling efforts and how museums are trying to stop plastics in their exhibits from breaking down. The time for preventing plastic pollution is long past—the time for changing the future of plastics in our world, however, is now."
https://openalex.org/W3173296197,"Many affective computing studies have developed automatic emotion recognition models, mostly using emotional images, audio and videos. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) has been also used as a method to elicit emotions in laboratory environments. However, there is still a need to analyse the validity of VR in order to extrapolate the results it produces and to assess the similarities and differences in physiological responses provoked by real and virtual environments. We investigated the cardiovascular oscillations of 60 participants during a free exploration of a real museum and its virtualisation viewed through a head-mounted display. The differences between the heart rate variability features in the high and low arousal stimuli conditions were analysed through statistical hypothesis testing; and automatic arousal recognition models were developed across the real and the virtual conditions using a support vector machine algorithm with recursive feature selection. The subjects’ self-assessments suggested that both museums elicited low and high arousal levels. In addition, the real museum showed differences in terms of cardiovascular responses, differences in vagal activity, while arousal recognition reached 72.92% accuracy. However, we did not find the same arousal-based autonomic nervous system change pattern during the virtual museum exploration. The results showed that, while the direct virtualisation of a real environment might be self-reported as evoking psychological arousal, it does not necessarily evoke the same cardiovascular changes as a real arousing elicitation. These contribute to the understanding of the use of VR in emotion recognition research; future research is needed to study arousal and emotion elicitation in immersive VR."
https://openalex.org/W3175018169,"β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is an abundant multidomain plasma protein that plays various roles in the clotting and complement cascades. It is also the main target of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the acquired coagulopathy known as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Previous studies have shown that β2GPI adopts two interconvertible biochemical conformations, oxidized and reduced, depending on the integrity of the disulfide bonds. However, the precise contribution of the disulfide bonds to β2GPI structure and function is unknown. Here, we substituted cysteine residues with serine to investigate how the disulfide bonds C32-C60 in domain I (DI) and C288-C326 in domain V (DV) regulate β2GPI's structure and function. Results of our biophysical and biochemical studies support the hypothesis that the C32-C60 disulfide bond plays a structural role, whereas the disulfide bond C288-C326 is allosteric. We demonstrate that absence of the C288-C326 bond, unlike absence of the C32-C60 bond, diminishes membrane binding without affecting the thermodynamic stability and overall structure of the protein, which remains elongated in solution. We also document that, while absence of the C32-C60 bond directly impairs recognition of β2GPI by pathogenic anti-DI antibodies, absence of the C288-C326 disulfide bond is sufficient to abolish complex formation in the presence of anionic phospholipids. We conclude that the disulfide bond C288-C326 operates as a molecular switch capable of regulating β2GPI's physiological functions in a redox-dependent manner. We propose that in APS patients with anti-DI antibodies, selective rupture of the C288-C326 disulfide bond may be a valid strategy to lower the pathogenic potential of aPL."

There is a rising number of patients’ mortality in hospitals each year because of lapses in patient safety practice. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to assess knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors towards patient safety among nurses working at Asella Referral and Teaching Hospital. Methods Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted on 172 nurses working at Asella Referral and Teaching Hospital, Arsi Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. The data were collected from nurses from December 28, 2020 to January 05, 2021 by using a pretested questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.2.0.0 and analyzed using the SPSS version 23.0 software. Results A total of 172 nurses were enrolled in to the study, resulting a response rate of 99.4%. The mean age of the nurses was 32.53 years. More than half 94(54.7%) of them were female. The majority 133(77.3%) of them were qualified for degrees and above. The majority 155(90.1%) of them had working experience of ≤13years. The nurse’s level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice towards patient safety was 58.7% (n = 101, [95% CI; 51.7, 66.7]), 52.9% (n = 91, [95% CI; 43.6, 61.4]), and 50% (n = 86, [95% CI; 43.6, 57%]) respectively. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed; working in the operation theatre unit [AOR = 5.01, 95% CI; 1.36, 18.46], having information on patient safety during initial education [AOR = 4.99, 95%CI; 1.87, 13.31], and having information on patient safety during continuing education [AOR = 2.85, 95% CI; 1.14, 7.12] were factors significantly associated with knowledge towards patient safety.

Conclusion In the present study, more than half of the nurse’s had good knowledge and positive attitude towards patient safety. However, only half of the nurses had good practice towards patient safety. Educational programs and training on patient safety may need to take place for nurses to abate these problems."
https://openalex.org/W3176306418,"A finite element analysis was performed to evaluate the stresses around nails and cortical bones in subtrochanteric (ST) fracture models fixed using short cephalomedullary nails (CMNs). A total 96 finite element models (FEMs) were simulated on a transverse ST fracture at eight levels with three different fracture gaps and two different distal locking screw configurations in both normal and osteoporotic bone. All FEMs were fixed using CMNs 200 mm in length. Two distal locking screws showed a wider safe range than 1 distal screw in both normal and osteoporotic bone at fracture gaps ≤ 3 mm. In normal bone FEMs fixed even with two distal locking screws, peak von Mises stresses (PVMSs) in cortical bone and nail constructs reached or exceeded 90% of the yield strength at fracture levels 50 mm and 0 and 50 mm, respectively, at all fracture gaps. In osteoporotic bone FEMs, PVMSs in cortical bone and nail constructs reached or exceeded 90% of the yield strength at fracture levels 50 mm and 0 and 50 mm, respectively, at a 1-mm fracture gap. However, at fracture gaps ≥ 2 mm, PVMSs in cortical bone reached or exceeded 90% of the yield strength at fracture levels ≥ 35 mm. PVMSs in nail showed the same results as 1-mm fracture gaps. PVMSs increased and safe range reduced, as the fracture gap increased. Short CMNs (200 mm in length) with two distal screws may be considered suitable for the fixation of ST transverse fractures at fracture levels 10 to 40 mm below the lesser trochanter in normal bone and 10 to 30 mm in osteoporotic bone, respectively, under the assumptions of anatomical reduction at fracture gap ≤ 3 mm. However, the fracture gap should be shortened to the minimum to reduce the risk of refracture and fixation failure, especially in osteoporotic fractures."

https://openalex.org/W3177035356,"Cancer cells show increases in protein degradation pathways, including autophagy, during progression to meet the increased protein degradation demand and support cell survival. On the other hand, reduced autophagy activity during aging is associated with a reduced DNA damage response and increased genomic instability. Therefore, it is a puzzling how DNA repair can be increased in cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapies or during progression when autophagy activity is intact or increased. We discovered that tripartite motif containing 44 (TRIM44) is a pivotal element regulating the DNA damage response in cancer cells with intact autophagy. TRIM44 deubiquitinates p62, an autophagy substrate, which leads to its oligomerization. This prevents p62 localization to the nucleus upon irradiation. Increased cytoplasmic retention of p62 by TRIM44 prevents the degradation of FLNA and 53BP1, which increases DNA damage repair. Together, our data support TRIM44 a potential therapeutic target for therapy-resistant tumor cells with intact autophagy."

ERPs, brain sources and their relationship with IU scores were analyzed for each stage. IU did not affect prediction generation . During prediction implementation , higher IU predicted larger Contingent Negative Variation in the 75% block, and lower left anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area activations. During prediction updating , as IU increased P2 to positive S2s decreased, along with P2 and Late Positive Potential in the 75% block, and right orbito-frontal cortex activity to emotional S2s. IU was therefore associated with altered uncertainty assessment and heightened attention deployment during implementation , and to uncertainty avoidance, reduced attention to safety cues and disrupted access to emotion regulation strategies during prediction updating ."
https://openalex.org/W3175720229,"Estimates of the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events (residual risk) among patients with acute coronary syndromes have largely been based on clinical trial populations. Our objective was to estimate the residual risk associated with common comorbidities in a large, unselected, population-based cohort of acute coronary syndrome patients. 31,056 ACS patients (49.5%—non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], 34.0%—ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and 16.5%—unstable angina [UA]) hospitalised in Alberta between April 2010 and March 2016 were included. The primary composite outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including: death, stroke or recurrent myocardial infarction. The secondary outcome was death from any cause. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to identify the impact of ACS type and commonly observed comorbidities (heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes). At 3.0 +/- 3.7 years, rates of MACE were highest in the NSTEMI population followed by STEMI and UA (3.58, 2.41 and 1.68 per 10,000 person years respectively). Mortality was also highest in the NSTEMI population followed by STEMI and UA (2.23, 1.38 and 0.95 per 10,000 person years respectively). Increased burden of comorbidities was associated with an increased risk of MACE, most prominently seen with heart failure (adjusted HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.73–1.93), renal disease (adjusted HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.40–1.65) and diabetes (adjusted HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.44–1.59). The cumulative presence of each of examined comorbidities was associated with an incremental increase in the rate of MACE ranging from 1.7 to 9.98 per 10,000 person years. Rates of secondary prevention medications at discharge were high including: statin (89.5%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (84.1%) and beta-blockers (85.9%). Residual cardiovascular risk following an acute coronary syndrome remains high despite advances in secondary prevention. A higher burden of comorbidities is associated with increased residual risk that may benefit from aggressive or novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3173906799,"Protein kinase C-delta (PKCδ) has a caspase-3 recognition sequence in its structure, suggesting its involvement in apoptosis. In addition, PKCδ was recently reported to function as an anti-cancer factor. The generation of a PKCδ knockout mouse model indicated that PKCδ plays a role in B cell homeostasis. However, the Pkcrd gene, which is regulated through complex transcription, produces multiple proteins via alternative splicing. Since gene mutations can result in the loss of function of molecular species required for each tissue, in the present study, conditional PKCδ knockout mice lacking PKCδI, II, IV, V, VI, and VII were generated to enable tissue-specific deletion of PKCδ using a suitable Cre mouse. We generated PKCδ-null mice that lacked whole-body expression of PKCδ. PKCδ+/- parental mice gave birth to only 3.4% PKCδ-/- offsprings that deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian ratio (χ2(2) = 101.7, P < 0.001). Examination of mice on embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) showed the proportion of PKCδ-/- mice implanted in the uterus in accordance with Mendelian rules; however, approximately 70% of the fetuses did not survive at E11.5. PKCδ-/- mice that survived until adulthood showed enlarged spleens, with some having cardiac and pulmonary abnormalities. Our findings suggest that the lack of PKCδ may have harmful effects on fetal development, and heart and lung functions after birth. Furthermore, our study provides a reference for future studies on PKCδ deficient mice that would elucidate the effects of the multiple protein variants in mice and decipher the roles of PKCδ in various diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3174112674,"Development of a simple, rapid and specific assay for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. based on duplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (d-LAMP), combined with lateral-flow biosensor (LFB) is reported herein. LAMP amplicons of both pathogens were simultaneously amplified and specifically differentiated by LFB. The specificity of the d-LAMP-LFB was evaluated using a set of 68 target and 12 non-target strains, showing 100% inclusivity and exclusivity. The assay can simultaneously detect Campylobacter and Salmonella strains as low as 1 ng and 100 pg genomic DNA per reaction, respectively. The lowest inoculated detection limits for Campylobacter and Salmonella species in artificially contaminated chicken meat samples were 10 3 CFU and 1 CFU per 25 grams, respectively, after enrichment for 24 h. Furthermore, compared to culture-based methods using field chicken meat samples, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of d-LAMP- LFB were 95.6% (95% CI, 78.0%-99.8%), 71.4% (95% CI, 29.0%-96.3%) and 90.0% (95% CI, 73.4%-97.8%), respectively. The developed d-LAMP-LFB assay herein shows great potentials for the simultaneous detection of the Campylobacter and Salmonella spp. and poses a promising alternative approach for detection of both pathogens with applications in food products."
https://openalex.org/W3175331389,"Introduction Uterine leiomyoma (UL) is a common benign pelvic tumor in women that has a high recurrence rate. Our aim is to propose a prognostic index (PI) model for predicting the long-term recurrence risk of uterine leiomyoma (UL). Methods A total of 725 women who underwent myomectomy were enrolled in this retrospective multicenter study. Patients were contacted for follow-up. A PI model was proposed based on the multivariate Cox regression analysis in the model group. The predictive value of this model was tested in both internal and external validation group. Results PI formula = 1.5(if 3–5 leiomyomas) or 2(if &gt;5 leiomyomas)+1(if residue)+1(if not submucosal)+1(if combined endometriosis). The PI value was divided into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk group by cut-off values 1.25 and 3.75. In the model group, the high-risk group had a significantly 4.55 times greater recurrence risk of UL than that in the low-risk group [cumulative recurrence rate (CR): 82.1% vs 29.5%, HR = 4.55, 95% CI 2.821–7.339]; the intermediate-risk group had a significantly 2.81 times greater recurrence risk of UL than that in the low-risk group (CR: 62.3% vs 29.5%, HR = 2.81, 95% CI 2.035–3.878). The differences between any two risk groups were also significant ( P &lt; 0.05) in both internal and external validation groups. Conclusion The model was proved to be effective in predicting recurrence of UL after myomectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3176718872,"‘Mexical’ scrubland is a sclerophyllous evergreen Mediterranean-like vegetation occurring in the leeward slopes of the main Mexican mountain ranges, under tropical climate. This biome occupies an elevational range approximately from 1900 to 2600 meters above sea level, which frequently is the upper-most part of the mountains range. This puts it at risk of extinction in a scenario of global warming in which an upward retraction of this type of vegetation is expected. The Mexical remains one of the least studied ecosystems in Mexico. For instance, nothing is known about pollinator fauna of this vegetation. Our main objective is to make a first insight into the taxonomic identity of the bee fauna that inhabits this biome, and to study how it is distributed along the elevational gradient that it occupies. Our results highlight that elevation gradient negatively affects bee species richness and that this relationship is strongly mediated by temperature. Bee abundance had no significant pattern along elevational gradient, but shows a significant relationship with flower density. Interestingly, and contrary to previous works, we obtained a different pattern for bee richness and bee abundance. Bee community composition changed strongly along elevation gradient, mainly in relation to temperature and flower density. In a global warming scenario, as temperatures increases, species with cold preferences, occupying the highest part of the elevation gradient, are likely to suffer negative consequences (even extinction risk), if they are not flexible enough to adjust their physiology and/or some life-story traits to warmer conditions. Species occupying mid and lower elevations are likely to extend their range of elevational distribution towards higher ranges. This will foreseeably cause a new composition of species and a new scenario of interactions, the adjustment of which still leaves many unknowns to solve."
https://openalex.org/W3173500914,"Housing affects an individual's physical and mental health, particularly among people who use substances. Understanding the association between individual characteristics and housing status can inform housing policy and help optimize the care of people who use drugs. The objective of this study was to explore the factors associated with unstable housing among people who use drugs in Ottawa.This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from 782 participants in the Participatory Research in Ottawa: Understanding Drugs (PROUD) Study. PROUD is a prospective cohort study of people who use drugs in Ottawa. Between March and December 2013, participants were recruited through peer-based recruitment on the streets and in social services settings and completed a peer-administered questionnaire that explored socio-demographic information, drug use patterns, community integration, experiences with police and incarceration, and access to health care and harm reduction services. Eligibility criteria included age of 16 years or older, self-reported illicit drug use within the past 12 months and having lived in Ottawa for at least 3 months. Housing status was determined by self-report. ""Stable housing"" was defined as residence in a house or apartment and ""unstable housing"" was defined as all other residence types. Exploratory multivariable logistic regression analyses of the association between characteristics of people who use drugs and their housing status were conducted.Factors that were associated with unstable housing included: recent incarceration; not having a regular doctor; not having received support from a peer worker; low monthly income; income source other than public disability support payments; and younger age. Gender, language, ethnicity, education level, opioid use and injection drug use were not independently associated with housing status.People who use drugs face significant barriers to stable housing. These results highlight key areas to address in order to improve housing stability among this community."

https://openalex.org/W3176924645,"Background/Aims Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is diagnosed by the presence of antibody to HCV and/or HCV RNA. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of anti-HCV titer (S/CO ratio) in predicting HCV viremia in patients with or without hepatitis B virus (HBV) dual infection. Methods Anti-HCV seropositive patients who were treatment-naïve consecutively enrolled. Anti-HCV antibodies were detected using a commercially chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. HCV RNA was detected by real-time PCR method. Results A total of 1321 including1196 mono-infected and 125 HBV dually infected patients were analyzed. The best cut-off value of anti-HCV titer in predicting HCV viremia was 9.95 (AUROC 0.99, P&lt;0.0001). Of the entire cohort, the anti-HCV cut-off value of 10 provided the best accuracy, 96.8%, with the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.3%, 98.9%, 99.7% and 87.3% respectively. The best cut-off value of anti-HCV titer in predicting HCV viremia was 9.95 (AUROC 0.99, P&lt;0.0001) and 9.36 (AUROC 1.00, P&lt;0.0001) in patients with HCV mono-infection and HBV dual-infection respectively. Among the HBV dually infected patients, the accuracy of anti-HCV titer in predicting HCV viremia reached up to 100% with the cut-off value of 9. All the patients were HCV-viremic if their anti-HCV titer was greater than 9 (PPV 100%). On the other hand, all the patients were HCV non-viremic if their anti-HCV titer was less than 9 (NPV 100%). Conclusions Anti-HCV titer strongly predicted HCV viremia. This excellent performance could be generalized to either HCV mono-infected or HBV dually infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W3177269422,"Objective Accumulating evidence suggests the possibility that early life exposures may contribute to risk of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This paper explores geographic disparities in AD mortality based on both state of residence in older age as well as state of birth measures in order to assess the relative importance of these factors. Methods We use a subset of a large survey, the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, of over 150,000 individuals aged 65–70 with 15 years of mortality follow-up, allowing us to study over 1050 cases of AD mortality. We use multi-level logistic regression, where individuals are nested within states of residence and/or states of birth, to assess the contributions of place to AD mortality variation. Results We show that state of birth explains a modest amount of variation in AD mortality, approximately 4%, which is consistent with life course theories that suggest that early life conditions can produce old age health disparities. However, we also show that nearly all of the variation from state of birth is explained by state of residence in old age. Conclusions These results suggest that later life factors are potentially more consequential targets for intervention in reducing AD mortality and provide some evidence against the importance of macro-level environmental exposures at birth as a core determinant of later AD."
https://openalex.org/W3173657070,"Maternal and newborn infections are important causes of mortality but morbidity data from low- and middle-income countries is limited. We used telephone surveillance to estimate infection incidence and risk factors in women and newborns following hospital childbirth in Dar es Salaam.We recruited postnatal women from two tertiary hospitals and conducted telephone interviews 7 and 28 days after delivery. Maternal infection (endometritis, caesarean or perineal wound, or urinary tract infection) and newborn infection (umbilical cord or possible severe bacterial infection) were identified using hospital case-notes at the time of birth and self-reported symptoms. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess the association between potential risk-factors and infection.We recruited 879 women and interviewed 791 (90%). From day 0-7, 6.7% (49/791) women and 6.2% (51/762) newborns developed infection. Using full follow-up data, the infection rate was higher in women with caesarean childbirth versus women with a vaginal delivery (aHR 1.93, 95%CI 1.11-3.36). Only 24% of women received pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis before caesarean section. Infection was higher in newborns resuscitated at birth versus newborns who were not resuscitated (aHR 4.45, 95%CI 2.10-9.44). At interview, 66% (37/56) of women and 88% (72/82) of newborns with possible infection had sought health-facility care.Telephone surveillance identified a substantial risk of postnatal infection, including cases likely to have been missed by hospital-based data-collection alone. Risk of maternal endometritis and newborn possible severe bacterial infection were consistent with other studies. Caesarean section was the most important risk-factor for maternal infection. Improved implementation of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis is urgently required to mitigate this risk."
https://openalex.org/W3175874585,"Objectives To assess kinematic parameters and proximal and distal reaching adjustments of infants at biological or environmental risk and compare with reaching performance of six-month-old full-term infants without known risk factors. Methods This blinded cross-sectional study included 62 infants at six months of age divided into three independent groups: Group with no known risk factor (NRF), 28 full-terms with no risk factors; Low SES group (LSES):19 full-terms classified as low socioeconomic status and no biological risk; Very preterm group (VPT), 15 very preterm infants at six months corrected age and no environmental risk. Infants were placed in a reclined baby chair at 45°, and a malleable and unfamiliar object was presented to the infant at 5-second intervals to elicit reaching movements. Results Infants from LSES presented reaching duration (p = 0.032, Cohen’s f = 0.349) and movement unit (p = 0.033, Cohen’s f = 0.351) significantly higher than VPT group. Horizontal hand orientation was moderately associated with infants at environmental risk (p = 0.031; Cramer’s V = 0.30). Conclusion Infants of low socioeconomic status perform less functional reaching movements than very preterm infants at six months corrected age. Socioeconomic status may impact more on reaching skills than biological risk. Given the importance of reaching for infant development, low-cost public health strategies are needed to identify possible delays."
https://openalex.org/W3177203387,"Background Managing HIV infection as a chronic condition includes encouraging adoption of healthy behaviors and promotion of physical activity (PA). However, people living with HIV (PLH) are often under social and programmatic vulnerability that may compromise behavior change. Understanding such barriers is crucial for successful incorporation of PA in their comprehensive care. Methods and findings In this study, we describe PA, energy intake from diet, and anthropometry of a cohort of PLH starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a Brazilian reference clinic, report how PA was addressed in routine care and investigate association between PA, energy intake and psychosocial constructs that may facilitate PA (social support and self-efficacy for PA). Among 61 PLH (86.9% males, mean age = 32.5 years) anthropometry was normal, but 47.5% reported PA below recommendations. Despite presenting high social support scores, family encouragement for PA was low, and self-efficacy classified as medium. Chart reviews yielded infrequent reports concerning PA. After adjusting for gender and age, we found a negative association between energy intake from diet and self-efficacy, but none between PA and energy intake or between PA and psychosocial constructs. Conclusions We conclude that patients in our cohort were insufficiently active when starting ART, and that PA was poorly addressed by caretakers in routine HIV care. Nevertheless, social support and self-efficacy scores suggest potential for behavioral change. Caregivers should therefore start considering patients’ vulnerabilities and establishing strategies to help them overcome barriers to incorporate PA in their comprehensive care effectively."

https://openalex.org/W3176705797,"The paper reports the results of a study into the use of linguistic cues defined as Persuasive Linguistic Tricks (PLT) in social media (SM) marketing communication. It was assumed that the content shared on Social Networking Sites (SNS) could be perceived as specific sets of meanings (memeplexes), where a single component, also PLT, may function as their part. Following an original typology of PLT, created based on an emotional factor, the research focused on whether and how the number of positive, neutral and negative PLT used in Facebook posts impacted the behaviour of content recipients. These activities, including liking, commenting and sharing, are strictly connected with post spreading and range. The data analysis focused on 167 Facebook posts shared by five leading Polish travel agencies and 1911 responding comments. The quantitative content analysis method and Spearman’s correlation tests were used. A relationship was observed between the number of emotionally positive and neutral PLT and the increase in the range of content with these PLT. The use of PLT by post recipients was also observed in their comments. This phenomenon is possibly related to the memetic nature of PLT. From the perspective of marketing messages, the obtained results contribute to and guide the textual content-building with a high spreading potential owing to the memetic capability of PLT. Further elaborations were made on the assumption for the evolutionary approach in social media content transfer and its processing."
https://openalex.org/W3176713880,"Those experiencing hearing loss face severe challenges in perceiving speech in noisy situations such as a busy restaurant or cafe. There are many factors contributing to this deficit including decreased audibility, reduced frequency resolution, and decline in temporal synchrony across the auditory system. Some hearing assistive devices implement beamforming in which multiple microphones are used in combination to attenuate surrounding noise while the target speaker is left unattenuated. In increasingly challenging auditory environments, more complex beamforming algorithms are required, which increases the processing time needed to provide a useful signal-to-noise ratio of the target speech. This study investigated whether the benefits from signal enhancement from beamforming are outweighed by the negative impacts on perception from an increase in latency between the direct acoustic signal and the digitally enhanced signal. The hypothesis for this study is that an increase in latency between the two identical speech signals would decrease intelligibility of the speech signal. Using 3 gain / latency pairs from a beamforming simulation previously completed in lab, perceptual thresholds of SNR from a simulated use case were obtained from normal hearing participants. No significant differences were detected between the 3 conditions. When presented with 2 copies of the same speech signal presented at varying gain / latency pairs in a noisy environment, any negative intelligibility effects from latency are masked by the noise. These results allow for more lenient restrictions for limiting processing delays in hearing assistive devices."
