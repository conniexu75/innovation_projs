https://openalex.org/W2007987850,"Mice repopulated with human hematopoietic cells are a powerful tool for the study of human hematopoiesis and immune function in vivo. However, existing humanized mouse models cannot support development of human innate immune cells, including myeloid cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Here we describe two mouse strains called MITRG and MISTRG, in which human versions of four genes encoding cytokines important for innate immune cell development are knocked into their respective mouse loci. The human cytokines support the development and function of monocytes, macrophages and NK cells derived from human fetal liver or adult CD34(+) progenitor cells injected into the mice. Human macrophages infiltrated a human tumor xenograft in MITRG and MISTRG mice in a manner resembling that observed in tumors obtained from human patients. This humanized mouse model may be used to model the human immune system in scenarios of health and pathology, and may enable evaluation of therapeutic candidates in an in vivo setting relevant to human physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2121302141,"The ‘tubulin-code’ hypothesis proposes that different tubulin genes or post-translational modifications (PTMs), which mainly confer variation in the carboxy-terminal tail (CTT), result in unique interactions with microtubule-associated proteins for specific cellular functions. However, the inability to isolate distinct and homogeneous tubulin species has hindered biochemical testing of this hypothesis. Here, we have engineered 25 α/β-tubulin heterodimers with distinct CTTs and PTMs and tested their interactions with four different molecular motors using single-molecule assays. Our results show that tubulin isotypes and PTMs can govern motor velocity, processivity and microtubule depolymerization rates, with substantial changes conferred by even single amino acid variation. Revealing the importance and specificity of PTMs, we show that kinesin-1 motility on neuronal β-tubulin (TUBB3) is increased by polyglutamylation and that robust kinesin-2 motility requires detyrosination of α-tubulin. Our results also show that different molecular motors recognize distinctive tubulin ‘signatures’, which supports the premise of the tubulin-code hypothesis. Vale and colleagues report the distinct abilities of different tubulin isotypes and post-translational modifications to regulate different microtubule motors and their properties."

Nevertheless, the fundamental molecular mechanisms through which altered mechanics regulate tissue behavior and the clinical relevance of these changes remain unclear. We demonstrate that increased matrix stiffness modulates microRNA expression to drive tumor progression through integrin activation of β-catenin and MYC. Specifically, in human and mouse tissue, increased matrix stiffness induced miR-18a to reduce levels of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), both directly and indirectly by decreasing levels of homeobox A9 (HOXA9). Clinically, extracellular matrix stiffness correlated directly and significantly with miR-18a expression in human breast tumor biopsies. miR-18a expression was highest in basal-like breast cancers in which PTEN and HOXA9 levels were lowest, and high miR-18a expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with luminal breast cancers. Our findings identify a mechanically regulated microRNA circuit that can promote malignancy and suggest potential prognostic roles for HOXA9 and miR-18a levels in stratifying patients with luminal breast cancers."

https://openalex.org/W1983035953,"Angiosarcoma is an aggressive malignancy that arises spontaneously or secondarily to ionizing radiation or chronic lymphoedema. Previous work has identified aberrant angiogenesis, including occasional somatic mutations in angiogenesis signaling genes, as a key driver of angiosarcoma. Here we employed whole-genome, whole-exome and targeted sequencing to study the somatic changes underpinning primary and secondary angiosarcoma. We identified recurrent mutations in two genes, PTPRB and PLCG1, which are intimately linked to angiogenesis. The endothelial phosphatase PTPRB, a negative regulator of vascular growth factor tyrosine kinases, harbored predominantly truncating mutations in 10 of 39 tumors (26%). PLCG1, a signal transducer of tyrosine kinases, encoded a recurrent, likely activating p.Arg707Gln missense variant in 3 of 34 cases (9%). Overall, 15 of 39 tumors (38%) harbored at least one driver mutation in angiogenesis signaling genes. Our findings inform and reinforce current therapeutic efforts to target angiogenesis signaling in angiosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W1986219467,"Cristen Willer, Kristian Hveem and colleagues use an exome array to identify a coding variant in TM6SF2 that is associated with total cholesterol levels. They further show that transient overexpression of TM6SF2 or knockdown of Tm6sf2 in mice alters serum lipid profiles, implicating TM6SF2 as a causal regulator of lipid traits. Blood lipid levels are heritable, treatable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We systematically assessed genome-wide coding variation to identify new genes influencing lipid traits, fine map known lipid loci and evaluate whether low-frequency variants with large effects exist for these traits. Using an exome array, we genotyped 80,137 coding variants in 5,643 Norwegians. We followed up 18 variants in 4,666 Norwegians and identified ten loci with coding variants associated with a lipid trait (P < 5 × 10−8). One variant in TM6SF2 (encoding p.Glu167Lys), residing in a known genome-wide association study locus for lipid traits, influences total cholesterol levels and is associated with myocardial infarction. Transient TM6SF2 overexpression or knockdown of Tm6sf2 in mice alters serum lipid profiles, consistent with the association observed in humans, identifying TM6SF2 as a functional gene within a locus previously known as NCAN-CILP2-PBX4 or 19p13. This study demonstrates that systematic assessment of coding variation can quickly point to a candidate causal gene."
https://openalex.org/W2005281689,"Biophysical analysis reveals that conserved G-rich sequences within the mRNAs of gammaherpesvirus genome maintenance proteins (GMPs) form G-quadruplexes (G4). Stabilization of mRNA G4 motifs represses GMP translation, whereas destabilization enhances translation, suggesting that these RNA elements are cis-acting translational regulators of proteins involved in viral latency. Viruses that establish latent infections have evolved unique mechanisms to avoid host immune recognition. Maintenance proteins of these viruses regulate their synthesis to levels sufficient for maintaining persistent infection but below threshold levels for host immune detection. The mechanisms governing this finely tuned regulation of viral latency are unknown. Here we show that mRNAs encoding gammaherpesviral maintenance proteins contain within their open reading frames clusters of unusual structural elements, G-quadruplexes, which are responsible for the cis-acting regulation of viral mRNA translation. By studying the Epstein-Barr virus–encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) mRNA, we demonstrate that destabilization of G-quadruplexes using antisense oligonucleotides increases EBNA1 mRNA translation. In contrast, pretreatment with a G-quadruplex–stabilizing small molecule, pyridostatin, decreases EBNA1 synthesis, highlighting the importance of G-quadruplexes within virally encoded transcripts as unique regulatory signals for translational control and immune evasion. Furthermore, these findings suggest alternative therapeutic strategies focused on targeting RNA structure within viral ORFs."

https://openalex.org/W2164469233,"Apoptotic cell death is a hallmark of the loss of insulin-producing beta cells in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Current treatments fail to halt the decline in functional beta cell mass, and strategies to prevent beta cell apoptosis and dysfunction are urgently needed. Here, we identified mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (MST1) as a critical regulator of apoptotic beta cell death and function. Under diabetogenic conditions, MST1 was strongly activated in beta cells in human and mouse islets and specifically induced the mitochondrial-dependent pathway of apoptosis through upregulation of the BCL-2 homology-3 (BH3)-only protein BIM. MST1 directly phosphorylated the beta cell transcription factor PDX1 at T11, resulting in the latter's ubiquitination and degradation and thus in impaired insulin secretion. MST1 deficiency completely restored normoglycemia, beta cell function and survival in vitro and in vivo. We show MST1 as a proapoptotic kinase and key mediator of apoptotic signaling and beta cell dysfunction and suggest that it may serve as target for the development of new therapies for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2140674483,"If immunized with an antigen of interest, transgenic mice with large portions of unrearranged human immunoglobulin loci can produce fully human antigen-specific antibodies; several such antibodies are in clinical use. However, technical limitations inherent to conventional transgenic technology and sequence divergence between the human and mouse immunoglobulin constant regions limit the utility of these mice. Here, using repetitive cycles of genome engineering in embryonic stem cells, we have inserted the entire human immunoglobulin variable-gene repertoire (2.7 Mb) into the mouse genome, leaving the mouse constant regions intact. These transgenic mice are viable and fertile, with an immune system resembling that of wild-type mice. Antigen immunization results in production of high-affinity antibodies with long human-like complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3H), broad epitope coverage and strong signatures of somatic hypermutation. These mice provide a robust system for the discovery of therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies; as a surrogate readout of the human antibody response, they may also aid vaccine design efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2007010532,"PRDM9 (PR domain-containing protein 9) is a meiosis-specific protein that trimethylates H3K4 and controls the activation of recombination hot spots. It is an essential enzyme in the progression of early meiotic prophase. Disruption of the PRDM9 gene results in sterility in mice. In human, several PRDM9 SNPs have been implicated in sterility as well. Here we report on kinetic studies of H3K4 methylation by PRDM9 in vitro indicating that PRDM9 is a highly active histone methyltransferase catalyzing mono-, di-, and trimethylation of the H3K4 mark. Screening for other potential histone marks, we identified H3K36 as a second histone residue that could also be mono-, di-, and trimethylated by PRDM9 as efficiently as H3K4. Overexpression of PRDM9 in HEK293 cells also resulted in a significant increase in trimethylated H3K36 and H3K4 further confirming our in vitro observations. Our findings indicate that PRDM9 may play critical roles through H3K36 trimethylation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061942838,"A method for high-throughput functional testing of 3′ UTR sequences uncovers new regulatory elements and effects of noncoding genetic variants. Functional characterization of noncoding sequences is crucial for understanding the human genome and learning how genetic variation contributes to disease. 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) are an important class of noncoding sequences, but their functions remain largely uncharacterized1. We developed a method for massively parallel functional annotation of sequences from 3′ UTRs (fast-UTR) and used this approach to measure the effects of a total of >450 kilobases of 3′ UTR sequences from >2,000 human genes on steady-state mRNA abundance, mRNA stability and protein production. We found widespread regulatory effects on mRNA that were coupled to effects on mRNA stability and protein production. Furthermore, we discovered 87 novel cis-regulatory elements and measured the effects of genetic variation within known and novel 3′ UTR motifs. This work shows how massively parallel approaches can improve the functional annotation of noncoding sequences, advance our understanding of cis-regulatory mechanisms and quantify the effects of human genetic variation."

Here we characterize a Cas9 ortholog from Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 (LMG18311 Cas9). In vitro reconstitution of this system confirms that LMG18311 Cas9 together with a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA) and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) cleaves double-stranded DNA with a specificity dictated by the sequence of the crRNA. Cleavage requires not only complementarity between crRNA and target but also the presence of a short motif called the PAM. Here we determine the sequence requirements of the PAM for LMG18311 Cas9.

During invasion, small fragments of the invading DNA from phage or plasmids (protospacers) are incorporated into host CRISPR loci, transcribed, and processed to generate small CRISPR RNAs (crRNA). The invading nucleic acid is then recognized and silenced by Cas proteins guided by the crRNAs. There are three types of CRISPR-Cas system each characterized by the presence of a signature gene (22Makarova K.S. Haft D.H. Barrangou R. Brouns S.J.J. Charpentier E. Horvath P. Moineau S.

Programmed DNA cleavage requires the fewest components in the type II CRISPR-Cas system, requiring only crRNA, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), and the Cas9 endonuclease (23Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E.

The system can be further simplified by fusing the mature crRNA and tracrRNA into a single guide RNA (sgRNA) (23Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9327) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in target cleavage, tracrRNA also mediates crRNA maturation by forming RNA hybrids with primary crRNA transcripts, leading to co-processing of both RNAs by endogenous RNase III (25Deltcheva E. Chylinski K. Sharma C.M. Gonzales K. Chao Y. Pirzada Z.A. Eckert M.R. Vogel J. Charpentier E. CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III.Nature. 2011; 471: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Cas9 contains two nuclease domains that together generate a double-strand (ds) break in target DNA. The HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, and the RuvC-like nuclease domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand (23Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E.

A short signature sequence, named the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), is characteristic of the invading DNA targeted by the type I and type II CRISPR-Cas systems. The PAM serves two functions. It has been linked to the acquisition of new spacer sequences, and it is necessary for the subsequent recognition and silencing of target DNA, reviewed in Ref. 26Shah S.A. Erdmann S. Mojica F.J.M. Garrett R.A. Protospacer recognition motifs: mixed identities and functional diversity.RNA Biol. 2013; 10: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar. The sequence, length, and position of the PAM vary depending on the CRISPR-Cas type and organism. PAMs from type II systems are located downstream of the protospacer and contain 2–5 bp of conserved sequence. A variable sequence, of up to 4 bp, separates the conserved sequence of the PAM from the protospacer. This variable region is often included in the definition of the PAM sequence, but for simplicity, we refer to this variable region as the linker and the conserved sequence as the PAM. To date, Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, Cas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710, and Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis have been employed as tools for genome editing or regulation. For these Cas9 orthologs, the PAMs are GG, GGNG, and GATT, and the linkers are 1, 1, and 4 bp, respectively (23Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E.

The simplicity of sgRNA design and sequence-specific targeting means the RNA-guided Cas9 machinery has great potential for programmable genome engineering. Cas9 can be employed to generate mutations in cells by introducing dsDNA breaks. The capabilities of Cas9 can be expanded to various genome engineering purposes, such as transcription repression or activation, with its nickase (generated by inactivating one of its two nuclease domains) or nuclease null variants (15Qi L.S.

Church G.M. Cas9 as a versatile tool for engineering biology.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Another appealing possibility for the Cas9 system is to target different Cas9-mediated activities to multiple target sites, for example transcriptional repression of one gene but activation of another (30Esvelt K.M. Mali P. Braff J.L. Moosburner M. Yaung S.J. Church G.M. Orthogonal Cas9 proteins for RNA-guided gene regulation and editing.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To achieve this, multiple Cas9 orthologs will need to be employed as a single ortholog cannot concurrently mediate different activities at multiple sites (30Esvelt K.M. Mali P. Braff J.L. Moosburner M. Yaung S.J. Church G.M. Orthogonal Cas9 proteins for RNA-guided gene regulation and editing.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Therefore to broaden our understanding of Cas9 proteins, we have characterized the Cas9 ortholog from S. thermophilus LMG18311, which we refer to as LMG18311 Cas9. We chose to investigate Cas9 from this organism not only to increase the repertoire of Cas9 orthologs but also because it utilizes a PAM distinct from those previously characterized and its small gene size is compatible with the standard viral vectors used for delivery into exogenous systems in vivo (30Esvelt K.M. Mali P. Braff J.L. Moosburner M. Yaung S.J. Church G.M. Orthogonal Cas9 proteins for RNA-guided gene regulation and editing.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that requirements for DNA cleavage in vitro and in vivo by LMG18311 Cas9 are the same as other Cas9 orthologs. We also reveal the sequence and linker length requirements of the PAM for LMG18311 Cas9. Finally, we show that the HNH and RuvC-like nuclease domains of Cas9 select the location of their cleavage sites via different mechanisms. The HNH domain catalyzes cleavage of the complementary strand at a fixed position, whereas the RuvC-like domain catalyzes cleavage of the noncomplementary strand using a ruler mechanism. Natural target sequences were found using the program BLAST. A single mismatch was allowed between the spacer and target sequences. Allowing more mismatches did not increase the number of sequences found. Sequences were considered unique if they were from distinct target genomes. The sequence encoding full-length Cas9 was PCR-amplified from S. thermophilus LMG18311 genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection) and inserted into the pMAT expression vector (31Peränen J.

To generate plasmid targets and RNA encoding vectors, synthetic oligonucleotides, bearing the appropriate sequence, were annealed and ligated into the pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen), pRSFDuet-1 (Novagen), or pMK (GeneArt). Primers and oligonucleotides are listed in Table 1. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Primers and oligonucleotides used in these studies Open table in a new tab Cas9 was overexpressed in T7Express Escherichia coli (New England Biolabs). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin to an A600 of ∼0.3. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm iso-propyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. For purification, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysed by French press. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm at 4 °C for 45 min, and the supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml immobilized metal chromatography column (Bio-Rad) charged with nickel sulfate. The column was washed with lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The elution was run on a HiLoad 26/60 S200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with gel-filtration buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl). Fractions containing His6-MBP tagged Cas9 were collected and treated with tobacco etch virus protease overnight at 4 °C to remove the His6-MBP tag. Samples were reapplied to immobilized metal affinity chromatography resin to remove the His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease, free His6-MBP, and any remaining tagged protein. The flow-through was collected, concentrated using an Ultracel 10K centrifugal filter unit (Millipore), and further purified by size exclusion chromatography in gel-filtration buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The final fractions containing Cas9 were concentrated to ∼16 mg/ml. Purified proteins were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (see Fig. 1A). The mutant variants of Cas9 were expressed and purified in the same manner as the wild-type protein (see Fig. 1A). RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. Plasmid templates were linearized overnight with EcoRI and then purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 0.5 μg of linear plasmid template was incubated with 0.1 mg/ml T7 RNA polymerase and 5 mm each of CTP, GTP, ATP, and UTP in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 40 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 3 h. RNA transcripts were then gel-purified. The recipient cells were prepared by co-transforming E. coli BL21 (DE3) with plasmids encoding Cas9 (pMAT) and sgRNA (pRSFDuet-1) or empty vectors. All plasmids, including the targets, had unique selection markers and origins of replication. The transformation assay was performed using the CaCl2 heat-shock procedure described in Ref. 33Sapranauskas R. Gasiunas G. Fremaux C. Barrangou R. Horvath P. Siksnys V.

The recipient cells were transformed with 5 ng of plasmid DNA and recovered in LB medium containing 0.2 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 1 h and plated on LB agar containing appropriate antibiotics and 0.2 mm IPTG. Reported transformation efficiencies are the average of at least three biological replicates. All target plasmids used in this study transformed into control recipient cells with the same efficiency (∼200 colony-forming units per 5 ng of DNA). Cas9 (25 nm), tracrRNA (25 nm), and crRNA (25 nm) were incubated in a cleavage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were initiated by adding plasmid targets (4 nm), incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and quenched with phenol. The aqueous layer was extracted and separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. Gels were stained by soaking in 1× Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer supplemented with 5 μg/μl ethidium bromide for 1 h and then for a further hour in 1× Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer. Bands were visualized using an FLA-7000 (Fuji) and quantified with ImageGauge (Fuji). To account for the different binding affinity of ethidium bromide to linear and supercoiled DNA, control samples with equal amounts of DNA in both forms were loaded on the same gel. The ratios of the fluorescence intensities of linear and supercoiled bands were measured and used to calculate a correlation coefficient K (34Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Strand breaks in whole plasmid DNA produced by the decay of 125I in a triplex-forming oligonucleotide.Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), K=ISCILin(Eq. 1) where ILin and Isc are the intensities of the linear and supercoiled bands, respectively. In our case, K was determined to be 0.4 ± 0.05 and did not vary significantly between experiments. The percentage of linear product was then calculated as follows (34Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Strand breaks in whole plasmid DNA produced by the decay of 125I in a triplex-forming oligonucleotide.Radiat.

Percentage Linear=ILinISCK+ILin×100(Eq. 2) DNA oligonucleotides were purified on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. dsDNA targets (Table 1) were made by annealing each strand and purified on 12% native polyacrylamide gels containing 1× Tris-borate-EDTA. dsDNA were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). A fixed concentration (10–100 pm) of labeled dsDNA targets was mixed with an increasing concentration of premixed Cas9D9A,H599A-sgRNA complex. Binding assays, performed in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10% glycerol), were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by separation on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. Gels were visualized by phosphorimaging (Fuji) and quantified with ImageGauge (Fuji). Fraction of DNA bound was plotted versus concentration of Cas9, and data were fit to a one-site binding isotherm using GraphPad Prism software. Reported Kd values are the average of at least three replicates. The genome of S. thermophilus LMG18311 contains two CRISPR-Cas systems, of type II-A and III-A, each associated with a CRISPR loci: CRISPR-1 and CRISPR-2, respectively. The first study of PAM sequences identified a putative PAM for S. thermophilus as RYAAA (where R is a purine and Y is a pyrimidine) (19Bolotin A. Quinquis B. Sorokin A. Ehrlich S.D. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). This sequence was found in natural target sequences matching 41 spacers collected from 13 different S. thermophilus strains, including LMG18311. Subsequent studies showed that PAM sequences vary greatly, even between different strains (reviewed in Ref. 26Shah S.A. Erdmann S. Mojica F.J.M. Garrett R.A. Protospacer recognition motifs: mixed identities and functional diversity.RNA Biol. 2013; 10: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore to confirm the PAM sequence for LMG18311 Cas9, we performed BLAST searches to identify potential protospacers in viral and plasmid genomes that matched any of the 33 spacer sequences from CRISPR-1. This search generated 41 unique target sequences, from the genomes of bacteriophage known to infect S. thermophilus. We then aligned 50-nucleotide segments from the identified target genomes, inclusive of the 30-nucleotide protospacer and 10-nucleotide flanking regions (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the previous study (19Bolotin A. Quinquis B. Sorokin A. Ehrlich S.D. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), inspection of this alignment clearly identified a 5-bp PAM with a consensus sequence, GYAAA, invariantly located 2 bp downstream of the protospacer (Fig. 1, B and C). The most commonly observed PAM sequence, found in 7 of the 41 target sequences, was GCAAA. To confirm that the identified PAM was functional, we used a previously described transformation assay in which E. coli cells containing an exogenous type II CRISPR-Cas system are resistant to plasmid transformation, whereas cells lacking the system are competent for transformation (33Sapranauskas R. Gasiunas G. Fremaux C. Barrangou R. Horvath P. Siksnys V. The Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR/Cas system provides immunity in Escherichia coli.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 9275-9282Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 35Karvelis T. Gasiunas G.

Siksnys V. crRNA and tracrRNA guide Cas9-mediated DNA interference in Streptococcus thermophilus.RNA Biol. 2013; 10: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To generate cells containing the type II CRISPR-Cas system (CRISPR+ cells), compatible vectors encoding either LMG18311 Cas9 or its cognate sgRNA, engineered to contain a 20-nucleotide sequence derived from the first spacer of CRISPR-1 (Fig. 1C), were co-transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). In this overexpression system, the Cas9 and sgRNA genes are under the control of an IPTG-inducible T7 promoter. Control cells lacking the CRISPR-Cas system (CRISPR− cells) were generated by co-transforming compatible empty vectors into E. coli BL21(DE3). We constructed a target and two control plasmids. The target plasmid contained protospacer-1 (whose sequence was identical to the first spacer of CRISPR-1), a 2-bp linker, and the identified PAM (GCAAA) (Fig. 1C). The first control plasmid contained only protospacer-1, whereas the second control plasmid lacked both protospacer-1 and PAM. The target and control plasmids were then tested for CRISPR-Cas silencing by transformation into the CRISPR+ and CRISPR− strains in the presence of IPTG and the appropriate antibiotics (Fig. 2A). The control plasmids transformed into both strains with similar efficiency (Fig. 2B). The target plasmid failed to transform into the CRISPR+ cells but transformed into the CRISPR− cells with an efficiency comparable with that of the control plasmids (Fig. 2B). All of the transformation efficiencies were comparable with those previously reported (35Karvelis T. Gasiunas G. Miksys A. Barrangou R. Horvath P. Siksnys V. crRNA and tracrRNA guide Cas9-mediated DNA interference in Streptococcus thermophilus.RNA Biol. 2013; 10: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the identified PAM is functional in vivo and that the type II CRISPR-Cas system of S. thermophilus LMG18311 protects E. coli cells from transformation by plasmid DNA. To investigate the PAM sequence requirements for LMG18311 Cas9, we transformed a series of plasmid targets harboring single-nucleotide mutations throughout the PAM sequence in the CRISPR+ strain (Fig. 2C). Only the plasmid containing a mutation at the position 1 guanosine (that is, the PAM nucleotide closest to the protospacer) was transformed, albeit with a reduced (∼66%) transformation efficiency as compared with the intact PAM sequence (Fig. 2C). Plasmids containing single mutations to any of the other four positions were resistant to transformation (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the guanosine at position 1 is important for PAM function but individually the four other positions have little effect on PAM function. A 2-bp linker separates the protospacer from the PAM for LMG18311 Cas9 (Fig. 1, B and C). To investigate how linker length affects Cas9 activity, we generated plasmid targets with linkers ranging from 0 to 5 bp in length (Fig. 2D). We then determined the transformation efficiency for these plasmids into the CRISPR+ cells. The CRISPR+ cells were equally resistant to transformation by a plasmid target with a linker length of either 2 bp or 3 bp (Fig. 2D). Plasmids with other linker lengths transformed with efficiencies more similar to the control plasmid (Fig. 2D), suggesting that plasmids with these linkers were able to escape CRISPR-Cas silencing.

One of the HBV proteins, HBx, modulates the host cell machinery via several mechanisms. In this study we hypothesized that HBV enhances cell proliferation via HBx-induced microRNA-21 in hepatocellular carcinoma. HBx gene was over-expressed, and miRNA-21 expression and cell proliferation were measured in Huh 7 and Hep G2 cells. miRNA-21 was over-expressed in these cells, cell proliferation and the target proteins were analyzed. To confirm the role of miRNA-21 in HBx-induced proliferation, Hep G 2.2.1.5 cells (a cell line that expresses HBV stably) were used for miRNA-21 inhibition studies. HBx over-expression enhanced proliferation (3.7- and 4.5-fold increase; n = 3; p<0.01) and miRNA-21 expression (24- and 36-fold increase, normalized with 5S rRNA; p<0.001) in Huh 7 and Hep G2 cells respectively. HBx also resulted in the inhibition of miRNA-21 target proteins, PDCD4 and PTEN. miRNA-21 resulted in a significant increase in proliferation (2- and 2.3-fold increase over control cells; p<0.05 in Huh 7 and Hep G2 cells respectively) and decreased target proteins, PDCD4 and PTEN expression. Anti-miR-21 resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation (p<0.05) and increased miRNA-21 target protein expression. We conclude that HBV infection enhances cell proliferation, at least in part, via HBx-induced miRNA-21 expression during hepatocellular carcinoma progression."

As cell migration is important to angiogenesis, we characterized HGF-mediated effects on the formation of lamellipodia, a pre-requisite for migration using human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). HGF, in a dose-dependent manner, induced c-Met phosphorylation (Tyr-1234/1235, Tyr-1349, Ser-985, Tyr-1003, and Tyr-1313), activation of PI3k (phospho-Yp85) and Akt (phospho-Thr-308 and phospho-Ser-473) and potentiated lamellipodia formation and HLMVEC migration. Inhibition of c-Met kinase by SU11274 significantly attenuated c-Met, PI3k, and Akt phosphorylation, suppressed lamellipodia formation and endothelial cell migration. LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3k, abolished HGF-induced PI3k (Tyr-458), and Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473) phosphorylation and suppressed lamellipodia formation. Furthermore, HGF stimulated p47(phox)/Cortactin/Rac1 translocation to lamellipodia and ROS generation. Moreover, inhibition of c-Met/PI3k/Akt signaling axis and NADPH oxidase attenuated HGF- induced lamellipodia formation, ROS generation and cell migration. Ex vivo experiments with mouse aortic rings revealed a role for c-Met signaling in HGF-induced sprouting and lamellipodia formation. Taken together, these data provide evidence in support of a significant role for HGF-induced c-Met/PI3k/Akt signaling and NADPH oxidase activation in lamellipodia formation and motility of lung endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055945598,"Playing video games is a common recreational activity of adolescents. Recent research associated frequent video game playing with improvements in cognitive functions. Improvements in cognition have been related to grey matter changes in prefrontal cortex. However, a fine-grained analysis of human brain structure in relation to video gaming is lacking. In magnetic resonance imaging scans of 152 14-year old adolescents, FreeSurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness. Cortical thickness across the whole cortical surface was correlated with self-reported duration of video gaming (hours per week). A robust positive association between cortical thickness and video gaming duration was observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left frontal eye fields (FEFs). No regions showed cortical thinning in association with video gaming frequency. DLPFC is the core correlate of executive control and strategic planning which in turn are essential cognitive domains for successful video gaming. The FEFs are a key region involved in visuo-motor integration important for programming and execution of eye movements and allocation of visuo-spatial attention, processes engaged extensively in video games. The results may represent the biological basis of previously reported cognitive improvements due to video game play. Whether or not these results represent a-priori characteristics or consequences of video gaming should be studied in future longitudinal investigations."

In the current study, comparative transcriptomic approaches were used to examine the correlation of the three induced transgenic liver cancers with human liver cancers. RNA profiles from the three zebrafish tumors indicated relatively small overlaps of significantly deregulated genes and biological pathways. Nevertheless, the three transgenic tumor signatures all showed significant correlation with advanced or very advanced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, molecular signature from each oncogene-induced zebrafish liver tumor correlated with only a small subset of human HCC samples (24–29%) and there were conserved up-regulated pathways between the zebrafish and correlated human HCC subgroup. The three zebrafish liver cancer models together represented nearly half (47.2%) of human HCCs while some human HCCs showed significant correlation with more than one signature defined from the three oncogene-addicted zebrafish tumors. In contrast, commonly deregulated genes (21 up and 16 down) in the three zebrafish tumor models generally showed accordant deregulation in the majority of human HCCs, suggesting that these genes might be more consistently deregulated in a broad range of human HCCs with different molecular mechanisms and thus serve as common diagnosis markers and therapeutic targets. Thus, these transgenic zebrafish models with well-defined oncogene-induced tumors are valuable tools for molecular classification of human HCCs and for understanding of molecular drivers in hepatocarcinogenesis in each human HCC subgroup."

Furthermore, by using a murine acute hepatitis model, we showed that C87 attenuates TNFα-induced inflammation, thereby markedly reducing injuries to the liver and improving animal survival.

https://openalex.org/W1971793452,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are normally expressed in the central nervous system, where they mediate neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. Certain cancers, including melanoma and gliomas, express various mGluR subtypes that have been implicated as playing a role in disease progression. Recently, we detected metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (gene: GRM1; protein: mGluR1) in breast cancer and found that it plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth. In addition to cancer cells, brain endothelial cells express mGluR1. In light of these studies, and because angiogenesis is both a prognostic indicator in cancer correlating with a poorer prognosis and a potential therapeutic target, we explored a potential role for mGluR1 in mediating endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and tumor-induced angiogenesis. GRM1 and mGluR1 were detected in various types of human ECs and, using mGluR1-specific inhibitors or shRNA silencing, we demonstrated that EC growth and Matrigel tube formation are dependent on mGluR1 signaling. In addition, loss of mGluR1 activity leads to reduced angiogenesis in a murine Matrigel sponge implant model as well as a murine tumor model. These results suggest a role for mGluR1 in breast cancer as a pro-angiogenic factor as well as a mediator of tumor progression. They also suggest mGluR1 as a potential new molecular target for the anti-angiogenic therapy of breast cancer."

Enzymes and carrier proteins in the visual cycle function sequentially to regenerate and continuously supply 11-cis-retinal to retinal photoreceptor cells. However, it is unknown how the expression of the visual cycle genes is coordinated at the transcriptional level. Here, we show that the proximal upstream regions of six visual cycle genes contain chromatin-accessible sex-determining region Y box (SOX) binding sites, that SOX9 and LIM homeobox 2 (LHX2) are coexpressed in the nuclei of mature RPE cells, and that SOX9 acts synergistically with orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) to activate the RPE65 and retinaldehyde binding protein 1 (RLBP1) promoters and acts synergistically with LHX2 to activate the retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) promoter. ChIP reveals that SOX9 and OTX2 bind to the promoter regions of RPE65, RLBP1, and RGR and that LHX2 binds to those of RPE65 and RGR in bovine RPE. ChIP with human fetal RPE cells shows that SOX9 and OTX2 also bind to the human RPE65, RLBP1, and RGR promoters. Conditional inactivation of Sox9 in mouse RPE results in reduced expression of several visual cycle genes, most dramatically Rpe65 and Rgr. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis predicts that multiple common microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate visual cycle genes, and cotransfection of miRNA mimics with luciferase reporter constructs validated some of the predicted miRNAs. These results implicate SOX9 as a key regulator of visual cycle genes, reveal for the first time the functional role of LHX2 in the RPE, and suggest the possible regulation of visual cycle genes by common miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2038569576,"The soil bacterium Streptomyces peucetius produces two widely used anticancer antibiotics, doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Present within the biosynthesis gene cluster in S. peucetius is the drrAB operon, which codes for a dedicated ABC (ATP binding cassette)-type transporter for the export of these two closely related antibiotics. Because of its dedicated nature, the DrrAB system is believed to belong to the category of single-drug transporters. However, whether it also contains specificity for other known substrates of multidrug transporters has never been tested. In this study we demonstrate under both in vivo and in vitro conditions that the DrrAB system can transport not only doxorubicin but is also able to export two most commonly studied MDR substrates, Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide. Moreover, we demonstrate that many other substrates (including verapamil, vinblastine, and rifampicin) of the well studied multidrug transporters inhibit DrrAB-mediated Dox transport with high efficiency, indicating that they are also substrates of the DrrAB pump. Kinetic studies show that inhibition of doxorubicin transport by Hoechst 33342 and rifampicin occurs by a competitive mechanism, whereas verapamil inhibits transport by a non-competitive mechanism, thus suggesting the possibility of more than one drug binding site in the DrrAB system. This is the first in-depth study of a drug resistance system from a producer organism, and it shows that a dedicated efflux system like DrrAB contains specificity for multiple drugs. The significance of these findings in evolution of poly-specificity in drug resistance systems is discussed."

Identification of molecular phenotypes of RCC could improve risk-stratification and the prediction of the clinical disease course. We investigated whether gene-specific DNA hypermethylation can predict PFS and OS among patients undergoing anti-VEGF-based therapy. Primary tumor tissues from 18 patients receiving targeted therapy were examined retrospectively using quantitative methylation-specific PCR analysis of CST6, LAD1, hsa-miR-124-3, and hsa-miR-9-1 CpG islands. PFS and OS were analyzed for first-line and sequential antiangiogenic therapies using the log rank statistics. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for predicting first-line therapy failure. Hypermethylation of CST6 and LAD1 was associated with both a shortened PFS (log rank p = 0.009 and p = 0.004) and OS (p = 0.011 and p = 0.043). The median PFS observed for the high and low methylation groups of CST6 and LAD1 was 2.0 vs.11.4 months. LAD1 methylation had a specificity of 1.0 (95% CI 0.65-1.0) and a sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.43-0.90) for the prediction of first-line therapy. CST6 and LAD1 methylation are candidate epigenetic biomarkers showing unprecedented association with PFS and OS as well as specificity for the prediction of the response to therapy.

Recent experiments in vitro and in vivo have shown that cancer cells transfected with IL-27 activate CD8+ T cells to promote the secretion of anti-tumor cytokines Interleukin-10, although, at the same time, IL-27 inhibits the secretion of Interferon-[Formula: see text] by CD8+ T cells. In the present paper we develop a mathematical model based on these experimental results. The model involves a dynamic network which includes tumor cells, CD8+ T cells and cytokines Interleukin-27, Interleukin-10 and Interferon-[Formula: see text]. Simulations of the model show how Interleukin-27 promotes CD8+ T cells to secrete Interleukin-10 to inhibit tumor growth. On the other hand Interleukin-27 inhibits the secretion of Interferon-[Formula: see text] by CD8+ T cells which somewhat diminishes the inhibition of tumor growth. Our numerical results are in qualitative agreement with experimental data. We use the model to design protocols of IL-27 injections for the treatment of cancer and find that, for some special types of cancer, with a fixed total amount of drug, within a certain range, continuous injection has better efficacy than intermittent injections in reducing the tumor load while the treatment is ongoing, although the decrease in tumor load is only temporary."
https://openalex.org/W1995157027,"The formation of synapses, the specialized points of chemical communication between neurons, is a highly regulated developmental process fundamental to establishing normal brain circuitry. Perturbations of synapse formation and function causally contribute to human developmental and degenerative neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders. Many genes controlling synaptogenesis have been identified, but lack of facile experimental systems has made systematic discovery of regulators of synaptogenesis challenging. Thus, we created a high-throughput platform to study excitatory and inhibitory synapse development in primary neuronal cultures and used a lentiviral RNA interference library to identify novel regulators of synapse formation. This methodology is broadly applicable for high-throughput screening of genes and drugs that may rescue or improve synaptic dysfunction associated with cognitive function and neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2016129915,"A theoretical basis is required for comparing key features and critical elements in wild fisheries and aquaculture supply chains under a changing climate. Here we develop a new quantitative metric that is analogous to indices used to analyse food-webs and identify key species. The Supply Chain Index (SCI) identifies critical elements as those elements with large throughput rates, as well as greater connectivity. The sum of the scores for a supply chain provides a single metric that roughly captures both the resilience and connectedness of a supply chain. Standardised scores can facilitate cross-comparisons both under current conditions as well as under a changing climate. Identification of key elements along the supply chain may assist in informing adaptation strategies to reduce anticipated future risks posed by climate change. The SCI also provides information on the relative stability of different supply chains based on whether there is a fairly even spread in the individual scores of the top few key elements, compared with a more critical dependence on a few key individual supply chain elements. We use as a case study the Australian southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery, which is challenged by a number of climate change drivers such as impacts on recruitment and growth due to changes in large-scale and local oceanographic features. The SCI identifies airports, processors and Chinese consumers as the key elements in the lobster supply chain that merit attention to enhance stability and potentially enable growth. We also apply the index to an additional four real-world Australian commercial fishery and two aquaculture industry supply chains to highlight the utility of a systematic method for describing supply chains. Overall, our simple methodological approach to empirically-based supply chain research provides an objective method for comparing the resilience of supply chains and highlighting components that may be critical."
https://openalex.org/W2090449329,"Covalent modification provides a mechanism for modulating molecular state and regulating physiology. A cycle of competing enzymes that add and remove a single modification can act as a molecular switch between ""on"" and ""off"" and has been widely studied as a core motif in systems biology. Here, we exploit the recently developed ""linear framework"" for time scale separation to determine the general principles of such switches. These methods are not limited to Michaelis-Menten assumptions, and our conclusions hold for enzymes whose mechanisms may be arbitrarily complicated. We show that switching efficiency improves with increasing irreversibility of the enzymes and that the on/off transition occurs when the ratio of enzyme levels reaches a value that depends only on the rate constants. Fluctuations in enzyme levels, which habitually occur due to cellular heterogeneity, can cause flipping back and forth between on and off, leading to incoherent mosaic behavior in tissues, that worsens as switching becomes sharper. This trade-off can be circumvented if enzyme levels are correlated. In particular, if the competing catalytic domains are on the same protein but do not influence each other, the resulting bifunctional enzyme can switch sharply while remaining coherent. In the mammalian liver, the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is regulated by the bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2). We suggest that bifunctionality of PFK-2/FBPase-2 complements the metabolic zonation of the liver by ensuring coherent switching in response to insulin and glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1969072954,"Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and CRII) at the C-terminal region of murine Rif1. NMR analysis showed CRI to be intrinsically disordered, whereas CRII is partially folded. CRII binds cruciform DNA with high selectivity and micromolar affinity and thus represents a functional DNA binding domain. Mutational analysis revealed an α-helical region of CRII to be important for cruciform DNA binding and identified critical residues. Thus, we present the first structural study of the mammalian Rif1, identifying a domain that directly links its function to DNA binding. The high specificity of Rif1 for cruciform structures is significant given the role of this key protein in regulating origin firing and DNA repair."

The RNA polymerase II core promoter is the ultimate target of a multitude of transcription factors that control transcription initiation. Core promoters consist of core promoter motifs, e.g. the initiator, TATA box, and the downstream core promoter element (DPE), which confer specific properties to the core promoter. Here, we explored the importance of core promoter functions in the dorsal-ventral developmental gene regulatory network. This network includes multiple genes that are activated by different nuclear concentrations of Dorsal, an NFκB homolog transcription factor, along the dorsal-ventral axis. We show that over two-thirds of Dorsal target genes contain DPE sequence motifs, which is significantly higher than the proportion of DPE-containing promoters in Drosophila genes. We demonstrate that multiple Dorsal target genes are evolutionarily conserved and functionally dependent on the DPE. Furthermore, we have analyzed the activation of key Dorsal target genes by Dorsal, as well as by another Rel family transcription factor, Relish, and the dependence of their activation on the DPE motif. Using hybrid enhancer-promoter constructs in Drosophila cells and embryo extracts, we have demonstrated that the core promoter composition is an important determinant of transcriptional activity of Dorsal target genes.

The existence of different types of core promoters implies that core promoter elements play regulatory roles beyond the specification of transcription initiation. Transcription of TATA-dependent genes differs from transcription of DPE-dependent genes in many respects. First, the set of basal transcription factors that is necessary to transcribe TATA-dependent promoters in vitro is insufficient to transcribe DPE-dependent promoters (34.Lewis B.A. Sims 3rd, R.J. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Functional characterization of core promoter elements: DPE-specific transcription requires the protein kinase CK2 and the PC4 coactivator.Mol.

Second, enhancers with preference for DPE-containing promoters or TATA-containing promoters have been identified, supporting the existence of enhancer-promoter specificity (16.Smale S.T.

The RNA polymerase II core promoter: a key component in the regulation of gene expression.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Third, TBP is necessary for TATA-dependent transcription. However, TBP down-regulates DPE-dependent transcription (39.Hsu J.-Y. Juven-Gershon T. Marr 2nd, M.T. Wright K.J. Tjian R. Kadonaga J.T.

The two transcriptional regulators, NC2 and MOT1, which have been shown to be positive regulators of DPE-dependent transcription, do so by counteracting TBP, thus relieving its inhibition of DPE transcription (39.Hsu J.-Y.

Cooperative action of NC2 and Mot1p to regulate TATA-binding protein function across the genome.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2359-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the contribution of the DPE motif to the regulation of gene expression in the dorsal-ventral developmental gene network that is governed by the Rel family transcription factor Dorsal. We show that the promoters of many Dorsal target genes contain DPE sequence motifs. We demonstrate that core promoters of multiple Dorsal target genes are evolutionarily conserved and are functionally dependent on the DPE motif. Moreover, we have analyzed the activation of key Dorsal target genes by Dorsal and another Rel family transcription factor, Relish, and the dependence on the DPE motif. Using Drosophila S2R+ cells, we further demonstrate that the TATA box cannot compensate for the loss of DPE in the Dorsal target brinker and can only partially compensate for the loss of DPE in the Dorsal target twist. The addition of a TATA box to the brinker and twist promoter can, however, compensate for the loss of DPE using nuclear extracts derived from Drosophila embryos. We show that Dorsal is able to discriminate between a TATA box-containing promoter and a DPE-containing promoter. Transcription of enhancer-promoter constructs in both Drosophila S2R+ cells and embryo extracts manifests the importance of the core promoter in transcriptional regulation of Dorsal target genes. Collectively, we demonstrate that the DPE motif plays an important role in the expression of Dorsal target genes regulating dorsal-ventral patterning and provides evidence for the key contribution of the core promoter composition to gene regulatory networks. Sequence conservation analysis was performed using the UCSC genome browser. Drosophila transcripts that initiate at different chromosomal positions (based on the RefSeq database) were used to calculate the frequency of the core promoter elements (see Tables 1 and 2). Inr elements were identified in the region −10 to +10 relative to the transcription start site if there was an A at +1 and at least three of five additional matches to the consensus (TCAKTY, where the A is the +1 of the transcript). DPE motifs that were precisely located at +28 relative to the A + 1 of the Inr, were identified based on at least five of six matches to the DPE functional range set (DSWYVY). Putative TATA box elements were identified based on a match to a TATA sequence located from −45 to −19 relative to the RefSeq transcription start site. The significance of differences in core promoter composition between Drosophila transcripts and Dorsal target genes was calculated using the chi-square test.TABLE 1Core promoter composition of Dorsal target genes Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Frequency of core promoter elements among Drosophila transcripts that initiate at different chromosomal positions and Dorsal target genesCombination of core promoter elementsDrosophila transcriptsDorsal target genesp valueNo. of GenesFrequencyNo. of GenesFrequency%%Inr16,352828391<0.02TATA3,494182629<0.01TATA and no DPE2,5681378<0.15TATA and no Inr4612221Inr and DPE4,628236369<0.0001Inr, DPE and TATA83641921<0.0001Total19,865(100)91(100) Open table in a new tab Double-stranded oligonucleotides comprising core promoter sequences from −10 to +40 (see Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) of the tested Dorsal target genes core promoters were inserted into the PstI and XbaI sites of pUC119.

https://openalex.org/W1989261134,"We report a new function for Escherichia coli DsbC, a protein best known for disulfide bond isomerization in the periplasm. We found that DsbC regulates the redox state of the single cysteine of the L-arabinose-binding protein AraF. This cysteine, which can be oxidized to a sulfenic acid, mediates the formation of a disulfide-linked homodimer under oxidative stress conditions, preventing L-arabinose binding. DsbC, unlike the homologous protein DsbG, reduces the intermolecular disulfide, restoring AraF binding properties. Thus, our results reveal a new link between oxidative protein folding and the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress."

Currently little is known about the mechanism by which checkpoint signaling is terminated, and the disappearance of DNA lesions is considered to induce the end of checkpoint signaling; however, here we show that the termination of checkpoint signaling is an active process promoted by Src family tyrosine kinases. Inhibition of Src activity delays recovery from the G2 phase DNA damage checkpoint following DNA repair. Src activity is required for the termination of checkpoint signaling, and inhibition of Src activity induces persistent activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and Rad3-related (ATR) and Chk1 kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2061259351,"Lysosomal membrane permeabilization is an essential step in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of liver cancer cell lines. TRAIL-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization is mediated by the multifunctional sorting protein PACS-2 and repressed by the E3 ligases cIAP-1 and cIAP-2. Despite the opposing roles for PACS-2 and cIAPs in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, an interaction between these proteins has yet to be examined. Herein, we report that cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 confer TRAIL resistance to hepatobiliary cancer cell lines by reducing PACS-2 levels. Under basal conditions, PACS-2 underwent K48-linked poly-ubiquitination, resulting in PACS-2 proteasomal degradation. Biochemical assays showed cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 interacted with PACS-2 in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the two cIAPs bound PACS-2 in vivo. More importantly, both cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 directly mediated PACS-2 ubiquitination in a cell-free assay. Single c-Iap-1 or c-Iap-2 gene knock-outs in mouse hepatocytes did not lead to PACS-2 accumulation. However, deletion of both cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 reduced PACS-2 ubiquitination, which increased PACS-2 levels and sensitized HuH-7 cells to TRAIL-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. Correspondingly, deletion of cIAPs sensitized wild-type, but not PACS-2-deficient hepatocarcinoma cells or Pacs-2-/- mouse hepatocytes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Together, these data suggest cIAPs constitutively downregulate PACS-2 by polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby restraining TRAIL-induced killing of liver cancer cells."

By contrast, functional evidence for the transport of NH3 and the lack of coupled ionic currents has been provided for many Rh proteins. Furthermore, despite high resolution structures the transported substrate in many bacterial homologs, such as AmtB from Escherichia coli, is still unclear.

When expressed in oocytes, the reduced transport capacity was confirmed for either of the mutants Q67K, M72I,and W145S. Structural alignments suggest that these mutations were dispersed at subunit contact sites of trimeric AMTs, without direct contact to the pore lumen.

https://openalex.org/W2040677908,"Gdown1 is a substoichiometric subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that has been recently demonstrated to be involved in stabilizing promoter-proximal paused Pol II. It was shown to inhibit termination of Pol II by transcription termination factor 2 (TTF2) as well as block elongation stimulation by transcription factor IIF (TFIIF). Here, using in vitro transcription assays, we identified two functional domains in Gdown1. Although both are required to maintain a tight association with Pol II, the N- and C-terminal domains are responsible for blocking TTF2 and TFIIF, respectively. A highly conserved LPDKG motif found in the N-terminal domain of Gdown1 is also highly conserved in TTF2. Deletion of this motif eliminated the TTF2 inhibitory activity of Gdown1. We identified a phosphorylated form of Gdown1 with altered mobility in SDS-PAGE that appears during mitosis. A kinase in HeLa nuclear extract that caused the shift was partially purified. In vitro, Gdown1 phosphorylated by this kinase demonstrated reduced activity in blocking both TTF2 and TFIIF because of its reduced affinity for Pol II. Mass spectrometry identified Ser-270 as the site of this phosphorylation. An S270A mutation was not phosphorylated by the partially purified kinase, and an S270E mutation partially mimicked the properties of phospho-Gdown1. Gdown1 Ser-270 phosphorylation occurs predominately during mitosis, and we suggest that this would enable TTF2 to terminate all Pol II even if it is associated with Gdown1."
https://openalex.org/W2094798284,"Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is an important disease of common bean, resulting in major economic losses worldwide. Genetic diversity of the C. lindemuthianum population contributes to its ability to adapt rapidly to new sources of host resistance. The origin of this diversity is unknown, but sexual recombination, via the Glomerella teleomorph, is one possibility. This study tested the hypothesis that Glomerella strains that are frequently recovered from bean anthracnose lesions represent the teleomorph of C. lindemuthianum. A large collection of Glomerella isolates could be separated into two groups based on phylogenetic analysis, morphology, and pathogenicity to beans. Both groups were unrelated to C. lindemuthianum. One group clustered with the C. gloeosporioides species complex and produced mild symptoms on bean tissues. The other group, which belonged to a clade that included the cucurbit anthracnose pathogen C. magna, caused no symptoms. Individual ascospores recovered from Glomerella perithecia gave rise to either fertile (perithecial) or infertile (conidial) colonies. Some pairings of perithecial and conidial strains resulted in induced homothallism in the conidial partner, while others led to apparent heterothallic matings. Pairings involving two perithecial, or two conidial, colonies produced neither outcome. Conidia efficiently formed conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs), but ascospores never formed CATs. The Glomerella strains formed appressoria and hyphae on the plant surface, but did not penetrate or form infection structures within the tissues. Their behavior was similar whether the beans were susceptible or resistant to anthracnose. These same Glomerella strains produced thick intracellular hyphae, and eventually acervuli, if host cell death was induced. When Glomerella was co-inoculated with C. lindemuthianum, it readily invaded anthracnose lesions. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported: Glomerella strains from anthracnose lesions do not represent the teleomorphic phase of C. lindemuthianum, and instead appear to be bean epiphytes that opportunistically invade and sporulate in the lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2040120004,"The tumor associated antigen OVA66 has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in malignant tumors and implicated in various cellular processes. To further elucidate its oncogenic character, we established an OVA66 stably overexpressed NIH3T3 cell line and a vector transfected control, named NIH3T3-flagOVA66 and NIH3T3-mock, respectively. NIH3T3-flagOVA66 cells showed faster cell cycling, proliferation, cell migration and more resistance to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. When NIH3T3-flagOVA66 and NIH3T3-mock cells were injected into nude mice for xenograft tumorigenicity assays, the NIH3T3-flagOVA66 cells formed tumors whereas no tumors were observed in mice inoculated with NIH3T3-mock cells. Analysis of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways by serum stimulation indicated hyperactivation of AKT and ERK1/2 in NIH3T3-flagOVA66 cells compared with NIH3T3-mock cells, while a decreased level of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 were observed in OVA66 knocked down HeLa cells. To further validate if the p-AKT or p-ERK1/2 is essential for OVA66 induced oncogenic transformation, we treated the cells with the PI3K/AKT specific inhibitor LY294002 and the ERK1/2 MAPK specific inhibitor PD98059 and found either inhibitor can attenuate the cell colony forming ability in soft agar and the cell viability of NIH3T3-flagOVA66 cells, suggesting aberrantly activated AKT and ERK1/2 signaling be indispensible of the tumorigenic role of OVA66. Our results indicate that OVA66 is important in oncogenic transformation, promoting proliferation, cell migration and reducing apoptosis via hyperactivating PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, OVA66 might be a novel target for early detection, prevention and treatment of tumors in the future."

We investigated the expression of IL-32 and its regulation mechanism in the inflammatory response of patients with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.IL-32 mRNA and protein expression in gastric tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The regulation of IL-32 in human gastric epithelia cell line AGS was investigated by different cytokine stimulation and different H. pylori strain infection.Gastric IL-32 mRNA and protein expression were elevated in patients with H. pylori infection and positively correlated with gastritis. In H. pylori-infected patients, the mRNA level of IL-32 was also correlated with that of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. In vitro IL-1β and TNF-α could upregulate IL-32 mRNA and protein level in AGS cells, which was dependent on NF-κB signal pathway. The regulation of IL-32 expression in response to H. pylori-infection could be weakened by using neutralizing antibodies to block IL-1β and TNF-α. Moreover, H. pylori-infected AGS cells also induced IL-32 mRNA and protein expression, which was dependent on CagA.IL-32 level is elevated in patients with H. pylori infection and its expression is regulated by proinflammatory stimuli, suggesting that IL-32 may play a role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-related gastritis."

Through its interaction with HIV-1 integrase (IN), LEDGF/p75 locks the latter onto chromatin (21.Hendrix J. Gijsbers R. De Rijck J. Voet A. Hotta J. McNeely M. Hofkens J. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y.

The LEDGF/p75 interactor JPO2 (CDCA7L, RAM2, R1) was first identified as a c-Myc transcription factor-interacting protein that complements c-Myc-transforming activity (29.Huang A. Ho C.S.

JPO2 consists of 454 amino acids and contains a PEST domain, a putative leucine zipper (LZ), a putative nuclear localization signal, and a zinc-binding RING finger-like domain (Fig. 1A). Through interaction with the androgen and retinoic acid receptors, JPO2 is implicated in the regulation of prostate-specific genes (31.Rivera-Gonzalez G.C. Droop A.P. Rippon H.J. Tiemann K.

A complex interplay at the MAO A gene promoter between Sp1, JPO2, the androgen receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor has been reported (30.Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C.

In addition, transcriptional activity of the MAO B gene is also regulated by JPO2 through the interplay with Sp1 and E2F-associated phosphoprotein (35.Chen K. Ou X.M. Wu J.B. Shih J.C. Transcription factor E2F-associated phosphoprotein (EAPP), RAM2/CDCA7L/JPO2 (R1), and simian virus 40 promoter factor 1 (Sp1) cooperatively regulate glucocorticoid activation of monoamine oxidase B.Mol.

All of these data are indicative of a role of JPO2 in transcriptional regulation. Independently, JPO2 was identified as a cellular binding partner of LEDGF/p75 (11.Bartholomeeusen K. De Rijck J.

In these studies, the stability and association of JPO2 with chromatin were shown to depend on the presence of LEDGF/p75. The LEDGF/p75-binding domain in JPO2, also referred to as the specific interaction domain (SID), was mapped between residues 62 and 94 (11.Bartholomeeusen K. De Rijck J. Busschots K. Desender L. Gijsbers R. Emiliani S. Benarous R. Debyser Z. Christ F. Differential interaction of HIV-1 integrase and JPO2 with the C terminus of LEDGF/p75.J. Mol.

Like IN, JPO2 interacts with LEDGF/p75 via the IBD (11.Bartholomeeusen K. De Rijck J. Busschots K. Desender L. Gijsbers R. Emiliani S. Benarous R. Debyser Z. Christ F.

In this regard, it was shown that binding was mutually exclusive, although the IBD residues engaged by JPO2 and IN were not identical (11.Bartholomeeusen K. De Rijck J. Busschots K. Desender L. Gijsbers R. Emiliani S. Benarous R. Debyser Z. Christ F. Differential interaction of HIV-1 integrase and JPO2 with the C terminus of LEDGF/p75.J. Mol.

Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy methods, such as continuous photobleaching (CP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), were originally developed to measure diffusion coefficients (37.Peters R. Brünger A. Schulten K. Continuous fluorescence microphotolysis: a sensitive method for study of diffusion processes in single cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38.Magde D. Webb W.W. Elson E. Thermodynamic fluctuations in a reacting system: measurement by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Phys. Rev. Lett. 1972; 29: 705-708Crossref Scopus (1469) Google Scholar) but can also be used to study dynamic chromatin interactions in cells (39.Michelman-Ribeiro A. Mazza D. Rosales T. Stasevich T.J. Boukari H. Rishi V. Vinson C. Knutson J.R. McNally J.G. Direct measurement of association and dissociation rates of DNA binding in live cells by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) can be used to specifically study protein-protein interactions in cells (40.Schwille P. Meyer-Almes F.J. Rigler R. Dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy for multicomponent diffusional analysis in solution.Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1878-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using CP and FCS, we could show that the dynamic chromatin scanning/hopping mode of LEDGF/p75 inside live HeLa cell nuclei is mediated in part by its PWWP domain (21.Hendrix J. Gijsbers R. De Rijck J. Voet A. Hotta J. McNeely M. Hofkens J. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. The transcriptional co-activator LEDGF/p75 displays a dynamic scan-and-lock mechanism for chromatin tethering.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 1310-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, when IN was overexpressed in these cells, LEDGF/p75 was shown to lock the LEDGF/p75-IN complex onto the chromatin via its PWWP domain (75-fold increase in affinity). Because IN has a low intrinsic affinity for chromatin, chromatin locking cannot solely be explained by the presence of IN (21.Hendrix J. Gijsbers R. De Rijck J. Voet A. Hotta J. McNeely M. Hofkens J. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. The transcriptional co-activator LEDGF/p75 displays a dynamic scan-and-lock mechanism for chromatin tethering.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 1310-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, although this mechanism may be a crucial step for HIV integration targeting, it is not known whether it is a general mechanism upon binding of cellular and/or viral proteins to the IBD of LEDGF/p75. Here we explored the dynamic behavior of JPO2 inside living cells in the absence and presence of LEDGF/p75 using CP and FCS and investigated in detail its interaction with LEDGF/p75 by FCCS. Plasmids for expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (fusion) proteins in eukaryotic cells were based on the peGFP-C1 backbone (Clontech). The plasmid for the expression of eGFP-JPO2 has been described elsewhere (peGFP-JPO2) (11.Bartholomeeusen K. De Rijck J. Busschots K. Desender L. Gijsbers R. Emiliani S. Benarous R. Debyser Z. Christ F. Differential interaction of HIV-1 integrase and JPO2 with the C terminus of LEDGF/p75.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for eGFP-JPO2(98–454) was constructed by inserting the coding sequence into the BamHI- and XhoI-digested peGFP-C1 constructs downstream of and in frame with the eGFP coding sequence. The JPO2(98–454) coding sequence was amplified from peGFP-JPO2 with the following primers: 5′-GCGGGATCCGAAGTAATGGTCGTGGAG and 5′-ACCTCGAGTCAATTGTCTTCTACCAGC. The plasmid encoding RNAi-resistant monomeric red fluorescent protein 1 (mRFP)-LEDGF/p75 for expression in HeLap75KD cells was created by amplifying the “LEDGF BC” cDNA (41.Llano M. Vanegas M.

The plasmid for expression of mRFP-LEDGF/p75K56D/R74D,BC was created from pmRFP-LEDGF/p75BC by site-directed mutagenesis, as described elsewhere (21.Hendrix J. Gijsbers R. De Rijck J. Voet A.

HeLa cells were obtained from the National Institutes of Health reagent program and were cultivated at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). Monoclonal HeLa cells with a strong (>97%) knockdown of endogenous LEDGF/p75 (HeLap75KD) were cultivated as described previously (42.Gijsbers R. Ronen K. Vets S. Malani N. De Rijck J. McNeely M.

Transient expression was achieved via cationic lipid-mediated plasmid DNA transfection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). One day before transfection, 0.5–1 × 105 cells were seeded per well in a #1 Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (VWR International, Leuven, Belgium). Cells were transfected at 50–70% cell confluence. Plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and Lipofectamine 2000 (0.5–1 μl/0.5 μg of DNA) were diluted in 50 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) per well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 350 μl of prewarmed growth medium was added, the cell medium was replaced with the transfection mixture, and cells were incubated for at least 12 h prior to the microscopy experiments. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on NuPage 10% BisTris gels (Invitrogen), followed by electroblotting onto polyvinyledene difluoride membranes. LEDGF/p75 was detected using a polyclonal rabbit-derived antibody (A300-847A, Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX), and eGFP was detected using an in-house polyclonal anti-GFP rabbit-derived antibody. Detection was performed with HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako Belgium nv/sa, Heverlee, Belgium) using an Amersham Biosciences ECL+ chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare).

https://openalex.org/W2001728916,"The objective of this study was to establish a primary culture of omasal epithelial cells (OECs) derived from dairy calves and to characterize its function in small peptide absorption. Bovine omasal tissues were obtained from newborn Chinese Holstein calves and digested with a 2.5% trypsin solution to obtain OECs. The isolated cells were later cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of omasal tissue after digestion indicated that the cultured cells originated from the epithelial strata. Pure epithelial cells displayed an epithelial cell-like morphology, similar to cobblestone, with few visible fibroblasts and were cytokeratin 18-positive according to immunocytochemical analyses. The OECs were morphologically characterized with desmosomes, tight junctions and microvilli. These cells exhibited normal growth properties, as assessed using a cell growth curve, and were stably cultured for 10 passages. The OECs expressed the peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) mRNA and absorbed intact glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar). The uptake of Gly-Sar by OECs was pH-dependent with an optimal pH of 5.5–6.5. Furthermore, the uptake of Gly-Sar was also time-dependent, concentration-dependent and temperature-dependent. Moreover, PEPT1 was saturated with Gly-Sar at a concentration of 2.5 mM. The uptake via PEPT1 was higher compared with that via passive route at low substrate concentrations (<1.5 mM). This result suggested that PEPT1 contributed more to total small peptide absorption at low concentrations. In addition, this uptake could be competitively inhibited by methionine-glycine. Taken together, these data suggested that PEPT1 contributes to small peptide absorption in OECs. Thus, OECs may serve as a useful culture model for the study of the absorption of small peptides in bovine omasum."
https://openalex.org/W1972489709,"Myelinating Schwann cells specifically express L-periaxin (L-PRX) in the mammalian peripheral nervous system. Several loss-of-function mutations in periaxin have been described and linked to autosomal recessive Dejerine Sottas neuropathy and to demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The localization of L-periaxin is developmentally regulated in the nucleus and the plasma membrane of Schwann cells. In this study, L-periaxin, which contains a PDZ domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain, a repeat domain, and an acidic domain, was localized in the cytoplasm of RSC96 cells. By contrast, a mutant L-periaxin with a deleted PDZ domain was localized mainly in the nucleus of RSC96 cells. After a nuclear cyclin A1, which is localized exclusively in the nucleus, was fused with the PDZ domain, cyclinA1was found in the cytoplasm of RSC96 cells. Treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export mediated by leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), also causes nuclear accumulation of wild-type L-periaxin. Double leucine mutation (L83, 85Q) in the putative NES in the PDZ domain prevented L-periaxin nuclear export and induced nuclear accumulation. These results suggested that the localization of L-periaxin in the cytoplasm is supported by NES in the PDZ domain."
https://openalex.org/W2039563556,"Group C orthobunyaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus), discovered in the 1950s, are vector-borne human pathogens in the Americas. Currently there is a gap in genomic information for group C viruses. In this study, we obtained complete coding region sequences of reference strains of Caraparu (CARV), Oriboca (ORIV), Marituba (MTBV) and Madrid (MADV) viruses, and five clinical isolates from Peru and Bolivia, using an unbiased de novo approach consisting of random reverse transcription, random anchored PCR amplification, and high throughput pyrosequencing. The small, medium, and large segments encode for a 235 amino acid nucleocapsid protein, an approximately 1430 amino acid surface glycoprotein polyprotein precursor, and a 2248 amino acid RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. Additionally, the S segment encodes for an 83 amino acid non-structural protein, although this protein is truncated or silenced in some isolates. Phylogenetically, three clinical isolates clustered with CARV, one clustered with MTBV, and one isolate appeared to be a reassortant or a genetic drift resulted from the high variability of the medium segment which was also seen in a few other orthobunyaviruses. These data represent the first complete coding region sequences for this serocomplex of pathogenic orthobunyaviruses. The genome-wide phylogeny of reference strains is consistent with the antigenic properties of the viruses reported in the original serological studies conducted in the 1960s. Comparative analysis of conserved protein regions across group C virus strains and the other orthobunyavirus groups revealed that these group C viruses contain characteristic domains of potential structural and functional significance. Our results provide the basis for the developments of diagnostics, further genetic analyses, and future epidemiologic studies of group C viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2039047911,"The in vitro production of early porcine embryos is of particular scientific and economic interest. In general, embryos produced from in vitro Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) manipulations, such as somatic cell chromatin transfer (CT) and parthenogenetic activation (PA), are less developmentally competent than in vivo–derived embryos. The mechanisms underlying the deficiencies of embryos generated from PA and CT have not been completely understood. To characterize the altered genes and gene networks in embryos generated from CT and PA, comparative transcriptomic analyses of in vivo (IVV) expanded blastocysts (XB), IVV hatched blastocyst (HB), PA XB, PA HB, and CT HB were performed using a custom microarray platform enriched for genes expressed during early embryonic development. Differential expressions of 1492 and 103 genes were identified in PA and CT HB, respectively, in comparison with IVV HB. The “eIF2 signalling”, “mitochondrial dysfunction”, “regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signalling”, “protein ubiquitination”, and “mTOR signalling” pathways were down-regulated in PA HB. Dysregulation of notch signalling–associated genes were observed in both PA and CT HB. TP53 was predicted to be activated in both PA and CT HB, as 136 and 23 regulation targets of TP53 showed significant differential expression in PA and CT HB, respectively, in comparison with IVV HB. In addition, dysregulations of several critical pluripotency, trophoblast development, and implantation-associated genes (NANOG, GATA2, KRT8, LGMN, and DPP4) were observed in PA HB during the blastocyst hatching process. The critical genes that were observed to be dysregulated in CT and PA embryos could be indicative of underlying developmental deficiencies of embryos produced from these technologies."

For this purpose training programs at health facility and community level were evaluated.A pre-post control-test group design in two administrative divisions of Nairobi East District was used. Clinical competencies of PHWs (n = 32 intervention, and n = 27 control) at health facility level were assessed 9 months after training, and after 6 months for community health workers, (CHWs) (n = 411 intervention and n = 404 control) using written questionnaires, clinical data and patient interviews. Effects on referral for HIV testing and actual HIV testing were assessed by comparing laboratory registries pre- and post training.PHWs in intervention (n = 27; 84%) and control (n = 15; 60%) divisions, and CHWs in intervention (n = 330; 80%) and control (189; 47%) divisions, completed all questionnaires. Trained PHWs significantly increased their knowledge of HROLs (p<0.02), frequency of oral examinations, diagnosis of HROLs and referral of patients with HROLs for HIV testing. Trained CHWs significantly gained knowledge about HROLs (p<0.02) and referred more patients with HROLs to health facilities. Overall percentage of HIV-positive test results was three-fold for HROLs compared to non-HROLs. Specifically, 70% of patients with oro pharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), the most commonly diagnosed HROL, were confirmed as being HIV-positive. Increase in overall HIV testing rates (1.6% pre-, 1.2% post training) and overall percentage of HIV-positive results (13% pre-, 16% post-intervention) was not significant.Training programs significantly increased PHW and CHW knowledge, recognition and management of HROLs but increased neither overall HIV testing rates nor overall percentage of positive tests. Speculation is that the health system and patient-related barriers seriously limit HIV testing.Netherlands Trial Register NTR2627 (date registered 22nd November 2010), and NTR2697 (date registered 13th January 2011)."
https://openalex.org/W1989350940,"Germline and somatic biallelic mutations of the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and TSC2 gene products cause TSC, an autosomal dominant multifocal hamartomatosis with variable neurological manifestations. The consequences of TSC1 or TSC2 loss in cells of hematopoietic origin have recently started to be unveiled in mice and showed to hinder the development of proper T cell immunity. To date, the consequences of germline TSC1 mutations and/or its loss in mature human T cells remain to be determined. To address these issues, we analyzed subset representation, phenotype and responsiveness to mitogens in T cells from patients with inherited monoallelic TSC1 mutations, and induced shRNA-mediated TSC1 down-regulation in primary and transformed human T cells. We report that, the distribution of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, their cytokine-secretion profile, and responsiveness to in vitro stimulation were largely preserved in TSC subjects with monoallelic TSC1 germline mutations when compared to healthy controls. Sufficient levels of hamartin and tuberin and proper control of mTOR-dependent signaling in primary T cells from TSC subjects best explained this. In contrast, shRNA-induced down-regulation of TSC1, likely mimicking biallelic inactivation of TSC1, compromised hamartin and tuberin expression and mTORC2/AKT/FoxO1/3 signaling causing both primary and transformed T cells to die by apoptosis. Thus, our results indicate that, while one functional TSC1 allele preserves human T lymphocytes development and homeostasis, TSC1 acute down-regulation is detrimental to the survival of both primary and transformed T cells."
