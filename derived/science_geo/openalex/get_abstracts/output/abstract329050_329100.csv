https://openalex.org/W2029139792,"The relative importance of the pelagic flux of aragonite, as compared to calcite, to the deep-sea floor has been evaluated by means of a quantitative x-ray diffraction study of samples collected from sediment traps and from an unusually shallow portion of the open Atlantic Ocean (the Rio Grande Rise). The results suggest that the aragonite flux constitutes at least 12 percent of the total flux of calcium carbonate on a worldwide basis. The presence of high-magnesium calcite in several samples suggests that some of the calcareous material falling to the deep-sea floor may be derived from the long-distance transport of debris from shallow-water beenthic organisms as well as from the settling of planktonic remains. This observation supports the contention that 12 percent represents a minimum value. Aragonite and high-magnesium calcite transported laterally from shallow-water regions, upon dissolution during settling into deeper water, may contribute to the neutralization of excess anthropogenic carbon dioxide added to the oceans."

When [(14)C]azidoatrazine was treated with 300-nanometer ultraviolet light in situ, reversibility of binding was lost in proportion to the duration of irradiation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of chloroplast membranes irradiated in the presence of [(l4)C]-azidoatrazine indicated radioactivity in only one region, corresponding to a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 32,000. Azidoatrazine is a photoaffinity reagent for the triazine binding site in chloroplasts and serves as a label to identify this site, which may be the apoprotein of the secondary electron acceptor in photosystem II."

In Mexican jays, social units are more complex genealogically than in most other communal birds and may contain grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins in addition to parents and older siblings. The average relatedness within the units varies greatly, and is lower than would be expected for a highly social bird."

https://openalex.org/W2014064709,"In view of the favorable reports in recent literature on the inhalation of therapeutic agents, especially penicillin, and because of the many possibilities of the method, we have attempted to produce even greater and more protracted topical effectiveness by a method which involves the inhalation of the fine dust aerosol particles. This method has simplified the mechanics of aerosol therapy, thus expanding its scope more readily for office and home treatment. Apparatus used for inhalation therapy in the past has been based on the delivery of the aerosol vapor under positive pressure of oxygen or air by means of a hand bulb or oxygen tank and gauge. The principle utilized in the new method is based on the negative pressure created by normal breathing during the inspiratory phase. Inhaling penicillin dust in this manner is more physiological and permits a more even and perhaps a wider distribution of medicament throughout the respiratory tract. The patient is not required to manipulate an exhaling valve during the expiration phase, and the cumbersome equipment of oxygen tank and gauge is unnecessary. The inhalation of thle dust particles yields a greater effect than the vapor, because there is greater concentration of penicillin per unit area and because the penicillin must go into solution while in contact with mucous membrane before it can be absorbed. The penicillin dust used in this study was crystalline sodium penicillin' processed to 50-100-mesh particles. This wasfound to be less hydroscopic than the sodium penicillin salt and could be stored at room temperature, without losing its potency, moreexeadily than the penicillin liquid which was used as the nebulin for the vapor method."
