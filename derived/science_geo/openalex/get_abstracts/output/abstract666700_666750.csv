Johmura et al. used RNA interference to screen for enzymes essential to the survival of senescent cells (see the Perspective by Pan and Locasale). The authors identified a key role for glutamine metabolism, particularly the enzyme glutaminase 1, and demonstrated that inhibition of this pathway induced the death of senescent cells. Glutaminase targeting also ameliorated aging-related organ dysfunction and obesity-related disorders in mouse models, suggesting the potential therapeutic value of this approach.

To predict which mutations may lead to viral escape, Hie et al. used a machine learning technique for natural language processing with two components: grammar (or syntax) and meaning (or semantics) (see the Perspective by Kim and Przytycka). Three different unsupervised language models were constructed for influenza A hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein. Semantic landscapes for these viruses predicted viral escape mutations that produce sequences that are syntactically and/or grammatically correct but effectively different in semantics and thus able to evade the immune system.

https://openalex.org/W3120205425,"Ethylene aplenty signals soil compaction It's tough to drive a spade through compacted soil, and plant roots seem to have the same problem when growing in compacted ground. Pandey et al. found that the problem is not, however, one of physical resistance but rather inhibition of growth through a signaling pathway. The volatile plant hormone ethylene will diffuse through aerated soil, but compacted soil reduces such diffusion, increasing the concentration of ethylene near root tissues. The cellular signaling cascades triggered by too much ethylene stop root growth. Therefore, gaseous diffusion serves as a readout of soil compaction for plant roots growing in search of productive nutrition. Science , this issue p. 276"

It remains unclear whether other types of immune responses can also contribute to host defense against these pathogens. The yeast Candida albicans prominently infects patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), an inherited disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the AIRE gene. Break et al. report that the oral susceptibility of Aire -deficient mice to C. albicans is not due to aberrant type 17 responses. Rather, the overproduction of interferon-γ by local CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in these mice disrupts the epithelial barrier, which increases susceptibility to C. albicans invasion. Similar type 1 immune pathways are operational in APECED patients. Inhibition of interferon-γ or the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in mice ameliorates disease symptoms, suggesting potential future therapeutic interventions for certain classes of fungal disease.

Zhang et al. investigated how gene transcription and RNA splicing are physically coupled. Using cryo–electron microscopy, they resolved the molecular structure of a complex of the transcription enzyme RNA polymerase II with part of the splicing machinery, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle. The results provide important details for our understanding of coupled mRNA production. Science , this issue p. 305"

Li et al. analyzed the balance between plants defending themselves and plants poisoning themselves. In wild tobacco ( Nicotiana attenuata ), two cytochrome P450 enzymes work within the biosynthetic pathway of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides to help prevent the accumulation of toxic diterpene derivatives. Those same diterpene derivatives are formed in an insect herbivore after ingestion and cause toxicity by inhibiting sphingolipid biosynthesis in both plant and insect. Science , this issue p. 255"

Despite more than a century of study, when and where these α particles form in stable and unstable nuclei alike remains an open question. Tanaka et al. bombarded a series of stable tin isotopes with high-energy protons and detected ejected α particles at an abundance inversely correlated with mass number (see the Perspective by Hen). This observation, relating α particle accumulation to the neutron skin thickness at the nuclear surface, bears on models spanning radioactive decay to neutron star dynamics.

https://openalex.org/W3120353614,"Kidneys are one of the targets for SARS-CoV-2, it is reported that up to 36% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection would develop into acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with high mortality in the clinical setting and contributes to the transition of AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Up to date, the underlying mechanisms are obscure and there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19-induced AKI. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms and interactions between Quercetin and SARS-CoV-2 targets proteins by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The renal protective effects of Quercetin on COVID-19-induced AKI may be associated with the blockade of the activation of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways. Quercetin may also serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by binding with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL and ACE2, therefore suppressing the functions of the proteins to cut the viral life cycle. In conclusion, Quercetin may be a novel therapeutic agent for COVID-19-induced AKI. Inhibition of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways may be the critical mechanisms by which Quercetin protects kidney from SARS-CoV-2 injury."
https://openalex.org/W3119674414,"A cellular cholesterol sensor Cholesterol levels in cells are controlled by the sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP) pathway. When the cell has sufficient cholesterol, the transcription factor that regulates cholesterol metabolism is sequestered at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, but when cholesterol is depleted, the transcription factor is released to activate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Yan et al. determined the structure of a central complex in human SREBP containing the proteins Scap and Insig-2. These two membrane-embedded proteins undergo 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC)–dependent association and must dissociate for the pathway to be activated. The structure shows that 25HC is sandwiched between Scap and Insig-2 to facilitate their association. A mutational analysis is consistent with the structural model. Science , this issue p. eabb2224"
https://openalex.org/W3119897549,"Quantum many-body scars, long-lived excited states of correlated quantum chaotic systems that evade thermalization, are of great fundamental and technological interest. We create novel scar states in a bosonic 1D quantum gas of dysprosium by stabilizing a super-Tonks-Girardeau gas against collapse and thermalization with repulsive long-range dipolar interactions. Stiffness and energy density measurements show that the system is dynamically stable regardless of contact interaction strength. This enables us to cycle contact interactions from weakly to strongly repulsive, then strongly attractive, and finally weakly attractive. We show that this cycle is an energy-space topological pump (due to a quantum holonomy). Iterating this cycle offers an unexplored topological pumping method to create a hierarchy of quantum many-body scar states."
https://openalex.org/W3119668853,"A key complex in B cell activation A core component of the immune system are B cells, which are activated by infection and then mature to provide long-lived immunity. Activation is initiated when a cell surface B cell receptor, in association with its coreceptor, recognizes an antigen. Susa et al. report a structure of the B cell coreceptor signaling subunit CD19 in complex with CD81, a key regulator. CD81 alone binds to cholesterol, but the conformational changes associated with binding to CD19 occlude the cholesterol-binding pocket. Regulating cholesterol binding could play a role in the activation mechanism. The structure also provides a basis for the design of immunotherapies. Science , this issue p. 300"
https://openalex.org/W3120932216,"Sperm-specific natural selection Sperm cells are genetically haploid, but because of the cytoplasmic bridges that link cells, they can be transcriptionally diploid. However, some gene transcripts are not shared. Bhutani et al. sequenced single sperm from mice, cattle, and macaques to determine the extent of distortion in the expression of these putatively selfish transcripts, which the authors call genoinformative markers (GIMs). Investigating the evolutionary pressures on these GIMs, they found that they exhibited signatures of positive selection yet tend to be biased toward sperm function. This observation explains why, relative to other tissues, testis shows distinctive gene expression patterns. Science , this issue p. eabb1723"
https://openalex.org/W3118417918,"Backgrounds An estimated 2.5 million Afghans are living in the Iran and almost half of them are young women at the childbearing ages. Although the evidence indicates lower rates of antenatal care and higher incidence of pregnancy complications in Afghan compared to Iranian women, the underlying reasons are not well defined. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to explore the prevalence and associated sociodemographic factors of adverse pregnancy outcomes and examine the impact of intimate partner violence, food insecurity, poor mental health, and housing issues on pregnancy outcome in Afghan women living in Iran. Methods In July 2019, we enrolled 424 Afghan women aged 18–44 years old using the time-location sampling at three community health centers in the south region of Tehran province. The data was collected through face to face interviews using the researcher-developed questionnaire. Using bivariate and multivariate analysis, the impact of poor antenatal care, intimate partner violence, food insecurity, and poor mental health was assessed on the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome. Results More than half (56.6%) of Afghan women reported at least one pregnancy complication in their recent pregnancy. The results showed that undocumented, illiterate, and unemployed Afghan women with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, we observed lower prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes among documented immigrants with health insurance compared to those with no health insurance. It is also been found that the food insecurity [Adjusted OR = 3.35, 95% CI (1.34–8.36)], poor antenatal care [Adjusted OR = 10.50, 95% CI (5.40–20.39)], intimate partner violence [Adjusted OR = 2.72, 95% CI (1.10–6.77)], and poor mental health [Adjusted OR = 4.77, 95% CI (2.54–8.94)] could adversely impact the pregnancy outcome and we observed higher incidence of adverse outcomes among those suffering from these situations. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study that explored the prevalence and associated factors of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the impact of intimate partner violence, food insecurity, poor mental health on pregnancy outcome among Afghan women in Iran. Enhancing the psychosocial support and empowering Afghan women through expanding the social network and safety net should be a priority for the central government and international parties. Psychological counseling should be incorporated into routine maternity care for Afghan refugees. Access to free antenatal care is a right for all Afghan women and it should be facilitated by universal health insurance for all Afghans regardless of their legal status."
https://openalex.org/W3120366519,"Backgrounds Validated tools for predicting individual in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 are lacking. We aimed to develop and to validate a simple clinical prediction rule for early identification of in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19. Methods and findings We enrolled 2191 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from three Italian dedicated units (derivation cohort: 1810 consecutive patients from Bergamo and Pavia units; validation cohort: 381 consecutive patients from Rome unit). The outcome was in-hospital mortality. Fine and Gray competing risks multivariate model (with discharge as a competing event) was used to develop a prediction rule for in-hospital mortality. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and by Brier score in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Seven variables were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality: age (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07–1.09), male sex (HR 1.62, 95%CI 1.30–2.00), duration of symptoms before hospital admission &lt;10 days (HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.39–2.12), diabetes (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.02–1.45), coronary heart disease (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.09–1.80), chronic liver disease (HR 1.78, 95%CI 1.16–2.72), and lactate dehydrogenase levels at admission (HR 1.0003, 95%CI 1.0002–1.0005). The AUC was 0.822 (95%CI 0.722–0.922) in the derivation cohort and 0.820 (95%CI 0.724–0.920) in the validation cohort with good calibration. The prediction rule is freely available as a web-app (COVID-CALC: https://sites.google.com/community.unipa.it/covid-19riskpredictions/c19-rp ). Conclusions A validated simple clinical prediction rule can promptly and accurately assess the risk for in-hospital mortality, improving triage and the management of patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3118717598,"GPER1 in utero to the rescue! Several common pathogens, including influenza A virus (IAV), can activate systemic type I interferon (IFN) signaling during pregnancy. Such infections would be expected to cause birth defects and fetal mortality, but maternal IAV infections rarely produce such effects, suggesting the presence of a protective mechanism in fetal tissues. Harding et al. used a CRISPR screen to uncover IFN regulators that can mediate differential IFN control across tissues in human cell lines. They found that G protein–coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1), which is expressed in fetal tissues, acts as a protective suppressor of IFN responses in the placenta during maternal infection. In a mouse model, pharmacological activation of GPER1 shielded fetuses from maternal inflammation. Activation of GPER1 might be promising therapeutically to protect the fetus from both maternal and fetal infections. Science , this issue p. 271"

https://openalex.org/W3119749010,"Not so different Humans often focus on how different we are from other animals. Certainly, there are some important differences, but more and more we are learning that we differ by degree rather than kind. We see these similarities most clearly when we look at human populations that live a more traditional, foraging lifestyle. Barsbai et al. compared more than 300 such foraging human populations with mammal and bird species living in the same environment across a wide array of environmental conditions (see the Perspective by Hill and Boyd). They found that all three groups converged with regard to foraging, social, and reproductive behaviors. Thus, adaptation to environmental selection shapes similar responses across a wide diversity of life forms. Science , this issue p. 292 ; see also p. 235"
https://openalex.org/W3118596417,"Background Improving hand hygiene in hospitals is the most efficient method to prevent healthcare-associated infections. The hand hygiene behavior of hospital patients and visitors is not well-researched, although they pose a risk for the transmission of pathogens. Therefore, the present study had three aims: (1) Finding a suitable theoretical model to explain patients’ and visitors’ hand hygiene practice; (2) Identifying important predictors for their hand hygiene behavior; and (3) Comparing the essential determinants of hand hygiene behavior between healthcare professionals from the literature to our non-professional sample. Methods In total N = 1,605 patients and visitors were surveyed on their hand hygiene practice in hospitals. The employed questionnaires were based on three theoretical models: a) the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB); b) the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA); and c) the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. To compare our results to the determinants of healthcare workers’ hand hygiene behavior, we searched for studies that used one of the three theoretical models. Results Among patients, 52% of the variance in the hand hygiene behavior was accounted for by the TDF domains, 44% by a modified HAPA model, and 40% by the TPB factors. Among visitors, these figures were 59%, 37%, and 55%, respectively. Two clusters of variables surfaced as being essential determinants of behavior: self-regulatory processes and social influence processes. The critical determinants for healthcare professionals’ hand hygiene reported in the literature were similar to the findings from our non-professional sample. Conclusions The TDF was identified as the most suitable model to explain patients’ and visitors’ hand hygiene practices. Patients and visitors should be included in existing behavior change intervention strategies. Newly planned interventions should focus on targeting self-regulatory and social influence processes to improve effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3120437545,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a huge challenge to healthcare systems and their personnel worldwide. The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW), through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas in healthcare organizations. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk. Methods and findings This is a cross-sectional and incidence study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the Occupational Health Service (OHS) for confirmed exposure and/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and/or rRT-PCR positive detection) was 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p = 0.0009), including when data were also classified by age. COVID-19 cumulative prevalence among the HCW assigned to medical departments was higher (25.2%) than others, as well as among medical staff (25.4%) compared with other professional categories (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCW of our centre has been 19.9%. Doctors and medical services personnel have had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of them have not presented compatible symptoms. This emphasizes the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most exposed health personnel and not only based on the appearance of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3120995616,"The etiology of vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) remains unclear; however, alterations in cutaneous and gut microbiota may be contributing to the pathogenesis of this inflammatory condition. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot case-control study, obtaining dermal swab and stool samples from prepubertal girls with vulvar LS (n = 5), girls with nonspecific vulvovaginitis (n = 5), and healthy controls (n = 3). Samples (n = 56) were subjected to total DNA extractions. Resulting DNA was purified, subjected to PCR (targeting the V3V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene), sequenced, and analyzed using QIIME, MetagenomeSeq, and DESeq2 software packages. Our findings showed that there were significant differences in the cutaneous and gut microbiotas of girls with LS compared to controls. On the skin, girls with LS had a statistically significantly higher relative abundance of Porphyromonas spp., Parvimonas spp., Peptoniphilus spp., Prevotella spp., Dialister spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp., but a lower relative abundance of Cornyebacterium compared to the control group. In the gut samples, girls with LS had a significantly higher relative abundance of Dialister spp., Clostridiales spp., Paraprevotella spp., Escherichia coli , Bifidobacterium adolescentis , and Akkermansia muciniphila , and a lower relative abundance of Roseburia faecis and Ruminococcus bromii compared to controls. These results suggest a potential association between cutaneous and gut dysbiosis and pediatric vulvar LS. Future studies involving larger samples sizes are warranted to further evaluate this association."
https://openalex.org/W3118547077,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe since December 2019 creating much uncertainty among medical staff. Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. Methods The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. Results 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one’s financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one’s financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08–1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22–1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01–1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55–2.39]). Feeling burdened by thoughts about virus contraction at work was also significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.33 [1.07–1.64]), caring for children (1.33 [1.07–1.66]), depression (1.54 [1.18–2.00]), and anxiety (4.71 [3.71–5.98]). Conclusions This study provides novel evidence regarding major SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related stressors among medical assistants and suggests need for special support for medical assistants caring for children and working in specialist practices."
https://openalex.org/W3120956778,"Background The single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide ( D LCO ) interpretation needs the comparison of measured values to reference values. In 2017, the Global Lung Function Initiative published new reference values (GLI-2017) for D LCO , alveolar volume ( V A ) and transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide ( K CO ). We aimed to assess the applicability of GLI-2017 reference values for D LCO on a large population by comparing them to the European Community of Steel and Coal equations of 1993 (ECSC-93) widely used. Methods In this retrospective study, spirometric indices, total lung capacity, D LCO , V A and K CO were measured in adults classified in 5 groups (controls, asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial lung diseases (ILD)). Statistical analysis comparing the 2 equations sets were stratified by sex. Results 4180 tests were included. GLI-2017 z-scores of the 3 D LCO indices of the controls (n = 150) are nearer to 0 (expected value in a normal population) than ECSC-93 z-scores. All groups combined, in both genders, D LCO GLI-2017 z-scores and %predicted are significantly higher than ECSC z-scores and %predicted. In the ILD group, differences between the 2 equation sets depend on the D LCO impairment severity: GLI-2017 z-scores are higher than ECSC z-scores in patients with no or “mild” decrease in D LCO , but are lower in “moderate” or “severe” decrease. Conclusion GLI-2017 reference values for D LCO are more suitable to our population and influence the diagnostic criteria and severity definition of several lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3121030511,"The prevalence of stunting, wasting, overweight and their coexistence are various in different populations and they also have changed with social developing and environmental improving. In this paper, we aimed to analyze the prevalence of stunting, wasting, overweight and their coexistence in some developed regions of China. Data were collected in a population-based cross-sectional survey by a multi-stage cluster sampling method in nine cities located in the northern, central, and southern region of China in 2016. Children under seven years (n = 110,491) were measured. WHO growth standards were used to assess the growth status. Stunting, underweight, wasting, overweight and obesity were considered as the primary forms of malnutrition (includes undernutrition and overnutrition) for infant or young children at population-levels. The prevalence of stunting, underweight, wasting, and overweight or obesity were respectively 0.7%, 0.6%, 1.2%, and 7.6%. Most of these children (95.4%) suffered from one form of malnutrition, and only 0.2% of them concurrently stunted and wasted, 0.4% concurrently stunted and overweight, 1.7% concurrently stunted and underweight, 2.3% concurrently underweight and wasted. Among stunted children, 91.2% were appropriate body proportion, and only 2.3% were wasted, 6.5% were overweight or obesity. Among overweight or obese children, only 0.6% were stunted, whereas, 15.8% were high stature and 83.6% were the appropriate ranges of stature. Sex, age, urban/suburban, and region were associated with these primary forms of malnutrition in the multivariate logistic analysis. In conclusion, we found that the coexistence of stunting and overweight was not common at both population-level and individual-level. The situation for undernutrition had significantly improved, and overweight may be the leading public health issue for children under seven years in the nine cities of China."
https://openalex.org/W3122760501,"The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of the Garfagnina (GRF) goat, a breed that currently risks extinction. For this purpose, 48 goats were genotyped with the Illumina CaprineSNP50 BeadChip and analyzed together with 214 goats belonging to 9 other Italian breeds (~25 goats/breed), whose genotypes were available from the AdaptMap project [Argentata (ARG), Bionda dell’Adamello (BIO), Ciociara Grigia (CCG), Di Teramo (DIT), Garganica (GAR), Girgentana (GGT), Orobica (ORO), Valdostana (VAL) and Valpassiria (VSS)]. Comparative analyses were conducted on i) runs of homozygosity (ROH), ii) admixture ancestries and iii) the accuracy of breed traceability via discriminant analysis on principal components (DAPC) based on cross-validation. ROH analyses was used to assess the genetic diversity of GRF, while admixture and DAPC to evaluate its relationship to the other breeds. For GRF, common ROH (more than 45% in GRF samples) was detected on CHR 12 at, roughly 50.25–50.94Mbp (ARS1 assembly), which spans the CENPJ (centromere protein) and IL17D (interleukin 17D) genes. The same area of common ROH was also present in DIT, while a broader region (~49.25–51.94Mbp) was shared among the ARG, CCG, and GGT. Admixture analysis revealed a small region of common ancestry from GRF shared by BIO, VSS, ARG and CCG breeds. The DAPC model yielded 100% assignment success for GRF. Overall, our results support the identification of GRF as a distinct native Italian goat breed. This work can contribute to planning conservation programmes to save GRF from extinction and will improve the understanding of the socio-agro-economic factors related with the farming of GRF."

Survey of human oxidoreductases and cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic and natural chemicals.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2015; 28: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Of the 57 human P450 enzymes, P450 3A4 is the most abundant, being located in liver and small intestine. Originally characterized as the enzyme involved in the oxidation of the antihypertensive drug nifedipine (3Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J.

Its prominence among the P450s can be rationalized in the context of its high expression levels (5Guengerich F.P. Human cytochrome P450 enzymes.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

The prominent role of P450 3A4 in drug metabolism makes it a site of binding of inhibitors as well as substrates, and P450 3A4 is considered to be a major locus for problems with drug–drug interactions (12Yu J.J. Zhou Z. Tay-Sontheimer J. Levy R.H. Ragueneau-Majlessi I. Risk of clinically relevant pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interactions with drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2013 and 2016.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2018; 46: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A recent analysis reported that of ∼150 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2013 and 2017, approximately 65% were P450 3A4 substrates, 30% were inhibitors, and 5% were inducers of the enzyme (6Hakkola J. Hukkanen J. Turpeinen M. Pelkonen O. Inhibition and induction of CYP enzymes in humans: an update.Arch. Toxicol. 2020; 94: 3671-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Adverse interactions are a major medical issue and responsible for many hospitalizations and deaths (13Montané E. Arellano A.L. Sanz Y. Roca J. Farre M. Drug-related deaths in hospital inpatients: a retrospective cohort study.Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2018; 84: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). P450s, including P450 3A4, are subject to the same types of inhibition that enzymes generally are, both reversible and irreversible (14Segel I.H. 3. Simple inhibition systems.Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1975: 109Google Scholar, 15Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis for the New Enzymology.1st Ed. KinTek, Austin, TX2019Google Scholar). Reversible inhibition can be competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive (although a good example for P450 is missing), or “mixed” (a rather nonmechanistic term). Irreversible inhibition of P450s is generally mechanism based or suicidal, in which either the protein or heme is modified (16Correia M.A. Hollenberg P.F. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 4th Ed. Springer, New York, NY2015: 177-259Google Scholar). Quasi-irreversible inhibition for P450s involves oxidation to a carbene or C-nitroso group that binds tightly to the ferrous form of the iron (17Mansuy D. Battioni J.P. Chottard J.C.

However, even with inhibitors that have been extensively studied (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir), there is considerable variability of reported inhibition constants (19Greenblatt D.J.

The binding of a ligand to a P450 often (but not always) involves a change in the UV–visible absorbance spectrum, usually observed in the Soret band. A shift of the iron from a resting low-spin state to high-spin state, associated with at least a partial loss of the H2O ligand to the iron, is termed type I change (λmax ∼390 nm). Type II change involves the formation of a low-spin iron bound to a nitrogen atom of a ligand (λmax ∼430 nm) (28Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Spectral studies of drug interaction with hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450.Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). These changes can be used to characterize the binding affinity of P450 and ligands. Alternate modes of binding, e.g., with an H2O molecule “sandwiched” between the iron atom and a ligand, have also been described (29Mast N. Zheng W. Stout C.D. Pikuleva I.A. Binding of a cyano- and fluoro-containing drug bicalutamide to cytochrome P450 46A1: unusual features and spectral response.J. Biol.

S. A. 2006; 103: 13682-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) evidence for multiple occupancy by ligands have been presented. Although the binding of ligands to P450s had generally been considered to be rapid, we reported that the binding of both substrates (33Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P.

Chem. 2007; 282: 6863-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was a multiphasic process and consisted of multiple steps, a phenomenon confirmed by Sevrioukova and Poulos (26Sevrioukova I.F. Poulos T.L. Structure and mechanism of the complex between cytochrome P450 3A4 and ritonavir.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 3510-3517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanism has been interpreted in terms of a multistep process in which binding first occurs at a peripheral site (10Williams P.A. Cosme J. Vinkovic D.M. Ward A. Angove H.C. Day P.J. Vonrhein C. Tickle I.J. Jhoti H. Crystal structures of human cytochrome P450 3A4 bound to metyrapone and progesterone.Science. 2004; 305: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and then the ligand is delivered to the area near the heme iron, where the spectral change is manifested (33Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. Kinetics and thermodynamics of ligand binding by cytochrome P450 3A4.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P.

Chem. 2012; 287: 3510-3517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Alternate proposals for multistep binding of azoles have also been presented (37Pearson J.T. Hill J.J. Swank J. Isoherranen N. Kunze K.L. Atkins W.M. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of antifungal azoles binding to CYP3A4 with kinetic resolution of multiple binding orientations.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6341-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the kinetics of the spectral changes of inhibitor binding could be modeled in terms of three steps (34Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. Multiple sequential steps involved in the binding of inhibitors to cytochrome P450 3A4.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6863-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), there are deficiencies in the system. We subsequently showed that substrate binding to P450 3A4 is dominated by a “conformational selection” model, as opposed to induced fit (38Guengerich F.P. Wilkey C.J. Phan T.T.N. Human cytochrome P450 enzymes bind drugs and other substrates mainly through conformational-selection modes.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 10928-10941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as in the case of P450 17A1 (39Guengerich F.P. Wilkey C.J. Glass S.M. Reddish M.J. Conformational selection dominates binding of steroids to human cytochrome P450 17A1.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 10028-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results indicate that multiple species of P450 3A4 are in equilibrium in the absence of ligand, and one (or more) of these conformations then binds the ligand. The previously described model did not contain this element (33Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. Kinetics and thermodynamics of ligand binding by cytochrome P450 3A4.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. Multiple sequential steps involved in the binding of inhibitors to cytochrome P450 3A4.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6863-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent work with human P450 17A1 and two azole-based inhibitors showed the existence of a series of intermediate spectra on the pathway to the final type II complex, including an initial complex with some type I high-spin iron character (40Child S.A. Guengerich F.P. Multistep binding of the non-steroidal inhibitors orteronel and seviteronel to human cytochrome P450 17A1 and relevance to inhibition of enzyme activity.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The conclusion from the latter study was that the enzyme inhibition was associated with the initial complex formed with the inhibitor. However, the system was not analyzed using pre–steady-state kinetics of product formation, and Cheong et al. (41Cheong E.J.Y. Nair P.C. Neo R.W.Y. Tu H.T. Lin F. Chiong E. Esuvaranathan K. Fan H. Szmulewitz R.Z. Peer C.J. Figg W.D. Chai C.L.L. Miners J.O. Chan E.C.Y. Slow-, tight-binding inhibition of CYP17A1 by abiraterone redefines its kinetic selectivity and dosing regimen.J. Pharmacol. Expt. Therapeut. 2020; 374: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have interpreted the results of binding of a different pyridine-based inhibitor (abiraterone) in the context of the phenomenon known as slow and tight-binding inhibition. The nature of the binding of five known (and clinically relevant) inhibitors to P450 3A4 (Fig. 1) was further characterized using kinetic and spectral approaches. The results are interpreted in terms of a multistate reversible process in which the strongest inhibition is associated with the final type II low-spin complex. The kinetics of the process may be relevant to the phenomenon of time-dependent inhibition seen with P450 3A4 and numerous other drugs (20Zimmerlin A. Trunzer M. Faller B. CYP3A time-dependent inhibition risk assessment validated with 400 reference drugs.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2011; 39: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The addition of 7-benzoyl (7-OBz) quinoline to P450 3A4 induced type I difference spectrum (Fig. S1A), indicative of a low- to-high spin conversion of the iron atom (28Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Spectral studies of drug interaction with hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450.Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). A titration yielded a Kd of 90 μM (Fig. S1B). In contrast to several other P450 3A4 substrates (33Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. Kinetics and thermodynamics of ligand binding by cytochrome P450 3A4.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38Guengerich F.P. Wilkey C.J. Phan T.T.N. Human cytochrome P450 enzymes bind drugs and other substrates mainly through conformational-selection modes.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 10928-10941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the binding of 7-OBz quinoline was rapid, with >90% of the change finished in the first 200 ms (Fig. S1C). The estimated (single exponential) kobs was 27 ± 1 s−1 at a 7-OBz quinoline concentration of 62 μM. The Km for 7-OBz O-demethylation in a reconstituted P450 3A4 system (42Shaw P.M. Hosea N.A. Thompson D.V. Lenius J.M. Guengerich F.P. Reconstitution premixes for assays using purified recombinant human cytochrome P450, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and cytochrome b5.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Elucidation of distinct ligand binding sites for cytochrome P450 3A4.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) was 21 ± 3 μM, and the kcat was 58 min−1 (Fig. S2). The five inhibitors (Fig. 1) were tested for their ability to inhibit the testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity of P450 3A4 (Fig. 2). As expected, all were highly effective. All five were also potent inhibitors of P450 3A4–catalyzed 7-OBz quinoline O-debenzylation activity. The IC50 values were submicromolar in all cases except for itraconazole, which presented technical problems because of solubility (see later). However, the low micromolar IC50 values for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation are consistent with the 7-OBz quinoline inhibition results. Even though there is some evidence for differences in the P450 reactions with the two substrates (44Lu P. Lin Y. Rodrigues A.D. Rushmore T.H. Baillie T.A. Shou M.G. Testosterone, 7-benzyloxyquinoline, and 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin bind to different domains within the active site of cytochrome P450 3A4.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1473-1479PubMed Google Scholar), the general similarity of the IC50 values for the two reactions suggests that the use of the continuous fluorescence assay with 7-OBz quinoline is valid as a surrogate for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation. If an enzyme is inactivated by a mechanism-based inhibitor, the inactivation is generally irreversible and cannot be rescued by the addition of substrates (45Abeles R.H. Maycock A.L. Suicide enzyme inactivators.Acc. Chem. Res. 1976; 9: 313-319Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, in slow tight-binding inhibition, the conformation of the inhibitor-bound enzyme is in equilibrium with a form in which inhibitor can be released and replaced with substrate (46Silverman R.B. Mechanism-based enzyme inactivators.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 240-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). P450 3A4, in the presence of an equimolar concentration of each inhibitor (Fig. 1), was mixed with an NADPH-generating system, and then the substrate 7-OBz quinoline was added to initiate the O-debenzylation reaction. Extrapolation of the linear phases of the data showed lag phases of ∼45, 15, and 25 s for clotrimazole, ritonavir, and indinavir, respectively (Fig. 3). The Kd for 7-OBz quinoline (90 μM, see previously) and its rate of conversion to (the fluorescent) product was used in KinTek Explorer (KinTek) modeling, but the output showed that the lags could be explained by a two-species and very tight-binding mechanism (results not presented), and alternate strategies to elucidating the kinetic mechanism were considered. In an alternate approach to the analysis of P450 3A4 inhibition, 7-OBz quinoline reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of both NADPH and an inhibitor to a reconstituted P450 3A4 system, using a stopped-flow fluorimeter (Fig. 4), to allow for pre–steady-state kinetic analysis. The initial binding of the inhibitors is rapid (see later), and there was no detectable lag for P450 reduction by NADPH–P450 reductase under these conditions, as indicated in the traces without inhibitor. These experiments are sensitive to the concentration of inhibitor, in that useful kinetic data cannot be obtained when inhibition is either too weak or too strong, in that the curvature is important in analysis of the plots (40Child S.A. Guengerich F.P. Multistep binding of the non-steroidal inhibitors orteronel and seviteronel to human cytochrome P450 17A1 and relevance to inhibition of enzyme activity.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This kinetic approach also relies on the use of many data points, and a continuous trace of product formation is ideal. A curvilinear approach to steady-state inhibition was not apparent in the case of itraconazole, but curvature was observed with the four other inhibitors at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 4). For instance, with ketoconazole (Fig. 4A), the r2 value was 0.99 for the line obtained with the uninhibited reaction but only 0.92 and 0.91 with the ketoconazole concentrations of 0.06 and 0.2 μM, respectively. The plots were analyzed by a combination log-linear equation of the form y = A0(1 − e−k1t) + ksst, where k1 is the exponential rate of approach to the steady state and kss is the steady-state rate. The estimated rates and half-lives are listed in Table 1. Although the fitting is reminiscent of burst kinetic behavior (i.e., in which a rate-limiting step follows product formation [15Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis for the New Enzymology.1st Ed. KinTek, Austin, TX2019Google Scholar, 78Guengerich F.P.

https://openalex.org/W3119632003,"Objectives High-risk CXR features in COVID-19 are not clearly defined. We aimed to identify CXR features that correlate with severe COVID-19. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted within the study period were screened. Those with suboptimal baseline CXR were excluded. CXRs were reviewed by three independent radiologists and opacities recorded according to zones and laterality. The primary endpoint was defined as hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, and CXR features were assessed for association with this endpoint to identify high-risk features. These features were then used to define criteria for a high-risk CXR, and clinical features and outcomes of patients with and without baseline high-risk CXR were compared using logistic regression analysis. Results 109 patients were included. In the initial analysis of 40 patients (36.7%) with abnormal baseline CXR, presence of bilateral opacities, multifocal opacities, or any upper or middle zone opacity were associated with supplemental oxygen requirement. Of the entire cohort, 29 patients (26.6%) had a baseline CXR with at least one of these features. Having a high-risk baseline CXR was significantly associated with requiring supplemental oxygen in univariate (odds ratio 14.0, 95% confidence interval 3.90–55.60) and multivariate (adjusted odds ratio 8.38, 95% CI 2.43–28.97, P = 0.001) analyses. Conclusion We identified several high-risk CXR features that are significantly associated with severe illness. The association of upper or middle zone opacities with severe illness has not been previously emphasized. Recognition of these specific high-risk CXR features is important to prioritize limited healthcare resources for sicker patients."
https://openalex.org/W3120263041,"Alpine ski racers require diverse physical capabilities. While enhanced force production is considered key to high-level skiing, its relevance is convoluted. The aims of this study were to i) clarify the association between performance path length and velocity, ii) test the importance of radial force, and iii) explore the contribution of force magnitude and orientation to turn performance. Ski athletes ( N = 15) were equipped with ski-mounted force plates and a global navigation satellite system to compute the following variables over 14 turns: path length ( L ), velocity normalized energy dissipation [Δ e mech / v in ], radial force [ F r ], total force (both limbs [ F tot ], the outside limb, and the difference between limbs), and a ratio of force application ( RF = F r / F tot ). Data were course-averaged or separated into sectional turn groupings, averaged, and entered into stepped correlation and regression models. Our results support Δ e mech / v in as a discriminative performance factor ( R 2 = 0.50–0.74, p &lt; .003), except in flat sections. Lower course times and better Δ e mech / v in were associated with greater F r ( R 2 = 0.34–0.69 and 0.31–0.52, respectively, p &lt; .032), which was related to both F tot and RF ( β = 0.92–1.00 and 0.63–0.81, respectively, p &lt; .001) which varied in predictive order throughout the sections. F tot was associated with increased outside limb force and a more balanced contribution of each limb ( β = 1.04–1.18 and -0.65– -0.92, respectively, p &lt; .001). F r can be improved by either increasing total force output or by increasing technical effectiveness (i.e., proportionally more force radially) which should increase the trajectories available to the skier on the ski course."
https://openalex.org/W3120680097,"Background To combat social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19, Canadian communities began a Facebook social media movement, #Caremongering, to support vulnerable individuals in their communities. Little research has examined the spread and use of #Caremongering to address community health and social needs. Objectives We examined the rate at which #Caremongering grew across Canada, the main ways the groups were used, and differences in use by membership size and activity. Methods We searched Facebook Groups using the term “Caremongering” combined with the names of the largest population centres in every province and territory in Canada. We extracted available Facebook analytics on all the groups found, restricted to public groups that operated in English. We further conducted a content analysis of themes from postings in 30 groups using purposive sampling. Posted content was qualitatively analyzed to determine consistent themes across the groups and between those with smaller and larger member numbers. Results The search of Facebook groups across 185 cities yielded 130 unique groups, including groups from all 13 provinces and territories in Canada. Total membership across all groups as of May 4, 2020 was 194,879. The vast majority were formed within days of the global pandemic announcement, two months prior. There were four major themes identified: personal protective equipment, offer, need, and information. Few differences were found between how large and small groups were being used. Conclusions The #Caremongering Facebook groups spread across the entire nation in a matter of days, engaging hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Social media appears to be a useful tool for spreading community-led solutions to address health and social needs."

Thus, heritage tourism has become the engine of economic activities diversification. This study aims to identify a decision-making-model substantiating algorithm in order to support the local heritage capitalization (lesser known on the international cultural consumption market), based on three types of qualitative researches, and the improved Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. In case of lesser known heritage, trademark potential and international cultural tourism route for heritage capitalization are smart choices for the innovative local hub development. The developed AHP version allows for a broader investigation of the characteristics that can lead to a trademark associated development based on integrated and innovative tourism products. To substantiate our approach and validate the model, we conducted a pilot study on a geographic area (Southern Transylvania, Romania), slightly exploited from the perspective of heritage potential, and characterized by a combination of heritage assets. The study’s results can be used by local authorities as a foundation for sound and strategic development of the area with economic potential from tangible and intangible heritage (re)interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W3119335560,"Maternal undernutrition has detrimental effects on fetal development and adult health. Total caloric restriction during early pregnancy followed by adequate nutrition for the remainder of gestation, is particularly linked to cardiovascular and metabolic disease risks during adulthood. The placenta is responsible for transport of nutrients from the maternal to fetal circulation, and the efficiency with which it does so can be adjusted to the maternal nutrient supply. There is evidence that placental adaptations to nutrient restriction in early pregnancy may be retained even when adequate nutrition is restored later in pregnancy, leading to a potential mismatch between placental efficiency and maternal nutrient supplies. However, in the mouse, 50% caloric restriction from days 1.5–11.5 of gestation, while temporarily altering placental structure and gene expression, had no significant effect on day 18.5. The periconceptional period, during which oocyte maturation, fertilization, and preimplantation development occur may be especially critical in creating lasting impact on the placenta. Here, mice were subjected to 50% caloric restriction from 3 weeks prior to pregnancy through d11.5, and then placental structure, the expression of key nutrient transporters, and global DNA methylation levels were examined at gestation d18.5. Prior exposure to caloric restriction increased maternal blood space area, but decreased expression of the key System A amino acid transporter Slc38a4 at d18.5. Neither placental and fetal weights, nor placental DNA methylation levels were affected. Thus, total caloric restriction beginning in the periconceptional period does have a lasting impact on placental development in the mouse, but without changing placental efficiency."

Population Stillbirths and neonatal deaths with a birth weight above 1000 grams born between October 16 th 2017 to May 31 st 2018. Methods Clinical information and an adapted WHO ICD-PM interactive excel-based system were used to capture and classify the deaths according to timing, causes and associated maternal complications. Descriptive analysis was performed. Main outcome measures Timing and causes of perinatal mortality and their associated maternal conditions. Results There were 661 perinatal deaths of which 248 (37.5%) were neonatal deaths and 413 (62.5%) stillbirths. Of the stillbirths, 128 (31%) occurred antepartum, 129 (31%) intrapartum and for 156 (38%) the timing was unknown. Half (n = 64/128) of the antepartum stillbirths were unexplained. Two-thirds (67%, n = 87/129) of intrapartum stillbirths followed acute intrapartum events, and 30% (39/129) were unexplained. Of the neonatal deaths, 40% died after complications of intrapartum events. Conclusion Problems of documentation, lack of perinatal death audits, capacity for investigations, and guidelines for the unambiguous objective assignment of timing and primary causes of death are major threats for accurate determination of timing and specific primary causes of perinatal deaths."

https://openalex.org/W3119897532,"Background The burden of psychological distress is increasing with the spread of the pandemic and also with the enforcement of its containment measures. The aim of this research was to determine the proportion of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and degrees of resilient coping, and to also investigate the relationship of loneliness, coping and other variables with psychological distress among apparently healthy Indians during nation-wide lockdown period. Methods A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey using pre-designed pre-tested Google form disseminated via different social media platforms was conducted. A total of 1249 responses were analysed all over India. The form enquired about Socio-demographic profile, awareness on COVID pandemic and cases in the surroundings. UCLA Loneliness scale, Brief resilience and coping scale (BRCS) and Psychological distress scale (K6) assessed self-reported loneliness, coping and psychological distress, respectively. Special regressor technique adjusting for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity was used to extract the average marginal effects. Results Majority of the respondents were 18–35 years old, male, single and urban residents. News media, social media mostly acted as sources of information regarding COVID related news. Overall, 54.47% (95% CI: 51.39–57.53%) and 38.39% (95% CI: 35.57–41.29%) were reported to be lonely and had low resilient coping ability respectively. Around 44.68% had high risk of developing psychological distress. Being a student (average marginal effect coefficient (AME Coef ) . : -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.12, -0.01]) and perceiving lockdown as an effective measure (AME Coef : -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.19, -0.03]) were protective against psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with male respondents (AME Coef 0.07, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.11]), low or medium resilient copers (AME Coef 0.89, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.61]), and perceiving a serious impact of social distancing measures (AME Coef 0.17, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.26]). Conclusions Psychological distress among Indian population during lockdown was prevalent. Poor coping ability and perceiving social distancing to have a serious impact was found to be significantly contributing to psychological distress. Appropriate measures to address these issues would be beneficial for the community mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3119807977,"Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a highly sensitive technique that can be applied to analyze how genes are modulated by culture conditions, but identification of appropriate reference genes for normalization is a critical factor to be considered. For this reason, the expression stability of 18 candidate reference genes was evaluated for the green microalgae Tetraselmis chui using the widely employed algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, the comparative Δ C T method, and RefFinder. Microalgae samples were collected from large scale outdoor photobioreactors during the growing phase (OUT_GP), and during the semi-continuous phase at different times of the day (OUT_DC). Samples from standard indoor cultures under highly controlled conditions (IND) were also collected to complement the other data. Different rankings for the candidate reference genes were obtained depending on the culture conditions and the algorithm employed. After comparison of the achieved ranks with the different methods, the references genes selected for samples from specific culture conditions were ALD and EFL in OUT_GP, RPL32 and UBCE in OUT_DC, and cdkA and UBCE in IND. Moreover, the genes EFL and cdkA or EFL and UBCE appeared as appropriate combinations for pools generated from all samples (ALL). Examination in the OUT_DC cultures of genes encoding the large and small subunits of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ( AGPL and AGPS , respectively) confirmed the reliability of the identified reference genes, RPL32 and UBCE . The present study represents a useful contribution for studies of gene expression in T . chui , and also represents the first step to set-up an RT-qPCR platform for quality control of T . chui biomass production in industrial facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3120479918,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) controls eukaryotic mRNA quality, inducing the degradation of faulty transcripts. Key players in the NMD pathway were originally identified, through genetics, in Caenorhabditis elegans as smg (suppressor with morphological effect on genitalia) genes. Using forward genetics and fluorescence-based NMD reporters, we reexamined the genetic landscape underlying NMD. Employing a novel strategy for mapping sterile mutations, Het-Map, we identified clk-2 , a conserved gene previously implicated in DNA damage signaling, as a player in the nematode NMD. We find that CLK-2 is expressed predominantly in the germline, highlighting the importance of auxiliary factors in tissue-specific mRNA decay. Importantly, the human counterpart of CLK-2/TEL2, TELO2, has been also implicated in the NMD, suggesting a conserved role of CLK-2/TEL2 proteins in mRNA surveillance. Recently, variants of TELO2 have been linked to an intellectual disability disorder, the You-Hoover-Fong syndrome, which could be related to its function in the NMD."
https://openalex.org/W3118854447,"Endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are members of the family Coronaviridae . Comparing the findings of the infections caused by these viruses would help reveal the novel characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and provide insight into the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs infection in adult hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study was performed at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital in the Republic of Korea, between January 1, 2015, and July 31, 2020. A total of 109 consecutive patients who were over 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs were enrolled. Finally, 19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP were compared to 40 patients with endemic HCoV CAP. Flu-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia, and prolonged fever were more common in SARS-CoV-2 CAP, whereas clinical findings suggestive of bacterial pneumonia such as dyspnea, leukocytosis with left shift, and increased C-reactive protein were more common in endemic HCoV CAP. Bilateral peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were typical radiologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 CAP, whereas mixed patterns of GGOs, consolidations, micronodules, and pleural effusion were observed in endemic HCoV CAP. Coinfection was not observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP, but was observed in more than half of the patients with endemic HCoV CAP. There were distinctive differences in the clinical and radiologic findings between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoV CAP. Further investigations are required to elucidate the mechanism underlying this difference. Follow-up observations are needed to determine if the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 CAP changes with repeated infection."
https://openalex.org/W3121105430,"We use the Positions and Covering methodology to obtain exact solutions for the two-dimensional, non-guillotine restricted, strip packing problem. In this classical NP-hard problem, a given set of rectangular items has to be packed into a strip of fixed weight and infinite height. The objective consists in determining the minimum height of the strip. The Positions and Covering methodology is based on a two-stage procedure. First, it is generated, in a pseudo-polynomial way, a set of valid positions in which an item can be packed into the strip. Then, by using a set-covering formulation, the best configuration of items into the strip is selected. Based on the literature benchmark, experimental results validate the quality of the solutions and method’s effectiveness for small and medium-size instances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that generates optimal solutions for some literature instances for which the optimal solution was unknown before this study."
https://openalex.org/W3118759570,"This study aimed to evaluate the validity and precision of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for climacteric women using computational intelligence techniques. The instrument was applied to 873 women aged between 40 and 65 years. Considering the proposal to regroup the set of data related to the level of physical activity of climacteric women using the IPAQ, we used 2 algorithms: Kohonen and k-means, and, to evaluate the validity of these clusters, 3 indexes were used: Silhouette, PBM and Dunn. The questionnaire was tested for validity (factor analysis) and precision (Cronbach's alpha). The Random Forests technique was used to assess the importance of the variables that make up the IPAQ. To classify these variables, we used 3 algorithms: Suport Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree. The results of the tests to evaluate the clusters suggested that what is recommended for IPAQ, when applied to climacteric women, is to categorize the results into two groups. The factor analysis resulted in three factors, with factor 1 being composed of variables 3 to 6; factor 2 for variables 7 and 8; and factor 3 for variables 1 and 2. Regarding the reliability estimate, the results of the standardized Cronbach's alpha test showed values between 0.63 to 0.85, being considered acceptable for the construction of the construct. In the test of importance of the variables that make up the instrument, the results showed that variables 1 and 8 presented a lesser degree of importance and by the analysis of Accuracy, Recall, Precision and area under the ROC curve, there was no variation when the results were analyzed with all IPAQ variables but variables 1 and 8. Through this analysis, we concluded that the IPAQ, short version, has adequate measurement properties for the investigated population."
https://openalex.org/W3119598325,"Background Early distinguishing ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains difficult in the daily practice. However, this question appears clinically relevant, as treatments of VAT and VAP currently differ. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of sepsis criteria according to the Sepsis-3 definition in the early distinction between VAT and VAP. Methods Retrospective single-center cohort, including all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of VAT (n = 70) or VAP (n = 136), during a 2-year period. Accuracy of sepsis criteria according to Sepsis-3, total SOFA and respiratory SOFA, calculated at time of microbiological sampling were assessed in differentiating VAT from VAP, and in predicting mortality on ICU discharge. Results Sensitivity and specificity of sepsis criteria were found respectively at 0.4 and 0.91 to distinguish VAT from VAP, and at 0.38 and 0.75 for the prediction of mortality in VA-LRTI. A total SOFA ≥ 6 and a respiratory SOFA ≥ 3 were identified as the best cut-offs for these criteria in differentiating VAT from VAP, with sensitivity and specificity respectively found at 0.63 and 0.69 for total SOFA, and at 0.49 and 0.7 for respiratory SOFA. Additionally, for prediction of mortality, a total SOFA ≥ 7 and a respiratory SOFA = 4 were identified as the best-cut-offs, respectively yielding sensitivity and specificity at 0.56 and 0.61 for total SOFA, and at 0.22 and 0.95 for respiratory SOFA. Conclusions Sepsis criteria according to the Sepsis-3 definition show a high specificity but a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of VAP. Our results do not support the use of these criteria for the early diagnosis of VAP in patients with VA-LRTI."
https://openalex.org/W3120570676,"Nurses and surgeons must identify and handle specialized instruments with high temporal and spatial precision. It is crucial that they are trained effectively. Traditional training methods include supervised practices and text-based study, which may expose patients to undue risk during practice procedures and lack motor/haptic training respectively. Tablet-based simulations have been proposed to mediate some of these limitations. We implemented a learning task that simulates surgical instrumentation nomenclature encountered by novice perioperative nurses. Learning was assessed following training in three distinct conditions: tablet-based simulations, text-based study, and real-world practice. Immediately following a 30-minute training period, instrument identification was performed with comparable accuracy and response times following tablet-based versus text-based training, with both being inferior to real-world practice. Following a week without practice, response times were equivalent between real-world and tablet-based practice. While tablet-based training does not achieve equivalent results in instrument identification accuracy as real-world practice, more practice repetitions in simulated environments may help reduce performance decline. This project has established a technological framework to assess how we can implement simulated educational environments in a maximally beneficial manner."

The Insectarium de Bobo-Dioulasso (IBD) was created and equipped in the frame of Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) with the main goal to provide sterile males for the different eradication programs in West Africa which is already the case with the ongoing eradication program in Senegal. The aim of this study was to identify the best feeding regime in mass-rearing colonies of Glossina palpalis gambiensis to optimize the yield of sterile males. We investigated the mortality and fecundity for various feeding regimes and day alternation (3×: Monday-Wednesday-Friday, 4×: Monday-Wednesday-Friday-Saturday, 4×: Monday-Wednesday-Thursday-Friday and 6×: all days except Sunday) on adult tsetse flies in routine rearing over 60 days after emergence. The day alternation in the 4 blood meals per week (feeding regimes 2 and 3) had no effect on tsetse fly mortality and fecundity. The best feeding regime was the regime of 4 blood meals per week which resulted in higher significant fecundity (PPIF = 2.5; P = 0.003) combined with lower mortality of females (P = 0.0003) than the 3 blood meals per week (PPIF = 2.0) and in similar fecundity (PPIF = 2.6; P = 0.70) and mortality (P = 0.51) than the 6 blood meals per week. This feeding regime was extended to the whole colonies, resulting in an improved yield of sterile males for the ongoing eradication program in Senegal and would be more cost-effective for the implementation of the next-coming sterile insect technique (SIT) programs in West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3119189241,"The grain size analysis plays a significant role in any geotechnical study. The grain size analysis, by means of sieving, is usually used for coarse material of particle size &gt; 75 μm. For the fine material; the sedimentation methods are frequently adopted (e.g., hydrometers). Other methods also exist such as electron microscopy, digital image analysis and laser diffraction. The fine geomaterials commonly undergo agglomeration which makes the recognition of individual grain size using digital image analysis or electron microscopy challenging. To facilitate and enhance the grain-size analysis, this study was conducted using the Laser Diffraction System (LDS). Seven samples with different nature (composition and texture) and sources were analyzed by hydrometer and LDS. For LDS, various factors were studied such as air pressure, sonication, dilution, refractive index, and distribution method (volume or number). The results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively based on soil classification systems, fractal dimensions, and other parameters. Furthermore, this study provided a novel criterion to determine which LDS distribution method (volume or number) is to be used depending on the Liquid Limit. A combined sieve-LDS system is recommended to obtain the entire grain size distribution. It is concluded that the LDS is a viable technique that can replace the time-consuming hydrometer method to assess the grain-size distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3120454940,"Aims To evaluate the effects of no-suction femtosecond laser (FSL) stability on conjunctival autograft (CAG) dissection in pterygium surgery. Methods Prospective analysis of 35 eyes from 34 subjects who underwent femtosecond laser-assisted pterygium surgery with the Ziemer Z8 laser (Ophthalmic Systems AG, Switzerland). Intraoperative absolute FSL displacements were measured and correlated with the duration and ease of CAG peel, CAG thickness, measured with intraoperative optical coherence tomography, and deviation from intended graft thickness. Results The median absolute FSL displacement was 22 μm (interquartile range [IQR] 14.7 to 60.8), while median vertical FSL displacement was 14.7 μm (IQR 7.3 to 44) and median horizontal FSL displacement was 22.0 μm (IQR 14.7 to 44). 65.7% had a grade 1 peel, 11.4% had grade 2 peel, 14.3% had grade 3 peel and 8.6% had grade 4 peel. The median duration of CAG peel was 5.4 seconds (IQR 3 to 21.4). The median CAG thickness was 69 μm (IQR 60.3 to 78.5), and the median deviation from targeted graft thickness was 9 μm (IQR 1 to 16). Eyes with more difficult peels and longer duration of CAG peels had significantly greater vertical FSL displacements (p = 0.04 and 0.02 respectively), but not horizontal displacement, age, ethnicity, CAG thickness or deviation from original thickness, compared to those with better quality and shorter duration peels. 1 eye (2.9%) had an incomplete CAG peel with a buttonhole and 2 eyes had graft tears (5.7%). Conclusion Micro-displacements during the suction-free CAG preparation are common but they did not affect the quality of the CAG peel, duration of peel, or CAG thickness. However, vertical globe displacement during FSL-assisted CAG creation was significantly associated with a more difficult and longer CAG peel duration. This highlights the importance of the cornea traction suture fixation to ensure stability of the eye during FSL application."
https://openalex.org/W3123425827,"In this paper, we make use of the replicating asset for statistical arbitrage trading, where the replicating asset is constructed by a portfolio that mimics the returns from a factor model. Using the replicating asset in the context of statistical arbitrage has never been done before in the literature. A novel optimal statistical arbitrage trading model is applied, and we derive the average transaction length and return for the Berkshire A stock and its replicating asset. The results show that the statistical arbitrage method proposed by Bertram (2010) is profitable by using the replicating asset. We also compute the average returns under different transaction costs. For the statistical arbitrage using the replicating asset of the factor model, average annual returns were at least 33%. Robustness is examined with the S&amp;P500. Our results can provide hedge fund managers with a new technique for conducting statistical arbitrage."

In this study, we estimate the distribution of sugarcane borers, Diatraea spp., under different climate scenarios (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85.) Insects were collected weekly in four sugarcane fields from four different towns in the department of Caldas (Colombia) during 2017, and also in several sugarcane fields in the Cauca River Valley (CRV) between 2010 and 2017. The influence of climatic variables on different agro-ecological zones of the CRV sugarcane fields was defined by climatic data between 2010 and 2017 (maximum and minimum daily temperatures, and accumulated precipitation). The estimate of an optimal niche for Diatraea spp. includes temperatures between 20°C and 23°C, accumulated annual rainfall between 1200 and 1500 mm, dry months with precipitations below 50 mm, slopes of less than 0.05 degrees, crop heterogeneity with an index of 0.2 and primary production values of 1.0. Data suggests Diatraea population is considerably influenced by adverse climate change effects, under the premise of an increase in local and global temperatures, reducing its population niches as well as the number of individuals."

It's 6 a.m. and I am working in the tissue culture room after an early start because of pandemic-related social distancing requirements. The message is probably from my family who live across the country, 3 hours ahead of me. I finish adding media to my cells, return the dishes to the incubator, take off my gloves, and grab my phone. I read the screen and let out a deep sigh. It's a WhatsApp message from my mom, with a link to a petition she started and wants me to sign."
