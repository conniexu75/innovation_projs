https://openalex.org/W2002395006,"IT would seem that some of the intriguing visual phenomena discussed by Dr. MacKay1 may be due, not to cerebral or retinal factors only, but at least in part to preretinal factors, namely, fluctuations of accommodation combined with lack of axial symmetry in the optical system of the eye. Helmholtz2 described how, when looking at a pattern consisting of black and white concentric circles, and thus similar to one of Dr. MacKay's, a complicated system of darker and brighter radial zones is seen. If accommodation, or the distance from the pattern to the eye, is slightly altered, the positions of the brighter zones vary and the observer sees them rotate rapidly to and fro. According to the above explanation the phenomenon is due to actual changes occurring in the image of the pattern formed on the retina. Unless such changes can be ruled out as a factor in Dr. MacKay's more complicated experiments, it does not seem possible to conclude that subjective impressions of movement received while the pattern is looked at, or in afterimages, are necessarily caused by the nervous system responding to a truly stationary light distribution in the optical image formed by the eye."

https://openalex.org/W1988746561,"RESULTS recently reported by Crampton et al. 1 lead those authors to the conclusion that the nucleohistones extracted from the different tissues of the same animal are very similar in composition. Our own investigations on different organs of the calf confirm these results (Table 1, Fig. 1)."
https://openalex.org/W2009446809,"WHEN amphibian eggs are exposed to a temperature shock a few minutes after fertilization, the second maturation division may be suppressed, and, by fusion of the haploid sperm with the diploid egg nucleus, triploid embryos may result1,2. In the earliest experiments of this type prolonged treatment with low temperatures (0° to +3° C.) was employed on eggs of Triturus viridescens3, but exposure of freshly laid eggs to a hot shock varying from 35–37° C. for from five to fifty minutes was found to be equally effective in this species4. These techniques have since been employed successfully on several species of Urodela and Anura. To the list of triploids produced experimentally, Xenopus laevis has now been added. This Anuran species is particularly suitable for this research, since reproduction can be induced throughout the year under laboratory conditions, and the young are easily reared, reaching maturity in less than one year."

https://openalex.org/W1973803231,"THE rate of equilibration of extra- and intracellular water is determined by the passage of the water through the cell membrane. The transfer of water through cell membranes can proceed by various mechanisms. The simplest mechanism is diffusion of water molecules as a whole. Another mechanism is a biological carrier system, such as exists, for example, in the tubular mechanism of the kidney; and another route of transfer is ionic migration of protons and hydroxyl ions independently through the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1999327633,"IT has recently been reported1 that an environmental temperature close to freezing point inhibited nerve regeneration in the rat's caudal nerve after crush injury. In these experiments only the peripheral part of the nerve was cooled, the temperature of the cell body being unaltered (for details, see Oamble and Jha2)."

During our investigation of this combination, a decreased growth-rate was noted in chickens fed for five days on an all-mash diet containing 100 p.p.m. of pyrimethamine."

https://openalex.org/W1981525816,"INTRACELLULAR proteolytic enzymes are present in many tissues and they hydrolyse proteins during autolysis. Some experimental data support the idea of a physiological action of these enzymes: the augmentation of catheptic activity during the regression of cancer1, and of larval tails of Xenopus 2. But it has been shown that intracellular protein degradation is dependent on energy3, and that o-fluorophenylalanine, a well-known anti-amino-acid, inhibits protein catabolism4,5. Steinberg et al. 5 also showed that this compound does not influence catheptic proteolysis. These observations lead to the supposition of a mechanism of protein degradation different from that of the simple catheptic hydrolysis. Similar conclusions are reported by Yakovlev6, who studied the action of phosphate, dinitrophenol and other substances on proteolysis of tissues. He reported also that fœtal tissues behave against dinitrophenol differently from the normal rat tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1985464231,A STATIONARY manometric respirometer for the simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and contraction amplitude of electrically stimulated muscle preparations has been developed1. It is necessary to immerse this apparatus in a water-bath having a temperature control of ±0.01° C.
