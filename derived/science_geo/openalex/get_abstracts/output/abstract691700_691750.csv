https://openalex.org/W4225660083,"The most commonly accepted hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid hypothesis caused due to formation of accumulation of Aβ42 isoform, which leads to neurodegeneration. In this regard, presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) and -2 (PSEN-2) proteins play a crucial role by altering the amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, affecting γ-secretase protease secretion, finally leading to the increased levels of Aβ. In the absence of reported commercial pharmacotherapeutic agents targeting presenilins, we aim to propose benzophenone integrated derivatives (BIDs) as the potential inhibitors of presenilin proteins through in silico approach. The study evaluates the interaction of BIDs through molecular docking simulations, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations. This is the first ever computational approach to discover the potential inhibitors of presenilin proteins. It also comprises druglikeliness and pharmacotherapeutic potential analysis of the compounds. Out of all the screened BIDs, BID-16 was found to be the lead compound against both the presenilin proteins. Based on these results, one can evaluate BID-16 as an anti-Alzheimer's potential specifically targeting presenilin proteins in near future using in vitro and in vivo methods."
https://openalex.org/W4223537954,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder for which dietary interventions can be a useful treatment. In recent years, the low-FODMAP approach is gaining traction in this regard. The fermentation of these non-absorbed carbohydrates by the gut microbiota can generate toxic glycating metabolites, such as methylglyoxal. These metabolites can have harmful effects by their role in the generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which activates Receptor for AGEs (AGER). Mast cells can be stimulated by AGEs and play a role in IBS. We have treated mice with lactose or fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), with or without co-administration of pyridoxamine and investigated the colonic mucus barrier. We have found that an increased intake of lactose and fructo-oligosaccharides induces a dysregulation of the colonic mucus barrier, increasing mucus discharge in empty colon, while increasing variability and decreasing average thickness mucus layer covering the fecal pellet. Changes were correlated with increased mast cell counts, pointing to a role for the crosstalk between these and goblet cells. Additionally, AGE levels in colonic epithelium were increased by treatment with the selected fermentable carbohydrates. Observed effects were prevented by co-treatment with anti-glycation agent pyridoxamine, implicating glycation processes in the negative impact of fermentable carbohydrate ingestion. This study shows that excessive intake of fermentable carbohydrates can cause colonic mucus barrier dysregulation in mice, by a process that involves glycating agents and increased mucosal mast cell counts."
https://openalex.org/W4229373697,"Arginine-serine (RS) domain(s) in splicing factors are critical for protein-protein interaction in pre-mRNA splicing. Phosphorylation of RS domain is important for splicing control and nucleocytoplasmic transport in the cell. RNA-binding motif 20 (RBM20) is a splicing factor primarily expressed in the heart. A previous study using phospho-antibody against RS domain showed that RS domain can be phosphorylated. However, its actual phosphorylation sites and function have not been characterized. Using middle-down mass spectrometry, we identified 16 phosphorylation sites, two of which (S638 and S640 in rats, or S637 and S639 in mice) were located in the RSRSP stretch in the RS domain. Mutations on S638 and S640 regulated splicing, promoted nucleocytoplasmic transport and protein-RNA condensates. Phosphomimetic mutations on S638 and S640 indicated that phosphorylation was not the major cause for RBM20 nucleocytoplasmic transport and condensation in vitro. We generated a S637A knock-in (KI) mouse model (Rbm20S637A ) and observed the reduced RBM20 phosphorylation. The KI mice exhibited aberrant gene splicing, protein condensates, and a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)-like phenotype. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that KI mice had altered expression and splicing of genes involving cardiac dysfunction, protein localization, and condensation. Our in vitro data showed that phosphorylation was not a direct cause for nucleocytoplasmic transport and protein condensation. Subsequently, the in vivo results reveal that RBM20 mutations led to cardiac pathogenesis. However, the role of phosphorylation in vivo needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4225850194,"Scorpion envenomation is a significant public health concern in São Paulo, Brazil, and its incidence and mortality have increased in recent decades. The present study analyzed documented scorpion envenomation notifications from 2008 to 2018 throughout the 645 municipalities of São Paulo. Annual incidence and mortality rates were calculated and stratified according to sex and age. The local empirical Bayesian method and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic were used to represent standardized incidence rates in the municipalities and to identify high- and low-risk agglomerates. The incidence rate of scorpion envenomation quintupled between 2008 and 2018. Overall, the risk was higher for man, and increased with age. Deaths due to envenomation, however, were concentrated almost entirely in children 0-9 years of age. Incidence maps showed that the risk of envenomation increased in almost all regions and municipalities of São Paulo throughout the study period. The highest incidence rates were found in the western, northwestern and northern regions of the state, in contrast to the São Paulo metropolitan area and southern and coastal regions. Hot spots were identified in the Presidente Prudente, Barretos, São José do Rio Preto, and Araçatuba regional health districts, which over time formed a single high-risk cluster. In spatial terms, however, deaths were randomly distributed. In this study, we identified areas and populations at risk of scorpion envenomation and associated-fatalities, which can be used to support decision-making by health services to reduce human contact with these arachnids and avoid fatalities, especially in children."
https://openalex.org/W4225512240,"The quality of cultivated land determines the production capacity of cultivated land and the level of regional development, and also directly affects the food security and ecological safety of the country. This paper starts from the perspective of spatial pattern of cultivated land quality and uses spatial autocorrelation analysis to study the spatial aggregation characteristics and differences of cultivated land quality in Henan Province at the county level scale, and also uses bivariate spatial autocorrelation to analyze the influence of neighboring influences on the quality of cultivated land in the target area. The spatial autoregressive model was used to further analyze the driving factors affecting the quality of cultivated land, and the influence of cultivated land area index was coupled in the process of rating analysis, which was finally used as a basis to propose more precise measures for the protection of cultivated land zoning. The results show that: (1) The quality of cultivated land in Henan Province has a strong spatial correlation (global Moran's I≈0.710) and shows an obvious aggregation pattern in spatial distribution; positive correlation types (high-high and low-low) are concentrated in north-central and western mountainous areas of Henan Province, respectively; negative correlation types are discrete. The negative correlation types are distributed in a discrete manner. (2) The bivariate spatial autocorrelation results show that Slope (Moran's I≈-0.505), Irrigation guarantee rate (IGR, 0.354), Urbanization rate (-0.255), Total agricultural machinery power (TAMP, 0.331) and Pesticide use (0.214) are the main influencing factors. (3) According to the absolute values of the regression coefficients, it can be seen that the magnitude of the influence of different factors on the quality of cultivated land is: Slope (0.089) >IGR (0.025) > Urbanization rate (0.002) > TAMP (0.001) > Pesticide use (1.96e-006). (4) Based on the spatial pattern presented by the spatial autocorrelation results, we proposed corresponding protection zoning measures to provide more scientific reference decisions and technical support for the implementation of refined cultivated land management in Henan Province."
https://openalex.org/W4225675112,"Cardiac arrest (CA) produces global ischemia/reperfusion injury resulting in substantial multiorgan damage. There are limited efficacious therapies to save lives despite CA being such a lethal disease process. The small population of surviving patients suffer extensive brain damage that results in substantial morbidity. Mitochondrial dysfunction in most organs after CA has been implicated as a major source of injury. Metformin, a first-line treatment for diabetes, has shown promising results in the treatment for other diseases and is known to interact with the mitochondria. For the treatment of CA, prior studies have utilized metformin in a preconditioning manner such that animals are given metformin well before undergoing CA. As the timing of CA is quite difficult to predict, the present study, in a clinically relevant manner, sought to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of metformin administration immediately after resuscitation using a 10 min asphxyial-CA rat model. This is the first study to show that metformin treatment post-CA (a) improves 72 h survival and neurologic function, (b) protects mitochondrial function with a reduction in apoptotic brain injury without activating AMPK, and (c) potentiates earlier normalization of brain electrophysiologic activity. Overall, as an effective and safe drug, metformin has the potential to be an easily translatable intervention for improving survival and preventing brain damage after CA."
https://openalex.org/W4226289782,"Pteroceltis tatarinowii (Pteroceltis: Ulmaceae) is a deciduous tree that has a cultivation history of more than 2000 years in China. As an excellent afforestation tree species and rare and endangered tertiary relic plant, P. tatarinowii has high ecological protection value. Due to the forest destruction caused by predatory logging and natural environmental factors, the population of P. tatarinowii in China has decreased significantly. In this study, the potential geographical distribution of P. tatarinowii in China under climate change was predicted using MaxEnt model and ArcGIS based on 223 effective distribution points of P. tatarinowii and 11 environmental variables. The results showed that: (1) the prediction accuracy of MaxEnt model was extremely high, and the areas under curve (AUC) value of the training data was 0.936; The area of the potential suitable habitat area of P. tatarinowii under current climate condition was 180.84×104 km2, and mainly located in the central and southeast regions of China. (2) The domain environmental variables affecting the potential geographical distribution of P. tatarinowii were min temperature of coldest month (12.1~22.7°C), isothermality (26.6~35.8), mean diurnal range 6.9~9.3°C and precipitation of wettest month (189.5 ~955.5 mm). (3) In 2050s and 2070s, compared with current (4.19×104 km2), the area of highly suitable habitat will increase by 0.2%-0.3% (RCP2.6) and 1.22%-3.84% (RCP8.5) respectively. while the poorly, moderately and total suitable habitats will decrease. The gravity center of P. tatarinowii showed a trend of migration to higher latitudes and northern regions in the future. These results will provide theoretical basis for cultivation management and resource protection of P. tatarinowii."
https://openalex.org/W4223962974,"I test the possibility that over-estimating negative consequences of COVID-19 (e.g., hospitalizations, deaths, and threats to children) will be associated with stronger support the ‘ new normal ’ (i.e., continuation of restrictions for an undefined period starting with wide-spread access to vaccines and completed vaccinations of vulnerable people). The new normal was assessed by endorsing practices such as vaccine passports, travel restrictions, mandatory masking, continuing contact tracing, and pursuing elimination. Results are based on five samples ( N = 1,233 from April 2021 and N = 264 from January 2022) and suggest that people over -estimate COVID-19 risks to children and healthy people, as evidenced by median estimates that 5% of all global deaths were children, 29% were generally healthy people under 65, and that a healthy person under the age of 65 has 5% chance of dying from COVID-19. Over-estimates observed in this study align with those based on representative samples, and they were consistently related to stronger support for the new normal. This relationship emerged when participants estimated risks with percentages (core indicators) and indicated the extent to which risk-based statements are true/supported with evidence or false/unsupported (alternative indicators). People were notably more likely to support continuing restrictions if they believed that COVID-19 risk and risk mitigation tactics are true, even when they are not (e.g., children need to be prioritized for boosters). These relationships persisted when considering competing explanations (political ideology, statistics literacy, belief in conspiracy theories). I trace these effects to well-meaning efforts to prevent under-estimation. Public policy and people’s perceptions of risks are intertwined, where even inaccurate judgments may influence decisions. Failure to combat all misinformation with equal rigor may jeopardize the restoration of the social and economic life essential for building adaptive post-pandemic societies."
https://openalex.org/W4224861501,"Current research estimates hundreds of thousands of turbine-related bat fatalities in North America annually. In an effort to reduce impacts of wind energy production on bat populations, many facilities implement operational curtailment strategies that limit turbine blade rotation during conditions when nighttime wind speeds are low. Incorporating real-time bat activity data into wind speed-only curtailment (WOC) strategies may increase operational flexibility by allowing turbines to operate normally when bats are not present near turbines. We evaluated costs and benefits of implementing the Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction (TIMR) system, an approach that informs a curtailment-triggering algorithm based on wind speed and real-time bat acoustic data, compared to a WOC strategy in which turbines were curtailed below 4.5 meters per second (m/s) at a wind energy facility in Fond Du Lac County, Wisconsin. TIMR is a proprietary system and we had no access to the acoustic data or bat call analysis software. Operational parameters for the TIMR system were set to allow curtailment at all wind speeds below 8.0 m/s during the study period when bats were acoustically detected. Overall, the TIMR system reduced fatalities by 75% compared to control turbines, while the WOC strategy reduced fatalities by 47%. An earlier analysis of the same TIMR data neglected to account for carcasses occurring outside the plot boundary and estimated an 84.5% fatality reduction due to the TIMR system. Over the study period, bat activity led to curtailment of TIMR turbines during 39.4% of nighttime hours compared to 31.0% of nighttime hours for WOC turbines, and revenue losses were approximately 280% as great for TIMR turbines as for turbines operated under the WOC strategy. The large cost difference between WOC and TIMR was driven by the 4.5 m/s versus 8.0 m/s wind speed thresholds for curtailment, but our study site has a relatively low average wind speed, which may also have contributed; other wind operators considering the TIMR system will need to consider their ability to absorb production losses in relation to their need to reduce bat fatality rates."

Prevalence in Canada has not been established, though multi-linked health administrative data resources present a unique opportunity to establish robust population-based estimates in a single-payer health system. This study used administrative data for the Ontario, Canada population between April 1988 and March 2019 to measure mitochondrial disease prevalence and describe patient characteristics and health care costs.3069 unique individuals were hospitalized with mitochondrial disease in Ontario and eligible for the study cohort, representing a period prevalence of 2.51 per 10,000 or 1 in 3989. First hospitalization was most common between ages 0-9 or 50-69. The mitochondrial disease population experiences a high need for health care and incurred high costs (mean = CAD$24,023 in 12 months before first hospitalization) within the single-payer Ontario health care system.This study provides needed insight into mitochondrial disease in Canada, and demonstrates the high health burden on patients. The methodology used can be adapted across jurisdictions with similar routine collection of health data, such as in other Canadian provinces. Future work should seek to validate this approach via record linkage of existing disease cohorts in Ontario, and identify specific comorbidities with mitochondrial disease that may contribute to high health resource utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4225514967,"Despite multiple attempts, no surrogate biomarker of Parkinson disease (PD) has been definitively identified. Alternatively, identifying a non-invasive biomarker is crucial to understanding the natural history, severity, and progression of PD and to guide future therapeutic trials. Recent work highlighted alpha synuclein-containing extracellular vesicles and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) activity as drivers of PD pathogenesis and putative PD biomarkers. This exploratory study evaluated the role of alpha-synuclein-positive extracellular vesicles and PARP-1 activity in the plasma of PD patients as non-invasive markers of the disease's severity and progression.We collected plasma of 57 PD patients (discovery cohort 20, replication cohort 37) and compared it with 20 unaffected individuals, 20 individuals with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, and 20 individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies. We analyzed alpha-synuclein-positive extracellular vesicles from platelet-free plasma by nanoscale flow cytometry and blood concentrations of poly ADP-ribose using sandwich ELISA kits.Median concentration of α-synuclein extracellular vesicles was significantly higher in PD patients compared to the other groups (Kruskal-Wallis, p < .0001). In the discovery cohort, patients with higher α-synuclein extracellular vesicles had a higher Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale score (UPDRS III median = 22 vs. 5, p = 0.045). Seven out of 20 patients (35%) showed detectable PAR levels, with positive patients showing significantly higher levels of α-synuclein extracellular vesicles. In the replication cohort, we did not observe a significant difference in the PAR-positive cases in relationship with UPDRS III.Non-invasive determination of α-synuclein-positive extracellular vesicles may provide a potential non-invasive marker of PD disease severity, and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the role of α-synuclein-positive extracellular vesicles as a marker of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4225751008,"Gut microbiomes (GMBs), complex communities of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of their hosts, perform countless micro-ecosystem services such as facilitating energy uptake and modulating immune responses. While scientists increasingly recognize the role GMBs play in host health, the role of GMBs in wildlife ecology and conservation has yet to be realized fully. Here, we use brown bears (Ursus arctos) as an ecological model to (1) characterize GMB community composition associated with location, season, and reproductive condition of a large omnivore; (2) investigate how both extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence GMB community membership and structure; and (3) quantify differences in GMB communities among different locations, seasons, sex, and reproductive conditions. To achieve these aims, we subsampled brown bear fecal samples collected during United States National Park Service research activities at three National Parks and Preserves (Katmai, Lake Clark, and Gates of the Arctic) and extracted microbial DNA for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and microbial taxonomic classification. We analyzed GMB communities using alpha and beta diversity indices, subsequently using linear mixed models to examine relationships between alpha diversity and extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Katmai brown bears hosted the greatest alpha diversity, whereas Gates brown bears hosted the least alpha diversity. Our results indicate that location and diet drive GMB variation, with bears hosting less phylogenetic diversity as park distance inland increases. Monitoring brown bear GMBs could enable managers to quickly detect and assess the impact of environmental perturbations on brown bear health. By integrating macro and micro-ecological perspectives we aim to inform local and landscape-level management decisions to promote long-term brown bear conservation and management."
https://openalex.org/W4225809680,"In Hungary, West Nile virus (WNV) has been responsible for 459 laboratory confirmed human cases between 2004 and 2019, while the first human Usutu virus (USUV) infection was confirmed only in 2018. A comprehensive serosurvey was conducted among blood donors to assess the WNV and USUV seroprevalence in 2019, one year after the largest European WNV epidemic. Altogether, 3005 plasma samples were collected and screened for WNV and USUV specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Enzyme–Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). All reactive samples were further tested for tick-borne encephalitis virus IgG antibodies by ELISA. Indirect immunofluorescence test and microneutralization assay were used as confirmatory methods. Overall, the WNV seroprevalence was 4.32%, and in five blood donors USUV seropositivity was confirmed. The highest seroprevalence was measured in Central, Eastern and Southern Hungary, while the Western part of the country proved to be less affected. There was a statistically strong association between the WNV seroprevalence of 2019 and the cumulative incidence in the period of 2004 and 2019 calculated for every NUTS 3 region. The last WNV serological screening was performed in 2016 and the prevalence of anti-WNV IgG proved to be 2.19%. One year after the 2018 WNV outbreak, a significant increase in seroprevalence was observed in the Hungarian population and evidence for USUV seropositivity was also obtained. The spatial pattern of seroprevalence can support the identification of high-risk areas raising awareness of the need for increased surveillance, such as screening vector, equine, and avian populations. The communication with general practitioners and other professionals in primary health care services can support the early identification of acute human cases. Education and awareness-raising on the importance of protection against mosquito vectors amongst residents are also important parts of preventive measures."

The Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) vaccine has been available in Morocco since 2008 but its introduction in the national immunization program is still under discussion. There is limited data regarding acceptability and predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability among Moroccan young women. This study aimed to evaluate the awareness of female university students of HPV and the vaccine and to identify predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability.We conducted a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire with 1087 participants in six Moroccan universities between May 2019 and June 2020.The awareness of HPV infection was 14.7% and of HPV vaccine was 7.8%. The rate of immunization coverage against HPV was less than 1%. Over 67% of participants were willing to receive the HPV vaccine. Awareness of cervical cancer (p-Value = 0.04) and the HPV vaccine (p-Value = 0.01), and acceptability of Pap smear test (p-Value <0.01) were significant predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability.This study revealed an insufficient amounts of awareness of HPV and of HPV vaccine uptake in a sample of Moroccan university young women. This lack of awareness needs intervention, and it is important to develop an awareness program for young female population either within or outside universities in order to promote vaccination uptake and ultimately lower the cervical cancer rate in Morocco."

Metabolism and axon regeneration are tightly connected. However, the overall metabolic processes and the landscape of the metabolites in axon regeneration of PNS neurons are uncovered. Here, we used an ultra high performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOFMS)-based untargeted metabolomics to analyze dorsal root ganglia (DRG) metabolic characteristics at different time points post sciatic nerve injury and acquired hundreds of differentially changed metabolites. In addition, the results reveal that several metabolic pathways were significantly altered, such as 'Histidine metabolism', 'Glycine serine and threonine metabolism', 'Arginine and proline metabolism', 'taurine and hypotaurine metabolism' and so on. Given metabolite could alter a cell's or an organism's phenotype, further investigation demonstrated that N, N-dimethylglycine (DMG) has a promoting effect on the regenerative ability post injury. Overall, our data may serve as a resource useful for further understanding how metabolites contribute to axon regeneration in DRG during sciatic nerve regeneration and suggest DMG may be a candidate drug to repair nerve injury."
https://openalex.org/W4225554947,"Cigar products, including cigarillos, have increased in popularity in the U.S. and are disproportionately used by young adults. Cigarillo product characteristics can influence consumer perceptions and the appeal of these characteristics can vary by subgroup. The goal of this study was to examine a) product characteristics important to young adult cigarillo users and b) differences based on demographics and cigarillo and other tobacco/substance use behaviors.In 2016, a convenience sample of 628 past-year cigarillo users rated the importance of the following cigarillo product characteristics when choosing a cigarillo to smoke tobacco: brand, tobacco filler quality, tobacco wrap quality, flavors, price, package graphic design, and number of cigars in the pack. Differences in mean importance by demographic, cigarillo use and other tobacco/substance use characteristics were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA tests.The most important cigarillo product characteristics were price, quality of tobacco wrap, and flavors. The least important was graphic design of packaging. There were differences in importance by demographics and/or cigar and other tobacco/substance use behaviors for all product characteristics. In particular, pack size was rated as more important among current cigarillo users, users of foil pouches (2-3 cigarillos) or cardboard/paper boxes or other packaging styles, and current users of cigarettes, blunts and marijuana. Price was rated as more important among Hispanic/Latino and lower income smokers, and current cigarette and blunt smokers.Findings suggest cigarillo users prioritize different product characteristics depending on their demographics or smoking behavior. Further research is needed to examine whether various cigar-related policies, such as those that ban flavors or set minimum pack sizes, could impact sub-populations of cigarillo users differently."
https://openalex.org/W4225567958,"Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are one of the most common infections affecting underprivileged populations in low- and middle-income countries. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm are the three main species that infect people. School children are the most vulnerable groups for STH infections due to their practice of walking and playing barefoot, poor personal hygiene, and environmental sanitation. However, evidence is limited in the study area. So, this study aimed to assess the current prevalence, infection intensity, and associated risk factors of STHs among school children in Tachgayint woreda, Northcentral Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted among school children of Tachgayint woreda from February to May 2021. The study participants were chosen via systematic random sampling. Stool samples were collected from 325 children and examined using the Kato-Katz technique. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 23. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the potential associated factors for STHs. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the magnitude of the association. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.The overall prevalence of STHs in this study was 36.0% (95% CI: 30.5-41.2%). Ascaris lumbricoides are the most prevalent species 89 (27.4%) followed by hookworm 14 (4.3%) and Trichuris trichiura 10 (3.1%). All of the infected school children had light-intensity of infections with the mean of eggs per gram (EPG) being 464.53. Lack of shoe wearing habit (AOR = 4.08, 95% CI: 1.29-12.88) and having untrimmed fingernail (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.06-3.22) were identified as risk factors for STH infections.More than one-third of the school children were infected with at least one STH species and this indicates that STHs are still a health problem among school children in the study area. Therefore, periodic deworming, implementation of different prevention strategies, and health education programs should be regularly applied in the area."
https://openalex.org/W3203860966,"Mathematical models of infectious diseases exhibit robust dynamics, such as stable endemic, disease-free equilibriums or convergence of the solutions to periodic epidemic waves. The present work shows that the accuracy of such dynamics can be significantly improved by including global effects of host movements in disease models. To demonstrate improved accuracy, we extended a standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model by incorporating the global dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extended SIR model assumes three possibilities for susceptible individuals traveling outside of their community: • They can return to the community without any exposure to the infection. • They can be exposed and develop symptoms after returning to the community. • They can be tested positively during the trip and remain quarantined until fully recovered. To examine the predictive accuracy of the extended SIR model, we studied the prevalence of the COVID-19 infection in six randomly selected cities and states in the United States: Kansas City, Saint Louis, San Francisco, Missouri, Illinois, and Arizona. The extended SIR model was parameterized using a two-step model-fitting algorithm. The extended SIR model significantly outperformed the standard SIR model and revealed oscillatory behaviors with an increasing trend of infected individuals. In conclusion, the analytics and predictive accuracy of disease models can be significantly improved by incorporating the global dynamics of the infection."
https://openalex.org/W4224081539,"Acoustic monitoring has been tested as an alternative to the traditional, human-based approach of surveying birds, however studies examining the effectiveness of different acoustic methods sometimes yield inconsistent results. In this study we examined whether bird biodiversity estimated by traditional surveys of birds differs to that obtained through soundscape surveys in meadow habitats that are of special agricultural importance, and whether acoustic monitoring can deliver reliable indicators of meadows and farmland bird biodiversity. We recorded soundscape and simultaneously surveyed birds by highly skilled human-observers within a fixed (50 m and 100 m) and unlimited radius using the point-count method twice in the breeding season at 74 recording sites located in meadows, in order to compare differences in (1) bird biodiversity estimation of meadow, farmland, songbird, and all bird species and (2) the detection rate of single bird species by these two methods. We found that recorders detected more species in comparison to the human-observers who surveyed birds within a fixed radius (50 and 100 m) and fewer when detection distance for human-observers was unlimited. We did not find significant differences in the number of meadow and farmland bird species detected by recorders and observers within a 100 m radius-the most often used fixed radius in traditional human based point-counts. We also showed how detection rate of 48 the most common bird species in our study differ between these two methods. Our study showed that an acoustic survey is equally effective as human observers surveying birds within a 100 m radius in estimation of farmland and meadow bird biodiversity. These groups of species are important for agricultural landscape and commonly used as indicators of habitat quality and its changes. Even though recorders rarely detect species that remain mostly silent during the observation periods, or species that are further distant than 100 m away, we recommend using acoustic soundscape recording methods as an equally effective and more easily standardised alternative for monitoring of farmland and meadow bird biodiversity. We propose adaptation of acoustic approach to long-term, large-scale monitoring by collecting acoustic data by non-specialists, including landowners and volunteers, and analysing them in a standardised way by units supervising monitoring of agriculture landscape."
https://openalex.org/W4225435535,"Introduction Information on laboratory test availability and current testing scope among general hospitals in Kenya is not readily available. We sought to explore the reporting trends and test availability within clinical laboratories in Kenya over a 24-months period through analysis of the laboratory data reported in the District Health Information System (DHIS2). Methods Monthly hospital laboratory testing data were extracted from the Kenyan DHIS2 between January 2018 and December 2019. We used the national laboratory testing summary tool (MoH 706) to identify the tests of interest among 204 general hospitals in Kenya. A local practitioner panel consisting of individuals with laboratory expertise was used to classify the tests as common and uncommon. We compared the tests on the MoH 706 template with the Essential Diagnostic List (EDL) of the World Health Organisation and further reclassified them into test categories based on the EDL for generalisability of our findings. Evaluation of the number of monthly test types reported in each facility and the largest number of tests ever reported in any of the 24 months were used to assess test availability and testing scope, respectively. Results Out of the 204 general hospitals assessed, 179 (179/204) reported at least one of the 80 tests of interest in any of the 24 months. Only 41% (74/179) of the reporting hospitals submitted all their monthly DHIS2 laboratory reports for the entire 24 months. The median testing capacity across the hospitals was 40% with a wide variation in testing scope from one hospital laboratory to another (% IQR: 33.8–51.9). Testing scope was inconsistent within facilities as indicated by often large monthly fluctuations in the total number of recommended and EDL tests reported. Tests of anatomical pathology and cancer were the least reported with 4 counties’ hospitals not reporting any cancer or anatomical pathology tests for the entire 24 months. Conclusion The current reporting of laboratory testing information in DHIS2 is poor. Monitoring access and utilisation of laboratory testing across the country would require significant improvements in consistency and coverage of routine laboratory test reporting in DHIS2. Nonetheless, the available data suggest unequal and intermittent population access to laboratory testing provided by general hospitals in Kenya."

This study aimed to assess the frequency, associated risk factors, fetomaternal outcomes, and management of women with the ruptured uterus at our hospital.It was a retrospective study of 206 women to review data collected from cases of uterine rupture managed at the WCTH Bannu, Pakistan from October 2016 to October 2018. A structured proforma was designed and used to extract data from operating theatre registers and the hospital medical records. In our hospital, there is a strong system of maintaining all information of the patients related to demographics, obstetric information, operative notes, and postoperative course during their hospital stay in the patient's charts. Detailed information on operative procedures is further maintained in the operation theater register and all these registers are checked in the weekly statistical meetings to ensure proper documentation. Data was entered and analyzed in SPSS package version 21 (IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA). Frequency and percentages were calculated for the categorical variables. For inferential statistics, chi-square or Fischer exact tests were used. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The overall incidence of the ruptured uterus was 1.71%. The important etiological factors were grand multiparity 62 (35.2%), obstructed/neglected labour 58 (32.9%), injudicious use of Oxytocin 56 (31.8%) and prostaglandins 26 (14.7%), previous cesarean section 35 (19.8%) and previous pelvic surgery (0.5%). Hysterectomy was done in 80.6% of cases, 34 (19.2%) patients underwent uterine repair and 4.5% had bladder repair. The mortality rate was 21%, mainly due to irreversible shock or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Perinatal mortality was 91.4%. Duration of surgery more than two hours and presentation to the hospital at night time was significantly associated with poor maternal outcome (p = 0.00).Uterine rupture is a preventable obstetric emergency associated with high fetomaternal morbidity and mortality. The main causes were grand multigravidity, obstructed labour, previous C-sections and injudicious use of oxytocin and prostaglandins. Women with prolonged surgery and admission at night time had a poor maternal outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4225642644,"The rapid expansion of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised serious public health concerns due to the possibility of misdiagnosis in regions where arboviral diseases are endemic. We performed the first study in northern Peru to describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in febrile patients with a suspected diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya fever.A consecutive cross-sectional study was performed in febrile patients attending primary healthcare centers from April 2020 through March 2021. Patients enrolled underwent serum sample collection for the molecular and serological detection of DENV and CHIKV. Also, serological detection of IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was performed.464 patients were included during the study period, of which (40.51%) were positive for one pathogen, meanwhile (6.90%) presented co-infections between 2 or more pathogens. The majority of patients with monoinfections were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM with (73.40%), followed by DENV 18.09% and CHIKV (8.51%). The most frequent co-infection was DENV + SARS-CoV-2 with (65.63%), followed by DENV + CHIKV and DENV + CHIKV + SARS-CoV-2, both with (12.50%). The presence of polyarthralgias in hands (43.75%, p<0.01) and feet (31.25%, p = 0.05) were more frequently reported in patients with CHIKV monoinfection. Also, conjunctivitis was more common in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM (11.45%, p<0.01). The rest of the symptoms were similar among all the study groups.SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were frequently detected in acute sera from febrile patients with a clinical suspicion of arboviral disease. The presence of polyarthralgias in hands and feet may be suggestive of CHIKV infection. These results reaffirm the need to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a main differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness in arboviruses endemic areas, as well as to consider co-infections between these pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4225682147,"Understanding how wildfires and modification in plant assemblages interact to influence soil bacteria assemblages is a crucial step in understanding how these disturbances may influence ecosystem structure and function. Here, we resampled soil from three study sites previously surveyed in spring 2016 and 2017 and compared soil bacterial assemblages prior to and six months after (spring 2019) the 2018 Woolsey Fire in the Santa Monica Mountain National Recreation Area using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. All sites harbored both native California sage scrub and a non-native (grassland or forbland) habitat, allowing us to examine how fire influenced bacterial assemblages in common southern California habitats. Most results contrasted with our a-priori hypotheses: (1) richness and diversity increased following the fire, (2) heat/drought resistant and sensitive bacteria did not show consistent and differing patterns by increasing and decreasing, respectively, in relative abundance after the fire, and (3) bacterial assemblage structure was only minimally impacted by fire, with no differences being found between 2017 (pre-fire) and 2019 (post-fire) in three of the six habitats sampled. As sage scrub and non-native grasslands consistently harbored unique bacterial assemblages both before and following the fire, modifications in plant compositions will likely have legacy effects on these soils that persist even after a fire. Combined, our results demonstrate that bacterial assemblages in southern California habitats are minimally affected by fire. Because direct impacts of fire are limited, but indirect impacts, e.g., modifications in plant compositions, are significant, plant restoration efforts following a fire should strive to revegetate sage scrub areas to prevent legacy changes in bacterial composition."
https://openalex.org/W4223640098,"Wound healing is a complex process involving multiple independent and overlapping sequential physiological mechanisms. In addition to cutaneous injury, a severe burn stimulates physiological derangements that induce a systemic hypermetabolic response resulting in impaired wound healing. Topical application of the anti-androgen drug, flutamide accelerates cutaneous wound healing, whereas paradoxically systemic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) improves burn wound healing. We developed and characterized a PCL scaffold that is capable of controlled release of androgen (DHT) and anti-androgen (F) individually or together. This study aims to investigate whether local modification of androgen actions has an impact on burn injury wound healing. In a full-thickness burn wound healing, mouse model, DHT/F-scaffold showed a significantly faster wound healing compared with F-scaffold or DHT-scaffold. Histology analysis confirmed that DHT/F-scaffold exhibited higher re-epithelization, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition. Dual release of DHT and F from PCL scaffolds promoted cell proliferation of human keratinocytes and alters the keratinocyte cell cycle. Lastly, no adverse effects on androgen-dependent organs, spleen and liver were observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated DHT plus F load PCL scaffolds accelerated burn wound healing when loading alone did not. These findings point to a complex role of androgens in burn wound healing and open novel therapeutic avenues for treating severe burn patients."

Three substance use PRS were computed based on prior GWAS: lifetime cannabis use from Pasman et al. (2018), heavy drinking indexed via maximum number of drinks from Gelernter et al. (2019), and alcohol consumption from Kranzler et al. (2019).Higher PRS for lifetime cannabis use, greater heavy drinking, and greater alcohol consumption were associated with heightened risk for misusing opioids among the whole sample. Significant sex by PRS interactions were also observed such that higher PRS for heavy drinking and alcohol consumption were associated with a greater likelihood of opioid misuse among males, but not females.Our findings further elucidate the genetic contributions to misusing opioids by showing that the genetics of cannabis and alcohol consumption are associated with lifetime opioid misuse among young adults, though replication of our findings is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4225547299,"Does reading fiction improve mental health and well-being? We present the results of five studies that evaluated the impact of five forms of exposure to fiction. These included the effects of recalling reading fiction, of being prescribed fiction, of discussing fiction relative to non-fiction, and of discussing literary fiction relative to best-seller fiction. The first three studies directly recruited participants; the final two relied on scraped social media data from Reddit and Twitter. Results show that fiction can have a positive impact on measures of mood and emotion, but that a process of mnemonic or cognitive consolidation is required first: exposure to fiction does not, on its own, have an immediate impact on well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4225893754,"Medication counselling is an important activity that improves patient therapeutic outcomes. After this activity has been carried out, patients should be satisfied with counselling, and possess adequate knowledge about their medications.To describe outpatient/caregiver medication knowledge and satisfaction with medication counselling at the main outpatient pharmacies of eight public secondary and tertiary hospitals located in two states in Northwestern Nigeria.Exit interviews were conducted from December 2019 to March 2020 with randomly sampled patients/caregivers who had just been dispensed one or more prescription medications from the main pharmacies of the hospitals. The questionnaire used contained 31 questions in three sections. The first section collected demographic information. The second section assessed respondents' experiences and overall satisfaction with the counselling they had received. The last section evaluated respondents' knowledge of one randomly selected prescription medication that had been dispensed to them. Data collected were coded and analyzed to generate descriptive statistics. To explore associations between respondent characteristics and overall satisfaction, non-parametric tests were used, and statistical significance set at p<0.05.A total of 684 patients/caregivers were interviewed. Majority of respondents agreed that the time spent (97.1%) and quantity of information (99.1%) provided during counselling was adequate. However, over 60% of them also agreed that dispensers did not assess their understanding of information provided or invite them to ask questions. Despite this, their average overall satisfaction with counselling on a 10-point scale was 8.6 ± 1.6. Over 90% of them also correctly identified the routes and frequency of administration of the prescribed medication selected for the knowledge assessment. Although, more than 60% of respondents did not know the duration of therapy or names of these medications.Respondents' satisfaction with medication counselling was fairly high even though they did not seem to know much about their medication."
https://openalex.org/W4226048041,"It is estimated that over half of medical students experience severe distress, a condition that correlates with low mental quality-of-life, suicidal ideation and serious thoughts of dropping out. While several risk factors for the development of severe distress have been identified, most focus on individual student characteristics. Currently, little is known about the impact medical schools have on student wellbeing.Prospective, observational survey study from 2019-2020 from a national cohort of US medical students. Student wellbeing, school characteristics, and wellbeing resource availability was measured with a 30-question electronic survey. Medical student distress was defined as a Medical Student Wellbeing Index (MS-WBI) of ≥4. Risk factors for the development of severe distress were evaluated in a multivariate logistic regression model. The impact of the number of wellbeing resources available on student wellbeing was measured along multiple wellbeing domains. Independent reviewers categorized free text analysis of survey responses about desired wellbeing resources into themes.A total of 2,984 responses were included in the study, representing 45 unique medical schools. Medical school characteristics independently associated with severe distress included low faculty support (OR 4.24); the absence of mentorship resources (OR 1.63) and the absence of community building programs (OR 1.45) in a multivariate model. Increased availability of wellbeing resources was associated with lower average MS-WBI (4.58 vs. 3.19, p<0;05) and a smaller percentage of students who had taken or considered taking a leave of absence (40% vs. 16%, p<0.05). The resources most desired by students were mental health services and scheduling adjustments.The majority of medical school characteristic that contribute to student distress are modifiable. Improving faculty support and offering more and varied wellbeing resources may help to mitigate medical student distress. Student feedback is insightful and should be routinely incorporated by schools to guide wellbeing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4226109480,"While according to the United Nations birth registration is a human right, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) only half of new-born children currently have their birth registered. To gain insight into the reasons behind this low registration rate, we study the role of determinants at the household, sub-national regional and country level, using self-reported birth registration data on 358,842 children in 40 SSA countries. While most of the variation in reported birth registration is due to factors at the household level, context factors are found to play an important role as well. At the household level, poverty, low education, restricted autonomy of women, and belonging to a traditional religion are associated with lower odds of being registered. Lack of professional care during pregnancy, delivery, and early life also decrease the odds of being registered. Important factors at the context level are the average number of prenatal care visits in the local area, living in an urban area, the kind of birth registration legislation, decentralization of the registration system, fertility rates, and the number of conflicts. To improve registration, the complex dynamics of these factors at the household and context level have to be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W4224440144,"The objective of this study was to determine if visible reflectance spectroscopy and quantitative colorimetry represent viable approaches to classifying the heat treatment state of silcrete. Silcrete is a soil duricrust that has been used as toolstone since at least the Middle Stone Age. The ancient practice of heat treating silcrete prior to knapping is of considerable interest to paleolithic archaeologists because of its implications for early modern human complex cognition generally and the ability to manipulate the material properties of stone specifically. Here, we demonstrate that our quantitative, non-invasive, and portable approach to measuring color, used in conjunction with k-Nearest Neighbors ""lazy"" machine learning, is a highly promising method for heat treatment detection. Traditional, expert human analyst approaches typically rely upon subjective assessments of color and luster and comparison to experimental reference collections. This strongly visual method can prove quite accurate, but difficult to reproduce between different analysts. In this work, we measured percent reflectance for the visible spectrum (1018 variables) and standardized color values (CIEL*a*b*) in unheated and experimentally heat-treated silcrete specimens from three sources in South Africa. k-NN classification proved highly effective with both the spectroscopy and colorimetry data sets. An important innovation was using the heat treatment state predicted by the k-NN model for the majority of replicate observations of a single specimen to predict the heat treatment state for the specimen overall. When this majority voting approach was applied to the 746 individual observations in this study, associated with 94 discrete silcrete flakes, both spectroscopy and colorimetry k-NN models yielded 0% test set misclassification rates at the specimen level."
https://openalex.org/W4225513584,"Nicotine dependence is an addiction to tobacco products caused by the chemical nicotine present in tobacco. 80% of premature deaths due to nicotine dependence come from low-and middle-income countries. Since most of the public health studies have focused solely on psychological and behavioral factors associated with tobacco smoking, this study aims to assess the nicotine dependence and stages of change of quitting smoking.A community based quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among 280 smokers aged 15-69 years in Bharatpur metropolitan, Nepal. A semi-structured and validated questionnaire was used during the face-to-face interviews. Nicotine dependence among participants was assessed using the six-item Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the associations between variables at the significance level α = 0.05.In the study population, the mean score of FTND was 5.15 ± 2.34. 33.9% participants had a high level of nicotine dependence and nearly half of the participants felt difficulty to refrain smoking even in No-smoking areas. Almost three out of ten respondents were prepared for smoking cessation. It was found that age group 20-39 years were more likely to have nicotine dependence (AOR 3.308, 95% CI = 1.039-10.534), those who initiated smoking before age of 15 were associated with a greater risk of nicotine dependence (AOR 3.68, 95% CI = 1.826-7.446), participants spending more on tobacco products (more than Rs 2400 monthly) were associated with an increased risk of nicotine dependence (AOR 4.47, 95% CI = 2.225-8.991), those who initiated smoking due to mental stress were more likely to have nicotine addiction (AOR 2.522, 95% CI = 1.004-6.028), and those who had no thought of quitting smoking were more associated with nicotine dependence (AOR 4.935, 95% CI = 1.458-16.699).Our study showed that high level of nicotine dependence is a major public health problem in low-and middle-income countries like Nepal. It also highlights that effective smoking cessation programs should be developed considering the level of nicotine dependence with more focus on early interventions of its associated factors."
https://openalex.org/W4225672740,"Flow around circular cylinder has been extensively studied by researchers for several decades due to its wide range of engineering applications such as in heat exchangers, marine cables, high rise building, chimneys, and offshore structures. The lack of clear understanding of the unsteady flow dynamics in the wake of circular cylinder and high computational cost are still an area of high interest amongst the researchers. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of variation in spanwise length and grid resolution in the spanwise direction on the recirculation length, separation angle of wake flow by performing large eddy simulations (LES). This study is an extension to previous work by Khan, NB et al, 2019 in which the spanwise length is restricted to 4D only. In current study, the spanwise length is changed from 0.5D to 8D where D is diameter of cylinder and mesh resolution in the spanwise direction is changed from 1 to 80 elements in the present study. The recirculation length, separation angle and wake characteristics are analyzed in detail. It is concluded that after getting optimize spanwise length, mesh resolution in the spanwise direction is the only parameter contributing toward better result."
https://openalex.org/W4225708285,"Democratizing learning is essential for environmental sustainability. Less privileged areas are crucial in this regard. Informal education has great such potential, but often fails to reach the less privileged, and to document learning. With the objective to identify and counter these issues, we here report on EDU-ARCTIC, an informal open schooling course in environmental science, aimed at European teachers with teenage pupils. Of the 1,181 teachers who enrolled, 73% were females and 43% were from less privileged nations (according to UN Human Development Index). This is a higher share of less privileged (females) than is the case for the general population of Europe. Teachers from less privileged nations also participated in more project activities than did those from more privileged nations, apart from in urban areas. For the project period, the teachers reported a significant increase in all the three categories of aspired learning outcomes for their pupils. We conclude that courses like ours can increase teenagers’ literacy and engagement in science and environmental issues, not the least in less privileged areas. Deliberate efforts are required to reach these target groups, who may be less inclined to join on their own."

Feedback control is planned for finite-time of synchronization CACS. By constructing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is derived for finite-time stability criteria of CACS with interval and continuous differential time-varying delays. We use Wirtinger-based integral inequality to evaluate the upper bound of the time derivative of the LKF. We apply the single integral form and the double integral form of the integral inequality, according to Wirtinger-based integral inequality, to ensure that the feedback controller for synchronization has good performance with disturbance and time-varying delay. The new sufficient finite-time stability conditions have appeared in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical checks can be performed using the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the success of the proposed methods. This resultant is less conservative than the resultants available in the previous works."

The urgency for timely decisions resulted in a multitude of models as informed policy actions must be made even when so many uncertainties about the pandemic still remain. In this paper, we use machine learning algorithms to build intuitive country-level COVID-19 motion models described by death toll velocity and acceleration. Model explainability techniques provide insightful data-driven narratives about COVID-19 death toll motion models-while velocity is explained by factors that are increasing/reducing death toll pace now, acceleration anticipates the effects of public health measures on slowing the death toll pace. This allows policymakers and epidemiologists to understand factors driving the outbreak and to evaluate the impacts of different public health measures."
https://openalex.org/W4226111919,"The Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, is a serious insect pest that can infest corn leaves and stems. Due to its internal feeding behavior, its larvae are not exposed to insecticides that are usually sprayed for pest control. To minimize crop damage caused by O. furnacalis, improving insect resistance trait of corn has been considered as an optimal control tactic. This study screened 27 corn varieties for their insect resistance trait and selected three varieties of Ilmichal (IM), P3394, and Kwangpyeongok (KP) that showed insect resistance trait. O. furnacalis larvae did not show any significant difference in preference between these three insect-resistant corn varieties and a control susceptible variety. However, these resistant varieties after ingestion significantly interfered with larval development of O. furnacalis. This suggests that the insect resistance trait is induced by antibiosis, but not by antixenosis. Indeed, larvae fed with these varieties suffered from low chymotrypsin (CHY) activities in the midgut juice. To determine the target CHY inhibited by resistant corn varieties, a total of nine CHY genes (Of-CHY1~Of-CHY9) were predicted from the transcriptome of O. furnacalis. Six genes (Of-CHY1~Of-CHY6) were expressed in all developmental stages and tissues. Especially, Of-CHY3 was highly expressed in the midgut of O. furnacalis larvae. RNA interference (RNAi) using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to Of-CHY3 (2 μg of dsRNA injected to each L5 larva) resulted in significant reduction of Of-CHY3 expression level at 24 h post-treatment. Feeding L3 larvae with this dsRNA also significantly suppressed the expression level of Of-CHY3 and reduced its enzyme activity at 24 h post-treatment. A recombinant Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA specific to Of-CHY3 was constructed using L4440 vector. Feeding such recombinant bacteria suppressed the expression level of Of-CHY3 and prevented larval development of O. furnacalis. These results suggest that the three resistant varieties can produce a resistance factor(s) to inhibit the CHY activity of O. furnacalis and suppress larval growth. This study suggests that CHY might be an inhibition target in O. furnacalis for breeding insect-resistant corns."

Many studies consider statistical or machine learning models to predict the results of professional tennis matches. In this study, we propose a statistical approach for predicting the match outcomes of Grand Slam tournaments, in addition to applying exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore variables related to match results. The proposed approach introduces new variables via the Glicko rating model, a Bayesian method commonly used in professional chess. We use EDA tools to determine important variables and apply classification models (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machine, neural network and light gradient boosting machine) to evaluate the classification results through cross-validation. The empirical study is based on men's and women's single matches of Grand Slam tournaments (2000-2019). Our analysis results show that professional tennis ranking is the most important variable and that the accuracy of the proposed Glicko model is slightly higher than that of other models."

Our case study of the 2010 conflict in Kyrgyzstan tests whether communities with higher ethnic inequalities in education experienced more intense displacement. We find that local inequality in education between Kyrgyzstan's ethnic majority and its largest minority robustly predicts patterns of forced displacement, controlling for alternative approaches like ethnic spatial segregation or polarization. By decomposing inequality, we observe that local educational advantage towards the other ethnic group is associated with a lower likelihood of displacement. Ethnic Uzbeks with low education levels relative to Kyrgyz in their area have the highest displacement rate."
https://openalex.org/W4206866566,"Item response theory (IRT) is the statistical paradigm underlying a dominant family of generative probabilistic models for test responses, used to quantify traits in individuals relative to target populations. The graded response model (GRM) is a particular IRT model that is used for ordered polytomous test responses. Both the development and the application of the GRM and other IRT models require statistical decisions. For formulating these models (calibration), one needs to decide on methodologies for item selection, inference, and regularization. For applying these models (test scoring), one needs to make similar decisions, often prioritizing computational tractability and/or interpretability. In many applications, such as in the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), tractability implies approximating an individual's score distribution using estimates of mean and variance, and obtaining that score conditional on only point estimates of the calibrated model. In this manuscript, we evaluate the calibration and scoring of models under this common use-case using Bayesian cross-validation. Applied to the WD-FAB responses collected for the National Institutes of Health, we assess the predictive power of implementations of the GRM based on their ability to yield, on validation sets of respondents, ability estimates that are most predictive of patterns of item responses. Our main finding indicates that regularized Bayesian calibration of the GRM outperforms the regularization-free empirical Bayesian procedure of marginal maximum likelihood. We also motivate the use of compactly supported priors in test scoring."
https://openalex.org/W4223980888,"Coal dust is the main pollutant in coal mining areas. Such pollutants easily diffuse and are difficult to monitor, which increases the cost of environmental pollution control. Remote sensing technology can be used to dynamically monitor mining areas at a low cost, and thus, this is a common means of mining area management. According to the spectral characteristics of various ground objects in remote sensing images, a variety of remote sensing indexes can be constructed to extract the required information. In this study, the Wucaiwan open-pit coal mine was selected as the study area, and the Enhanced Coal Dust Index (ECDI) was established to extract the coal dust pollution information for the mining area. A new mining area pollution monitoring method was developed, which can provide technical support for environmental treatment and mining planning in Zhundong. The results of this study revealed the following: (1) Compared with the normalized difference coal index, the ECDI can expand the difference between the spectral information about the coal dust and the surrounding features, so it has a significant recognition ability for coal dust information. (2) From 2010 to 2021, the coal dust pollution in the study area initially increased and then decreased. With the continued exploitation of the coal mines in the study area, the coal dust pollution area increased from 14.77 km2 in 2010 to 69.49 km2 in 2014. After 2014, the local government issued various environmental pollution control policies, which had remarkable results.

This study aimed to screen the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) during the differentiation of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) into IPCs, and uncover the underlying function and mechanism of a specific DEmiRNA, miR-708-5p.MDSCs were successfully isolated from the leg muscle of rats, and were induced for IPCs differentiation through a five-stage protocol. miRNA microarray assay was performed for screening DEmiRNAs during differentiation. The features of MDSCs-derived IPCs were identified by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining. The targeting of STK4 by miR-708-5p was examined by luciferase assay. The protein expression of STK4, YAP1, and p-YAP1 was determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.MDSCs were successfully isolated and differentiated into IPCs. A total of 12 common DEmiRNAs were obtained during five-stage differentiation. Among them, miR-708-5p that highly expressed in MDSCs-derived IPCs was selected. Overexpression of miR-708-5p upregulated some key transcription factors (Pdx1, Ngn3, Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, Gata4, Gata6, Pax4, and Pax6) involving in IPCs differentiation, and increased insulin positive cells. In addition, STK4 was identified as the target gene of miR-708-5p. miR-708-5p overexpression downregulated the expression of STK4 and the downstream phosphorylated YAP1.There were 12 DEmiRNAs involved in the differentiation of MDSCs into IPCs. miR-708-5p promoted MDSCs differentiation into IPCs probably by targeting STK4-mediated Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4224122724,"The clam Ameghynomia antiqua is a highly important resource for fisheries due to its high catches volume. It is the bivalve mollusc with the highest fisheries landings from natural beds on the Pacific coast of southern South America; however, studies of the reproductive conditions of this species are scarce and date back many years. The object of the present work was to evaluate the reproductive characteristics of the species, analysing its gametogenic and gonadal cycle, and reproductive indices, in fishery locations that present the natural beds with the highest fisheries catches, as well as parasite loads in the species. The gonads of the individuals were sampled monthly over a year and classified into one of three states called: ""in development"", ""ripe"" and ""spawned"". Synchrony between the sexes was observed in the indicators of the Gonadosomatic Index and Condition Index in each of the locations, although no synchrony was observed between locations. In the gametogenic cycle, the ""ripe"" state was observed in females in spring-summer, followed by rapid recovery to new development of the gonads; in males the ""ripe"" state was observed throughout the year. It was observed that males entered the ""spawned"" state one month ahead of females. The presence of digenean parasites in the state of metacercariae was detected in the gonads and mantle. No significant differences were found in the prevalence or intensity of infection when analysed by sex and month. The metacercariae were identified, by sequencing of three DNA regions, as belonging to the clade shared by species of the genus Parvatrema and close to the Gymnophalloides; both these genera belong to the family Gymnophallidae of the superclass Digenea. Infection was observed to reduce the gonadal tissue, in some cases causing castration. This is the first record of the presence of these parasites of A. antiqua, with genetic identification at genus level. These results are relevant for act proper management of this resource, which is important for fishing."
https://openalex.org/W4224497462,"Spinal deformity is a serious economic and animal welfare problem in intensive fish farming systems, which will be a significant unsolved problem for the fish sector. The aim of this study was to determine the relative expression of genes (Akt1 substrate 1, Calreticulin, Collagen type I alpha 2 chain, Corticotropin-releasing hormone, Chromodomain-Helicase DNA-binding, Growth hormone, Insulin like growth factor 1, Myostatin, Sine oculis-related homeobox 3, Toll-like receptor 2) in different tissues associated with spinal deformity and to determine the macroelement (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, sulfur) and microelement (barium, copper, iron, manganese, strontium, zinc) content of spine in healthy and deformed common carps (Cyprinus carpio) in Hungary. The mRNA levels of the genes were measured in 7 different tissues (abdominal fat, blood, brain, dorsal muscle, genitals, heart, liver) by qRT-PCR. Correlations between gene expression and element content were analyzed by using linear regression and Spearman rank correlation. In a total of 15 cases, we found a statistically significant connection between gene expression in a tissue and the macro- or microelement content of the spine. In these contexts, the genes Akt1 substrate 1 (3), Collagen type I alpha 2 chain (2), Corticotropin-releasing hormone (4), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (4), and Myostatin (2), the tissue's blood (3), brain (6), heart (5), and liver (1), the macroelements sodium (4), magnesium (4), phosphorus (1) and sulfur (2) as well as the microelement iron (4) were involved. We also found statistically significant mRNA level differences between healthy and deformed common carps in tissues that were not directly affected by the deformation. Based on our results, genes regulating the nervous system and growth, elements, and tissues are the most associated components in the phenomenon of spinal deformity. With our study, we wish to give direction to and momentum for the exploration of these complex processes."
https://openalex.org/W4224708298,"eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is the most widely used, valid and reliable tool to assess eHealth literacy skills, but no culturally appropriate tool exists to assess these skills among Sinhala-speaking Sri Lankans, including health professionals. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the original eHEALS from English to Sinhala and evaluate its psychometric properties. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase involved translation and cross-cultural validation of the questionnaire. The second phase involved a cross-sectional survey conducted online among 268 health science students from a state university in Sri Lanka to confirm the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. An analysis of test-retest reliability was conducted with a subset of 72 students. The pre-final version of Sinhala eHEALS (Si-eHEALS) was developed following the cross-cultural adaptation process. The mean score of Si-eHEALS was 28.51±4.87. A satisfactory level of internal consistency was achieved (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). The test-retest reliability was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient -.776). Content validity index of Si-eHEALS was.97. The principal component analysis supported the unidimensionality of the scale, explaining 61.2 variance. There was a significant positive association between Si-eHEALS score with academic year (rs = .146, p = .017), self-rated internet skills (rs = .122, p = .046), usefulness of internet in health decision making (rs = .212, p < .001) and importance of ability to access health resources on the internet (rs = .230, p < .001), confirming concurrent validity. No significant difference based on gender (U = 5854, p = .550) and degree program (X2(2) = 2.965, p = .564) was found, confirming discriminant validity. In line with many previous validation studies, our study demonstrated good psychometric properties for Si-eHEALS. Si-eHEALS is a valid and reliable tool that assesses eHealth literacy in Sinhala speaking Sri Lankans, particularly health professionals."
https://openalex.org/W4225524075,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the health of humans and animals and has repeatedly been detected in wild animal species across the world. This cross-sectional study integrates whole-genome sequence data from Escherichia coli isolates with demonstrated phenotypic resistance that originated from a previous longitudinal wildlife study in southern Ontario, as well as phenotypically resistant E. coli water isolates previously collected as part of a public health surveillance program. The objective of this work was to assess for evidence of possible transmission of antimicrobial resistance determinants between wild meso-mammals, swine manure pits, and environmental sources on a broad scale in the Grand River watershed, and at a local scale-for the subset of samples collected on both swine farms and conservation areas in the previous wildlife study. Logistic regression models were used to assess potential associations between sampling source, location type (swine farm vs. conservation area), and the occurrence of select resistance genes and predicted plasmids. In total, 200 isolates from the following sources were included: water (n = 20), wildlife (n = 73), swine manure pit (n = 31), soil (n = 73), and dumpsters (n = 3). Several genes and plasmid incompatibility types were significantly more likely to be identified on swine farms compared to conservation areas. Conversely, internationally distributed sequence types (e.g., ST131), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC-producing E. coli were isolated in lower prevalences (<10%) and were almost exclusively identified in water sources, or in raccoon and soil isolates obtained from conservation areas. Differences in the odds of detecting resistance genes and predicted plasmids among various sources and location types suggest different primary sources for individual AMR determinants, but, broadly, our findings suggest that raccoons, skunks and opossums in this region may be exposed to AMR pollution via water and agricultural sources, as well as anthropogenic sources in conservation areas."
https://openalex.org/W4225603620,"Transient elastography (TE) allows non-invasive quantification of liver stiffness (LSM) and steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter, CAP). Here we test the feasibility and utility of TE in the emergency department (ED) and investigate whether LSM predicts longer hospitalization and reimbursement for non-elective patients.LSM and CAP were determined in prospectively recruited consecutive adult patients admitted to the ED of a tertiary referral center. Patients were stratified according to the 9.1 kPa and 13.0 kPa LSM cut-offs. Elastography measurements were correlated with clinical and outcome parameters, including duration of hospital stay and hospitalization costs.In 200 ED patients (133 men, age 18 - 97 years), median LSM was 5.5 kPa (2.4 - 69.1 kPa), and median CAP was 252 dB/m (100 - 400 dB/m). In total, 39 patients (19.5%) presented with LSM ≥ 9.1 kPa, and 24 patients (12.0%) presented with LSM ≥ 13.0 kPa. Heart failure (n = 19) was associated with higher LSM (p = 0.045). Patients with LSM ≥ 9.1 kPa were significantly (p < 0.01) more likely to require longer hospitalization than those with lower LSM. Patients with LSM ≥ 13.0 kPa generated significantly (p = 0.001) higher costs as compared to patients with low LSM.Transient elastography represents an easily accessible screening tool in ED that might help identify patients in need of increased health care resources."
https://openalex.org/W4225834393,"Furazolidone is a synthetic nitrofuran with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial action and has been widely used in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. However, its safety profile has not been clarified. Moreover, the drug fever associated with its use is frequently misdiagnosed. The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors of furazolidone-associated fever to increase awareness and stimulate further research on this topic.This was a retrospective case-control study of patients referred to a specialist clinic for furazolidone-containing quadruple regimens for H. pylori infection at a tertiary care hospital located in Eastern China between July 2018 and September 2018. We evaluated adult patients who received furazolidone treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients were pregnant or breastfeeding; (2) patients received furazolidone treatment not for Helicobacter pylori infection; (3) patients had taken antibiotics or any acid suppressant or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in the last 4 weeks; (4) patients had chronic hepatic, renal, or pulmonary disease. Pertinent information was retrieved from medical records and telephone follow-up. All statistical analysis was performed in SPSS version 22.0.A total of 1499 patients received furazolidone and met the overall inclusion criterion. Of these 1499 patients, 27 (1.80%) developed drug fever. The mean time between initiation of furazolidone and the onset of fever is 11.00 ± 1.84 days, and the median peak fever was 38.87 ± 0.57°C. We found no differences in age and past drug allergy between the non-fever and fever groups. Through multiple logistic regression analysis, we found two variables as independent risk factors for furazolidone-associated fever, including gender (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.26-7.91; P = 0.014) and clarithromycin (OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.17-10.79; P<0.001).This retrospective cohort study identified two risk factors for furazolidone-associated fever, which were female and clarithromycin. We also analyzed the characteristics of drug fever during anti-Helicobacter pylori therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms are uncertain and require further research."
https://openalex.org/W4225890646,"It is well established that there is a national problem surrounding the equitable participation in and completion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) higher education programs. Persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) experience lower course performance, major retention, sense of belonging, and degree completion. It is unclear though how pervasive these issues are across an institution, from the individual instructor, course, and discipline perspectives. Examining over six years of institutional data from a large-enrollment, research-intensive, minority-serving university, we present an analysis of racial opportunity gaps between PEERs and non-PEERs to identify the consistency of these issues. From this analysis, we find that there is considerable variability as to whether a given course section taught by a single instructor does or does not exhibit opportunity gaps, although encouragingly we did identify exemplar instructors, course-instructor pairs, courses, and departments that consistently had no significant gaps observed. We also identified significant variation across course-instructor pairs within a department, and found that certain STEM disciplines were much more likely to have courses that exhibited opportunity gaps relative to others. Across nearly all disciplines though, it is clear that these gaps are more pervasive in the lower division curriculum. This work highlights a means to identify the extent of inequity in STEM success across a university by leveraging institutional data. These findings also lay the groundwork for future studies that will enable the intentional design of STEM education reform by leveraging beneficial practices used by instructors and departments assigning equitable grades."
https://openalex.org/W4226350900,"The WHO 95-95-95 targets for 2030 do not imply that people living with HIV (PLHIV) achieve a good quality of life. The current 30-day dispensing interval for antiretroviral (ART) burdens the healthcare system. Lengthening dispensing intervals could alleviate this burden as well as enhance patient well-being.To capture perceptions on 90-day dispensing interval (90D) for ART from the perspective of PLHIV, people on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), doctors, and pharmacists.Multi-centre observational survey led in France from 16 to 20 October 2020, among doctors agreeing to participate via regional coordinated care organisations for HIV, all PLHIV or people on PrEP consulting these outpatient-clinic doctors, and pharmacists doing ART dispensing.The survey was completed by 220 doctors who saw 1087 people (999 PLHIV; 88 on PrEP) and 176 pharmacists from 55 centres. Among the PLHIV, 855 (85.6%, 95% CI: 83.2%-87.7%) and among the patients on PrEP, 70 (79.5%, 95% CI: 69.6%-87.4%) stated they would be interested in 90D. All in all, patients who were more likely to endorse 90D are those who opt exclusively for hospital dispensing (OR 3.22 [1.57-6.58]) and who rotate between hospital and community pharmacy dispensing (OR 3.29 [1.15-9.32]). Patients who were less likely to endorse 90-D were those who consult in a city located outside the 3 French high HIV prevalence regions (OR 0.66 [0.44-0.99]), receive 2 vs 1 pill QD regimens (OR 0.53 [0.31-0.91]), and anticipate at least one vs no limitation to 90D (OR 0.27 [0.17-0.42]). 90D was perceived as possible by 152 pharmacists (86.4%), including 8 (5%) without restriction, and 219 doctors (99.6%), including 42 (19.2%) regardless of PLHIV's immunovirologic status or social conditions (health insurance coverage, access to housing or accommodation, access to rights, resources). Comparison of the benefits and limitations of a 90-day ART dispensing interval as perceived by PLHIV and people on PrEP, doctors and pharmacists shows that doctors anticipate a higher number of benefits than people on ART and/or pharmacists, chiefly that 90D would be more convenient and create less risk of drug shortages and that patients would gain autonomy and a better quality of life. Pharmacists were found to clearly perceive the economic benefits (90D would be less expensive) but anticipate more drawbacks than doctors and the people on ART themselves: more administrative burdens, more non-dispensing if doses get lost, harder to track adherence and more drug-drug interaction issues, and more work as they shall have to warn the patient of potential risks of shortages due to the cost of the stock.A clear majority of PLHIV, people on PrEP, doctors, and pharmacists endorsed 90D of ART. Most patients thought that 90D would be a good option, whereas most pharmacists and doctors thought that eligibility for 90D dispensing should depend on immunovirologic factors and social condition criteria. Moreover, pharmacists thought it would be necessary to commit regulatory resources and a better follow-up on adherence and drug-drug interactions."
