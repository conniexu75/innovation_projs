https://openalex.org/W2123480703,"The transcription factor PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific member of the ets family. Mice carrying a mutation in the PU.1 locus were generated by gene targeting. Homozygous mutant embryos died at a late gestational stage. Mutant embryos produced normal numbers of megakaryocytes and erythroid progenitors, but some showed an impairment of erythroblast maturation. An invariant consequence of the mutation was a multilineage defect in the generation of progenitors for B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. Thus, the developmental programs of lymphoid and myeloid lineages require a common genetic function likely acting at the level of a multipotential progenitor."

Here we report on the relationship between APOE*4 and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) in a Dutch population-based study. The frequency of the APOE*4 allele was 2.3 times higher among EOAD cases compared to controls. Among patients, the allele frequency was 1.6 times higher in those with a positive family history than in those without. A significant increase in risk of EOAD was found for subjects homozygous for APOE*4 regardless of family history of dementia, but an increase in EOAD risk for APOE*4 heterozygotes could only be shown in subjects with a positive family history. Our study demonstrates a significant association between APOE*4 and EOAD which is modified by family history of dementia."

https://openalex.org/W2079924956,"We report a null mutation in the human ciliary neurotrophic factor gene (CNTF). The mutated allele shows a G to A transition producing a new splice acceptor site and the resulting mRNA species codes for an aberrant protein. Analysis of tissue samples and transfection of CNTF minigenes into cultured cells demonstrates that the mutated allele expresses only the mutated mRNA species. In 391 Japanese people tested, 61.9% were normal homozygotes, 35.8% heterozygotes and 2.3% mutant homozygotes. The distribution of the three genotypes is similar in healthy and neurological disease subjects, indicating that human CNTF deficiency is not causally related to neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1509963147,"The cardiac sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger transports Na+ and Ca2+ but is also regulated by Ca2+ at a high affinity binding site. A large intracellular, hydrophilic loop of the exchanger has been suggested to contain the Ca(2+)-binding regulatory domain (Matsuoka S., Nicoll, D. A., Reilly, R. F., Hilgemann, D. W., and Philipson, K. D. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 3870-3874). To localize the Ca(2+)-binding site(s), we expressed portions of the exchanger loop as fusion proteins and measured binding by 45Ca2+ overlay. The high affinity binding domain is located near the center of the loop and binds Ca2+ in a cooperative manner. K0.5 ranges from 0.3 to 3 microM in the presence of 0.2-5 mM Mg2+. The binding region (amino acids 371-508) has two highly acidic sequences, each characterized by 3 consecutive aspartic acid residues. Ca2+ affinity markedly decreases when these aspartates are mutated. The Ca(2+)-binding region does not contain an EF-hand motif. The mobilities during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fusion proteins with high Ca2+ affinity differ depending on the presence or absence of Ca2+ in the gel loading buffer. The high affinity Ca(2+)-binding domain is probably responsible for the secondary Ca2+ regulation of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger."

https://openalex.org/W1532377506,"The alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor (alpha 1BAR) and its truncated mutant T368 lacking the last 147 amino acids were stably expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts. The wild type alpha 1BAR was rapidly phosphorylated upon exposure to the agonist epinephrine as well as to phorbol ester as assessed by immunoprecipitation of the receptor with antiserum raised against its amino-terminal portion. Exposure of cells expressing the wild type alpha 1BAR to epinephrine resulted also in rapid homologous desensitization of receptor-mediated response on polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. On the other hand, truncation of the serine- and threonine-rich carboxyl portion of the alpha 1BAR abolished agonist-induced phosphorylation and greatly impaired homologous desensitization of the receptor. The truncated receptor T368 could undergo agonist-induced decrease of cell surface receptors but to a lesser extent, as compared with the wild type alpha 1BAR. These results demonstrate that the carboxyl portion of the alpha 1BAR plays a crucial role in the regulation of receptor function. They also suggest a strong relationship between agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the alpha 1BAR, which were both insensitive to the inhibitor of protein kinase C RO-318220. Our findings support the emerging hypothesis that the biochemical mechanisms involved in rapid agonist-dependent regulation of G protein-coupled receptors, which activate polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, do not primarily involve protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1575595760,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant constitutively expressed by a variety of normal and transformed cells. Transient transfection and deletion analysis of the human c-sis proto-oncogene in cultured vascular endothelial cells revealed a minimal core promoter region extending 82 base pairs upstream from the TATA box. Two novel and functional cis-acting elements were identified within the core that share considerable sequence homology with consensus binding elements for transacting factors of the ETS class and those involved in AP-1 complexes. Deletion or mutation of either the ETS-like site or the AP-1-like site resulted in significant attenuation in the ability of the core to drive transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that proteins from bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial nuclear extracts bound to these elements in a specific manner and that both sites were essential for protein binding. Ferguson analysis predicted a combined molecular mass of 153 kDa for these proteins. In addition, transient transfection, gel shift, and DNase I footprint analysis were used to identify a functional Sp1 binding site downstream of these elements in the core promoter. By localizing the functional cis-acting elements in the PDGF-B promoter, it may be possible to elucidate the normal transcriptional control of the gene, as well as the mechanisms that activate it in pathologic settings."
https://openalex.org/W1496795534,"We evaluated the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstrictor peptide, to regulate prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS)-1 and -2 gene expression and protein synthesis in cultured rat mesangial cells (MC). ET-1 induced mRNA for PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1 and also stimulated protein accumulation of PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1 in MC. ET-1 induction of PGHS-2 protein was accompanied by a sustained enhancement of enzymatic activity assessed by conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2. The ET-1-stimulated PGHS-2 expression was reduced with protein tyrosine kinase but not with protein kinase C inhibitors or in protein kinase C-depleted cells. Both dexamethasone and heparin reduced ET-1-activated PGHS-2 mRNA expression and protein formation. We conclude that in MC, ET-1 induces PGHS-2 through a protein tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2022281449,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), such as rhodopsin kinase and beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), are involved in mediating agonist-specific phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. GRK6 is the most recently identified member of the GRK family and displays higher homology with GRK5 (70.1% amino acid identity) and IT11 (68.5%) compared to beta ARK (37.4%) and rhodopsin kinase (47.1%). To further characterize GRK6, it has been overexpressed in Sf9 cells and purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography on SP-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose columns. GRK6 shares a number of in vitro characteristics with GRK5, including potent inhibition by heparin and dextran sulfate (IC50 values of approximately 15 and approximately 7 nM, respectively), hyperstimulation by polycations, and preference for phosphorylation of non-acidic peptides. Rhodopsin and the beta 2-adrenergic and m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors serve as stimulus-dependent substrates for GRK6, but with stoichiometries significantly lower than achieved by GRK5 and beta ARK. Additionally, GRK6 does not undergo significant autophosphorylation even though it contains residues identical to those that are autophosphorylated in GRK5 and rhodopsin kinase. These data extend our knowledge of a growing family of receptor-specific kinases and suggest that GRK6 has a substrate specificity distinct from beta ARK, rhodopsin kinase, and GRK5."
https://openalex.org/W1570121117,"A predominant form of the inherited syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum is genetic complementation group C (XP-C). XP-C cells are defective in DNA nucleotide excision repair in the bulk of the genome but can repair transcribed strands of active genes. An activity that can complement the repair deficiency of extracts from XP-C cells has been purified approximately 2,000-fold from HeLa cells. The factor also increases the unscheduled DNA synthesis of XP-C fibroblasts in vivo after microinjection. Hydrodynamic measurements show that the XP-C complementing factor has a native molecular mass of approximately 160 kDa. The factor binds tightly to single-stranded DNA cellulose, eluting in approximately 1.3 M NaCl. No incision or ATPase activity of the protein alone was detected. XP-C protein is involved in an early stage of repair since its presence was required before the start of gap-filling repair synthesis. In vitro complementation was achieved with naked DNA substrates, and so a primary role in processing chromatin to allow access for repair enzymes seems unlikely. Surprisingly, however, extracts from an XP-C cell line introduced some incisions in UV-irradiated DNA; these were unstable in cell extracts and did not lead to complete repair. The data can be explained by a model in which XP-C factor participates in forming one of the repair incisions flanking DNA damage but not the other. In transcribed DNA, its role is subsumed by RNA polymerase and/or transcription coupling factors."
https://openalex.org/W1492682055,"Adenylate cyclase toxin (AC toxin) from Bordetella pertussis enters target cells to produce supraphysiologic levels of cAMP and, by a cAMP-independent process, is hemolytic. In the present study, we show for the first time that this toxin also produces ion-permeable, cation-selective pores in phospholipid bilayers. The resulting membrane conductance is absolutely calcium-dependent, as are the intoxication and hemolytic activities. It is strongly affected by the polarity and magnitude of the membrane potential and enhanced by the presence of negatively charged phospholipid. AC toxins from two mutants, BPDE386 and BPD377, which are defective in toxin activity, produce little or no conductance. Finally, evaluation of the current-voltage relationships and the concentration dependence of pore formation and of hemolysis reveal a greater than 3rd power dependence, suggesting that a multimer of AC toxin, probably consisting of three or more holotoxin molecules, is involved in pore formation."
https://openalex.org/W1508751842,"Elastase, an extracellular protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is synthesized as a preproenzyme containing a large amino-terminal propeptide. The propeptide is cleaved within the periplasm to form a noncovalent complex with the elastase moiety. The propeptide-elastase complex was purified from the cell extract of P. aeruginosa by affinity chromatography on Gly3-D-Phe-Sepharose. The purified fraction was proteolytically inactive and contained the propeptide-elastase complex as the major protein component. Activation by limited proteolysis with trypsin was associated with the disappearance of the propeptide. To correlate individual proteins in the preparation with proteolytic activity, the purified fraction was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and subsequent incubation of the separation gel over a skim milk-agarose-indicator gel. Clearing zones due to proteolysis were produced either by mature elastase (control) or the free processed periplasmic enzyme, a low level of which was present in the purified propeptide-elastase complex preparation. No clearing was evident with the propeptide-elastase complex, indicating inhibition by the bound propeptide. Proteolytic activity of mature elastase was inhibited by various Pseudomonas cell fractions. This inhibition was abolished by antipropeptide antibodies, and, as evident from immunoblotting analysis, was consistent with propeptide presence in the effective fraction, whole cell extract, cytosol, and one of the two periplasmic fractions obtained upon conversion of P. aeruginosa cells to spheroplasts. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-blotting of the various cell fractions onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation of the membranes with elastase and subsequent probing with antielastase antibodies revealed elastase propeptide binding. This binding of mature elastase to the propeptide was prevented by antibodies to the propeptide but not by inhibitors of elastase activity. Thermolysin, a neutral metalloprotease homologous to elastase, was not recognized by the elastase propeptide. In addition, propeptide containing P. aeruginosa fractions that were inhibitory to elastase had no effect on thermolysin activity. We conclude that elastase propeptide functions as an elastase inhibitor. Inhibition is specific, effective against both periplasmic and mature elastase, and depends on enzyme propeptide binding."

https://openalex.org/W1516244994,"Sea urchin eggs are surrounded by a gelatinous layer (called the jelly coat) that consists of mixture of fucoserich polysaccharides and sialic acid-rich glycoproteins. Chemical and 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopic studies revealed for the first time the presence of a novel polysialic acid (polySia) structure in the jelly coat glycoproteins isolated from Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus (designated polySia-gp(H)). The structure of the polySia chains was thoroughly characterized as (-->5-Oglycolyl-Neu5Gc alpha 2-->)n, where n ranges from 4 to more than 40 Neu5Gc residues. The polyNeu5Gc chains were attached to core oligosaccharides that were O-glycosidically linked to threonine residues on a core polypeptide. Each polypeptide contained about 17 O-linked polysialylglycan chains. The apparent molecular weight of polySia-gp(H) was 180,000. The expression of this new polySia structure in place of alpha 2-->8-linked polySia is the main structural feature that distinguishes polySia-gp from other known polysialylated glycoproteins. The (-->5-Ogly-colyl-Neu5Gc alpha 2-->)n chains were resistant to exo- and endosialidases from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and bacteriophage K1F, respectively. Discovery of these (-->5-Ogly-colyl-Neu5Gc alpha 2-->)n chains adds a new class of naturally occurring polySia to the structurally diverse family of polysialylated glycoproteins. The structure of a poly-Sia-gp from a different sea urchin species, Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus (designated polySia-gp(S)), was also determined to ascertain if there were any species-specific differences. The 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra of the two polySia-gps were identical, indicating that at this level of molecular detail the structures were the same. The molecular weight of polySiagp(S) was larger, however (250,000), and it contained about 25 polySia chains O-glycosidically linked to both threonine (two-thirds) and serine (one-third) residues."
https://openalex.org/W2167996208,"During development and fracture repair, endochondral bone formation is preceded by an orderly process of chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage matrix calcification. Analysis of calcifying versus noncalcifying cartilage has identified several differences in matrix proteins; among these are appearance of a novel collagen, type X, and decreased synthesis of type II collagen, the major component of cartilage matrix. In addition, there is a marked increase in alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme expressed at high levels in all mineralizing tissues. Cultured chondrocytes can be induced to undergo these changes in gene expression and to produce calcified matrix by exposure to ascorbic acid. The mechanism by which ascorbate produces these changes has been examined by analyzing the effect of the vitamin on prehypertrophic chick embryo sternal chondrocytes. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that ascorbate alters mRNA levels in chondrocytes by changing the transcription rates. The fact that marked changes in mRNA levels require 1-2 days of ascorbate exposure suggested that the effect of this vitamin on gene transcription may be secondary to other, earlier ascorbate-induced effects. Since cells cultured with ascorbate produce a collagen-enriched matrix, we examined the hypothesis that transcriptional changes were secondary to altered cell-matrix interactions. Chondrocytes were cultured after attachment to tissue culture plastic, in suspension, or on plates coated with collagen type I. Comparison of alkaline phosphatase activity with and without ascorbate addition demonstrated that under all of these conditions, induction of enzyme was dependent on the presence of ascorbate. When plates containing ascorbate-conditioned chondrocyte matrix were used as substrate for naive chondrocytes, the cells continued to require ascorbate for induction of high levels of alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen mRNA. Addition of the hydroxylation inhibitor, 3,4-dehydroproline, caused marked inhibition of collagen secretion as well as accumulation of underhydroxylated collagens within the cells. However, even in the presence of this inhibitor ascorbate was effective in inducing elevated alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen. These results indicate that the ability of ascorbate to induce chondrocyte hypertrophy does not depend on production of a collagen-rich matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2021796216,"The x-ray standing waves generated by dynamical Bragg diffraction were used to directly measure lattice locations of trace elements within and at the surface of a mineral single crystal. These high-precision measurements were made on natural Iceland spar calcite cleaved along the (101̅4) plane and reacted with a dilute aqueous lead solution. Within the bulk crystal, naturally occurring trace manganese was found within (101̅4) planes, consistent with its substitution for calcium. At the crystal surface, sorbed lead was found to be highly ordered and mostly within (101̅4) planes. This demonstrates a powerful application of synchrotron radiation in the earth and environmental sciences."
https://openalex.org/W1499490171,"Only a small fraction of the adult chicken erythrocyte histones is involved in dynamic acetylation. We have reported previously that the rapidly acetylated and deacetylated H4 histones are primarily associated with the transcriptionally active DNA-enriched chromatin fragments that remain attached to the residual nuclear material following micrococcal nuclease digestion and chromatin solubilization. Furthermore, this nuclear fraction contained most of the histone deacetylase activity. In this study we show that the bulk of the nuclear histone acetyltransferase activity is located with the insoluble residual nuclear material. We demonstrate that in vitro the enzymes associated with the residual nuclear material catalyze reversible acetylation when the endogenous histones of the nuclear skeleton-bound chromatin fragments are used as substrate. Nuclear matrices isolated from adult chicken immature erythrocyte and trout liver nuclei had 60-76% of the nuclear histone acetyltransferase activity. Procedures that solubilized the internal nuclear matrix also resulted in the release of the enzyme from the nuclear matrix. Together, our observations suggest that histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase are associated with the internal nuclear matrix, and one of the functions of these enzymes may be to mediate a dynamic attachment between transcriptionally active chromatin and the nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1584457508,"The yeast-based two hybrid system has been used to determine whether oligomerization of the intracellular domain of the 55-kDa type 1 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor may occur during TNF action. This assay depends upon reconstitution of the function of the GAL4 transcriptional activator through interaction of a protein fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain with a protein fused to the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4. Fusion of the type 1 TNF receptor intracellular domain with the DNA binding domain and the transactivation domain of GAL4 led to activation of the lacZ indicator gene, demonstrating interaction of the receptor intracellular domain with itself. A HeLa cell cDNA library was searched for proteins that interact with the intracellular domain of the type 1 TNF receptor. A protein corresponding to amino acids 329-426 in the type 1 TNF receptor intracellular domain was identified by this screen. The aggregation domain was further defined by testing the ability of deletion mutants of the type 1 TNF receptor intracellular region to interact with the complete intracellular domain. These experiments map the aggregation domain to a sequence of amino acids previously shown to be responsible for mediating TNF-induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that aggregation of type 1 TNF receptor intracellular domains may be important in TNF signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1495353088,"The G1 and G2 glycoproteins of Punta Toro virus, a member of the bunyaviruses, are targeted to the Golgi complex, where viral budding occurs. We found that the G1 protein, when expressed in the absence of G2, is also targeted to the Golgi complex. A series of G1 proteins truncated at the carboxyl-terminal region was constructed, and the localization of the expressed proteins was examined. It was found that the proteins expressed from constructs with partial deletions in the cytoplasmic domain were transported to the Golgi complex at a significantly slower rate than G1. Although a major fraction of these proteins was eventually transported to the Golgi complex, they did not exhibit as clearly defined a pattern of accumulation as G1, but rather appeared to be distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the Golgi complex. The proteins expressed from constructs lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain and, in some cases, part of the transmembrane domain sequences as well were transported to the cell surface. We have also constructed chimeric proteins with the envelope protein of a murine leukemia virus (MCFenv), which is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane. A MCF-G1 chimera that contained the G1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was found to be efficiently retained in the Golgi complex, and a construct that contained only the G1 transmembrane domain was also partially retained in the Golgi complex. Thus, the transmembrane domain as well as a portion of the cytoplasmic domain adjacent to the transmembrane domain are apparently crucial for Golgi retention of the G1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1487135478,"The role of integration host factor (IHF) in the regulation of the sigma 54-dependent promoter Pu of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida has been examined. We have selected in vivo insertions of intrinsically curved DNA that restore the responsiveness of an IHF-binding site deletion variant of Pu to the cognate activator of the system, XylR. We found five Pu derivatives which had inserted a core sequence with 6 phased [A]6 tracts, flanked by different lengths of DNA at the location of the former IHF site. They displayed 40-100% of the activity of Pu, were independent of IHF, and maintained the overall geometry of the wild-type promoter. The induction patterns of Pu, compared to those of hybrid promoters, were virtually indistinguishable. This supports the notion that, in native conditions, IHF co-regulates the system by providing a structural aid for promoter architecture and not by interacting directly with the RNA polymerase, as it has been suggested with other known IHF-dependent promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1480173187,"The amyloid beta-protein (A beta) and protease nexin-2/amyloid beta-protein precursor (PN-2/A beta PP) are major constituents of senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. It has been suggested that the coagulation protease thrombin may process A beta PP in a manner leading to the formation of A beta. Here we investigated the effects of thrombin on the secretion and processing of PN-2/A beta PP and the production of A beta in a cellular system. Incubation of glioblastoma cells with thrombin (1-5 nM) resulted in the accumulation of abnormally processed, carboxyl-terminal-truncated forms of secreted PN-2/A beta PP (approximately 85 kDa) in the culture medium. Higher concentrations of thrombin (> 10 nM) also increased the levels of secreted PN-2/A beta PP in cultured untransfected glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma cells that were stably transfected to overproduce the 695 isoform of A beta PP. Increased secretion of PN-2/A beta PP required the proteolytic activity of thrombin, was induced by activation of the thrombin receptor by agonist peptides, and required activation of protein kinase C. Incubation of the untransfected and transfected glioblastoma cells with thrombin led to decreased levels of soluble A beta in the culture medium consistent with previously suggested mechanisms regarding the secretion of PN-2/A beta PP. Although the present studies suggest that thrombin does not directly contribute to A beta formation, its proteolysis of secreted PN-2/A beta PP may disrupt regions near the carboxyl terminus of the secreted proteins that account for their neuroprotective and cell adhesive properties."
https://openalex.org/W1570880570,"Adhesion of A-121 human ovarian carcinoma cells to extracellular matrix is partly mediated via interaction between galaptin, an endogenous beta-galactoside-binding lectin present in extracellular matrix, and specific cell surface carbohydrate receptors identified as lysosomal associated membrane proteins, lamp-1 and lamp-2. In this study, we report that adhesion of human ovarian carcinoma cells to polystyrene plates coated with polymerized human splenic galaptin can be inhibited by polyclonal antibodies raised against lamp-1 and lamp-2 molecules and by pretreatment of A-121 human ovarian carcinoma cells with glucosamine analogs: 2-acetamido-1,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-3- deoxy-3-fluoro-alpha-D-glucopyranose (3-F-GlcNAc) and 2-acetamido-1,3,6-tri-O-acetyl-4-deoxy-4-fluoro-alpha-D-glucopyranose (4-F-GlcNAc). A 48-h exposure of A-121 cells to individual sugar analogs, or to a combination of the two, resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cellular attachment to polymerized galaptin. Both drugs inhibited glycoprotein biosynthesis as measured by cellular incorporation of labeled [3H]glucosamine and [3H]fucose with negligible effects on [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation and cell growth. As a result of drug action on glycoprotein biosynthesis, an alteration in the structure of the galaptin receptor was noted by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Moreover, probing gels of cell extracts with anti-lamp antibodies or Datura stramonium lectin demonstrated significant changes in the reactivity and pattern of glycoprotein staining, suggesting an effect of sugar analogs on the glycosylation of various cellular receptor molecules. The greatest change was observed when tumor cells were exposed to a combination of the two sugar analogs. These studies suggest that specific endogenous lectins and their surface receptors play a role in tumor cell adhesion and perhaps metastasis and may serve as suitable targets for therapeutic exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W2144092964,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) oncoprotein Tax is a potent activator of viral and cellular gene transcription. Tax does not bind DNA directly but utilizes cellular transcription factors to mediate activation. In this report, we examine the role of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in Tax deregulation of gene expression, as these proteins play a critical role in progression through the cell cycle and have been implicated in neoplastic disease. We show that the bHLH proteins do not mediate activation, but instead mediate repression of gene expression in the presence of Tax. We further show that a consensus bHLH binding site in the promoter of the beta-polymerase gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in DNA repair, mediates the previously reported repression of beta-polymerase gene expression by Tax. Together, these results suggest that Tax may induce malignant transformation, at least in part, through bHLH-mediated repression of key cellular regulatory genes."
https://openalex.org/W1927118261,"The resting plasma membrane of circulating blood cells demonstrates an asymmetric distribution of the phospholipid classes across the bilayer that is altered during cellular activation. To better understand the mechanisms governing transbilayer distribution of phospholipids, studies were conducted using the erythrocyte ghost, in which plasma membrane leaflet distribution of phospholipids can be readily probed. Preparation of ghosts by hypotonic lysis at increasingly high dilution markedly enhanced (up to 10-fold) calcium-induced (50-500 microM) transbilayer movement of phospholipids. The enhanced transbilayer movement was assessed by translocation of exogenously added sn-2-[6[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-labeled phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine from the plasma membrane outer leaflet to the inner leaflet and vice versa, as well as transbilayer movement of endogenous phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet. It was found that phospholipid movement was bidirectional and also nonspecific with regard to polar head group. It was further demonstrated that preparation of ghosts at increasing dilution resulted in depletion of cellular polyamines and that physiologic replenishment of spermine, and to a lesser extent spermidine, resulted in significant inhibition (50 and 25%, respectively) of transbilayer movement of phospholipids. Replenishment of other di- and polyamines demonstrated that inhibition was not simply dependent on total cationic charge but rather on charge density and suggestive of specific interaction of the polyamines, particularly spermine, with the plasma membrane. As most cells demonstrate both a high degree of regulation in maintenance of polyamine levels and the means for facile shifts within cellular polyamine pools, it is suggested that loss of membrane asymmetry during cellular activation may be mediated in part through enhanced transbilayer movement of phospholipids due to altered polyamine-membrane associations."

https://openalex.org/W1509692938,"The 1235 residue herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase is a prototype alpha-like DNA polymerase and also an antiviral drug target. To investigate its organization, we mapped favored cleavage sites for seven proteases and identified three major classes of stable proteolytic fragments: 70-85-kDa N-terminal fragments, 50-70-kDa fragments that start near residues 600-700, and 12-kDa C-terminal fragments. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the first two classes of fragments remained associated; thus, cleavage in the center of the protein did not resolve structurally separate domains. In contrast, the 12-kDa C-terminal fragments did not remain associated with other fragments, suggesting a small separable C-terminal domain. The 70-85-kDa N-terminal fragments contained 3‘-5‘ exonuclease and ribonuclease H activities; however, cleavage at the center of the molecule or near the C terminus appeared to destroy DNA polymerase activity. All three major classes of fragments bound DNA in DNA-cellulose chromatography and Southwestern blot analyses. The C-terminal fragments bound the viral polymerase processivity factor, UL42. The results map activities to regions of herpes simplex virus polymerase and suggest a model for its organization that may be pertinent to other DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1480038774,"Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is an evolutionarily conserved, nonlysosomal metalloprotease that has been implicated in the cellular degradation and processing of insulin. However, the site and the mode of the action of this enzyme are unclear. We have addressed these questions by establishing several Ltk- cell lines that can overexpress human insulin-degrading enzyme (hIDE) upon glucocorticoid induction. The level of overexpression of hIDE protein and transcripts in these lines correlates well with an increase in insulin degradation in both cell lysates and intact cells. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of mammalian and Drosophila IDEs reveals a conserved carboxyl-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (A/S-K-L), suggesting that IDE may be localized in peroxisomes. To test this possibility, we determined the cellular location of the stably transfected hIDE by both immunofluorescence and immunocryoelectron microscopy. The overexpressed hIDE predominantly colocalized with catalase in peroxisomes, although IDE was also found in the cytosol at a much lower concentration. These results demonstrate that stably transfected IDE catalyzes a rate-limiting step in cellular insulin degradation and is localized predominantly in peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1568052852,"Somatic mutations of the alpha subunit of Gs (G alpha s) have been detected in a variety of endocrine tumors. To test whether G alpha s is an oncogene, we investigated the genomic effects of G alpha s protein in which the GTPase activity had been inactivated. Results from transient transfection studies show that such proteins increase 1) transcription of a reporter gene driven by the minimal cAMP-responsive element (TGACGTCA) and 2) c-fos transcription in several endocrine cell lines (GH3, AtT20, and PC12). By promoter deletion analyses and genetic inactivation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we show that this transcriptional stimulation by G alpha s impinges on several regulatory elements within the c-fos promoter and operates within the protein kinase A pathways. Stable PC12 cell lines were established to analyze long-term effects of constitutively active G alpha s. Cell lines expressing mutated G alpha s have elevated cAMP levels and increased AP1 binding activity. Transcription of a variety of genes, including c-fos, c-jun, and junB, is increased in these cells. The strong and permanent effects of G alpha s on early immediate genes, and c-fos in particular, may be responsible for the oncogenic potential of G alpha s in endocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1537363506,"Stimulation of intracellular cholesterol esterification, which is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT), by atherogenic lipoproteins in macrophages is a key step in the ability of these cells to store lipoprotein-cholesterol and in the eventual development of atheroma foam cells. Herein, we provide evidence that the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in the stimulation of cholesterol esterification by atherogenic lipoproteins in macrophages. When the actin cytoskeleton of cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages was disrupted by treatment with cytochalasin D or Clostridial C2 toxin, the ability of beta very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) to stimulate cholesterol esterification was decreased 3-6-fold, even under conditions in which beta-VLDL protein degradation, cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, or net cholesterol delivery to the cells was matched. Esterification of cellular phospholipids and triglycerides was not affected by this treatment. Cytochalasin D treatment of macrophages also inhibited the ability of acetyl-low density lipoprotein, another foam cell-forming lipoprotein, to stimulate cholesterol esterification, but stimulation of cholesterol esterification by 25-hydroxycholesterol was not inhibited by cytochalasin D. Cytochalasin D was found to inhibit neither the exit of beta-VLDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes nor the ability of beta-VLDL to down-regulate endogenous cholesterol synthesis. From these data we conclude that an intact actin cytoskeleton is necessary for efficient stimulation of cholesterol esterification by atherogenic lipoproteins in macrophages. Although the exact function of actin in the cholesterol esterification pathway remains to be determined, our data rule out a general role for actin in intracellular cholesterol trafficking or maintenance of ACAT enzyme activity. Rather, we speculate that actin filaments play a role in specific cellular entry processes of atherogenic lipoproteins and/or in establishing transport or contact between the plasma membrane cholesterol substrate pool and the ACAT enzyme in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1536564297,"With increase in age, proteins of the eye lens undergo covalent modifications associated with interprotein cross-linking, loss of protein solubility, generation of protein-associated pigments, and racemization of some optically active residues. Precipitated protein aggregates localized in the nucleus of brunescent lenses are modified to such an extent that they become resistant to the commonly used methods of extraction by reducing agents or detergents. Thus, little information is available on the types of protein modifications that occur in the nuclear region of the lens. Here we report the simultaneous solubilization and digestion of the entire nuclear pellet of brunescent human cataract lenses into constituent amino acids and their derivatives through protease action at neutral pH. Fractionation of the resulting hydrolyzate by reverse phase chromatography, followed by spectroscopic and biochemical analysis of one of the purified fractions, showed the presence of racemic tyrosine in the amino acid mixture. Racemization of L-amino acid residues in protein chains is associated with the aging process. This is the first report of racemization of tyrosine in any system studied so far."
https://openalex.org/W1522965425,"Abstract Brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite, interferes with vesicular transport causing disassembly of the Golgi complex with redistribution of Golgi components to the endoplasmic reticulum, and isolation of the trans-Golgi cisternae from the trans-Golgi network. We examined the effects of brefeldin A on the synthesis of hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate by chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. Hyaluronan synthesis continues at a constant rate in the presence of brefeldin A for at least 8 h, and is therefore independent of vesicular transport. By contrast, chondroitin sulfate synthesis is rapidly inhibited (to < 1% within 15 min) by brefeldin A indicating that addition of chondroitin sulfate chains to the aggrecan core protein precursor requires vesicular transport. Removal of brefeldin A rapidly restored chondroitin sulfate chain elongation and sulfation on the aggrecan core protein precursor reaching 100% of control in 2 h and consistently establishing a higher steady state rate (up to 120%) by 4 h. Addition of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, an exogenous acceptor for the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate chains, does not reverse the brefeldin A block. This suggests that xyloside-initiated synthesis of chondroitin sulfate depends on transport vesicles as might occur if the enzymes for synthesizing the linkage tetrasaccharide (i.e. galactosyltransferases) reside in the Golgi, while those required to elongate the chains reside in the trans-Golgi network. Recovery of chondroitin sulfate synthesis from brefeldin A treatment occurred efficiently in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that the machinery for chondroitin sulfate synthesis reassembles from previously existing proteins. The results are consistent with the current model that hyaluronan synthesis occurs at the plasma membrane and is independent of vesicular transport, and with the hypothesis that the enzyme complex for chondroitin sulfate elongation and sulfation residues within the trans-Golgi network, and therefore isolated from the aggrecan core protein precursor in the presence of brefeldin A."
https://openalex.org/W1547834125,"The cDNA encoding the plant toxin precursor preproricin was introduced into tobacco via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. Transgenic plants were assayed for type II ribosome-inactivating protein expression and activity. Western blot analysis of soluble leaf extracts using anti-ricin a-chain (RTA) antibodies identified 34- and 32-kDa proteins, which were electrophoretically indistinguishable from castor seed RTA. Analysis with anti-ricin b-chain (RTB) antibodies identified both a 34-kDa protein major band, which co-migrated with castor seed RTB, and a 30-kDa protein minor band. Enzyme-linked immunoassay of the transgenic leaf extracts with anti-RTA and anti-RTB indicated microgram per gram production on a fresh weight basis of soluble extractable recombinant ricin. Sugar binding enzyme-linked immunoassay employing an immobilized glycoprotein, asialofetuin, and anti-RTB antibodies confirmed the characteristic type II ribosome-inactivating protein galactose binding lectin activity of the recombinant ricin. The enzymatic activity of recombinant ricin was characterized for cell-free translation inhibition, as well as for overall cytotoxicity. A 50% inhibitory dose of 3 x 10(-11) M was observed for the immunoreactive leaf extract material using a rabbit reticulocyte translation inhibition assay, while a 50% lethal dose of 1 x 10(-12) M was calculated with human T-lymphotropic virus-1 infected leukemic T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1563842612,"The hepatitis B virus X gene encodes a transcriptional trans-activator that appears essential for viral replication in the infected liver. It has been shown by others that at least two X protein products, initiating at different in-frame ATG codons within the X open reading frame, are necessary for full trans-activating function. Yet, previous studies have demonstrated only a full-length X gene transcript that extends 5' of the first ATG codon in the X open reading frame. In this communication, we present evidence for the existence of shorter X gene transcripts, whose heterogeneous 5' ends straddle the second ATG codon of the X open reading frame. These transcripts are not degradation products of the full-length X gene transcripts but rather arise from an independent promoter. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and functional analyses reveal that active X proteins are translated from these transcripts. Therefore, there appears to be a previously undescribed promoter embedded within the X open reading frame that can give rise to functionally important transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1601960728,"Recently, we reported the domain requirements for the binding of formyl peptide to its specific receptor. Based on experiments using receptor chimeras, we also postulated an importance for the amino-terminal domain of the receptor in ligand binding (Perez, H. D., Holmes, R., Vilander, L., Adams, R., Manzana, W., Jolley, D., and Andrews, W. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2292-2295). We have begun to perform a detailed analysis of the regions within the formyl peptide receptor involved in ligand binding. To address the importance of the receptor amino-terminal domain, we substituted (or inserted) hydrophilic sequences within the amino-terminal domain, expressed the receptors, and determined their ability to bind ligand. A stretch of nine amino acids next to the initial methionine was identified as crucial for receptor occupancy. A peptide containing such a sequence specifically completed binding of the ligand to the receptor. Alanine screen mutagenesis of the second extracellular domain also identified amino acids involved in ligand binding as well as a disulfide bond (Cys98 to Cys176) crucial for maintaining the binding pocket. These studies provide evidence for a novel mechanism involved in regulation of receptor occupancy. Binding of the ligand induces conformational changes in the receptor that result in the apposition of the amino-terminal domain over the ligand, providing a lid to the binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1500481760,"The transmembrane segments of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase were determined by trypsinization of cytoplasmic side-out intact sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The membrane portion of tryptic digest comprising the transmembrane fragments, joined by the intravesicular segments, was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after labeling with fluorescein 5-maleimide in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. In this way, seven fluorescent bands of tryptic fragments below 11 kDa were observed which were derived from 4 pairs of membrane spanning segments and one hydrophobic sequence at the C-terminal end. Two peptides of 10.8 and 10.6 kDa had the identical N-terminal sequence beginning at Glu826, representing the transmembrane segments M7 and M8 and their connecting loop. A band at 8.1 kDa contained one peptide beginning at Tyr36 (M1/loop/M2). A 7.7-kDa peptide starting at Leu253 (M3/loop/M4) and a 7.3-kDa peptide beginning at Ala752 (M5/loop/M6) were also observed. A band at 6.7 kDa contained two peptides, one beginning at Ser48 (M1/loop/M2) and another beginning at Tyr763 (M5/loop/M6). In addition, a 4-kDa peptide beginning at Met925 was observed. The size of this peptide did not allow for a complete pair of transmembrane segments, but this peptide could have been derived from trypsinolysis between the last pair of membrane spanning segments. These data therefore provide biochemical evidence for at least 8 transmembrane segments and perhaps two more at the C-terminal end of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1563601123,"Surface expression of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) in mature T cells requires the association of a variable heterodimer (alpha.beta or gamma.delta) with six invariant CD3 polypeptides (gamma, delta, epsilon-epsilon, zeta-zeta, or zeta-eta). We described here that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail polypeptide sequence (Lys-Lys-Lys-Asn-Ser) of TCR beta-chain (beta CT) results in expression of the truncated beta-chain on the surface of a mature T cell hybridoma line, in the absence of TCR-alpha, as a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored monomeric polypeptide. The GPI-anchored TCR-beta CT is not associated with CD3-epsilon and is incapable of conventional signal transduction. Association with TCR-alpha prevents beta CT from GPI-linkage formation. The alpha beta CT heterodimer binds the CD3 polypeptides, and the resultant TCR alpha beta CT/CD3 complex is capable of signal transduction. Our data show that a signal sequence for GPI-linkage formation is present in TCR-beta, and this alternative membrane anchoring mechanism can be utilized by beta-chain polypeptide lacking the CT sequence. We conclude therefore that in the absence of TCR-alpha expression, the beta-chain CT sequence plays an essential function in hindering GPI-linkage formation, thereby preventing escape of incompletely assembled TCR beta-chain to the cell surface of mature T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1483395415,"In this paper, the effects of the fungal metabolite, brefeldin A, on the synthesis and maturation of aggrecan core protein precursor were studied in rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes. The aggrecan core protein precursor was partially identified in total protein pools isolated from cell extracts based on its selective cleavage at a single site by the restriction protease factor Xa. During a 2-h labeling period with [3H]serine as precursor, brefeldin A inhibited the synthesis of mature aggrecan from its aggrecan core protein precursor consistent with an inhibition of chondroitin sulfate chain elongation and sulfation as described in the accompanying paper (Calabro, A., and Hascall, V. C. (1994) J. Biol Chem. 269, 22764-22770). This inhibition is presumably the result of the disruption of vesicular transport by brefeldin A, which isolates the aggrecan core protein precursor at the level of the trans-Golgi cisternae from the enzymes for chondroitin sulfate chain elongation and sulfation located in the trans-Golgi network. Brefeldin A also inhibited the exocytosis of all radiolabeled secretory proteins from the cell layer into the medium compartment, which is also consistent with the disruption of vesicular transport attributed to this metabolite. Although total protein synthesis was inhibited by 12% in the presence of brefeldin A, the aggrecan core protein precursor accumulated within the cell layer indicating that the inhibition of chondroitin sulfate synthesis by brefeldin A was not the result of a lack of aggrecan core protein precursor. When the brefeldin A block was removed and cultures chased in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, vesicular transport through the cell was re-established and chondroitin sulfate chains were added to a large proportion of the aggrecan core protein precursor that had accumulated during the brefeldin A block. These results suggest that the machinery for chondroitin sulfate synthesis and for protein exocytosis, that were disrupted by brefeldin A treatment, recover after removal of the brefeldin A, even in the presence of cycloheximide, and that the structures involved in these processes reassemble from previously existing proteins. Interestingly, two other proteins with the same relative abundance as the aggrecan core protein precursor were observed. An approximately 210-kDa protein with the characteristics of the fibronectin subunit, and an unidentified approximately 150-kDa protein which was efficiently cleaved by the protease Xa enzyme."
