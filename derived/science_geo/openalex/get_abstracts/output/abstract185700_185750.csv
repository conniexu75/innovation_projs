LPA has been widely considered to elicit its biological functions through three types of G protein-coupled receptors, Edg-2 (endothelial cell differentiation gene-2)/LPA1/vzg-1 (ventricular zone gene-1), Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3. We identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, p2y9/GPR23, as the fourth LPA receptor (LPA4). Membrane fractions of RH7777 cells transiently expressing p2y9/GPR23 displayed a specific binding for 1-oleoyl-LPA with a K d value of around 45 nm. Competition binding and reporter gene assays showed that p2y9/GPR23 preferred structural analogs of LPA with a rank order of 1-oleoyl- > 1-stearoyl- > 1-palmitoyl- > 1-myristoyl- > 1-alkyl- > 1-alkenyl-LPA. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing p2y9/GPR23, 1-oleoyl-LPA induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that mRNA of p2y9/GPR23 was significantly abundant in ovary compared with other tissues. Interestingly, p2y9/GPR23 shares only 20–24% amino acid identities with Edg-2/LPA1, Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3, and phylogenetic analysis also shows that p2y9/GPR23 is far distant from the Edg family. These facts suggest that p2y9/GPR23 has evolved from different ancestor sequences from the Edg family.

LPA induces mitogenic and/or morphological effects on the cells and has been proposed to be involved in biologically important processes, including neurogenesis, myelination, angiogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression (1Tokumura A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21360-21367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPA is generated mainly by two different pathways; 1) generation of lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or phospholipase A1, followed by conversion of these lysophospholipids to LPA by lysophospholipase D (5Aoki J. Taira A. Takanezawa Y. Kishi Y. Hama K. Kishimoto T. Mizuno K. Saku K. Taguchi R. Arai H. J. Biol.

At least three types of G protein-coupled receptors, Edg-2/LPA1/vzg-1 (7Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), Edg-4/LPA2 (8An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol.

These three G protein-coupled receptors share 50–57% amino acid identities. Several experiments have demonstrated that they can mediate adenylyl cyclase inhibition, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, phospholipase C activation, and Ca2+ mobilization through pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gi/o) and -insensitive G proteins (G12/13 and Gq/11/14) (2Contos J.J.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Edg-4/LPA2 and Edg-7/LPA3 have also been shown to activate adenylyl cyclase when they were overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells (9Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T.

However, the existence of one or more additional LPA receptors has been implied from the analysis of Edg-2/LPA1(–/–) Edg-4/LPA2(–/–) double knockout mice (10Contos J.J. Ishii I. Fukushima N.

Although p2y9/GPR23 shares only 20–24% amino acid identities with Edg-2/LPA1, Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3, and the phylogenetic analysis also shows that p2y9/GPR23 is distant from the Edg family (Fig. 1), our results consistently indicate that p2y9/GPR23 is the fourth LPA receptor (LPA4).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cells—1-Myristoyl (14:0), -palmitoyl (16:0), -stearoyl (18:0), and -oleoyl (18:1)-LPAs, 18:1-LPC, 18:1-LPE, 18:1-lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), and 18:1-LPS were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 18:1-LPA was also purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). 1-Alkyl- and 1-alkenyl-LPAs were kind gifts from Dr. R. Taguchi (Nagoya City University, Japan), which were prepared from bovine heart lyso-platelet-activating factor (lyso-PAF) and lyso-plasmalogen, respectively, by using phospholipase D. 18:1-PA and 17 nucleotides (ADP-glucose, ATP, ADP, S-adenosyl-l-methionine, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, CTP, GDP-fucose, GDP-mannose, GDP, UDP, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, UTP, UDP-glucuronic acid, and GTP) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and the Bioactive Lipid Library were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and 1-O-hexadecyl-PAF were from Cayman Chemical. [3H]LPA (1-oleoyl[oleoyl-9,10-3H(N)]LPA, 57 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) from Serologicals Proteins (Kankakee, IL) was of fatty acid-free and very low endotoxin grade. Other chemical reagents were of analytical grade. RH7777 rat hepatoma cells and B103 rat neuroblastoma cells were kindly provided from Dr. J. Chun (University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Human megakaryoblastic MEG-01 cells were purchased from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan).Construction of the Phylogenetic Tree—Peptide sequences of selected G protein-coupled receptors were obtained from GenBank™ and SwissProt. The phylogenetic tree was generated from peptide sequences of selected G protein-coupled receptors, using the all-against-all matching method (available at cbrg.inf.ethz.ch/Server/AllAll.html). The tree was constructed on the basis of point-accepted mutation distances between each pair of sequences estimated by the dynamic programming algorithm.Cloning of p2y 9/GPR23—The tBLASTn program was used to search the data base of GenBank™ for orphan G protein-coupled receptors sharing high identities with the human PAF receptor (14Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of p2y9/GPR23 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005296) was first amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR using KOD-Plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and oligonucleotides (sense primer, 5′-GTCCATAGTGTCAGAGTGGTGAAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CATATCTGGACCTGAACACATTTC-3′). The entire open reading frame of p2y9/GPR23 with an additional sequence of hemagglutin (HA)-epitope at the 5′-end was subsequently amplified from the resultant PCR products using KOD-Plus and oligonucleotides (sense primer containing KpnI and HA tag sequences, 5′-GGGGTACCGCCATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCGGTGACAGAAGATTCATT-3′; antisense primer containing XbaI sequence, 5′-GCTCTAGACTAAAAGGTGGATTCTAG-3′). The resultant DNA fragment was digested with KpnI and XbaI and subsequently cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCXN2.1, a slightly modified version of pCXN2 (15Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar) with multiple cloning sites, between KpnI and NheI sites.Binding Assay—RH7777 cells and B103 cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex Co., Walkersville, MD), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Roche Applied Science). Cells were transfected with p2y9/GPR23-pCXN2.1 or empty vector using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. The cells were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline twice and scraped off. After further washing with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 m sucrose), the cells were suspended in the buffer with additional 20 μm 4-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science), sonicated three times at 15 watts for 30 s, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resultant pellet was homogenized in ice-cold binding buffer. Binding assays were performed in 96-well plates in triplicates. For Scatchard analysis, 40 μg of the membrane fractions were incubated in binding buffer containing 0.25% BSA with various concentrations of [3H]LPA for 60 min at 4 °C. The bound [3H]LPA was collected onto a Unifilter-96-GF/C (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a MicroMate 196 harvester (Packard, Wellesley, MA). The filter was then rinsed ten times with binding buffer containing 0.25% BSA and dried for 2 h at 50 °C. 25 μl of MicroScint-0 scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added per well. The radioactivity that remained on the filter was measured with a TopCount microplate scintillation counter (Packard). Total and nonspecific bindings were evaluated in the absence and presence of 10 μm unlabeled LPA, respectively. The specific binding value (dpm) was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding value (dpm) from the total binding value (dpm). For competition assay with related lipids, 20 μg of the membrane fractions were incubated with 5 nm [3H]LPA in the absence or presence of 1 μm of unlabeled 18:1-LPA, 18:1-LPC, 18:1-LPE, 18:1-LPS, 18:1-LPG, 18:1-PA, PAF, S1P, or SPC. For competition assay with structural analogs of LPA, 10 μg of the membrane fractions was incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled 18:1-, 18:0-, 1-alkyl-, and 1-alkenyl-LPA in the presence of 2.5 nm [3H]LPA. Before conducting the binding assays, the cell surface expression of p2y9/GPR23 was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis (Epics XL, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with anti-HA rat IgG (3F10, Roche Applied Science) and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-rat IgG (Beckman Coulter) as the second antibody.Reporter Gene Assay—PC-12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. 2 × 105 cells were transfected with 450 ng of p2y9/GPR23-pCXN2.1 or empty vector, 530 ng of zif 268-firefly luciferase-pGL2 (a kind gift from Dr. T. Naito, Japan Tobacco, Tokyo, Japan), and 20 ng of CMV-Renilla luciferase-pRL (Promega, Madison, WI) using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hiden, Germany), and cultured on collagen-coated 24-well plates for 48 h. Cells were washed three times with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA and cultured in the serum-free DMEM for 12 h, and stimulated with various concentrations of LPA analogs. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using PICAGENE Dual Seapansy (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) and a MiniLumat LB 9506 luminometer (Berthold, Bundoora, Australia). Firefly luciferase values were standardized to Renilla ones.Ca2+ Measurement—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with p2y9/GPR23-pCXN2.1 or empty vector using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. Stably transfected clones were selected with 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and maintained with 0.3 mg/ml G418. Cell surface expression of p2y9/GPR23 was detected by flow cytometric analysis as described above (see Fig. 4A). For the ligand screening assay, clones highly expressing p2y9/GPR23 were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight. They were loaded with 4 μm Fluo-3 AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in HEPES-HBSS buffer (1 × Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, and 2.5 mm probenecid) and 0.04% pluronic acid for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice, and filled with HEPES-HBSS buffer. They were then stimulated with 198 lipids contained in the Bioactive Lipid Library and 17 nucleotides (described under “Materials and Cells”) individually, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was monitored with a scanning fluorometer (FLEXstation, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. For examination of dose dependence, CHO cell clones highly expressing p2y9/GPR23 or mock-transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, serum-starved for 24 h in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.1% BSA, washed twice again with phosphate-buffered saline, and then harvested. The harvested cells were further washed with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, and 5.6 mmd-glucose), and loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 AM (Dojindo) in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA (HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension was applied to a CAF-100 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), and 5 μl of various concentrations of 18:1-LPA in HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer was added. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by the ratio of emission fluorescence of 500 nm by excitations at 340 and 380 nm.Fig. 4LPA-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in CHO cells. A, cell surface expression of p2y9/GPR23. In a clonal population of CHO cells stably expressing p2y9/GPR23 tagged with HA at N terminus (black area), the higher intensity of fluorescence was detected by flow cytometric analysis than in mock-transfected CHO cells (gray area). This is a representative result of four independent clones, which gave essentially identical patterns. B, dose-response curves. A clonal population of CHO cells stably expressing p2y9/GPR23 was loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 AM, and stimulated with increasing concentrations of 18:1-LPA (▪). The results of mock-transfected CHO cells are also shown as a negative control (□). Data are means ± S.D. (n = 3) of a representative of four different stable clones. C, representative traces of Ca2+ responses. A clonal population of CHO cells stably expressing p2y9/GPR23 was stimulated with 100 nm 18:1-LPA (right). A result of mock-transfected CHO cells is also shown as a negative control (left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)cAMP Assay—CHO cell clones stably expressing p2y9/GPR23 were used to measure cAMP levels. After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were harvested and suspended in HBSS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. The density was 5 × 106 or 5 × 107 cells/ml for assay in the presence or absence of forskolin, respectively. 20 μl of the cell suspension was applied to 96-well plates and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of ligand solution of 18:1-LPA in HBSS-BSA buffer with or without 5 μm forskolin. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of HBSS-BSA buffer containing 4% Tween 20. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, cAMP contents in the supernatant were measured by a Fusion system (Packard) using an AlphaScreen cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was for 12 h at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Results were expressed as -fold increases over respective controls.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Human first strand cDNAs from 16 tissues were purchased from Clontech (Human MTC Panel I and II), whose concentrations were normalized to the mRNA expression levels of four different housekeeping genes (α-tubulin, β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and PLA2). The cDNA levels of GAPDH and p2y9/GPR23 were quantified using a LightCycler apparatus (Roche Applied Science). The PCR reactions were set up in microcapillary tubes in a volume of 20 μl, consisting of 2 μl of cDNA solution, 1× FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 μm each sense and antisense primers and 3 mm MgCl2. The PCR program for GAPDH was as follows; denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and 50 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 0 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s. The PCR program for p2y9/GPR23 was as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and 50 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, and extension at 72 °C for 6 s. For GAPDH, a human GAPDH control Amplimer Set (Clontech), designed to amplify a 983-bp fragment was used as primers; sense primer: 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and antisense primer: 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. The primers for p2y9/GPR23 were designed to amplify a 139-bp fragment; sense primer: 5′-AAAGATCATGTACCCAATCACCTT-3′ and antisense primer: 5′-CTTAAACAGGGACTCCATTCTGAT-3′. The PCR products were detected by measuring the fluorescence of SYBR Green I, which selectively bound to double-stranded DNA and emitted the greatly enhanced fluorescence. The cDNA level of each sample was quantified by Fit Points Method in LightCycler analysis software. The control cDNA contained in Clontech human MTC Panels and a linearized p2y9/GPR23-pCXN2.1 were used as standards for GAPDH and p2y9/GPR23, respectively. In both cases, the quality of PCR products was assessed by monitoring a fusion step.Northern Hybridization—Human poly(A)+ RNA samples from kidney and skeletal muscle were purchased from Clontech. Total RNA of human megakaryoblastic MEG-01 cells was extracted with Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 200 μg of the total RNA using μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). For Northern analysis, 2.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled probes of human p2y9/GPR23 and human β-actin, as described previously (16Ogasawara H. Ishii S. Yokomizo T. Kakinuma T. Komine M. Tamaki K. Shimizu T. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18763-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The washed membrane was subjected to autoradiography for 4 days (p2y9/GPR23) or 3 h (β-actin).RESULTSScreening of Candidate Ligands—Phylogenetic analysis showed that p2y9/GPR23 was most closely related to the orphan receptor p2y5 and relatively close to the functional receptors for nucleotides (P2Y1, P2Y4, and P2Y6) (17Boeynaems J.M. Communi D. Savi P. Herbert J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and for lipids (G2A, GPR4, GPR65/TDAG8, GPR68/OGR1, PAF receptor, CysLT1, and CysLT2) (18Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). It was, therefore, supposed that p2y9/GPR23 might interact with lipids or nucleotides. We screened 198 lipids and 17 nucleotides using CHO cells stably expressing p2y9/GPR23 by measuring intracellular Ca2+ mobilization with FLEXstation, a scanning fluorometer. Among them, 18:1-LPA at a concentration of 10 μm induced a significant increase in [Ca2+]i in p2y9/GPR23-expressing cells, but not in p2y5-expressing cells (data not shown).Membrane Binding Assay—To characterize the binding of LPA to p2y9/GPR23, we conducted membrane binding assays using [3H]18:1-LPA. RH7777 rat hepatoma cells transiently transfected with p2y9/GPR23 were used, because RH7777 cells were not responsive to LPA (19Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

[3H]LPA binding to membrane fractions of RH7777 cells was greatly enhanced by p2y9/GPR23 transfection (Fig. 2A). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses showed no induction of endogenous receptors (Edg-2/LPA1, Edg-4/LPA2, or Edg-7/LPA3)byp2y9/GPR23 transfection (data not shown). Scatchard analysis indicated a dissociation constant (K d) of 44.8 nm and a maximum binding capacity (B max) of 37.2 pmol/mg of protein (Fig. 2B). Competition analyses revealed that only 18:1-LPA, but not 18:1-LPC, 18:1-LPE, 18:1-LPS, 18:1-LPG, 18:1-PA, PAF, S1P, or SPC competed for [3H]LPA binding to the membrane fractions of p2y9/GPR23-expressing RH7777 cells (Fig. 2C). 18:1- and 18:0-LPA competed for [3H]LPA binding to the membrane fractions of p2y9/GPR23-expressing RH7777 cells with K i values of 80.0 and 282 nm, respectively (Fig. 2D). 1-Alkyl- and 1-alkenyl-LPA also competed for [3H]LPA binding but rather weakly (Fig. 2D). Because B103 rat neuroblastoma cells were also reported to lack responsiveness to LPA (19Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), binding assays using B103 cells were performed in the same manner as RH7777 cells. The specific binding activities of p2y9/GPR23-transfected B103 cells were 289, 859, and 2975 dpm/50 μg of protein at 1, 3, and 10 nm [3H]LPA, respectively. Based on the specific activity of [3H]LPA, 2975 dpm/50 μg of protein corresponds to 0.47 pmol/mg of protein. The binding activities of the mock-transfected B103 cells were 79, 197, and 238 dpm/50 μg of protein at 1, 3, and 10 nm [3H]LPA, respectively.Fig. 2[3H]LPA binding to RH7777 cell membranes.

Detailed analysis of the interaction between Btk and TLR8 demonstrates that the presence of both Box 2 and 3 motifs in the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain was required for the interaction. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Btk can also interact with key proteins involved in TLR4 signal transduction, namely, MyD88, Mal (MyD88 adapter-like protein), and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1, but not TRAF-6. The ability of Btk to interact with TLR4 and Mal suggests a role for Btk in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal transduction. Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 with LPS resulted in an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk (indicative of activation). The autokinase activity of Btk was also stimulated after LPS stimulation. In addition, a dominant negative form of Btk inhibited TLR4-mediated activation of a nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-dependent reporter gene in HEK293 cells as well as LPS-induced activation of NFκB in the astrocytoma cell line U373 and the monocytic cell line RAW264.7. Further investigation revealed that the Btk-specific inhibitor, LFM-A13, inhibited the activation of NFκB by LPS in THP-1 cells. Our findings implicate Btk as a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-binding protein that is important for NFκB activation by TLR4.

The Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases, of which Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) 1The abbreviations used are: Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; Xid, X-linked immunodeficiency; IL, interleukin; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; Xid, X-linked immunodeficiency; IL, interleukin; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin. is a prototypical member, is involved in a vast array of signaling pathways in cells of hematopoietic lineage. Btk is expressed in all hematopoietic cells except T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It is critically important for B-cell development as well as mature B-cell activation and survival. It has also been shown to be important for IgE-mediated activation of mast cells resulting in allergic reactions. Btk kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation have both been shown to increase upon cross-linking or stimulation of the B-cell receptor, the IgE receptor (FcϵRII), and a number of cytokine receptors such as those for IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, suggesting a general role for Btk in immune regulation (1de Weers M.

Whereas the molecular mechanisms by which the B-cell receptor regulates B-cell proliferation and survival are not well understood, Btk has recently been shown to lie downstream of the B-cell receptor on the pathway regulating activation of the key pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFκB (5Bajpai U.D.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The biological importance of the signaling function has been shown by naturally occurring loss of function mutations in Btk in human X-linked agammaglobulinemia and its murine counter-part, X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid). These diseases are characterized by a block in B-cell development and defects in B-cell signaling, and in X-linked agammaglobulinemia patients, mutations in Btk are associated associated with an increased frequency of bacterial infections in all organs (9Vihinen M. Mattsson P.T. Smith C.I.E. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d27-d42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Studies in Xid mice have also shown reduced responses to LPS stimulation, with nitric oxide (NO) production decreased, and macrophage effector functions impaired (10Huber B. Melchers F. Eur. J.

George A. Bal V. Rath S. Ravindran B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2914-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This, coupled with the observation that responses to T-independent antigens are impaired in Xid mice, suggests a role for Btk in innate immune responses.Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have an essential function in both innate and adaptive immunity and have evolved to recognize, with high specificity, diverse microbial pathogens (13Jefferies C. O'Neill L.A.J. Mod. Aspects Immunobiol. 2002; 2: 169-175Google Scholar). TLR4, as the receptor for the Gram-negative bacterial product LPS, is the prototypical member of the family (numbered TLR1–10 in humans) of type I transmembrane receptors, which are characterized by an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, responsible for signaling. Ligands for other family members (except TLR10) have been identified and include bacterial flagellin and un-methylated bacterial CpG motifs for TLR5 and TLR9, respectively; double-stranded RNA for TLR3; and the antiviral compound R-848 recognizing TLR7 and TLR8. Research into how these receptors signal has identified MyD88 and IL-1-receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) as key proximal signaling components regulating activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFκB in response to LPS (reviewed in Ref. 14O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Important differences in the proteins recruited to the different TLR members have also been described. Both TLR2 (the receptor for bacterial products such as peptidoglycan) and TLR4 recruit an adapter protein homologous to MyD88, which has been termed Mal (for MyD88 adapter-like protein) or TIRAP (Toll/IL-1 receptor adapter protein), which has been shown to interact with TLR4 and MyD88 and mediate signaling to NFκB activation (15Fitzgerald K.A.

Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Btk also interacts with MyD88, Mal, and IRAK-1, but not TRAF-6. We investigated the involvement of Btk in LPS signaling via TLR4 and found that LPS activated Btk and that inactive mutants of Btk inhibited LPS signaling to NFκB activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening—Full-length Btk was cloned into pPCH1 (19Hagemann C. Kalmes A. Wixler V. Wixler L. Schuster T. Rapp U.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and used as a bait. HF7c yeast cells expressing the bait vector were transformed (20Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar) with a human splenic library. The triple dropout plates contained 5 mm 3-aminotriazole, and putative clones were tested for β-galactosidase activity. Subdomains of TLR8 (TIR domain, individual boxes) were generated by PCR using the following primers: (a) Box 1, 2, and 3, GTTTGAATTCTATATAATGTGTGTTTAGCTAAGGTAAAAGG (forward) and TGGCTCGAGATCATGACTTAACGTCAGTTAGTATTGC (reverse); (b) Box 2 and 3, CTGAATTCCTGACTGGGTGATAAATGAG (forward) and TGGCTCGAGATCATGACTTAACGTCAGTTAGTATTGC (reverse); (c) Box 3, CGAATTCGTAAGAGCTCCATCCTCC (forward) and TGGCTCGAGATCATGACTTAACGTCAGTTAGTATTGC (reverse); (d) Box 1 and 2, GTTTGAATTCTATATAATGTGTGTTTAGCTAAGGTAAAAGG (forward) and CTGCTCGAGGTTGTCGATGATGGCC (reverse); and (e) Box 1, GTTTGAATTCTATATAATGTGTGTTTAGCTAAGGTAAAAGG (forward) and CTCCTCGAGGTGGTAGCGCAGC (reverse).The different subdomains of the TLR8 TIR domain as well as the other TIR domains were cloned into the library vector pAct2 (Clontech) and co-transformed with the Btk bait vector in HF7c yeast cells.Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Reagents—HEK293 and U373 cell lines were obtained from the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (Porton Down, United Kingdom), and the RAW264.7 cell line was obtained from the European Centre for Animal Cell Culture Collection; these cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml-1 gentamycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. THP-1 cells were obtained from the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml-1 gentamycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at 105 cells/ml-1 for experiments and treated as indicated in the figure legends. The chimeric CD4-TLR4-expressing plasmid was a kind gift from Ruslan Medzhitov (Yale University School of Medicine) and has been described previously (15Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The NFκB-luciferase plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. R. Hofmeister (Universitat Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany) and contains five κB sites upstream of the luciferase gene. The plasmid encoding MyD88 was a gift from Marta Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy), and IRAK-1 was a gift from Emma-Louise Cooke (Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, United Kingdom). TRAF-6 was a kind gift from Tularik (San Francisco, CA). The wild-type Btk sequence cloned into the pBluescript cloning vector was obtained from R. Hendriks (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Different point mutations, resulting in either the dominant negative (K430R) or the Xid (R28C) version of the Btk protein, were generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according the protocol of the manufacturer. After sequencing, the plasmid DNA of positive clones was digested with NotI and cloned into a filled EcoRV site of the pCDNA3 expression vector. The Btk-specific inhibitor, LFM-A13, was obtained from Calbiochem (Nottingham, United Kingdom). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, United Kingdom) unless otherwise stated.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells were seeded (105 cells/ml-1) onto 100-mm dishes 24 h before transfection with combinations of plasmids (4 μg of each) as indicated, using Genejuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (8 μg in total) by the addition of various amounts of the appropriate empty vector plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on ice (30 min) in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 μg/ml-1 leupeptin. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody, which had been pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Polyclonal antibody (SC-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) against Btk was used for Btk immunoprecipitation (endogenous and overexpressed) and Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against the epitope tags Myc (9E10) and FLAG (12CA5) were obtained from Sigma. The polyclonal antibody against the HA epitope tag was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal antibody against IRAK-1 was a kind gift from Keith Ray (Glaxo Wellcome). The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting.Btk Activation Assays—THP-1 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml-1 18 h before stimulation. A total of 2 × 107 cells were used per point and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for the time points indicated, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 μg/ml-1 leupeptin) as described above. Endogenous Btk-containing immunocomplexes were obtained and either blotted for tyrosine phosphorylation using monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/sample) in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 20 μm ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by autoradiography. The blots were subsequently probed for immunoprecipitated Btk by Western blotting.Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 or U373 cells were seeded (105 cells/ml-1) onto 96-well plates 24 h before transfection with 80 ng of κB-luciferase, 40 ng of Renilla luciferase, and the indicated amount of Btk-expressing plasmid (220 ng total), and RAW264.7 cells were seeded (105 cells/ml-1) onto 24-well plates 24 h before transfection with 250 ng of κB-luciferase, 250 ng of Renilla luciferase, and the indicated amount of Btk-expressing plasmid (1000 ng total) using Genejuice (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of DNA transfected was kept constant by the addition of various amounts of the appropriate empty vector plasmid. For reporter gene assays, cells were lysed for 15 min at room temperature with 50 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). After this, 50% of the supernatant was used to determine firefly luciferase activity, and an equivalent amount was used for Renilla luciferase activity. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity was assayed using standard protocols. Levels of firefly luciferase expression were normalized against Renilla activity as a control for transfection efficiency and expressed as fold stimulation over unstimulated empty vector control.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Osborn et al. (21Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar) from THP-1 cells (5 × 106) treated as described in the figure legends. Nuclear extracts (4–8 μg of protein) were incubated (30 min at room temperature) with 10,000 cpm of double-stranded [γ-32P]ATP NFκB oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). Incubations were performed in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific competitor and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on native (5%) polyacrylamide gels that were subsequently dried and autoradiographed.RESULTSIn order to gain more insights into the function of Btk, a yeast two-hybrid screen for possible interaction partners was performed. The full-length Btk was used as bait, and a total of 2.4 × 106 independent transformants of a human splenic library were analyzed. We obtained 62 clones that showed specific interaction upon retransformation. Their identities were determined by sequencing. Among these clones, we found the cDNA encoding the human TLR8. The TLR8 cDNA encoded the transmembrane and intracellular domains (Fig. 1a). To narrow down the interaction domain of TLR8 with Btk, we generated subregions of the TLR8 cytoplasmic region containing either all three conserved boxes of the TIR domain (Boxes 1, 2, and 3) or smaller fragments (Fig. 1b). These analyzed boxes had been shown to be essential for the interaction of the TIR domain-containing proteins with other proteins (22Slack J.L. Schooley K. Bonnert T.P. Mitcham J.L. Qwarnstrom E.E. Sims J.E. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4670-4678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Whereas the complete TIR domain showed strong interaction with Btk, a weaker interaction with a truncated version lacking Box 1 was found. None of the individually conserved boxes by themselves interacted measurably with Btk.Next we asked whether Btk selectively interacts with TLR8 or whether other TLR-intracellular domains might also show Btk interaction. We therefore tested the TIR domains of TLRs 4, 6, and 9 for their capacity to interact with Btk. The selection was made on the basis of sequence homology and expression pattern. TLR8 shows high sequence homology to TLR4, an important receptor on mast cells and macrophages, and TLR6 and TLR9, which, in addition to macrophages, were also found on B cells (23Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1c, Btk can interact with all analyzed TIR domains; nevertheless, the strongest interaction was found with the TIR domain of TLR8. Together, these data indicate that Btk is able to bind to the TIR domains of TLRs. Furthermore, Boxes 2 and 3 of the TIR domains are critical for this interaction.Btk associates with MyD88, Mal, and IRAK-1—If Btk were to be important for signaling by TLRs, we hypothesized that it might interact with downstream signaling components. We therefore next investigated possible interactions between Btk and MyD88, Mal, and IRAK-1. Fig. 2, a and b, shows HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding AU1-tagged MyD88 (AU1-MyD88) in combination with a Btk-expressing plasmid. In Fig. 2a, immunoprecipitation of AU1-MyD88 from lysates of cells overexpressing both Btk and AU1-MyD88 resulted in increased detection of Btk in the immunocomplex (lane 4) when compared with lysates from cells expressing either Btk or AU1-MyD88 alone (lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, Btk was detected after AU1-MyD88 immunoprecipitation from cells expressing AU1-MyD88 alone (Fig. 2a, lane 2), indicating an association between AU1-MyD88 and endogenous Btk. This interaction would appear to be specific due to the fact that Btk was not detected after immunoprecipitation with anti-AU1 in lysates from cells transfected with Btk alone (Fig. 2a, lane 1). To confirm the interaction, the immunoprecipitation was performed in the opposite direction (Fig. 2b). Immunoprecipitation of Btk from lysates of cells overexpressing both Btk and AU1-MyD88 resulted in increased detection of AU1-MyD88 in the immunocomplex (Fig. 2b, lane 3) when compared with lysates from cells expressing AU1-MyD88 alone (lane 1). Again, a band at the correct molecular weight for AU1-MyD88 was detected after immunoprecipitation of complexes using anti-Btk in cells transfected with AU1-MyD88 alone (Fig. 2b, lane 1). Whether this band was due to an interaction between endogenous Btk and overexpressed AU1-MyD88 was difficult to determine due to a contaminating nonspecific band present in the IgG control lane (Fig. 2b, lane 4 compared with lane 5).Fig. 2Btk interacts with MyD88 and Mal. HEK-293 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 4 μg of plasmids expressing wild-type Btk and (a and b) AU1-tagged MyD88 (AU1-MyD88) or (c and d) HA-tagged Mal (HA-Mal) as indicated. Btk was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody (SC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognizing endogenous Btk as indicated, and antibodies recognizing the epitope tags AU1 (Babco) and HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to immunoprecipitate AU1-MyD88 and HA-Mal, respectively. Isotype-matched control antibodies were also used in the immunoprecipitates as indicated. The presence of (a and c) Btk, (b) AU1-MyD88, or (d) HA-Mal in the resulting immunocomplex was tested using the relevant antibodies. All results shown are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2, c and d, investigated possible interactions between overexpressed Btk and HA-tagged Mal (HA-Mal). Btk and HA-Mal were found to associate when either HA-Mal-containing complexes (Fig. 2c, lane 4) or Btk-containing complexes (Fig. 2d, lane 3) were isolated from cells transfected with both HA-Mal and wild-type Btk. Similar to the interaction with AU1-MyD88, immunocomplexes containing HA-Mal were found to contain endogenous Btk (Fig. 2c, lane 2), and immunocomplexes containing endogenous Btk were found to associate with HA-Mal (Fig. 2d, lane 1), suggesting that endogenous Btk associates with overexpressed HA-Mal. The specificity of this finding was tested in lysates expressing HA-Mal alone, comparing the ability of anti-Btk (Fig. 2d, lane 5) and control IgG (lane 4) to immunoprecipitate HA-Mal. Increased levels of HA-Mal were detected in Btk-containing immunocomplexes when compared with the IgG control complex (Fig. 2d, lanes 5 and 4, respectively), indicating that an interaction between endogenous Btk and overexpressed Mal can be detected.We also tested for interactions of Btk with IRAK-1 and TRAF-6. IRAK-1 was detected in a complex with Btk in lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with both wild-type Btk and IRAK-1 (Fig. 3a, lane 3). The specificity of this interaction was tested in lysates expressing IRAK-1 alone, comparing the ability of anti-Btk (lane 5) and control IgG (lane 4) to immunoprecipitate IRAK-1. IRAK-1 was detected in Btk-containing immunocomplexes only and not in the IgG control. An interaction between endogenous Btk and endogenous IRAK-1 was also detected after immunoprecipation of endogenous Btk from nontransfected HEK293 cells, with a weak but detectable band being detected after Western blotting of separated immunocomplexes with an antibody against endogenous IRAK-1 (Fig. 3b, lane 3). No IRAK-1 was detectable in the IgG control lane (Fig. 3b, lane 1). In contrast, no interaction between Btk and the downstream adapter protein TRAF-6 was detected (Fig. 3c, lane 3), whereas an interaction between TRAF-6 and TAB-1, serving as a positive control, was detected (Fig. 3d, lane 2).Fig. 3Btk interacts with IRAK-1 but not TRAF-6. a, HEK-293 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 4 μg of plasmids expressing wild-type Btk and IRAK-1. Btk was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from the cells, and the presence of IRAK-1 in the immunocomplex was tested using an antibody against endogenous IRAK-1. b, Btk was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from HEK-293 cells (1 × 106), and the resulting immunocomplex was tested for the presence of IRAK-1 by Western blotting. Isotype-matched control antibodies were also used in the immunoprecipitates as indicated. c and d, HEK-293 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 4 μg of plasmids expressing Btk, AU1-TAB-1, or FLAG-tagged TRAF-6 (FLAG-T6) as indicated. After immunoprecipitation of (c) Btk or (d) AU1-TAB-1 from lysates prepared from the cells, the presence of TRAF-6 in the immunocomplex was tested.

Endogenous Btk was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS for various time points. Because activated Btk is phosphorylated on Tyr551 within the activation loop of the protein (24Wahl M.I. Fluckiger A.C. Kato R.M. Park H. Witte O.N. Rawlings D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk was detected after 5 min of stimulation with LPS (Fig. 4a, top panel). Samples were also blotted for total Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 4a, bottom panel).Fig. 4LPS activates Btk in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells (2 × 107) were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for the time points indicated. Cells were lysed, and Btk was isolated by immunoprecipitation. Immune complexes were (a) immunoblotted with a phospho-tyrosine-specific antibody to detect phospho-Btk (top panel) or (b) assayed for Btk autokinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation of Btk in a kinase assay (top panel) as outlined in “Materials and Methods.” Blots for total Btk are shown in the bottom panels.

Channels of the TRP family can be divided on the basis of structural features into three subfamilies: classic or canonical (TRPC) channels, melastatin-like (TRPM) channels, and vanilloid receptor-like (TRPV) channels (1Clapham D.E.

TRPV1–4 are Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channels activated by a variety of stimuli but having in common sensitivities to different levels of heat. TRPV1 (VR1) is activated by heat, vanilloids, and protons and is involved in the transduction of noxious heat stimuli in primary sensory neurons (5Caterina M. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar). TRPV2 (VRL-1, GRC) is activated by high levels of noxious heat (6Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) and is probably involved in high threshold nociception. In addition, this channel is expressed in other tissues and, in some, is translocated to the cell membrane by stimulators of cell proliferation (7Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H.

In contrast to TRPV1–4, the other members of this subfamily, TRPV5 and TRPV6, are highly Ca2+-permeable channels and are involved in epithelial Ca2+ transport in the kidney and gut (18Hoenderop J.G.J. van der Kemp A.W.C.M.

The activity of many Ca2+-permeable cation channel types, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, is regulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). This regulation is usually inhibitory and often provides a feedback mechanism to prevent excessive increases in [Ca2+]i. In most cases, Ca2+ does not act directly on the channel but through binding to the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NMDG+, N-methyl-d-glucamine; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; wt, wild-type.1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NMDG+, N-methyl-d-glucamine; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; wt, wild-type. A number of TRP channel isoforms are modulated by Ca2+, and some have CaM binding domains in their C termini. All TRPC isoforms have at least one CaM binding domain (20Trost C. Bergs C. Himmerkus N.

For TRPC1, CaM has been shown to regulate Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition (23Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TRPM2 requires intracellular Ca2+ for its activation, although the mechanism of Ca2+ action is unknown (24McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.Z. Perraud A.L. Beech D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11002-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Effects of intracellular Ca2+ have also been reported for members of the TRPV subfamily. Rapid desensitization of TRPV1 is dependent on Ca2+ (5Caterina M. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar), acting at an intracellular site via a Ca2+-CaM-dependent phosphatase (25Docherty R.J. Yeats J.C. Bevan S. Boddeke H.W.

The epithelial Ca2+ channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 are inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ in the submicromolar range (26Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J.

In this paper we show that, in addition to an inhibitory effect, intracellular Ca2+ potentiates currents through TRPV4. Ca2+ entry through the channel is involved in the maintenance of spontaneous activity and increases both the TRPV4 current amplitude and the rate of current activation in response to channel stimulation with hypotonic solutions or phorbol esters. Using mutagenesis, we localized the structural determinant of the stimulatory effect to an intracellular C-terminal domain. Binding experiments showed that the region involved is a Ca2+-dependent CaM binding domain. Mutations that prevent CaM binding led to a loss of Ca2+-dependent potentiation of TRPV4. Cloning of Human TRPV4 and Generation of a Stably Transfected Cell Line—For the cloning of human TRPV4, total RNA was prepared from human kidney tissue samples using the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed from 1 μg of total RNA using 200 units of Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 5 pmol of the primer (dT)17. The human TRPV4 coding sequence was amplified in 30 cycles of PCR under the following conditions: 55 °C annealing temperature, extension at 72 °C for 3 min, Expand HF polymerase (Roche Applied Science), primers GGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGCGGATTCCAGCGA (sense) and CCGGATCCGCGAGCGGGGCGTCATCAGT (antisense). The PCR product was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the cDNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. A C-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion construct was obtained by HindIII/BamHI digestion of the fragment and ligation into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Point mutations were inserted by overlap extension PCR using appropriate sense and antisense primers. C-terminal deletion mutants were amplified using a modified antisense primer. For the generation of a stably transfected cell line, the HindIII/BamHI fragment was cloned into the pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) vector, and the construct was transfected into the T-REx-293 cell line using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Clonal selection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with Zeocin (250 μg/ml), and multiple clones were functionally tested for TRPV4 expression. CaM Pull-down Assays—Human TRPV4 C-terminal fragments were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences). The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing, and the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli BL21 cells. After purification by glutathione-Sepharose according to the standard protocol (Amersham Biosciences), the eluted peptides were subjected to interaction with calmodulin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min at room temperature in a buffer containing (in mm) 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 CaCl2 or 2 EGTA. For quantitative interaction assays, the free calcium concentration was buffered to the desired value using the appropriate chelators (EGTA, HEDTA, nitrilotriacetic acid, or EDTA). Pellets were washed three times with the respective buffers and subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye and dried, and the relative intensities of the bands were analyzed using AIDA software. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrom) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips 24–48 h prior to transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) in 94 μl of OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) per 85-mm dish. Ca2+ measurements and electrophysiological studies were performed 24–36 h after transfection. T-REx cells and T-REx cells stably transfected with human TRPV4 (T-REx-V4) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 4 mml-glutamine (Fluka, Taufkirchen, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (both Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). For cells containing TRPV4, 5 μg/ml blasticidin and 250 μg/ml Zeocin (both Invitrogen) were added to the culture medium. All experiments were performed 1–2 days after transient transfection and, in the case of T-REx-V4 cells, 1–2 days after induction with tetracyclin (1 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science). Patch Clamp Recording—Recordings of whole cell currents from single cells were made with an EPC-7 amplifier using Pulse software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) as described previously (12Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using the standard whole cell mode of the patch clamp technique or the perforated patch technique. For the latter, amphotericin B (250 μg/ml; Sigma) was used as the ionophore for current recording. Measurements of currents in perforated patch recordings were started when the series resistance approached a plateau at values <30 megohms. To measure channel currents, cells were held at a potential of 0 or –20 mV and ramps from –100 to +100 mV with a duration of 400 ms applied at a frequency of 0.2 or 0.1 Hz. Ramp data were acquired at a frequency of 4 kHz after filtering at 1 kHz. The standard pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 110 CH3O3SCs (cesium methane sulfonate), 25 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.362 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 30 HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The standard extracellular solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For experiments to test the effects of hypotonic solutions, cells were initially bathed in a solution containing 100 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 100 mannitol (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and mannitol and then removed to reduce the osmolarity without changing the ion concentrations. In other experiments the normal extracellular solution was diluted to 2/3, and Ca2+ was adjusted to 2 mm. For Na+-free solutions, Na+ was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+). For nominally Ca2+-free solutions, Ca2+ was omitted. The osmolarity of the solutions was measured using a freezing-point depression osmometer (Roebling, Berlin, Germany). For measurements of divalent cation permeabilities, currents were fully activated in an NMDG+ solution containing the divalent cation (X2+) at a concentration of 20 mm. The solution was then exchanged for aNa+ solution. The relative permeability was then calculated according to the following equation: P X/P Na = {[Na+]o/4[X 2+]o}{exp((F/RT)(V X–V Na))}{1 + exp(FV X/RT)}. Combined Patch Clamp and Ca2+ Measurements—In some experiments, perforated patch recordings were combined with fluorometric recordings of [Ca2+]i. Cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands), and Ca2+ measurements were performed using a monochromator/photomultiplier-based system (TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Cells were viewed with a ×40 oil immersion objective. Fluorescence was excited alternately at 360 and 390 nm for fura-2, and light output was measured from an adjustable rectangular aperture containing the cell of interest. Background fluorescence was obtained from the same region without a cell. The output of the photomultiplier was recorded simultaneously with the current data using Pulse software (HEKA) and the fluorescence signals together with the calculated ratio (F 360/F 390) displayed online. Properties of Human TRPV4 —The properties of human TRPV4 closely resembled those of the murine ortholog, when studied either after induction of expression in the T-REx-V4 cell line or following transient transfection in HEK293 cells. In whole cell recordings of membrane currents, many cells displayed spontaneous current activity that decayed rapidly in the open whole cell recording mode (Fig. 1D) but was more stable in perforated patch recordings (Fig. 1A). TRPV4 responds both to decreases in the extracellular osmolarity (11Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V.

In perforated patch recordings, application of hypotonic solutions resulted within a few seconds in an increase in membrane current that reached a maximum and then decayed (Fig. 1A). Both spontaneous and osmosensitive currents displayed a characteristic outwardly rectifying current-voltage (IV) relation (Fig. 1B). Scaling the IV relation obtained at an osmolarity of 320 mosmol/liter in Fig. 1B reveals the similarity in shape of the IV relations before and during stimulation with the hypotonic solution. The currents differ only in the reversal potential, which is more negative because of the stronger influence of background currents at the lower amplitudes in 320 mosmol/liter. In the open whole cell mode, responses to changes in osmolarity were weak (data not shown). In contrast, responses to phorbol esters were large, even after run-down of spontaneous activity (Fig. 1D), and displayed an identical IV relation to spontaneous currents and currents activated by hypotonic solutions (Fig. 1E). Divalent Cation Permeability of TRPV4 —Previous studies have shown that TRPV4 is somewhat more permeable to Ca2+ than to Na+ (12Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 15Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To estimate the permeability of human TRPV4 to Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+, currents were activated by 4α-PMA (1 μm)inaNa+-free (NMDG+) solution containing the divalent cation at a concentration of 20 mm. After reaching a maximum, the extracellular solution was changed to an Na+ solution. As the influence of background currents became smaller, the reversal potential in the divalent cation solution shifted to more positive potentials during current activation with each of the three cations, before reaching a maximum value (Fig. 1F). Because currents evoked in Ba2+ were much smaller than those in Ca2+ and Sr2+, the reversal potential in many cells was more negative than those in Ca2+ and Sr2+. However, in cells with currents of comparable amplitude to those in Ca2+ and Sr2+ more positive reversal potentials were obtained (e.g. Fig. 1F), and only these were used for calculation of the permeability ratio. From the reversal potential in the presence of the divalent cation and the shift in reversal potential upon application of the Na+ solution, the permeability ratios P Ca/P Na, P Sr/P Na, and P Ba/P Na were calculated to be 9.3 ± 0.5 (n = 4), 8.7 ± 0.4 (n = 6), and 7.0 ± 0.4 (n = 5), respectively. Effect of Removal of Permeant Cations on TRPV4 —Replacement of both extracellular Na+ and Ca2+ by the large cation NMDG+ abolished both the inward current activated by hypotonic solutions (Fig. 1, A and C) or 4α-PMA and spontaneous currents (data not shown). In addition, as observed for mouse TRPV4 (12Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), application of the NMDG+ solution also resulted in a surprising reduction in the outward current rather than the expected increase (Fig. 1, A and C). This suggests that the channel activity is dependent on either extracellular Na+ or Ca2+. Large reductions in both inward and outward currents also occurred upon application of a Na+-containing, nominally Ca2+-free extracellular solution during current activation (as shown in Fig. 1D for a phorbol ester-activated current), suggesting that Ca2+ may play a role in TRPV4 activation. Spontaneous Activity of TRPV4 Is Ca2+-dependent—The experiments described above suggest that currents through TRPV4 are Ca2+-dependent. To investigate the regulatory role of Ca2+ in the maintenance of TRPV4 activity, we studied the effect of removal of extracellular Ca2+ on spontaneous channel activity. For this, we combined perforated patch recordings of spontaneous whole cell currents with fluorometric recordings of [Ca2+]i using fura-2. Cells were clamped at 0 mV to reduce Ca2+ entry through the spontaneously active channels and prevent steady increases in [Ca2+]i that occur at negative holding potentials. Currents were estimated by ramps applied at 5- or 10-s intervals. In cells that showed spontaneous TRPV4 activity, replacement of the standard extracellular solution with a nominally Ca2+-free solution resulted in a complete loss of spontaneous channel activity and a parallel decrease in [Ca2+]i (see Fig. 2, A and B and Fig. 3A). The rate of reduction of currents and [Ca2+]i was much slower than the solution exchange, which was complete within a few seconds. Readdition of Ca2+ to the extracellular solution resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i and currents to levels higher than those before Ca2+ removal (Fig. 2A). Thereafter, both parameters returned to stable levels similar to those before Ca2+ removal. The similarity in the time course of the currents and the fura ratio upon removal of extracellular Ca2+ suggests that spontaneous TRPV4 activity is dependent on an elevated [Ca2+]i resulting from Ca2+ entry through the channel.Fig. 3TRPV4 currents are potentiated by increases in intracellular Ca2 + A, activation of TRPV4 by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in T-REx-V4 cells. Currents at –100 mV and +100 mV (upper panel) and fura-2 ratio (lower panel) were recorded simultaneously showing the effect of Ca2+ removal and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by thapsigargin (1 μm) and ionomycin (1 μm). B, IV relations recorded at the times indicated in A before Ca2+ removal (a), in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (b), and during application of ionomycin (c).

E, IV relations recorded before and during stimulation by ionomycin application in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then tested the ability of other permeant divalent cations to substitute for Ca2+ in the maintenance of channel activity. Neither Ba2+ nor Sr2+ (2 mm) were effective replacements for Ca2+ at the same concentration. Replacement of Ca2+ by either of these divalent cations (Ba2+, n = 8; Sr2+, n = 5) resulted in reductions of inward and outward currents similar to those seen on Ca2+ removal (Fig. 2, C, D, and E). However, as evidenced by the shape of the IV relation, small TRPV4 currents persisted in Sr2+ but not in Ba2+ (Fig. 2, D and E). Stimulation of TRPV4 by Ca2+ Release from Intracellular Stores Indicates That Ca2+ Acts at an Intracellular Site—As a permeant cation, Ca2+ could influence channel activity at either an extracellular or an intracellular site. To test whether increases in intracellular Ca2+ can restore TRPV4 activity in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, we raised [Ca2+]i by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. As described above, removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished channel activity. After [Ca2+]i had reached a stable level, in eight from nine cells addition of thapsigargin (1 μm) or ionomycin (1 μm) resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i and stimulation of an outwardly rectifying current with an identical shape of IV relation to the spontaneous current (Fig. 3, A and B). In Fig. 3, A and B, the addition of ionomycin after thapsigargin resulted in a further increase in [Ca2+]i and current. Control experiments in cells not treated with tetracyclin and, thus, not expressing the channel (Fig. 3C) indicated that the currents observed are unlikely to result from activation of an endogenous Ca2+-activated cation current like TRPM4 (30Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In five of these cells, no current was activated by Ca2+ release induced by either ionomycin or thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and, in another one, a small current with different properties to those of TRPV4 was observed. The Ca2+ signals obser"
https://openalex.org/W2070885630,"Death receptors are a subfamily of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor subfamily. They are characterized by a death domain (DD) motif within their intracellular domain, which is required for the induction of apoptosis. Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) is reported to be the universal adaptor used by death receptors to recruit and activate the initiator caspase-8. CD95, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL-R1), and TRAIL-R2 bind FADD directly, whereas recruitment to TNF-R1 is indirect through another adaptor TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD). TRADD also binds two other adaptors receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which are required for TNF-induced NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, respectively. Analysis of the native TNF signaling complex revealed the recruitment of RIP, TRADD, and TRAF2 but not FADD or caspase-8. TNF failed to induce apoptosis in FADD- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells, indicating that these apoptotic mediators were required for TNF-induced apoptosis. In an in vitro binding assay, the intracellular domain of TNF-R1 bound TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2 but did not bind FADD or caspase-8. Under the same conditions, the intracellular domain of both CD95 and TRAIL-R2 bound both FADD and caspase-8. Taken together these results suggest that apoptosis signaling by TNF is distinct from that induced by CD95 and TRAIL. Although caspase-8 and FADD are obligatory for TNF-mediated apoptosis, they are not recruited to a TNF-induced membrane-bound receptor signaling complex as occurs during CD95 or TRAIL signaling, but instead must be activated elsewhere within the cell."

Recently, we reported the identification of a novel family of OGT-interacting proteins (OIPs) that interact strongly with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of OGT (Iyer, S. P., Akimoto, Y., and Hart, G. W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5399–5409). Members of this family are modified by O-GlcNAc and are excellent substrates of OGT. Here, we further investigated the role of the TPR domain in the O-GlcNAcylation of OIP106, one of the members of this OIP family. Using N-terminal deletions, we first identified the region of OIP106 that binds OGT, termed the OGT-interacting domain (OID). Deletion analysis indicated that TPRs 2–6 of OGT interact with the OID of OIP106. The apparent Km of OGT for the OID of OIP106 is 3.35 μm. Unlike small peptide substrates, glycosylation of the OID was dependent upon its interaction with the first 6 TPRs of OGT. Furthermore, the isolated TPR domain of OGT competitively inhibited glycosylation of the OID protein, but did not inhibit glycosylation of a 12-amino acid casein kinase II peptide substrate, providing kinetic evidence for the role of the TPR domain as a protein substrate docking site. Additionally, both the OID of OIP106 and nucleoporin p62 competed with each other for glycosylation by OGT. These studies support the model that the catalytic subunit of OGT achieves both high specificity and a remarkable diversity of substrates by complexing with a variety of targeting proteins via its TPR protein-protein interaction domains.

Attachment of O-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic (added/removed in minutes) and ubiquitous modification and occurs in all higher eukaryotes, including plants and animals. Because many of the sites that are modified by O-GlcNAc are either the same or adjacent to sites of Ser/Thr phosphorylation (15Hart G.W. Greis K.D. Dong L.-Y. Blomberg M.A. Chou T.-Y. Jiang M.S.

Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Google Scholar).Enzymes that catalyze addition and removal of O-GlcNAc on and off proteins are analogous to those that catalyze phosphorylation, i.e. kinases and phosphatases. O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT; uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EC 2.4.1) is an enzyme that transfers GlcNAc to proteins from a UDP-GlcNAc sugar donor. Conversely, an O-GlcNAc-specific β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase) removes the sugar from O-GlcNAcylated proteins.

The OGT gene resides on the X chromosome near the centromere (Xq13 in man), and its targeted deletion results in embryonic lethality in mice (22Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Google Scholar), indicating that it is essential for life. Recently, the previously reported partial human OGT clone described by Lubas et al. (21Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Google Scholar) has been characterized as an alternatively spliced isoform of OGT that targets specifically to the mitochondria (40Love D.C. Kochan J. Cathey R.L. Shin S.-H. Hanover J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 647-654Google Scholar). Thus, two distinct isoforms of OGT exist: a nucleocytoplasmic form of OGT and its alternatively spliced mitochondrial isoform. Interestingly, the mitochondrial OGT isoform is not active in the mitochondria toward mitochondrial protein substrates, suggesting that it may have another function (40Love D.C. Kochan J. Cathey R.L. Shin S.-H. Hanover J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 647-654Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 110-kDa enzyme showed it to contain two distinct modular halves. In its N-terminal half, OGT contains a TPR protein-protein interaction domain, whereas the unique C-terminal half of the enzyme is known to contain its catalytic domain (20Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Google Scholar, 21Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Google Scholar). The nucleocytoplasmic OGT enzyme contains 11.5 TPRs, whereas the mitochondrial OGT isoform contains 9 TPRs, preceded by a mitochondrial targeting sequence (20Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J.

Hanover J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 647-654Google Scholar); and these domains have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions in a variety of proteins (23Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Google Scholar, 36Chung J.J. Shikano S. Hanyu Y. Li M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 146-150Google Scholar, 37Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 2002; 21: 932-939Google Scholar).Various functions have been attributed to the TPR domain of OGT. The native OGT holoenzyme exists as a trimer, and the TPR domain has been shown to be required for its trimerization (24Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Google Scholar). The TPR domain has also been shown to mediate substrate specificity in a variety of peptide substrates (24Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that the TPR domain is also responsible for targeting OGT to mSin3A transcriptional repressor complexes (25Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Google Scholar). Although much is known about the peptide substrate specificity of OGT, it is unclear as to how the substrate specificity of its physiological protein substrates is regulated by the TPR domain.We have recently identified a novel family of coiled-coil domain proteins that interact with OGT (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar). GRIF-1 and OIP106, the two archetypal members of this family, interact with the TPR domain strongly. GRIF-1 is a GABAA receptor-associated protein (26Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H.L. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Google Scholar) and is thought to play a role in targeting OGT to GABAA receptor complexes to mediate GABA signaling cascades. OIP106 was shown to associate in a complex with RNA polymerase II, suggesting a role in targeting OGT to RNA polymerase II complexes for transcriptional machinery O-GlcNAcylation (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar). Interestingly, both proteins are modified by O-GlcNAc and are substrates for OGT (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar).Here, we investigated the O-GlcNAcylation of OIP106 to gain further insights into the enzymatic mechanisms regulating the specificity of OGT. Specifically, we wanted to study how the TPR domain functions in relation to the substrate specificity of OGT for a bona fide physiological protein substrate such as OIP106. We localized the domains of OGT and OIP106 interactions and found that the OGT-interacting domain (OID) of OIP106 is a high affinity substrate for OGT. Furthermore, deletion of specific TPRs of OGT resulted in loss of binding and, consequently, loss of O-GlcNAcylation of the OID. A free TPR domain effectively inhibited glycosylation of the OID, but not glycosylation of small peptides, in a dose-dependent manner, providing kinetic evidence that the TPRs function as protein substrate “docking” sites. In addition, both recombinant nucleoporin p62 (a high affinity substrate) and OID proteins effectively competed with each other for glycosylation by OGT. We propose a model for the possible mechanism of OGT glycosylation of its various protein substrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructsThe baculovirus expression constructs encoding rat OGT and its TPR truncations have been described previously (24Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Google Scholar). Constructs encoding an N-terminal His6-tagged TPR (pRSET-TPR) were generated by subcloning the TPR fragments into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen). The pCITE-OIP106 construct used for in vitro transcription/translation reactions has been described previously (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar). N-terminal OIP106 deletion constructs were generated by PCR of the appropriate regions and subcloning into pCITE4c. The OID of OIP106 was generated by PCR of the region of OIP106 encoding residues 639–890 and cloned into pET32 for overexpression in Escherichia coli as an S/His-tagged fusion protein. The GST-p62 construct was generated by subcloning the p62 insert into pGEX-5x-1 (Amersham Biosciences).Protein Expression and PurificationUnless indicated otherwise, the E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL strain (Stratagene) was used for the overexpression of TPR and OIP106 protein constructs in either LB or digested yeast tryptone/ampicillin medium. Unless indicated otherwise, all purified proteins were desalted in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 20–40% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and stored in –20 °C. His-tagged TPR protein (pRSET-TPR) was overexpressed and purified under native nondenaturing conditions via nickel affinity chromatography. Baculovirus-produced recombinant full-length OGT and Δ2.5OGT and Δ5.5OGT TPR deletion constructs were overexpressed and purified as described (24Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Google Scholar).S-tagged OID was overexpressed and purified via S-protein affinity chromatography under mildly denaturing conditions in the presence of 1.3 m urea. Insoluble S-OID protein was extracted by incubating the insoluble cell pellet in 6 m urea and TBST (20 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for1hat4 °C. The extract was spun at 39,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing S-OID was diluted down to 1.3 m urea by the addition of TBST. The resulting 1.3 m urea supernatant was loaded onto S-protein-agarose (Novagen) equilibrated in 1.3 m urea and TBST, and S-OID was bound by incubation for 30 min, washed extensively, and used for subsequent assays. Alternatively, the 1.3 m urea and TBST supernatant was passed over Talon immobilized metal affinity chromatography resin (Clontech), and S-OID was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions.GST-p62 was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) RP strain (Stratagene). Overexpressed GST-p62 was purified essentially as described previously (38Hu T. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Google Scholar). Purified recombinant GST-p62 was found to be 90–95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown).Antibodies and Western Blot AnalysisAnti-OGT antibodies AL25 (20Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Google Scholar) and AL28 (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar) were used at a final concentration of 25–50 ng/ml in 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 16 h at 4 °C. S-protein-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen) was used at a 1:5000 dilution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-O-GlcNAc monoclonal antibody CTD 110.6 was used at a 1:2500 dilution as described previously (39Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Google Scholar). All blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Protein-Protein Interaction AssaysWild-type OIP106 and its N-terminal truncation mutants (for OID localization studies) were synthesized with either [35S]Met or unlabeled amino acids in TnT in vitro transcription and translation rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) with an S tag fusion, which is encoded by their respective pCITE vectors. Following synthesis, the reactions were diluted in Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.3 m NaCl, and S-tagged OIP106 proteins were bound to S-protein-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with their respective binding buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed by Western blotting with S-protein-horseradish peroxidase and AL28. The OGT-OID interaction assays were performed as follows. Baculovirus-produced recombinant full-length OGT, Δ2.5OGT, and Δ5.5OGT and E. coli His-TPR proteins were incubated with S-OID in Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 3.5 h at 4 °C. Proteins were then pulled down with S-protein-agarose, washed extensively with binding buffer, and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with S-protein-horseradish peroxidase and AL25.OGT Activity AssaysOGT activity assays were performed essentially as described (13Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The S-OID protein used as a substrate for OGT was either in a soluble form (immobilized metal affinity chromatography-purified) or bound to S-protein-agarose. OGT protein glycosylation assays were performed by incubation of baculovirus-produced recombinant full-length OGT, Δ2.5OGT, or Δ5.5OGT as the enzyme source. 1 μg of the indicated OGT protein was incubated with the indicated amounts of S-OID protein substrate, 1–1.5 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (34 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a final reaction volume of 40 μl. Reactions were incubated at 220–240 rpm for 90 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped and processed in one of two post-assay protocols.Post-assay Protocol 1—The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with EA-Wax enhanced autoradiography reagent (EABiotech Ltd., Scotland, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to Biomax MS film at –80 °C. Typical exposure times were from 16 to 30 h.Post-assay Protocol 2—The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of TBST containing 0.5 m NaCl. S-protein-agarose beads were then added to the reactions to bind the S-OID substrate. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of TBST containing 0.5 m NaCl. 10 ml of scintillation fluid was added directly to the columns containing the beads, shaken briefly, and counted.OGT peptide glycosylation assays were performed as described (27Iyer S.P. Hart G.W. Tanaguchi N. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. 21. Springer-Verlag Tokyo, Tokyo2002: 158-163Google Scholar), except that the reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a final reaction volume of 40 μl. The CKII 12-mer peptide was used as a substrate at a final concentration of 1mm. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was performed at least two times.Determination of the Km of OGT for the OID of OIP106For the Km determination experiments, assays were performed as described above with varying concentrations (0.26–2.6 μm) of soluble S-OID protein substrate. 2 μg of OGT enzyme was used per assay. UDP-GlcNAc was kept constant at a final concentration of 1 mm by isotopic dilution from 34 Ci/mmol to 0.025 μCi/nmol with the addition of unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc (Calbiochem). To remove the resulting UDP product, which is a potent inhibitor of OGT, 1 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) was added to the reaction. Assays were processed as per post-assay protocol 2. Units are defined as picomoles of GlcNAc transferred per μg of enzyme/min. All assays were performed under initial rate conditions in triplicate, and the Km was determined based on averaged results of two independent experiments.TPR Competition ExperimentsOGT protein and peptide assays in the presence of competing TPR protein were performed as described above with the following parameters. The S-OID protein (1.68 μm) and CKII peptide (55 μm) substrates were at a final concentration of one-half of their respective Km values. His-TPR protein was added to the reaction at the indicated amounts. Total protein amounts were kept constant with the addition of BSA. Assays were processed as per post-assay protocol 2. Assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was performed twice.OID-p62 Glycosylation Competition ExperimentsOID-p62 glycosylation competition experiments were performed as follows. For p62 competition experiments, S-tagged OID was kept at a constant concentration of 0.5 μm, and the concentration of GST-p62 was varied from 0.5 to 2.5 μm. Similarly, for OID competition experiments, GST-p62 was kept at a constant concentration of 0.5 μm, and the concentration of the OID was varied from 0.5 to 2.5 μm. 425 ng of OGT was used per assay for each condition. In the 0 μm competitor control assays, 2.5 μm BSA was substituted for the competing protein substrate and served as a negative control. Assays were performed at room temperature for 90 min as described in above. Following the reactions, assays were split into two; GST-p62 was purified by adding glutathione-Sepharose to one half, and the other half was subjected to S-protein-agarose chromatography to purify S-tagged OID. Proteins bound to either affinity resin were eluted by boiling the resins in SDS sample buffer (following extensive washing after adsorption). Glycosylation of p62 and the OID was analyzed by immunoblotting of the eluted proteins on polyvinylidene fluoride, followed by analysis by the O-GlcNAc-specific monoclonal antibody CTD 110.6.RESULTSLocalization of Domains of OIP106 and OGT Interactions— Based on its strong interaction with OGT, we hypothesized that OIP106 could function to influence the activity of OGT as a possible cofactor (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar). Therefore, we first performed in vitro OGT assays to determine whether recombinant OIP106 has any effect on the activity of OGT. Unfortunately, when overexpressed in E. coli as a His-tagged fusion protein, the majority of recombinant full-length OIP106 was found to be insoluble, so we localized the region of OIP106 that was responsible for its interaction with OGT with the hope that this region would be a smaller portion of the molecule and therefore be more amenable to overexpression in an E. coli based system. To localize this region, we constructed N-terminal truncations of OIP106. N-terminal OIP106 truncations were then synthesized in lysates as S-tagged fusion proteins, pulled down with S-protein-agarose, and assayed for their ability to bind endogenous OGT as detected by anti-OGT antibody (AL28) Western blotting (1Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (upper panel) shows the various N-terminal OIP106 truncations synthesized as [35S]Met-labeled S-tagged fusion proteins. Also shown is a schematic of the OIP106 truncations lacking different domains. As shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel), all of the truncations except Δ859 (residues 860–953) were able to bind and pull down OGT. This indicated that the potential OGT-binding domain localized to within residues 639–859 in the C terminus of OIP106.To confirm the above localization studies, we investigated whether the 220-amino acid fragment of OIP106 from residues 639 to 859 is sufficient to bind OGT. We overexpressed this region in E. coli as an S-tagged fusion protein and purified it under mildly denaturing conditions via S-protein affinity chromatography. We call this region OID for OGT-interacting domain and performed in vitro binding assays with purified recombinant OGT and the TPR domain. S-protein-agarose alone or S-OID was incubated with baculovirus-expressed purified recombinant OGT or the TPR domain, and S-protein pull-down assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), the OID efficiently bound full-length OGT (lane 3) and the TPR domain of OGT (lane 9) as detected by anti-OGT antibody (AL25) Western blotting (20Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Google Scholar). S-protein-agarose alone did not bind any OGT or TPR domain (lanes 2 and 8, respectively). The S-protein-horseradish peroxidase blot (lower panel) shows that equal amounts of S-OID were bound in each reaction. Thus, the OID of OIP106 is sufficient to bind to OGT efficiently. These data confirm the localization experiments performed above in lysates.Fig. 2The OID of OIP106 efficiently binds to full-length OGT and its TPR domain, but not to the Δ5.5OGT deletion, which lacks the first 5.5 TPR domains.A, recombinant full-length OGT, the Δ5.5OGT deletion, and the TPR domain were incubated with recombinant S-tagged OID and pulled down (PD) with S-protein-agarose. Protein complexes were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed with anti-OGT antibody (upper panel) and S-protein-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; lower panel). Lanes 1–3, full-length OGT-OID binding assays; lanes 4–6, Δ5.5OGT-OID binding assays; lanes 7–9, OGT-TPR domain binding assays. B, Δ2.5OGT interacted with the OID of OIP106 similarly compared with wild-type OGT under physiological and high salt conditions. Δ2.5OGT-OID binding assays were performed under physiological (0.15 m NaCl; trimer) and high salt (1 m NaCl; dimer) conditions. Similarly, wild-type OGT-OID binding assays were performed in parallel as a control (con). Assays were performed under non-saturating conditions. No significant differences were seen in the binding of wild-type full-length OGT to the OID either under physiological (0.15 m NaCl; lane 3) or high salt (1 m NaCl; lane 4) conditions. Similarly, no significant differences were seen in the binding of Δ2.5OGT (upper panel) to the OID at either 0.15 m NaCl (lane 7) or 1 m NaCl (lane 8). Although the levels of Δ2.5OGT appeared to be reduced in the 1 m NaCl pull-down experiment (lane 8), the S-protein-horseradish peroxidase blot (lower panel) shows that the amount of S-OID pulled down by S-protein-agarose in lane 8 was less than that in lane 7 (asterisk). However, when normalized (densitometry), the levels of both proteins (OID and Δ2.5OGT) in both lanes are similar, indicating that there are no differences in binding of Δ2.5OGT to the OID under either salt condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further localize the specific TPRs that interact with the OID, we used the Δ2.5OGT and Δ5.5OGT deletion mutants, which lack the first 2.5 and 5.5 TPRs, respectively (33Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7845-7852Google Scholar), in binding assays with S-tagged OID. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 4–6), the Δ5.5OGT mutant failed to interact with the OID. We performed binding assays with the Δ2.5OGT mutant, and the results are shown in Fig. 2B. Binding assays were performed under non-saturating conditions. Under physiological conditions (150 mm NaCl), Δ2.5OGT forms a trimer, whereas under high salt conditions (1 m NaCl), it forms a dimer (24Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Google Scholar). Δ2.5OGT-OID binding assays were performed under these two conditions. As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 1–4), there were no significant differences in the binding of full-length OGT (upper panel) to the OID (lower panel) between the 0.15 and 1 m NaCl binding conditions (compare lanes 3 and 4 in both panels). Similarly, as shown in lanes 5–8, no significant"

After chromatin immunoprecipitation using an H3-Lys9 methylated antibody, we cloned the recovered DNA and sequenced 47 independent clones. Of these, 38 clones (81%) contained repetitive elements, either short interspersed transposable element (SINE or Alu elements), long terminal repeat (LTR), long interspersed transposable element (LINE), or satellite region (ALR/Alpha) DNA, and three additional clones were near Alu elements. Further characterization of these repetitive elements revealed that 32 clones (68%) were Alu repeats, corresponding to both old Alu (23 clones) and young Alu (9 clones) subfamilies. Association of H3-Lys9 methylation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR using conserved Alu primers. In addition, we randomly selected 5 Alu repeats from the recovered clones and confirmed association with H3-Lys9 by PCR using primer sets flanking the Alu elements. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine rapidly decreased the level of H3-Lys9 methylation in the Alu elements, suggesting that H3-Lys9 methylation may be related to the suppression of Alu elements through DNA methylation. Thus H3-Lys9 methylation is enriched at human repetitive elements, particularly Alu elements, and may play a role in the suppression of recombination by these elements.

Post-translational modifications of histone tails play a critical role in the assembly of heterochromatin, and accumulating evidence suggests that the pattern of histone modifications specify regulation of gene expression (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar, 2Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Acetylation of lysine residues on histone H3 and H4 usually leads to the formation of an open chromatin structure, with transcription factors accessible to promoters. Phosphorylation of serine 10 and acetylation of lysine 14 on histone H3 result in gene activation (3Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Lys4 methylation on histone H3 localizes to sites of active transcription, and this modification may be stimulatory for transcription (4Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). The different combinations of histone tail modifications influence transcription by affecting chromatin structure. Recent studies have shown that methylation at Lys9 on histone H3 is a marker of heterochromatin and is specifically associated with inactivation of gene expression (5Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). H3-Lys9 methylation is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in women (6Boggs B.A. Cheung P. Heard E. Spector D.L. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and at loci silenced in cancer (7Kondo Y. Shen L. Issa J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Nguyen C.T. Weisenberger D.J. Velicescu M. Gonzales F.A. Lin J.C. Liang G. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6456-6461PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fahrner J.A. Eguchi S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7213-7218PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond this, the distribution of H3-Lys9 in human DNA has not been well characterized. Alu repeats represent the most frequent repetitive element in the human genome (10Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Alu elements are ∼280 bp in length and consist of two similar, but distinct, monomers linked by an oligo(dA) tract. Presumably, the 1 million Alu elements that are fixed within the human genome represent the fraction of insertions that were neutral or at least tolerable functionally. Alu elements possess an RNA polymerase (pol III) promoter (11Mighell A.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite this, the steady state abundance of pol III-directed Alu transcripts is usually very low in tissues and cultured cells indicating transcriptional silencing (12Howard B.H. Sakamoto K. New Biol. 1990; 2: 759-770PubMed Google Scholar). However, cellular stress can dramatically increase the abundance of human Alu RNA (12Howard B.H. Sakamoto K. New Biol. 1990; 2: 759-770PubMed Google Scholar), although it is unknown how and how many Alu elements are induced by stress. Accumulating evidence indicates that regulation of Alu expression is determined on many levels, some of which act locally upon individual Alu elements (13Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kochanek S. Renz D. Doerfler W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA methylation and chromatin configuration might each globally repress transcription of this repetitive sequence family and therefore potentially direct regulation of the Alu stress response. Here we performed an unbiased approach to clone targets of H3-Lys9 methylation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 1The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; LTR, long terminal repeats, SINE, short interspersed nuclear elements; LINE, long interspersed nuclear elements; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. assay and found that most such clones contain Alu elements. Thus, Alu expression might be crucially regulated by H3-Lys9 methylation and associated chromatin remodeling. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—SW48 cells were grown in L-15 medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum in plastic tissue culture plates in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RKO cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen). The cells were grown to a density of 5.0 × 105 to 3.0 × 106 cells per dish before being harvested for cross-linking experiments. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. 5-Aza-dC Treatment of Cells—Cells were split 12–24 h before treatment. Cells were then treated with either 5-aza-dC, 5 μm (Sigma), or phosphate-buffered saline for 72 h. Media containing 5-aza-dC or phosphate-buffered saline was changed every 24 h. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The protocols for ChIP have been described previously (15Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Briefly, SW48 and RKO cells are treated with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min to cross-link histones to DNA. After washing by cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cell pellets are resuspended in 550 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and sonicated for 7 × 8 s. The lysate (500 μl) is then divided into three fractions; the first and second ones (230 μl each) are diluted in 260 μl of lysis buffer, and the third one (40 μl) is used for input control. The first lysate is incubated with 10 μl of anti H3-Lys9 methylated histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The second lysate is incubated with Tris/EDTA buffer (10 μl) at 4 °C overnight as a negative control. To collect the immunoprecipitated complexes, protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) are added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the beads are treated with RNase (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and then proteinase K overnight. The cross-links are then reversed by heating the sample at 65 °C for 6 h. DNA is extracted by the phenol/chloroform method, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 100 μl of water. We performed a total of six individual chromatin immunoprecipitations in the SW48 cell line to obtain DNA enriched with methylated H3-Lys9 for cloning purposes. Cloning of H3-Lys9-enriched DNA Fragments—SW48 ChIP products were ethanol-precipitated and treated with mung bean nuclease to make blunt ends, then cloned into the zero-blunt vector (Invitrogen).

The PCR products are visualized by agarose or 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). To ensure that PCR amplification was in the linear range, each reaction was initially set up at different dilutions of DNA for varying amplification cycle numbers, and we selected the final PCR conditions accordingly. The assays were done in duplicate. To identify genes linked to methylated histone H3-Lys9, we performed ChIP using an anti-Lys9 methylated histone H3 antibody and cloned the immunoprecipitated DNA (strategy described in Fig. 1). Initially, we verified that the library contained methylated H3-Lys9 enriched DNA fragments by PCR using primers encompassing the promoter regions of P16, hMLH1, P21, and GAPDH. P16 and hMLH1 are silenced, and P21 and GAPDH are expressed in the SW48 cell line (7Kondo Y. Shen L. Issa J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In our library, compared with genomic DNA, the former two promoters showed a high degree of enrichment and the latter two promoters showed specific depletion, in accordance with known levels of H3-Lys9 methylation (data not shown). Having verified the quality of the library, we then randomly selected 47 clones, sequenced them, and characterized the sequences using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and BLAT (genome.ucsc.edu/) searches. The results of sequencing are summarized in Table I, and a representative example is shown in Fig. 2. Twenty-four (51%) of forty-seven clones contained Alu elements only. Five clones had both Alu and long terminal repeats (LTR) or Alu and long interspersed transposable element (LINE). Three additional clones had Alu elements within 200–300 bp of the recovered fragment (clones 43, 44, and 45 had AluSg, -Ye, and -Jb, respectively). Some of the sequences began or ended in the middle of Alu elements, and the range of Alu element length in the recovered clones was 95–282 bp in each clone. Thus, overall, 32 of 47 (68%) clones were in or within 200 bp of an Alu element. Considering that Alu elements form about 10% of the human genome (16Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W.

Twenty-three (72%) of thirty-two Alu elements belonged to the old Alu subfamily, and nine (28%) Alu elements were classified into young Alu subfamilies.

Open table in a new tab To verify these results, we randomly selected 5 Alu clones and prepared primer sets encompassing the Alu elements (ChIP-PCR). In each case, at least one primer was located in the flanking region to ensure that we were studying that specific Alu element (Fig. 2A). ChIP-PCR experiments using these primers in SW48 and RKO colorectal cancer cells are shown in Fig. 2B. MLH1 and P21 were used as controls. As we reported previously (7Kondo Y. Shen L. Issa J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), both SW48 and RKO show high levels of H3-Lys9 methylation in the hMLH1 promoter and low levels of H3-Lys9 methylation in the P21 promoter, corresponding to gene suppression and activation, respectively. All Alu elements showed a pattern similar to the hMLH1 promoter in both cell lines. We summarized these quantitative analyses in Fig. 2C. Ratios of precipitated DNA over input DNA were high in all the Alu elements and hMLH1 and low in P21, suggesting that Alu elements are suppressed by H3-Lys9 methylation in a manner similar to hMLH1 gene silencing in cancer. Primers that amplify many Alu elements simultaneously (i.e. in the conserved Alu sequence) showed similar results (data not shown). Alu elements show high degrees of DNA methylation in human cells (14Kochanek S. Renz D. Doerfler W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Magewu A.N. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4225-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the H3-Lys9 methylation we observed was related to DNA methylation and recruitment of a silencing complex. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of inhibition of DNA methylation on Alu H3-Lys9 methylation. To this end, we performed ChIP on SW48 cells treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC daily for 3 consecutive days. As shown in Fig. 3, all Alu elements and MLH1 showed a decreasing level of H3-Lys9 methylation shortly after 5-aza-dC. These results are consistent with our previous reports on non-repetitive, silenced genes and suggest that H3-Lys9 methylation of Alu elements is partially targeted by DNA methylation. In this study we identified Alu elements as major targets for histone H3-Lys9 methylation using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Methylation at Lys9 on histone H3 has been shown to be a marker of heterochromatin and to be associated with inactivation of gene expression (5Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In the promoter regions of P16, hMLH1, and MGMT, we recently found increased H3-Lys9 methylation in cells with promoter DNA methylation-associated silencing (7Kondo Y. Shen L. Issa J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and others have reported similar findings (8Nguyen C.T. Weisenberger D.J. Velicescu M. Gonzales F.A. Lin J.C. Liang G. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6456-6461PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fahrner J.A. Eguchi S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7213-7218PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, H3-Lys9 methylation appears to be a ubiquitous marker of silencing in human cells and likely leads to transcriptional repression by recruitment of a protein complex such as the HP1-associated complex (18Kellum R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 53-77PubMed Google Scholar). The repetitive DNA at yeast centromeres is maintained in a transcriptionally silent state by methylation of H3-Lys9 and binding of Swi6 or heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to the modified chromatin (19Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). A recent study of centromere chromatin silencing in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, demonstrated that silencing of homologous repeats by H3-Lys9 methylation is initially mediated by components of the RNA interference machinery (20Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G. Grewal S.I. Martienssen R.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, gene silencing in inactivation of the X chromosome in mammalian female cells involves the expression of Xist RNA, which coats the X chromosome, followed soon after by H3-Lys9 methylation, gene inactivation, and ultimately methylation of DNA (21Cohen D.E. Lee J.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The finding of Alu elements as a target of H3-Lys9 methylation raises the possibility that by analogy to yeast silencing of homologous repeats, mechanisms involving RNA interference also operate in the establishment of silenced Alu elements. Among 32 Alu clones recovered here, the frequency of old Alu elements (23 clones, 72%) and young Alu elements (9 clones, 28%) are consistent with the prevalence of old and young Alu elements in the human genome. In older Alu subfamilies, many of the CpG sites have mutated to TpG or CpA because of deamination of 5-methylcytosine. In contrast, newly retrotransposed Alu elements are CpG-rich and extensively methylated. Our results show that histone H3-Lys9 methylation is characteristic of both old and young Alu subfamilies and suggests that, once established, H3-Lys9 Alu methylation persists over long periods of time, despite eventual inactivation of the Alu elements by promoter mutations. We also found another repetitive element, LINE, in 7 clones (15%). LINE-1 elements comprise roughly 15% of the human genome and are concentrated in AT-rich regions (16Venter J.C.

McDaniel J. Murphy S. Newman M. Nguyen T. Nguyen N. Nodell M. Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10699) Google Scholar). LINE-1 promoters are also usually methylated at DNA (22Hata K. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), thus providing an explanation for H3-Lys9 methylation. Nevertheless, the frequency of LINE elements in our clones was almost similar to that in the human genome, suggesting that LINE elements are less specifically targeted than Alu elements, although the number of clones analyzed overall in this study is small. It remains unclear which protein complexes are involved in Alu silencing when these sequences are highly methylated. The SNF2h-NuRD-cohesin complex, which is a chromatin remodeling complex, was recently reported to specifically associate with some Alu elements, accompanied by histone H3-Lys4 methylation and either histone H3 or H4 acetylation (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Schmiesing J.A. Dong Y. Barak O.G. Speicher D.W. Yokomori K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2002; 418: 994-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In that study, the binding of the cohesin complex to chromatin around Alu elements could be increased by inhibition of DNA methylation. In our study, treating cells with 5-aza-dC decreased the degree of H3-Lys9 methylation in all 5 Alu elements tested. It is possible then that the SNF2h-NuRD-cohesin complex counteracts the activity of a silencing complex recruited by histone H3-Lys9 methylation and that normally reside on Alu elements, possibly as a result of DNA methylation in these regions. An obvious functional significance of these findings is to provide a molecular mechanism for the known silencing of Alu elements. This silencing is thought to be essential in reducing the mutational load associated with active Alu elements in dividing cells, as has been proposed in the genome defense hypothesis (24Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). It is of interest, however, that H3-Lys9 methylation can spread in cis, as seen in fission yeast (25Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I. Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). If similar spreading occurs in human cells, one might observe time-dependent spreading of silencing, a hypothesis consistent with the observations of age-related DNA methylation in normal tissues (26Issa J.P. Ottaviano Y.L. Celano P. Hamilton S.R. Davidson N.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 27Shen L. Kondo Y. Hamilton S.R. Rashid A. Issa J.P. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 626-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, such Alu element H3-Lys9 methylation may serve as an initial seed for gene silencing in cancer, as suggested by previous studies (28Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myohanen S. Baylin S.B.

https://openalex.org/W1977607467,"The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand TALL-1 and its cognate receptors, BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R, were recently identified as members of the TNF superfamily, which are essential factors contributing to B-cell maturation. The functional, soluble fragment of TALL-1 (sTALL-1) forms a virus-like assembly for its proper function. Here we determine the crystal structures of sTALL-1 complexed with the extracellular domains of BCMA and BAFF-R at 2.6 and 2.5 Å, respectively. The single cysteine-rich domain of BCMA and BAFF-R both have saddle-like architectures, which sit on the horseback-like surface formed by four coil regions on each individual sTALL-1 monomer. Three novel structural modules, D2, X2 and N, were revealed from the current structures. Sequence alignments, structural modelling and mutagenesis revealed that one disulphide bridge in BAFF-R is critical for determining the binding specificity of the extracellular domain eBAFF-R to TALL-1 instead of APRIL, a closely related ligand of TALL-1, which was confirmed by binding experiments in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2143824409,"The three-dimensional structure of human apoA-I on nascent, discoidal HDL particles has been debated extensively over the past 25 years. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the α-helical domains of apoA-I are arranged in a belt-like orientation with the long axis of the helices perpendicular to the phospholipid acyl chains on the disc edge. However, experimental information on the spatial relationships between apoA-I molecules on the disc is lacking. To address this issue, we have taken advantage of recent advances in mass spectrometry technology combined with cleavable cross-linking chemistry to derive a set of distance constraints suitable for testing apoA-I structural models. We generated highly homogeneous, reconstituted HDL particles containing two molecules of apoA-I. These were treated with a thiol-cleavable cross-linking agent, which covalently joined Lys residues in close proximity within or between molecules of apoA-I in the disc. The cross-linked discs were then exhaustively trypsinized to generate a discrete population of peptides. The resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry before and after cleavage of the cross-links, and resulting peaks were identified based on the theoretical tryptic cleavage of apoA-I. We identified at least 8 intramolecular and 7 intermolecular cross-links in the particle. The distance constraints are used to analyze three current models of apoA-I structure. The results strongly support the presence of the salt-bridge interactions that were predicted to occur in the “double belt” model of apoA-I, but a helical hairpin model containing the same salt-bridge docking interface is also consistent with the data.

However, experimental information on the spatial relationships between apoA-I molecules on the disc is lacking. To address this issue, we have taken advantage of recent advances in mass spectrometry technology combined with cleavable cross-linking chemistry to derive a set of distance constraints suitable for testing apoA-I structural models. We generated highly homogeneous, reconstituted HDL particles containing two molecules of apoA-I. These were treated with a thiol-cleavable cross-linking agent, which covalently joined Lys residues in close proximity within or between molecules of apoA-I in the disc. The cross-linked discs were then exhaustively trypsinized to generate a discrete population of peptides. The resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry before and after cleavage of the cross-links, and resulting peaks were identified based on the theoretical tryptic cleavage of apoA-I. We identified at least 8 intramolecular and 7 intermolecular cross-links in the particle. The distance constraints are used to analyze three current models of apoA-I structure. The results strongly support the presence of the salt-bridge interactions that were predicted to occur in the “double belt” model of apoA-I, but a helical hairpin model containing the same salt-bridge docking interface is also consistent with the data.

Apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, a 243-amino acid, 28-kDa protein is a key mediator of HDL function. It is required for lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase-mediated maturation of HDL and may be a major ligand by which cholesteryl esters are delivered to the liver via the scavenger receptor type B class 1 receptor (1Xu S.

In addition, the recent discovery of the importance of the ATP binding cassette protein in lipid transport (2Rust S. Rosier M. Funke H. Real J. Amoura Z. Piette J.C. Deleuze J.F. Brewer H.B.

Genet. 1999; 22: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) indicates that an important apoA-I to cell surface interaction may occur during HDL formation and reverse cholesterol transport. One of the major obstacles to a better understanding of these interactions has been the paucity of detailed structural information for apoA-I in its various states of lipid association.Homogeneous discoidal forms of HDL are easily reconstituted from purified protein and lipids in vitro (5Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and these reconstituted HDL (rHDL) analogs have been used heavily for structural studies. The discs likely exist as a phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer surrounded at its edges by the hydrophobic regions of the amphipathic helices of apoA-I (for a review see Ref. 6Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Segrest et al. and others (7Segrest J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 18: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Wlodawer A. Segrest J.P. Chung B.H. Chiovetti R.J. Weinstein J.N. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed in the late 1970s that the α-helices of apoA-I were arranged around the disc circumference with the long axis of the helices perpendicular to the acyl chains. This became known as the “belt” or “bicycle wheel” model. Alternatively, other investigators theorized that the 22-amino acid helical repeats could traverse the bilayer edge with the helices parallel to the acyl chains (9Tall A.R. Small D.M. Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4701-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This “picket fence” model was challenged by the first successful x-ray crystal structure of a lipid-free fragment of apoA-I by Borhani et al. (10Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The crystal structure showed a tetramer of highly α-helical apoA-I molecules arranged in a ring-shaped complex, with no evidence of hairpin turns. Borhani et al. hypothesized that the ring motif in the crystal structure could be applied to the case of lipid-bound apoA-I on a disc. Since then, a belt-like orientation for the helices of apoA-I has been supported by polarized infrared spectroscopy experiments performed by Koppaka et al. (11Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14541-14544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, we published a series of studies in which various single tryptophan mutants of apoA-I were analyzed in discoidal HDL particles containing phospholipids with quenching groups at various positions along the acyl chain. The results clearly showed that all eight 22-amino acid helices in apoA-I were oriented perpendicular to the phospholipid acyl chains (12Panagotopulos S.E. Horace E.M. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42965-42970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).With the question of apoA-I helical orientation addressed, attention has focused on determining spatial relationships between two molecules of apoA-I on a disc. Segrest et al. (14Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) recently published a computer model referred to as the “double belt” model for a reconstituted HDL particle containing two molecules of apoA-I. In this model, two ring-shaped molecules of apoA-I are stacked on top of each other with both molecules forming an almost continuous helix that wraps around the perimeter of the phospholipid disc in an anti-parallel orientation. Computer analysis of the model predicted a particular registry between the monomers resulting in the greatest potential for salt bridge connections between the two molecules. An alternative belt-like model, initially suggested by Brouillette (15Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 103-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), predicts that apoA-I molecules are arranged in a hairpin orientation. In this model, about half of the molecule interacts with one leaflet, there is a turn, and the other half runs anti-parallel to the first on the opposing leaflet. This idea was supported by fluorescence energy transfer experiments performed by Tricerri et al. (16Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The model preserves the potential for stabilizing salt bridge interactions between the same residues that were proposed for the double belt, although these must occur intramolecularly in the hairpin model. We have proposed a third model termed the “Z” belt orientation (13Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This arrangement is similar to the hairpin except that, instead of traversing back along itself, the molecule proceeds in the same direction on the opposing leaflet, giving the potential for interlocking interactions between the molecules.Although traditional spectroscopic methods such as fluorescence and circular dichroism have proven useful for studying the generalities of apoA-I structure in rHDL, data from these approaches are not suitable for high resolution modeling. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and x-ray crystallography data would be very useful, but these techniques have not yet been successfully applied to native rHDL particles. However, Bennett et al. (17Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) recently reported an elegant study that demonstrated the power of combining high precision mass spectrometry/peptide analysis with cross-linking chemistry to identify sites of interaction between two protein molecules. Young et al. (18Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) used a similar approach in combination with a sequence threading technique to generate a structure of monomeric human fibroblast growth factor that matched well with the known NMR structure of the protein. In this work, we report the successful adaptation of this approach to the problem the spatial relationships of two molecules of apoA-I on the edge of a discoidal HDL particle. The results provide the most comprehensive determinations of distance constraints within an rHDL particle and strongly confirm the presence of the salt bridge interactions predicted by Segrest et al. (14Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol.

Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, HDL was freeze-dried and extracted with chloroform/methanol. The pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tris HCl with 6 m urea and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (XK 2.6/40, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated and eluted at 4 ml/min at room temperature in the same buffer. Fractions containing apoA-I as determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were dialyzed into 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer and freeze-dried. Proteins were solubilized in 3 m guanidine for 1 h and then dialyzed into standard phosphate buffer (SPB) (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH. 7.8) prior to use in reconstitution experiments.Preparation of rHDL Particles—Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles were prepared using 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at lipid to protein molar ratios of 90:1 according to the method of Jonas (5Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Lipids were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in SPB. Deoxycholate (Fisher, deoxycholate: lipid, 1.3:1, w/w) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h with mild vortexing every 15 min. The protein was added and incubated a 37 °C for 1 h. The cholate was removed by dialysis against SPB (5 changes of 2 liters for at least 4 h each at 4 °C). The particles were analyzed on a non-denaturing, native polyacrylamide Phast gel (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) (20Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Before cross-linking, the particles were passed down a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove unreacted protein and lipid. Fractions corresponding to the 96-Å diameter complex were pooled and concentrated by filtration. The phosphorus method of Sokolof and Rothblat (21Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the Markwell modification of the Lowry assay (22Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) determined the final phospholipid and protein concentrations, respectively. The atomic phosphorus standard was obtained from Sigma (St, Louis, MO).Cross-linking, Reduction, and Generation of Tryptic Peptides—DSP (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) (Pierce) was weighed out and dissolved in ice-cold Me2SO to a concentration of 6.5 mg/ml and used within 5 min. A 7:1 molar ratio of DSP to apoA-I protein was added to a solution containing human apoA-I/POPC discs in SPB on ice at a concentration between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with periodic vortexing. The reaction was quenched by adding a stock of 1 m Tris, pH.7.8, to a final Tris concentration of 100 mm. The samples were dialyzed into 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate to remove any unreacted cross-linker and were lyophilized to dryness. The lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, and the protein fraction was solubilized in SPB with 3 m guanidine HCl. In some experiments, the monomeric protein was separated from the dimeric protein after cross-linking by passage down a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the dimer and monomer were collected, concentrated, and dialyzed into SPB. Each cross-linked sample was split in two equal fractions. One was labeled “reduced” and incubated with 25 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) from a stock solution in water for 2 h at 37 °C. The other fraction was labeled “x-linked” and treated identically except receiving the same volume of water instead of DTT. Both samples were dialyzed against 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate (in separate containers). 5% (weight of trypsin to apoA-I) sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was allowed to digest the protein at 37 °C for 2 h. The samples were lyophilized to dryness in a microcentrifuge tube in 100-μg aliquots. The samples were stored at -20 °C until used.Mass Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) experiments were carried out on a Sciex QSTAR DE (quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF)) mass spectrometer fitted with an atmospheric electrospray ionizer controlled by using Analyst QS 1.1 software (Applied Biosystems). The spectrometer was programmed for TOF-MS scans from 100 to 2800 atomic mass units at a 1.0-s accumulation time. An Agilent 1100 capillary HPLC with an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 0.5-mm × 15-cm reverse phase column at a flow rate of 7.5 μl per min was used to separate tryptic peptides prior to introduction into the mass spectrometer by complex peptide gradient chromatography. Lyophilized samples were solubilized in mobile phase A (distilled water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and eluted with a 0–100% gradient of mobile phase B (95% acetonitrile in water with 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid). 160 pmol of protein was injected per run. The mass spectra were internally calibrated by a three-point linear method based on the monoisotopic masses of the following peptides derived from apoA-I: 154–160 (mass of 780.4242 Da), 161–171 (1300.6412 Da), and 62–77 (1931.9265 Da). These peptides were used because they exhibited prominent peaks in all samples and covered much of the expected mass range.Data Analysis—Using the Analyst QS software, individual mass spectra were generated for each peak in the total ion chromatograph (TIC) for each sample. Masses that exhibited an intensity of at least 25 detector counts were recorded and identified in terms of ion type (M+H, M+2H, etc.). Monoisotopic masses were determined by averaging the ion series for each mass. The resulting list of masses was analyzed by the software GPMAW (ChemSW, Inc.) to assign a putative amino acid sequence identity as either an unmodified peptide of apoA-I or one or more peptides containing one or more DSP modifications (see Table I). To identify cross-links occurring between two peptides, a spreadsheet was used to sum the masses of all possible combinations of peptides and one or more intervening cross-links. The resulting data base of theoretical cross-linked peptide masses was then searched for a given experimental mass. Mass identity assignments were made using the following criteria: 1) An assignment was made only if the experimental mass matched the theoretical mass within 40 ppm. This cutoff was sufficient to identify all single cleavage peptides in control experiments using unmodified apoA-I that had been completely trypsinized. 2) All peptides present in a cross-link must contain a Lys residue (not at the C terminus). 3) It was assumed that trypsin does not cleave on C-terminal side of a modified Lys residue (17Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This feature of trypsin was advantageous because it reduced the complexity of the peptide mixture in the cross-linked sample. 4) Putative cross-links were assigned to masses present in the cross-linked sample but only if they completely disappeared when the sample was reduced with DTT. 5) Identities were assigned for putative intermolecular or intramolecular cross-links only if all peptide components were recovered with the appropriate number of reduced cross-links on eligible Lys residues after DTT reduction. 6) It was assumed that trypsin fully cleaved the protein at every opportunity, with no partials.Table IPossible peptide modifications resulting from DSP cross-linkingType of modificationaSee the text for a description of how cross-links were assigned as intra- or intermolecular.

All masses are expressed as the monoisotopic mass Open table in a new tab Distinguishing Intraversus Intermolecular Cross-links—Intra-versus intermolecular cross-links were assigned by comparing the intensity of a given mass between spectra generated from dimeric and monomeric forms of apoA-I isolated from a cross-linked rHDL particle by gel filtration. The maximal detector count intensities for the entire ion series for a given mass were summed for the dimeric and monomeric cross-linked samples, respectively (23Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2120-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ratio of the dimeric/monomeric intensities was used to determine if a mass was substantially less prevalent in the monomeric versus the dimeric cross-linked protein. For a particular mass, an intensity ratio below 1.7 was identified as a putative intramolecular cross-link. By contrast, an intermolecular cross-link was proposed for ratios higher than 1.7. The appearance of small amounts of intermolecular cross-links in the monomeric sample was due to slight contamination of the dimeric form in the sample (see Fig. 3).RESULTSThe Approach—The case of purified apoA-I on a well-defined rHDL particle with two molecules of apoA-I is essentially a homodimeric non-covalent interaction similar to that studied by Bennett et al. (17Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using mass spectrometry. ApoA-I contains 21 Lys residues that are generally evenly spread throughout the molecule, making it a manageable candidate for this approach. The homodimer is first incubated with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DSP, which reacts with the ϵ-amine group of lysine residues. Numerous cross-links randomly form both intra- and intermolecularly depending on the number Lys residues within the reagent's spacer arm length of 12 Å. In addition, the cross-linker may bind to one Lys residue but fail to cross-link to a second Lys residue before spontaneous hydrolysis of the cross-linker (17Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Once cross-linked, trypsin is used to cleave after Arg and Lys residues to generate a population of peptides, some of which are unmodified whereas others are cross-linked. An aliquot of the peptide mixture is treated with the reducing agent DTT to cleave the disulfide linkage within DSP (Fig. 1) to liberate any joined peptides. A second aliquot is left untreated. Both the cross-linked and reduced peptide mixtures are then separated by reverse phase HPLC and analyzed immediately upon elution by electrospray MS. Highly accurate mass spectra are taken for each peak as they elute from the column. If a particular mass is present in both chromatograms, it represents a peptide that was not modified by DSP. However, masses appearing in the cross-linked chromatogram, but not in the reduced chromatogram, indicate the presence of cross-linked peptides that were cleaved by DTT. Masses appearing in the reduced chromatogram are due to the newly freed peptides. The mass data are used to assign a sequence identity to each peptide by comparing the experimentally derived peptide mass to a data base of theoretical peptide masses generated from the known protein sequence and the known cleavage sites of trypsin. Unmodified peptides exhibit masses equal to the sum of the amino acids in the peptide sequence. The mass of a cross-linked peptide complex is the sum of each component peptide mass plus an intact cross-link (see Table I). Similarly, the mass of peptides containing cleaved cross-links is the sum of the peptide mass plus a reduced cross-link. After peptide identification, one can deduce that a cross-link was formed between peptides X and Y in the native dimer. If each peptide had a single Lys residue in the sequence, then one can conclude that the two Lys residues were within about 12 Å in the native protein structure.Fig. 1Chemical structure of dithiobis(succinimidyl proprionate) (DSP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)rHDL Particle Reconstitution, Characterization, and Cross-linking Optimization—We generated a simple discoidal reconstituted rHDL particle with a diameter of 96 Å that is well known to contain two molecules of apoA-I and about 160 molecules of POPC (24Jonas A.

This particle was selected because it is stable, easily produced in high yield in vitro, and has been used for computer simulation studies testing various models for apoA-I structure (14Segrest J.P.

Proteins. 1992; 13: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows a non-denaturing PAGE analysis demonstrating the homogeneity of this particle. Its diameter measured 96 ± 3 Å, and it contained a final POPC to apoA-I ratio of 79 ± 4:1. To work out the conditions for cross-linking the apoA-I molecules on the complex with DSP, pilot experiments were performed in which the molar ratio of DSP to apoA-I was varied from 2.5:1 to 50:1 (data not shown). Ratios above 10:1 were sufficient to cross-link about 97% of the apoA-I to a dimeric form as visualized by SDS-PAGE. Higher ratios could drive the reaction completely to dimers. We chose a ratio of 7:1 for further experiments to minimize the chances of perturbing the particle structure and to give an opportunity to study the monomeric form of the cross-linked apoA-I (see below). Cross-linking at 4 °C was found to reduce the heterogeneity of the dimeric band versus incubations at room temperature probably by minimizing thermal motions within the particle. Fig. 2B shows the results of a typical cross-linking experiment under these conditions. ApoA-I (28 kDa) in the rHDL particle was cross-linked to a dimer (56 kDa), which could be mostly reduced back to a monomer by cleavage of the cross-link with DTT. We consistently observed a small amount of trimer (84 kDa) in these particles (Fig. 2, lane 3, top band) of about 5% of the total staining. We believe that this arose from a slight contamination of the 108-Å rHDL particles in our preparation, a complex with three molecules of apoA-I (24Jonas A. Toohill K.L. Krul E.S. Wald J.H. Kezdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small percentage (about 5%) of the apoA-I remained as a monomer under these conditions. The appearance of the dimer upon DSP cross-linking was independent of the rHDL concentration between 0.5 to 5.0 mg/ml (data not shown), indicating that the cross-links were formed within rHDL particles and not between two rHDL particles (28Swaney J.B. O'Brien K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the cross-links did not change the average helical content of apoA-I from that of the unmodified form as measured by circular dichroism (both were about 75% helical), arguing that the cross-links did not significantly perturb the structure of the protein. Furthermore, we found that the ratio of cross-linker to apoA-I did not significantly affect the cross-links identifiable by MS (data not shown).Fig. 2Characterization and cross-linking of a 96-Å apoA-I discoidal rHDL particle.

https://openalex.org/W2171805191,"The directionality of electron transfer in Photosystem I (PS I) is investigated using site-directed mutations in the phylloquinone (QK) and FX binding regions of Synnechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The kinetics of forward electron transfer from the secondary acceptor A1 (phylloquinone) were measured in mutants using time-resolved optical difference spectroscopy and transient EPR spectroscopy. In whole cells and PS I complexes of the wild-type both techniques reveal a major, slow kinetic component of τ ≈ 300 ns while optical data resolve an additional minor kinetic component of τ ≈ 10 ns. Whole cells and PS I complexes from the W697FPsaA and S692CPsaA mutants show a significant slowing of the slow kinetic component, whereas the W677FPsaB and S672CPsaB mutants show a less significant slowing of the fast kinetic component. Transient EPR measurements at 260 K show that the slow phase is ∼3 times slower than at room temperature. Simulations of the early time behavior of the spin polarization pattern of P700+A1–, in which the decay rate of the pattern is assumed to be negligibly small, reproduce the observed EPR spectra at 260 K during the first 100 ns following laser excitation. Thus any spin polarization from P700+FX– in this time window is very weak. From this it is concluded that the relative amplitude of the fast phase is negligible at 260 K or its rate is much less temperature-dependent than that of the slow component. Together, the results demonstrate that the slow kinetic phase results from electron transfer from QK-A to FX and that this accounts for at least 70% of the electrons. Although the assignment of the fast kinetic phase remains uncertain, it is not strongly temperature dependent and it represents a minor fraction of the electrons being transferred. All of the results point toward asymmetry in electron transfer, and indicate that forward transfer in cyanobacterial PS I is predominantly along the PsaA branch. The directionality of electron transfer in Photosystem I (PS I) is investigated using site-directed mutations in the phylloquinone (QK) and FX binding regions of Synnechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The kinetics of forward electron transfer from the secondary acceptor A1 (phylloquinone) were measured in mutants using time-resolved optical difference spectroscopy and transient EPR spectroscopy. In whole cells and PS I complexes of the wild-type both techniques reveal a major, slow kinetic component of τ ≈ 300 ns while optical data resolve an additional minor kinetic component of τ ≈ 10 ns. Whole cells and PS I complexes from the W697FPsaA and S692CPsaA mutants show a significant slowing of the slow kinetic component, whereas the W677FPsaB and S672CPsaB mutants show a less significant slowing of the fast kinetic component. Transient EPR measurements at 260 K show that the slow phase is ∼3 times slower than at room temperature. Simulations of the early time behavior of the spin polarization pattern of P700+A1–, in which the decay rate of the pattern is assumed to be negligibly small, reproduce the observed EPR spectra at 260 K during the first 100 ns following laser excitation. Thus any spin polarization from P700+FX– in this time window is very weak. From this it is concluded that the relative amplitude of the fast phase is negligible at 260 K or its rate is much less temperature-dependent than that of the slow component. Together, the results demonstrate that the slow kinetic phase results from electron transfer from QK-A to FX and that this accounts for at least 70% of the electrons. Although the assignment of the fast kinetic phase remains uncertain, it is not strongly temperature dependent and it represents a minor fraction of the electrons being transferred. All of the results point toward asymmetry in electron transfer, and indicate that forward transfer in cyanobacterial PS I is predominantly along the PsaA branch. The pathway of light-induced electron transfer among symmetrically placed electron transfer cofactors has been a long standing issue in the study of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; PS, photosystem; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; Chl, chlorophyll; phylloquinone, 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or 2-methyl-3-(3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecenyl)-1,4-naphthalenedione. Although RCs show considerable diversity between various organisms, all consist of a protein dimer with two branches of cofactors that extend across the membrane from a “special pair” of chlorophyll molecules on the donor side to a pair of quinones on the acceptor side. The whole arrangement has pseudo-C2 symmetry, however, differences in the amino acid sequences of the two proteins and/or positions and structures of the cofactors break the symmetry significantly in all heterodimeric RCs. In Type II RCs, quinones function as the terminal electron acceptors, and electron transfer is known to be highly asymmetric and strongly biased toward one branch (referred to as the A-branch). One apparent reason for this asymmetry is the fact that the quinone acceptor in the B-branch, QB, functions as a mobile electron carrier, and electron transfer down the A-branch stabilizes the electron while the QB site undergoes a structural reorganization needed to accept an electron (1Graige M.S. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11679-11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In Type I RCs, there are no known mobile quinones, and both branches converge at the iron-sulfur cluster FX on the stromal side of the membrane. The electron is further transferred to the FA and FB iron-sulfur clusters, which function as the terminal electron acceptors. Because of these differences, the directionality of electron transfer in Type I RCs cannot be inferred from knowledge of Type II RCs. Unlike in the bacterial RC, the two branches in Photosystem I (PS I) are difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish spectroscopically. As discussed in the previous paper (2Xu W. Chitnis P. Vaieva A. van der Est A. Pushkar J. Teutloff C. Krzystyniak M. Zech S. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Zybailov B. Shen G. Golbeck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27864-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the use of point mutants and time-resolved EPR and optical spectroscopy allows this issue to be addressed in PS I. The initial electron transfer steps are difficult to observe because the trapping of the excitation from the antenna masks these early events. In contrast, the subsequent electron transfer from phylloquinone (A1) to the iron-sulfur center FX is easily observed and provides a convenient way to study the kinetics and pathway of electron transfer. Early time-resolved optical studies of electron transfer from A1– to FX appeared to be contradictory, with kinetics from UV absorbance changes attributed to A1– reoxidation reported to have a t ½ of 15 ns in PS I particles isolated from spinach (3Mathis P. Sétif P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 65-68Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 200 ns in PS I particles isolated from Synechococcus sp (4Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas transient EPR data on PS I particles from Synechococcus sp. and spinach chloroplasts both gave a value of τ = 260 ns (t ½ = 180 ns) (5Bock C.H. van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 91-96Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Later studies using so-called PS I-β particles from spinach showed a biphasic decay attributed to A1– oxidation with t ½ of 25 and 250 ns, and relative amplitudes of 65 and 35%, respectively (7Sétif P. Brettel K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both kinetic phases were attributed to electron transfer from A1– to FX. Studies at faster time scales with PS I particles from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 also showed an additional kinetic phase attributed to A1– oxidation with a t ½ of 10 ns (8Brettel K. Garag G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Vol. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Budapest, Hungary1998: 611-614Google Scholar). Although the faster of the two kinetic phases cannot be resolved directly by transient EPR, changes in its relative amplitude are reflected in the observed spin polarization (9Kandrashkin Y.E. van der Est A. RIKEN Rev. 2002; 44: 124-127Google Scholar, 10van der Est A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 212-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which is sensitive to the spin dynamics of short-lived precursor states with lifetimes as short as 500 ps. Recently, this influence of the fast kinetic phase on the spin polarization patterns was investigated (9Kandrashkin Y.E. van der Est A. RIKEN Rev. 2002; 44: 124-127Google Scholar), and it was concluded that the amplitude of the fast phase in whole cells and PS I particles of cyanobacteria could account for at most ∼20% of the total amplitude, whereas the transient EPR spectra of PS I particles isolated from spinach and Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii show a much larger influence (9Kandrashkin Y.E. van der Est A. RIKEN Rev. 2002; 44: 124-127Google Scholar). Moreover, the ratio of the fast to slow kinetic phases is not constant between different preparations; rather, PS I particles isolated from spinach show a diminished amplitude of the optically detected 25-ns kinetic phase when isolated using less harsh conditions, down to 30% in a particle prepared without detergent (7Sétif P. Brettel K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas transient EPR suggests at most a very small contribution from the fast kinetic phase in spinach chloroplasts and cyanobacterial whole cells (6van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Kandrashkin Y.E. van der Est A. RIKEN Rev. 2002; 44: 124-127Google Scholar, 10van der Est A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 212-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent optical studies of whole cells of C. reinhardtii (11Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11130-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) showed biphasic kinetics attributed to the reoxidation of A1– with t ½ of 18 ns and t ½ of 160 ns and of nearly equal amplitude. Hence, it appears that the fast kinetic phase is a property inherent to PS I but the ratio of the amplitudes of the fast and slow kinetic phases is species-dependent and sensitive to environmental conditions such as the presence of the detergent. Moreover, the sensitivity to detergent isolation is much higher in eukaryotic PS I compared with cyanobacterial PS I. Whereas the biphasic kinetics observed in the near UV are now generally thought to result from electron transfer from A1– to FX, the origin of the biphasic behavior remains controversial (see Ref. 12Brettel K. Leibl W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar for review). Sétif and Brettel (7Sétif P. Brettel K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggested that the redox potentials of A1 and FX are close and that the fast kinetic phase reflects the establishment of a redox equilibrium between A1 and FX. This proposal was made prior to detailed knowledge about the pseudo C2 symmetry of PS I, and therefore presupposes a unidirectional pathway of electron transfer. Joliot and Joliot (11Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11130-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) suggested that the biphasic kinetics could come about from either two conformational states that differ by the reoxidation rate of A1– or two phylloquinones that correspond to the two branches of the PS I heterodimer involved in electron transfer. The former presupposes unidirectional electron transfer and the latter presupposes bidirectional electron transfer. The latter idea arose when the model of PS I based on the 6-Å crystal structure (13Krauß N. Hinrichs W. Witt I. Fromme P. Pritzkow W. Dauter Z. Betzel C. Wilson K.S. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nature. 1993; 361: 326-331Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar) showed the presence of a 2-fold axis of symmetry similar to the pseudo 2-fold axis of symmetry in the purple bacterial RC. The atomic resolution structure based on the 2.5-Å electron density map (14Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauß N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 15Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) shows that the position of the electron transfer cofactors and the identity and positions of nearby amino acids are highly similar on the PsaA side and the PsaB side polypeptides. In particular, the phylloquinones on the PsaA side and the PsaB side are located in similar environments that consist of: (i) a H-bond between a backbone Leu and the stromal-facing carbonyl group of phylloquinone in the ortho position relative to the phytyl tail, (ii) a π–π interaction with a Trp, and (iii) an apparent lack of a H-bond to the other phylloquinone carbonyl group in the meta position relative to the phytyl tail. One significant break in symmetry is in the P700 chlorophyll a′/a special pair; the chlorophyll a′ has three H-bonds to PsaA side amino acids, whereas there are no H-bonds to the chlorophyll a on the PsaB side. Other significant symmetry breaks are also found further down the electron transfer chain in the high resolution structure (15Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The extent to which the two quinones are active in the electron transport chain, the origin of the biphasic kinetics of A1– reoxidation, and the role that the structural features of the binding site play in determining the electron transfer kinetics are all unresolved issues. In this paper, we report EPR and optical kinetic studies of mutants in and around the quinone binding sites of PS I. The premise of these experiments is that a change in the environment of the quinone should lead to a change in its redox potential, which, in turn, should translate to a change in the forward kinetics of electron transfer from the quinone to the iron-sulfur clusters. A network of H-bonded residues extends from the Met axial ligand of A0 through A1 to FX. The residues involved in this network are thus candidates for point mutations, which are expected to influence the rate of forward electron transfer. In the preceding paper (2Xu W. Chitnis P. Vaieva A. van der Est A. Pushkar J. Teutloff C. Krzystyniak M. Zech S. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Zybailov B. Shen G. Golbeck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27864-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we showed that the point mutations W697FPsaA, W677FPsaB, S692CPsaA, S672CPsaB, R694APsaA, and R674APsaB cause only subtle structural and electronic changes so that they act as suitable markers for following the pathway of electron transfer. As discussed in the preceding paper (2Xu W. Chitnis P. Vaieva A. van der Est A. Pushkar J. Teutloff C. Krzystyniak M. Zech S. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Zybailov B. Shen G. Golbeck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27864-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the W697FPsaA, W677FPsaB, S692CPsaA, and S672CPsaB, mutants affect the quinone binding sites and we expect only electron transfer in the branch containing the mutation to be affected. The R694APsaA and R674APsaB mutants on the other hand may affect both branches because each is involved in a salt bridge from the jk-surface loop to Gly572PsaB (Gly585PsaA) in the respective FX binding loop (16Antonkine M. Jordan P. Fromme P. Krauß N. Golbeck J. Stehlik D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 671-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In other words, this residue ties together the region of the quinone with that of the iron-sulfur cluster. Mutations of these residues should disrupt this arrangement and would be expected to cause a change in the properties of FX. The results presented in this paper address the issue of directionality and biphasic kinetics and can be interpreted to show that in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the majority of electrons proceed along PsaA side cofactors in PS I. Whereas we cannot rule out the participation of PsaB side cofactors in PS I electron transfer, we place an upper limit on the fraction of electrons taking this pathway. Mutants and Photosystem I Complexes—The mutant strains containing the W697FPsaA, W677FPsaB, S692CPsaA, S672CPsaB, R694APsaA, and R674APsaB substitutions have been described previously (2Xu W. Chitnis P. Vaieva A. van der Est A. Pushkar J. Teutloff C. Krzystyniak M. Zech S. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Zybailov B. Shen G. Golbeck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27864-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Isolation of membranes and purification of PS I complexes was performed according to previously published procedures (2Xu W. Chitnis P. Vaieva A. van der Est A. Pushkar J. Teutloff C. Krzystyniak M. Zech S. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Zybailov B. Shen G. Golbeck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27864-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Flash-induced Transient Absorption Spectroscopy in the Near UV/Blue Region—Flash-induced absorbance changes of isolated PS I complexes were measured with a time resolution of about 2 ns with a set-up described previously (17Brettel K. Leibl W. Liebl U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using 300-ps pulses of about 300 nJ/cm2 at 532 nm for excitation (repetition rate, 1 Hz) and the relatively flat top of a 50-μs Xe flash as measuring light. Stock solutions of PS I complexes were diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 500 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol, to a final Chl concentration of typically 60 and 150 μm for measurements at 380 and 480 nm, respectively. The optical path length for the measuring light was 2 mm. Between 1024 and 4096 transients were averaged for each sample and wavelength to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. A Marquardt least squares algorithm program was used for fitting of the absorbance change transients to a multiexponential decay. Time zero was defined as the midpoint of the rising edge of the transient, and fitting was started 2.5 ns after time zero. Flash-induced absorbance changes in whole cells were measured with an optical setup described previously (18Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1999; 70: 202-207Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 20 mm Tris at pH 8.2 in the presence of 5% Ficoll. Dichlorodimethylurea (20 μm) and 2 mm hydroxylamine were added to inactivate Photosystem II and 20 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added to prevent accumulation of transmembrane potential. X-band Transient EPR Spectroscopy at Room Temperature—Transient EPR experiments at room temperature were carried out using a modified Bruker ESP 200 spectrometer equipped with a home-built, broadband amplifier (bandwidth >500 MHz) for direct detection experiments. Light excitation was provided by a Continuum YAG/OPO laser system operating at 680 or 532 nm and 10 Hz. The EPR signals were digitized using a LeCroy LT322 500 MHz digital oscilloscope and transferred to a PC for storage and analysis. The samples were measured using a flat cell and a Bruker rectangular resonator and contained 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 μm phenazine methosulfate as external redox mediators. The response time of the system is governed by the band-width of the resonator and is estimated to be ∼50 ns; the decay of the spin polarization limits the accessible time range to times shorter than a few microseconds. Complete time/field data sets were collected and analyzed to determine the lifetimes of the species and their decay-associated spectra. To ensure that the isolation procedure does not influence the kinetics or polarization patterns, transient EPR measurements of whole cells and isolated particles from wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were compared. The observed spin polarization patterns (not shown) and kinetic traces are identical demonstrating that the isolation of the particles has no effect on the kinetics. X-band Transient EPR Spectroscopy at 260 K—X-band transient EPR experiments on frozen solutions at 260 K were carried out using a Bruker ER046 XK-T microwave bridge equipped with a Flexline dielectric resonator (6van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and an Oxford liquid helium gas-flow cryostat. The loaded Q-value for this dielectric ring resonator was about Q = 3000, equivalent to a rise time of τr = Q/(2π × νmw) ≈ 50 ns. The samples were illuminated using a Spectra Physics Nd-YAG/MOPO laser system operating at 10 Hz and contained 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 μm phenazine methosulfate. Our main effort focuses on applying a set of complementary spectroscopic techniques to characterize transient charge separated states in a comparative study of the influence of mutations near the A1 binding site. We begin with studies of optical absorbance changes in the near UV/blue in both whole cells and in PS I complexes and continue with transient EPR spectroscopy. Time-resolved Optical Measurements in Whole Cells and Isolated PS I Complexes—The advantage of studying kinetic processes in whole cells is that there is no potential damage to the acceptor cofactors as a result of detergent solubilization of the thylakoid membranes. The disadvantage is that the cells are actively growing and dividing, and PS I complexes may be present in a number of developmental states, including those undergoing assembly and those undergoing degradation. To minimize any potential for heterogeneity because of turnover and to reduce effects of background absorption and competing photoprocesses in larger antenna systems, studies were performed on whole cells and purified on PS I complexes. Ideally, the kinetic results should match in both studies. The flash-induced difference spectrum of A1–/A1 shows a broad absorption increase between 340 and 400 nm (4Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Brettel K. Sétif P. Mathis P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 220-224Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Measurements on PS I complexes were made at 380 and 480 nm, an absorption band in the visible spectrum that reflects the reduction of A1. For technical reasons, measurements were performed at 390 and 400 nm on whole cells. Fig. 1 depicts the decay of the relative flash-induced absorbance change at 400 nm on a logarithmic time scale in whole cells of the wild-type in comparison with the W697FPsaA (top) and W677FPsaB (bottom) mutants. Table I summarizes the lifetimes and relative amplitudes as obtained from a fit of the data to the sum of a fast and slow kinetic phase. At detection wavelengths of 390 and 400 nm, two kinetic phases are found in the wild type with similar time constants of τ = 10 and τ = 300 ns in an amplitude ratio of about 2:3. In the PsaA side mutant W697FPsaA the lifetime of the slow kinetic phase is increased by a factor of about 4 but the lifetime of the fast kinetic phase is relatively unchanged. In the corresponding (symmetric) PsaB side mutant W677FPsaB the lifetime of the slow kinetic phase is not changed significantly at either wavelength (see Table I) but the lifetime of the fast kinetic phase is increased by a factor of about 2.7 (see Fig. 1, top).Table IKinetic analysis of flash-induced absorbance changes attributed to A1- reoxidation in whole cells390 nm400 nmτRelative amplitudeτRelative amplitudeτRelative amplitudeτRelative amplitudensnsnsnsWT100.403000.60110.343400.66W697FPsaA110.4212800.58120.2712000.73W677FPsaB270.364000.64290.383800.62S692CPsaAaIn this mutant, a fast kinetic component (τ = 30 ns) was observed at 430 nm.

All samples studied showed an instrument limited rise of absorption (including the formation of A1– (4Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Brettel K. Sétif P.

As in whole cells, the subsequent decay of the signal (attributed to electron transfer from A1– to the ironsulfur clusters (3Mathis P. Sétif P.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11130-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)) was affected by the mutations. The wild-type signal (Fig. 2) could be well fitted with two exponential decay phases of τ = 10.6 and τ = 240 ns at an amplitude ratio of about 1:3 (see Table II), in line with a previous report (8Brettel K. Garag G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Vol. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Budapest, Hungary1998: 611-614Google Scholar). 2A slight bleaching present at the end of the depicted time scale is presumably from the state P700+(FA/FB)– and/or a small number of antenna chlorophyll triplets. Compared with the measurements on whole cells from the wild type at 390 and 400 nm (see Table I), the lifetimes of the two phases are rather similar, but the relative amplitude of the faster phase appears to be smaller in isolated PS I (but only at 380 nm, not at 480 nm). For the mutants W697FPsaA and W677FPsaB, the kinetics in isolated PS I complexes followed the same trends as in whole cells, i.e. the slower phase alone was slowed in the PsaA side mutant, whereas the faster phase alone was slowed in the PsaB side mutant. The relative amplitudes of the two phases were not significantly affected by these mutations (data not shown; see Table II for fit results). Similar results were observed in mutants of C. reinhardtii (20Guergova-Kuras M. Boudreaux B. Joliot A. Joliot P. Redding K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4437-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), in which the mutation of Trp to Phe on PsaA increased the lifetime of the slow phase while the corresponding (symmetric) mutation on PsaB slowed down the fast phase.Table IIKinetic analysis of flash-induced absorbance changes attributed to A1- reoxidation in isolated PS I complexes380 nm480 nmτRelative amplitudeτRelative amplitudeτRelative amplitudeτRelative amplitudensnsnsnsWT110.252400.759.80.392300.61W697FPsaA8.70.267200.748.10.388800.62W677FPsaB320.242600.76230.412600.59S692CPsaAaA significant evolution of the kinetics during prolonged repetitive excitation was observed for this mutant.

Open table in a new tab The lifetimes and amplitudes as obtained from a fit of the data to a fast and slow kinetic phase in whole cells of the wild-type, S692CPsaA, and S672CPsaB mutants are summarized in Table I. In the PsaA side mutant S692CPsaA, the lifetime of the slow kinetic phase is increased by a factor of about 4, whereas within experimental error the lifetime of the fast kinetic phase does not appear to be lengthened. In the corresponding (symmetric) PsaB side mutant S672CPsaB, the life-time of the slow kinetic phase is not changed significantly at either wavelength (see Table I). Surprisingly, within experimental error the lifetime of the fast kinetic phase also does not appear to be lengthened at either detection wavelength. Note particularly that the large effect on the slow kinetic phase of the S692CPsaA mutant is not mirrored by that on the fast ki"

We have previously reported a tandem mass spectrometry-based method (viz. selected ion tracing analysis) that can be applied to the identification of phosphopeptides as well as exact mapping of the phosphorylated residues within. In this study, we describe the application of the same strategy for the identification of p300 acetyltransferase-mediated acetylation sites on p53. Consistent with the previous finding, lysines 370, 372, 373, 381, and 382 were detected by this modified selected ion tracing method as the target sites of p300 in vitro. Moreover, two novel acetylation sites, Lys-292 and Lys-305, were also found. Immunoblotting using anti-acetyl-Lys-305 antibody confirmed this discovery and demonstrated that Lys-305 could be acetylated by p300 both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that an alanine or glutamine substitution at Lys-305 (K305A or K305Q) suppressed the transcriptional activity of p53, whereas an arginine mutation (K305R) increased the transcriptional activity. Thus, p300 may further regulate the transcriptional activity of p53 through a novel acetylation site, Lys-305.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factor. In response to a wide variety of stress signals, it acts to regulate processes such as the cell cycle, cell death, and DNA repair. Loss of p53 activity has been identified in 60% of the human cancers examined, and >90% of the p53 missense mutations are clustered within the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (1Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor functions of p53 are directly linked to its ability to mediate transcriptional activation (3Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Grosse F. Kim E. Wiesmuller L. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The regulation of p53 transcriptional activity involves several mechanisms including post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (4Appella E.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Most of these modifications occur in the N- and C-terminal regions of p53. Stress-induced N-terminal phosphorylation increases p53 stability by dissociating MDM2, a negative regulator. For example, Ser-15, Thr-18, and Ser-20, located in the MDM2-binding site, are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. This phosphorylation is probably induced by protein kinases such as ATM, ATR, Chk2, CKI, and DNA-PK (10Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The acetylated residues of p53 are located in the regulatory domains adjacent to the tetramerization domain (amino acids 252–355). Acetylation of p53 may be an important regulatory mechanism of p53 function because p53 deacetylation by overexpression of histone deacetylase-associated proteins compromises its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (14Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p53 deacetylation also increases the p53 half-life, suggesting that acetylation may play important roles in the turnover of the p53 protein (15Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Recently, we employed a strategy based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify residues bearing phosphorylation modifications (16Tsay Y.-G. Wang Y.-H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.-C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on this technique, moderately phosphorylated peptides can be identified by close examination of specific ion chromatograms (16Tsay Y.-G. Wang Y.-H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.-C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This selected ion tracing (SIT) method has a major advantage in analyzing modified peptides of low abundance in a complex peptide mixture. More importantly, we have proposed that this method can be generally employed to identify peptides of various modifications. Here, we illustrate how this approach is adapted to identify acetylated peptides and to map the modified residues. Although we successfully verified the previously reported acetylated residues of p53, we also uncovered two novel acetylation targets using this approach. We also present evidence that acetylation of p53 at Lys-305, like that at Lys-382, is elevated by different stress signals. In addition, we found that acetylation at Lys-305 is important for regulating p53 transcriptional activity. DNA Constructs and Reagents—Plasmid pcDNA3-p53w, which contains human wild-type p53, was kindly provided by Dr. Ming-Yang Lai (National Taiwan University). The mammalian expression vector for hemagglutinin-tagged p300 and the bacterial expression vector containing the His-tagged HAT domain (amino acids 1195–1673) of p300 were gifts from Dr. Li-Jung Juan (National Health Research Institutes, Taipei, Taiwan). The p50-2 reporter, which contains the p53-responsive promoter, was obtained from Dr. Young-Sun Lin (Academia Sinica). C-terminally FLAG-tagged p53 was produced by PCR amplification with a pair of primers (forward T7 oligonucleotide, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′; and reverse C-terminal FLAG primer, 5′-TCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTCTGTCT-3′, where the underlined sequence corresponds to the FLAG tag sequence). PCR was carried out by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 47 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min and elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO plasmid using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). C-terminally FLAG-tagged p53 cDNA was excised by EcoRI digestion and cloned into the corresponding site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). C-terminally FLAG-tagged p53 was also subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen). The expression plasmid pVL-p53-FLAG was introduced into Sf21 insect cells using a BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen). The FLAG-p53 protein was purified using an anti-FLAG (M2) immunoaffinity column. The His-tagged HAT domain (amino acids 1195–1673) of the p300 protein (HAT-p300) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(Lys) cells transformed with a bacterial expression vector. The protein was purified from the clarified lysate on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before storage at –80 °C in aliquots. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants of FLAG-tagged p53 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-step PCR technique as described (17Chiu C.M. Tsay Y.-G. Chang C.J. Lee S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39102-39111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mutants were prepared by introducing the desired mutation into overlapping oligonucleotide primers. In the first round of PCR, the mutagenic primer and an outside primer were used to amplify a partial fragment of the region in which the mutation would be created. This mutagenized fragment was then purified and used as a “megaprimer,” together with the second outside primer, in a second round of PCR to amplify the entire region to be subcloned. Conditions for the first round of PCR were 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 47 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Conditions for the second round of PCR were as follows: a denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 46.5 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min and an elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Plasmid pcDNA3 containing FLAG-tagged p53 was used as the template in the PCR. The outside primers used for all of the mutants in this study were as follows: the forward T7 oligonucleotide and SP6 oligonucleotide (5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′). Mutations were introduced into wild-type p53 by two-step PCR mutagenesis with oligonucleotides containing base alterations to convert lysines 305 and 382 to alanine, arginine, or glutamine. The oligonucleotides for the mutants were as follow (where underlined regions correspond to direct amino acid substitutions): FP53-K305R, 5′-AGGGAGCACTCGGCGAGCACTGC-3′; RP53-K305R, 5′-GCAGTGCTCGCCGAGYGCTCCCT-3′; FP53-K305A, 5′-AGGGAGCACTGCGCGAGCACTGC-3′; RP53-K305A, 5′-GCAGTGCTCGCGCAGTGCTCCCT-3′; FP53-K305Q, 5′-CCCCCAGGGAGCACTCAGCGAGCACTGCCCAAC-3′; RP53-K305Q, 5′-GTTGGGCAGTGCTCGCTGAGTGCTCCCTGGGGG-3′; FP53-K382R, 5′-CTCCCGCCATAAACGACTCATGT-3′; RP53-K382R, 5′-ACATGAGTCGTTTATGGCGGGAG-3′; FP53-K382A, 5′-CTCCCGCCATAAAGCACTCATGT-3′; RP53-K382A, 5′-ACATGAGTGGTTTATGGCGGGAG-3′; FP53-K382Q, 5′-CCTCCCGCCATAAACAACTCATGTTCAAGACAG-3′; and RP53-K382Q, 5′-CTGTCTTGAACATGAGTTGTTTATGGCGGGAGG-3′. The mutated PCR fragments were cut with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into pcDNA3. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Reporter Assays—H1299 human lung carcinoma cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were seeded in each 100-mm culture dish 12–24 h before transfection. Calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfection was performed as described previously (19Desaintes C. Hallez S. Detremmerie O. Burny A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2155-2161PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was prepared by the Clontech procedure and adjusted to 12 μg/transfection with the pcDNA3 plasmid. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed with two-thirds of the total cell extract as described (17Chiu C.M. Tsay Y.-G. Chang C.J. Lee S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39102-39111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). p50-2, which contains two copies of the p53-binding motif in its promoter region, was used as the p53-responsive CAT reporter plasmid (21Harwood F.G. Frazier M.W. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Houghton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2057-2067PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-μg aliquot of a Rous sarcoma virus/β-galactosidase vector was included as an internal control in all transfections. Quantification of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The β-galactosidase assays (Promega) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. A total of 10 μg of plasmid were used for each experiment. Antibodies—Antisera against acetylated p53 peptides were generated in rabbits using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated acetylated peptides (p53-(300–310), PPGSTK*RALPN, acetylated at Lys-305; and p53-(376–387), STSRHKK*LMFKT, acetylated at Lys-382) (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The antisera from immunized rabbits were affinity-purified successively with non-acetylated and acetylated peptide columns (10Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody DO-1 was obtained from Oncogene Research Products. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was obtained from Sigma. Western Blot and Dot-blot Analyses—To verify the antibody specificity, we used dot-blot analysis as described previously (23Zhou P. Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Patino M.M. Lindquist S. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Equal amount of peptides (20 μg) were spotted onto strips of Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were probed with the purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of cell extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-FLAG, anti-acetyl-Lys-305 (Ab-165), or anti-acetyl-Lys-382 (Ab-166) antibody. In Vitro Acetylation Assay—Acetylation assays were carried out primarily according to published methods (1Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). Four micrograms of recombinant FLAG-p53 were acetylated in vitro by incubation with the indicated amount of HAT-p300 in the presence of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 18 μm [14C]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. 14C-Labeled p53 was detected by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager. In-gel Digestion—The gel piece containing p53 polypeptides was first reduced and pyridylethylated as described previously (16Tsay Y.-G. Wang Y.-H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.-C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Up to 0.2 μg of enzyme (Arg-C or Asp-N (Roche Applied Science)) were added to the dried gel. After overnight incubation, the supernatant was removed, and the gel was extracted twice with an adequate amount of 0.1% formic acid. The supernatant and extracts were combined together and dried in a SpeedVac. The digests were kept at –20 °C and suspended in 0.1% formic acid immediately before use. LC-MS/MS Analysis—Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed using a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced with an ABI 140D HPLC apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 150 × 0.5-mm PE Brownlee C18 column (5-mm particle diameter, 300-Å pore size; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with mobile phases of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.085% formic acid in acetonitrile were used. The peptides were eluted using the acetonitrile gradient and analyzed in a “triple-play” experiment as described (16Tsay Y.-G. Wang Y.-H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.-C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by two runs of LC-MS/MS experiments. In the first analysis, the most abundant ion in a mass spectrum was selected for a collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiment; in the latter analysis, only the ions with m/z values corresponding to the potential acetylated peptides were selected for a CID experiment. The acquired CID spectra were interpreted using a Finnigan MAT software package, SEQUEST Browser, which correlated the tandem mass spectrum with the amino acid sequence of the human p53 protein. Enzyme was not specified in the search parameters, which increased the confidence of identification when the matched peptides had appropriate cleavage sites. A 105.14-Da tag was constitutively assigned to the Cys residue, which was modified with 4-vinylpyridine in these experiments. Those MS/MS scans that matched the peptide sequences with proper cleavage sites were considered significant and also were subjected to manual evaluation to confirm the SEQUEST results. The hypothetical m/z values of peptides used for generation of ion tracing chromatograms were derived using the PEPSTAT algorithm in the SEQUEST package. The EXPLORE program (Finnigan MAT) was used to plot the ion tracings. Determination of p300-mediated in Vitro Acetylation Sites on p53 by LC-MS/MS—In our previous report (16Tsay Y.-G. Wang Y.-H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.-C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we established the SIT method to identify phosphorylated peptides. Here, we set out to test whether the SIT method could be adapted to identify acetylated peptides. Previous studies have demonstrated that p53 can be acetylated by p300 in vitro (5Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed acetylated peptides derived from recombinant FLAG-tagged p53 protein that was acetylated in vitro by p300. Baculovirus-expressed recombinant FLAG-tagged p53 was immobilized on antibody M2-agarose beads and served as the substrate for the in vitro acetylation reactions. Various amounts of the HAT domain from the p300 acetyltransferase (HAT-p300) were incubated with a fixed amount of FLAG-p53 in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1A). After in vitro acetylation, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1B). FLAG-tagged p53 was acetylated by the enzyme in a dose-dependent fashion. Quantitative determination of the autoradiogram showed that the acetylation was not saturated. Acetylated p53 resolved on the gel was excised and divided into two portions. One was treated with Arg-C, and the other was digested with Asp-N. An aliquot of each digested peptide mixture was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The raw data were then interpreted using the SEQUEST software with the optional addition of 44 Da to the Lys residues. This analysis yielded 15 Arg-C peptides and 6 Asp-N peptides (Table I). These two peptide groups were estimated to account for 87% (350/401) of the amino acid residues of FLAG-p53 and 95% (21/22) of the lysine residues (Fig. 2A). Two acetylated residues were found directly using the SEQUEST software, Lys-373 and Lys-381/382. Subsequently, we used the SIT approach to examine all of these peptides, and their putative acetylated analogs were chromatographed. We found that three Arg-C peptides and one Asp-N peptide were probably acetylated (Table I).Table ICharacteristics of acetylated residues of the p53 proteinPeptide positionsSequencePresence of acetyl group1-20aAsp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.MEEPQSDPSV PPLSQETFS-21-41aAsp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.DLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDI-184-206aAsp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.DSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYL-207-227aAsp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.DDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGS-339-351aAsp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.EMFRELNEALELK-352-370aAsp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.KDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLK+76-110bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.MPEAAPPYAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTYQGSYGFR-111-132bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.LGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNK-140-156bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.TCPVQLWVDST PPPGTR-159-175bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.AMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRR-181-196bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.CSDSDGLAPPQHLIR-197-209bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.VEGNLRVEYLDDR-249-267bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.RP ILTIITLEDSSGNLL GR-268-280bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.NSFEVRVCACPGR-281-290bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.DRRTEEENLR-291-306bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.KKGEPHHELPPGSTKR+307-333bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.ALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIR-334-342bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.GRERFEMFR-343-363bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.ELNEALEL KDAQAGKEPGGSR-364-379bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.AHSSHLK SKKGQSTSR+380-401bArg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.H KKLMFKTEGPDSDDYKDDDD+a Asp-N-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS.b Arg-C-digested peptide positions analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Open table in a new tab In particular, we found that the triply charged, unmodified peptide-(291–306) with m/z 600.4 had a retention time of 35.66 min in our analysis (Fig. 2B). The +3 ion tracing for the singly acetylated peptide has multiple peaks migrating closely with the unmodified peaks (Fig. 2B , middle panel). To determine whether these contained the acetylated peptide ions, the +4 ion tracing was also chromatographed (Fig. 2B , lower panel). The results reveal that there were two major peaks (at 35.6 and 39.8 min) that were commonly seen in the two tracings. On the other hand, many signals found between 50∼60 min in the +3 ion tracing were not observed in the +4 ion tracing. This is consistent with the notion that these peaks contain ions that may have different molecular masses but that have similar m/z values compared with the triply charged peptide-(291–306). Also, based on their relative abundances, these lysine residues appeared to be modified at a lower efficiency (Fig. 2B). The CID spectrum of the 615 m/z ion in the peak at 35.6 min was acquired for identification of the acetylation sites (Fig. 2C). The presence of y4 and y5 ions argues against the possibility that Lys-305 is acetylated, whereas the masses of the b9 and b10 ions indicate that the acetyl group is on the lysine residue at the N-terminal end. The observation of a y15 ion indicates that Lys-292 is the acetylated residue. The CID spectrum of the 615 m/z ion in the peak at 39.8 min is shown in Fig. 2D. The observation of b7–b12 ions indicates that the acetyl group is on the C-terminal three amino acids. Lys-305 is presumably the acetylation target base on the m/z values of the y1 and y2 ions. This assumption is further supported by the fact that it is the only acetylatable residue in the region. Therefore, we identified two distinct acetylation sites, Lys-292 and Lys-305, in this particular peptide. Subsequently, we used the SIT approach to analyze peptide-(354–379) and peptide-(380–401). Both peptides could take up as much as two acetyl groups. The three sets of Arg-C peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis, which was carried out in a mass-specific mode such that the necessary tandem mass spectra were acquired. The tandem mass spectrum of the peptide-(380–401) ion indicated that the acetylation group could be located at either Lys-381 or Lys-382. Additionally, double acetylation at Lys-381 and Lys-382 was also observed (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the previous finding that both Lys-381 and Lys-382 are acetylated. Although the SEQUEST analysis revealed that peptide-(354–379) could be singly acetylated, this region could incorporate as many as two acetyl groups based on SIT analysis. Nevertheless, our current data could not pinpoint the exact modified residues in the four-amino acid stretch from Lys-370 to Lys-373. Thus, p53 could be in vitro acetylated by p300 at lysines 370, 372, and 373 as well as lysines 382 and 383. Moreover, novel p53 sites of acetylation by p300 were also found at lysines 292 and 305. Detection of in Vitro Acetylated p53 by Antibodies Specific to Acetyl-Lys-305 and Acetyl-Lys-382 of p53—The rabbit antibodies raised against Lys-305 (Ab-165) and Lys-382 (Ab-166) were purified by peptide affinity chromatography. The specificity of the purified antibodies was verified by dot-blot analysis (Fig. 3A). We found that Ab-165 specifically recognized acetylated peptide-(300–310) (Ac-K305), but it did not recognize acetylated peptide-(376–387) (Ac-K382) or an acetylated peptide from the HMG-14 peptide (Ac-HMG) (Fig. 3A , upper panel). Likewise, Ab-166 recognized only acetylated peptide-(376–387), but not acetylated peptide-(300–310) or the acetylated HMG-14 peptide (Fig. 3A , lower panel). We next tested whether these antibodies can recognize full-length p53 acetylated by p300 in vitro (Fig. 3B). After in vitro acetylation, recombinant FLAG-p53 was analyzed by immunoblotting using Ab-165 and Ab-166. The amount of p53 used for each reaction was about the same (Fig. 3B , lower panel). Ab-165 recognized p53 that was acetylated in the presence of p300 and acetyl-CoA. The acetylated signals increased proportionately to the p300 amounts in the reaction (Fig. 3B , upper panel). Similarly, Ab-166 specifically recognized acetylated (but not non-acetylated) p53 (Fig. 3B , middle panel). Ab-165 and Ab-166 did not recognize p53 in the absence of acetyl-CoA or p300 in the acetylation reactions (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Ab-165 and Ab-166 specifically recognized acetylated p53. Together with the fact that Ab-165 specifically recognized acetylated Lys-305, these data further corroborate the conclusion that Lys-305 is indeed acetylated in vitro by p300 in a dose-dependent fashion. Lys-305 Is Acetylated by p300 in Vivo—To address whether Lys-305 of p53 might be acetylated in vivo, we performed an in vivo acetylation assay that previously identified Lys-382 as an acetylation target. H1299 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing C-terminal p53 (Fig. 4). Without further treatment, no acetylated signal was detected on the Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Upon addition of sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, acetylation at Lys-305 as well as at Lys-382 was detected (Fig. 4). Overexpression of hemagglutinin-tagged p300 also enhanced acetylation at Lys-305, similar to Lys-382. This enhancement was correlated with the hemagglutinin-p300 leve"
https://openalex.org/W2167832336,"The Photosystem I (PS I) reaction center contains two branches of nearly symmetric cofactors bound to the PsaA and PsaB heterodimer. From the x-ray crystal structure it is known that Trp697PsaA and Trp677PsaB are π-stacked with the head group of the phylloquinones and are H-bonded to Ser692PsaA and Ser672PsaB, whereas Arg694PsaA and Arg674PsaB are involved in a H-bonded network of side groups that connects the binding environments of the phylloquinones and FX. The mutants W697FPsaA, W677FPsaB, S692CPsaA, S672CPsaB, R694APsaA, and R674APsaB were constructed and characterized. All mutants grew photoautotrophically, yet all showed diminished growth rates compared with the wild-type, especially at higher light intensities. EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies at both room temperature and in frozen solution showed that the PsaB mutants were virtually identical to the wild-type, whereas significant effects were observed in the PsaA mutants. Spin polarized transient EPR spectra of the P700+A1– radical pair show that none of the mutations causes a significant change in the orientation of the measured phylloquinone. Pulsed ENDOR spectra reveal that the W697FPsaA mutation leads to about a 5% increase in the hyperfine coupling of the methyl group on the phylloquinone ring, whereas the S692CPsaA mutation causes a similar decrease in this coupling. The changes in the methyl hyperfine coupling are also reflected in the transient EPR spectra of P700+A1– and the CW EPR spectra of photoaccumulated A1–. We conclude that: (i) the transient EPR spectra at room temperature are predominantly from radical pairs in the PsaA branch of cofactors; (ii) at low temperature the electron cycle involving P700 and A1 similarly occurs along the PsaA branch of cofactors; and (iii) mutation of amino acids in close contact with the PsaA side quinone leads to changes in the spin density distribution of the reduced quinone observed by EPR.

Photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction centers; PS, photosystem; CW, continuous wave, EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis (hydroxymethylethyl]glycine; Chl, chlorophyll; phylloquinone, 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or 2-methyl-3-(3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecenyl)-1,4-naphthalenedione. are classified into two general types depending on the identity and function of the terminal electron acceptors. Those RCs that incorporate iron-sulfur clusters are classified as “Type I,” and those that incorporate a mobile (secondary) quinone are classified as “Type II.” Type I RCs include Photosystem I (PS I) of cyanobacteria and plants and those in heliobacteria and green sulfur bacteria. Type II RCs include Photosystem II of cyanobacteria and plants and those in green non-sulfur bacteria and purple bacteria. Despite the difference in the identity of the terminal electron acceptors, Type I and Type II RCs share a common motif in terms of polypeptide arrangement and cofactor composition (1Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Fromme P. Krauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The primary cofactors are bound to proteins that are present as dimers in the membrane. This results in a set of electron transfer cofactors that are arranged (pseudo)symmetrically (2Fromme P. Singhal G.S.R.G. Sopory S.K. Irrgang K.D. Govindjee Concepts in Photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis. Narosa Publishing House, New Delhi, India1999: 181-220Crossref Google Scholar). In PS I, these cofactors include a special pair of chlorophyll a/a′ molecules as the primary donor, two bridging chlorophyll a molecules, and two chlorophyll a molecules, at least one of which functions as the primary acceptor (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauß N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). In the purple bacterial reaction center, the cofactors include a special pair of bacteriochlorophyll a molecules as the primary donor, two bridging bacteriochlorophyll a molecules, and two pheophytin molecules, one of which functions as the primary acceptor (4Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). PS I and the purple bacterial reaction center contain two quinones; in the latter, one quinone is rather immobile (QA) and the other is mobile (QB), whereas in PS I both quinones (QK-A and QK-B) are, to the best of our knowledge, immobile in their normal function. In Type II reaction centers, a single turnover results in the reduction of QB, to a semiquinone and a second turnover results in the further reduction (and protonation) of QB to a hydroquinone. The stability of QB– requires that there is no recombination pathway; hence, there is also no direct forward pathway to QB. The hydroquinone in the QB site is loosely bound and is replaced by an oxidized quinone, thereby recharging the site for a new round of light-induced turnover. In PS I, a single turnover results in the reduction of the quinone to a semiquinone; the electron is then passed to FX, an interpolypeptide iron-sulfur cluster that serves to vector the electron to ferredoxin (with the participation of two additional iron-sulfur clusters, termed FA and FB, bound within the stromal subunit PsaC). As a result, there is only the need for a one-electron reduction of a single quinone to the semiquinone state. In PS I there is no a priori reason that electron transfer must be either uni- or bidirectional because there is no obvious need to accumulate two electrons in a QB-type quinone as in the bacterial reaction center. Indeed, the simpler requirement that only a single electron needs to be passed to the iron-sulfur cluster FX implies that there may be no preferred pathway for the electron. Thus, a bidirectional pathway of electron transfer is possible. Alternately, the 2.5-Å electron density map of PS I indicates that there are subtle differences between the two branches, starting with the primary donor P700, which the x-ray structure reveals to be a Chl a/Chl a′ heterodimer. In addition, there are differences in the distances, orientations, and environments of the cofactors along both branches. Because rates of electron transfer are sensitive to such factors, the probability that both branches are exactly equivalent is miniscule. Thus, a unidirectional pathway of electron transfer is equally possible. Spectroscopic indicators do not provide any conclusive evidence for directional electron transfer in native PS I because the two branches cannot be distinguished, unlike the case with bacterial reaction centers, in which the two pheophytins on the L and M sides have different optical spectra. Mutagenesis provides a technique by which the two branches can be rendered distinguishable by introduction of a specific modification into only one branch of cofactors. However, there are a number of important criteria that must be met if this method is to be used successfully. First, the changes induced by the mutations should be sufficiently subtle that the cell should still be able to grow. Second, the changes should be localized to the immediate vicinity of the electron transfer cofactors. This is necessary because otherwise, any correlation between spectroscopic changes and electron transfer along a given branch may be lost. Third, the mutations should not disturb the overall structure and function of the primary charge separation. For example, a mutation that inadvertently alters the directionality of electron transfer cannot be used to infer this behavior in wild-type PS I. Last, the mutations should produce changes that are readily characterized using spectroscopic techniques. These considerations led us to approach the problem of distinguishing between the two potential pathways by introducing site-directed mutations in and around the QK-A and QK-B binding sites on the PsaA and PsaB reaction center proteins in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy of A1– and P700+A1– have yielded considerable details about the local environment of the quinone as well as information about electron transfer kinetics. These studies indicate asymmetric H-bonding to the phylloquinone, with a dominant H-bond to the oxygen meta to the methyl group (see Refs. 5Kamlowski A. Altenberg-Greulich B. van der Est A. Zech S.G.

Both the π-stacked Trp and one H-bond that occurs between the backbone amide from Leu722PsaA and Leu706PsaB, and the carbonyl of phylloquinone meta to the methyl group, along with the absence of a significant H-bond to the other carbonyl ortho to the methyl group, have been confirmed in the 2.5-Å PS I structure (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauß N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Combined with optical studies of the electron transfer kinetics, a very detailed picture of the influence of the mutations on structure and function can be constructed, which is a prerequisite to uncovering the electron transfer pathway in the wild-type. In this paper, we present physiological and EPR/ENDOR spectroscopic characterization of the following mutants: W697FPsaA, W677FPsaB, S692CPsaA, S672CPsaB, R694APsaA, and R674APsaB. These amino acids were chosen because they may constitute a potential electron transfer pathway between A0 and FX (Fig. 1). In a companion paper (24Xu W. Chitnis P.R. Valieva A. van der Est A. Brettel K. Guergova-Kuras M. Pushkar J. Zech S.G. Stehlik D. Shen G. Zybailov B. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol.

The results presented here are aimed at gaining an understanding of the physiological and structural changes induced by the mutations. The importance of a detailed characterization is highlighted by the fact that a number of recent papers addressing the issue of directionality in various mutants and PS I preparations using a variety of spectroscopic techniques (12Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Joliot P. Joliot A.

Acta. 2001; 1507: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar for a summary) have reported conflicting evidence compatible with both unidirectional and bidirectional electron transfer. In most of these studies, the directionality is inferred from either optical or EPR/ENDOR spectroscopic properties of modified PS I complexes but little attention has been paid to direct comparison of optical and EPR/ENDOR data on the same samples and to ensuring that the modifications do not alter the structure or function of the quinone. A careful characterization of the environment of the mutation is a necessary prerequisite to drawing conclusions about the function of the wild type from the function of the mutants. We show here that the mutations described above lead to only subtle changes in the quinone environment and have no perceptible effect on P700. Thus, they are ideally suited to the study of the directionality of electron transfer. Moreover, the specific changes in the spectra can be explained satisfactorily in terms of expected changes in the electronic environment of the quinone. Together, the combined results from six different mutants and several spectroscopic techniques clearly indicate that the quinone detected by CW EPR, transient EPR and ENDOR is located on the PsaA branch of cofactors. Generation of the PsaA and PsaB Point Mutants—For site-directed mutagenesis of the psaA and psaB genes, two recipient strains were constructed with deletion of a portion of the psaA gene or deletion of the whole psaB gene. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 pWX3 recipient strain was constructed through deletion of the EagI-EcoRI fragment that contains the 1130-bp 3′ part of the psaA gene and the whole psaB gene, and replacement with a spectinomycin-resistance cartridge gene. The Synechocycstis sp. PCC 6803 pCRTΔB recipient strain was obtained through deletion of the HindIII-EcoRI fragment that contains the 3′ half of the psaB gene and replacement with a 1.3-kilobase pair kanamycin-resistance cartridge gene. As shown in Fig. 2B, two plasmids pGEM-3C+ and pIBC were constructed as the templates for PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis. To generate mutations in the Qk-B binding site, the plasmid pGEM-3C+ was constructed through cloning of a 1588-bp segment of the psaB 3′ region and the 760-bp region downstream of the psaB into the pGEM7z vector. A chloramphenicol resistance gene was inserted at the EcoRI site just downstream of the psaB gene. To generate mutations in the Qk-A binding site, the pIBC plasmid was constructed through cloning of a DNA fragment that contained most of the psaA gene, the psaB gene, and a 760-bp downstream region of the psaB gene into a pBluescript II KS vector. A chloramphenicol-resistant cassette gene was inserted after the 3′ terminator of the psaB gene. PCR mutagenesis was carried out using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc). The constructs with specific mutations in the psaA gene were generated through PCR mutagenesis using the pIBC plasmid DNA as the template and appropriate primers for W697FPsaA, R694APsaA, and S692CPsaA. The constructs with specific mutations in the psaB gene were generated through PCR mutagenesis using the pGEM-3C+ plasmid DNA as the template and appropriate primers for W677FPsaB, R674APsaB, and S672CPsaB. All mutation sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids with the desired psaA mutations derived from pIBC were used to transform the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 recipient strain pWX3. The plasmids with the desired psaB mutations derived from pGEM-3C+ were used to transform the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 recipient strain pCRTΔB. Transformants with chloramphenicol resistance were selected under low light intensities. To verify the full segregation of the transformants, DNA fragments containing the mutation sites were amplified through PCR from the genomic DNA of the mutant strains and sequenced to confirm the desired nucleotide change. Physiological and Biochemical Characterization—The Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild-type and mutant strains were cultured in BG-11 medium with 5 mm glucose under lower light intensities. To start a growth experiment, cells of actively growing cultures were centrifuged at 4000 × g and the pellet was suspended in BG-11 medium. The centrifugation-resuspension procedure was repeated three times to separate the glucose from the cells. Cultures were shaken constantly at 120 rpm under different light intensities at 30 °C with (photomixotrophic) or without (photoautotrophic) glucose. Growth rates of the liquid cultures were monitored by the absorbance at 730 nm (A 730). Quantitation of chlorophyll content, preparation of thylakoid membranes, and isolation of PS I particles were carried out according to previously published procedures (17Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K.

Light-driven PS I-mediated electron transport from 3,6-diaminodurene to methyl viologen was monitored using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech, Norfolk, United Kingdom). PS I activity was also determined with a NADP+ photoreduction assay using cytochrome c 6 and ferredoxin as electron donor and acceptor, respectively. PS II activity was measured as light-driven oxygen evolution, in which electrons are transferred from water to p-benzoquinone. The polypeptide composition of PS I complexes in the wild-type and mutant strains was examined by analytical SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Immunoblots were probed with antisera against PsaB and PsaL from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and PsaC from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. For chemiluminescence immunodetection, the ECL Western blotting detection method was used (Amersham Biosciences). Q-band CW EPR of Photoaccumulated PS I Complexes—Photoaccumulation experiments were performed using a Bruker ER300E spectrometer and an ER 5106-QT resonator equipped with an opening for in-cavity illumination similar to that described in Ref. 12Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar. Low temperatures were maintained with an ER4118CV liquid nitrogen cryostat and an ER4121 temperature controller. The microwave frequency was measured with a Hewlett-Packard 5352B frequency counter, and the magnetic field was measured with a Bruker ER035M NMR gaussmeter. The pH of sample was adjusted to 10.0 with 1.0 m glycine buffer, and sodium dithionite was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. After incubation for 10 min in the dark, the sample was placed into the resonator and the temperature was adjusted to 205 K. The sample was illuminated at 630 nm for 40 min using a 20 mW He-Ne laser. A dark background spectrum was subtracted from the experimental spectrum. EPR spectral simulations were carried out on a dual 1 GHz Power Macintosh G4 computer using a Windows 3.1 emulator (SoftWindows, FWB Software Inc., Redwood Shores, CA) and SimFonia software (Bruker Analytik GMBH). Variable Temperature X-band, Q-band, and W-band Transient EPR—The low temperature X-band (9 GHz) transient EPR experiments were carried out on a laboratory built spectrometer using a Bruker ER046 XK-T microwave bridge equipped with an ER-4118X-MD-5W1 dielectric ring resonator and an Oxford CF935 helium gas-flow cryostat (18van der Est A. Hager-Braun C. Leibl W. Hauska G. Stehlik D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The loaded Q-value for this dielectric ring resonator was about Q = 3000, equivalent to a rise time of τr = Q/(2π × νmw) ≈ 50 ns. Q-band (35 GHz) transient EPR spectra of the samples were also measured with the same set-up except that a Bruker ER 056 QMV microwave bridge equipped with a home-built cylindrical resonator was used. All samples contained 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 μm phenazine methosulfate as external redox agents and were frozen in the dark. The samples were illuminated using a Spectra Physics Nd-YAG/MOPO laser system operating at 10 Hz. The low temperature X-band experiments on the R694APsaA and R674APsaB mutants were carried out using the set-up described below for room temperature measurements except that the sample was placed in a quartz tube and a liquid nitrogen cryostat was used to control the temperature. W-band (95 GHz) transient EPR spectra were measured using a Bruker E680 spectrometer. Illumination was accomplished with a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser using an optical fiber fed into the sample capillary and ending directly above the PS I sample. Room Temperature Transient EPR measurements—Room temperature X-band experiments were performed using a modified Bruker ESP 200 spectrometer equipped with a home-built, broadband amplifier (bandwidth >500 MHz). A flat cell and a rectangular resonator were used and the samples were illuminated using a Q-switched, frequency-doubled Continuum Surelite Nd-YAG laser at 532 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. To mediate cyclic electron transfer, 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 μm phenazine methosulfate were added. Pulsed ENDOR Studies of the P 700+ A 1– State—Pulsed ENDOR experiments on the radical pair P700+A1– were performed using a Bruker ESP 380E X-band FT-EPR spectrometer using a ESP360D-P ENDOR accessory, an ER4118X-MD-5W1-EN ENDOR resonator, and an ENI A500 radiofrequency amplifier. The Davies-ENDOR pulse sequence (π(microwave) – π(radio frequency) – π/2(microwave) – π(microwave) – echo) was used, with pulse lengths of 128 ns for the two microwave π pulses and 64 ns for a microwave π/2 pulse and 8 μs for the radiofrequency π pulse. The delay time between the laser flash and the first microwave pulse was 800 ns. The ENDOR experiments were carried out at 80 K, and the field position was chosen to provide the most symmetric spectra. See Ref. 19Fursmann C. Teutloff C. Bittl R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 9679-9686Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar for a detailed discussion of the field-dependence of the ENDOR spectra. The light source for the experiments was a Q-switched and frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (Spectra Physics GCR 130) operating at a wavelength of 532 nm with a pulse width of 8 ns (full width at half-height) and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Rationale for the Choice of the Mutant Strains— Fig. 1, top, shows a view (parallel to the membrane plane) of the QK-A region of the PsaA subunit and Fig. 1, bottom, shows the corresponding view of the QK-B region of the PsaB subunit. Examination of this region of the structure reveals a network of contacts between residues extending from Met688PsaA (Met668PsaB), which is the axial ligand to Chl eC-A3 (eC-B3), through QK-A (QK-B) to Gly572PsaB (Gly585PsaA) in the respective FX binding loop, which reaches over from the other subunit of the heterodimer. The backbone of Met688PsaA (Met668PsaB) is H-bonded to Ser692PsaA (Ser672PsaB), which in turn is H-bonded to Trp697PsaA (Trp677PsaB). This Trp is π-stacked with the phylloquinone, which is H-bonded to Leu722PsaA (Leu706PsaB). In turn, the backbone oxygen of Leu722PsaA (Leu706PsaB) is H-bonded to the FX binding loop through Arg694PsaA (Arg674PsaB), which originates from the start of the respective stromal surface helix jk (1Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Fromme P. Krauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and acts as a bridge between the return loop containing Leu722PsaA (Leu706PsaB) and the FX binding loop provided by the other heterodimeric subunit. Note that for this purpose the FX binding loop of PsaB (PsaA) crosses over into the region occupied below the stromal membrane surface by the other subunit PsaA (PsaB) and establishes the intersubunit H-bond between Arg694PsaA (Arg674PsaB) and the backbone oxygen of Gly572PsaB (Gly585PsaA). Additional intraloop contacts stabilize the loop configuration as part of the FX binding site. This continuous set of covalent bonds, ionic contacts, H-bonds, and π–π contacts may constitute a highly favorable electron transfer pathway from A0 through A1 to FX. When inferring functional properties of the wild-type from studies of mutants, it is important to base the conclusions on as many mutants as possible. This is particularly true if it is not known with certainty whether structural changes are induced by the mutations. Immediate candidates for mutation are Trp697PsaA and Trp677PsaB, which are in π-π contact with QK-A and QK-B and are therefore likely to influence the redox properties of the quinones. Because we wanted to restrict the influence of the mutations to the vicinity of the amino acids involved, we chose to make a conservative replacement, changing the Trp to a Phe. As can be seen in Fig. 1, top, a side chain oxygen of Ser692PsaA forms a H-bond with the imidazole nitrogen of Trp697PsaA, which is in π–π contact with QK-A. The hydrogen atom, which is shared between the Ser and Trp residues, is also close to the carbonyl oxygen ortho to the methyl group on the quinone ring. Thus, the quinone may participate to some extent in the H-bonding, although the distances and angles argue against a significant interaction. Rather, the function of the Ser residue is likely to stabilize the Trp in π–π contact with the quinone. Hence, Ser692PsaA and Ser672PsaB were considered further good candidates for mutagenesis. Again, by making a conservative mutation of the Ser to a Cys, we expect only subtle changes in the H-bonding to the neighboring Trp. Fig. 1 also highlights the two symmetry-related residues, Arg694PsaA and Arg674PsaB, which link the A1 and FX binding sites as described above. Thus, Arg694PsaA and Arg674PsaB residues were also considered candidates for mutagenesis. The PsaA- or PsaB-specific mutants W697FPsaA, W677FPsaB, S692CPsaA, S672CPsaB, R694APsaA, and R674APsaB were therefore constructed, because they would be most likely to show an effect on the acceptors involved in the electron transfer pathways. Physiological Characterization of the Mutant Strains—The growth rates of the wild-type and mutant strains were compared at different light intensities under photoautotrophic and photomixotrophic growth conditions (Table I). All mutant strains grew photoautotrophically, yet all displayed reduced growth rates compared with the wild-type. The growth rates of all of the mutant strains were significantly slower at high light intensities (about 250 μmol m–2 s–1) than at low light intensities (about 5 μmol m–2 s–1). In contrast, the growth rate of the wild-type strain was marginally faster at high light intensities than at normal light intensities. Regardless of light intensity, the growth rates of W697FPsaA and W677FPsaB were the most severely impacted of all of the mutant strains; the growth rates of the S692CPsaA, S672CPsaB, R694APsaA, and R674APsaB mutant strains were nearly equivalent. The growth rate of the PsaA side mutant W697FPsaA was slower than the PsaB side mutant W677APsaB, especially under high light intensities.Table IGrowth rate and chlorophyll content of wild-type and mutant strainsStrainsChlorophyll contentaChlorophyll concentration was meas"
https://openalex.org/W2073545125,"The discovery of metal-poor stars (where metal is any element more massive than helium) has enabled astronomers to probe the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. More recently, element abundances in gas inside high-redshift galaxies has been probed through the absorption lines imprinted on the spectra of background quasars, but these have typically yielded measurements of only a few elements. Furthermore, interpretation of these abundances is complicated by the fact that differential incorporation of metals into dust can produce an abundance pattern similar to that expected from nucleosynthesis by massive stars. Here we report the observation of over 25 elements in a galaxy at redshift z = 2.626. With these data, we can examine nucleosynthetic processes independent of the uncertainty arising from depletion. We find that the galaxy was enriched mainly by massive stars (M > 15 solar masses) and propose that it is the progenitor of a massive elliptical galaxy. The detailed abundance patterns suggest that boron is produced through processes that act independently of metallicity, and may require alternative mechanisms for the nucleosynthesis of germanium."

Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Q is most commonly associated with its role in the respiratory chain where it transports electrons from either Complex I or Complex II to Complex III (2Dutton P.L. Ohnishi T. Darrouzet E.

Navas P. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10973-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Additionally, Q functions in the electron transport chains of lysosomal and plasma membranes (4Gille L. Nohl H. Arch. Biochem.

Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Dekker, New York1996: 157-201Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, a high QH2:Q ratio is sensed by ArcB, a transmembrane sensor kinase, that phosphorylates ArcA, activating operons involved in fermentation and repressing those involved in respiration (7Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, dietary Q produces a shortened life span (8Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Science. 2002; 295: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been attributed to the generation of superoxide by Q·¯ (the Q semiquinone radical) generated during respiratory electron transport (9Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F.

In humans, Q supplementation has been shown to be effective in treating patients with specific respiratory chain defects (10Geromel V. Darin N. Chretien D. Benit P. DeLonlay P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms (11Shults C.W. Oakes D. Kieburtz K. Beal M.F.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce Q6, which has six isoprene units, whereas E. coli synthesize Q8, and humans synthesize Q10. Eight COQ genes have been identified to be required for Q synthesis in S. cerevisiae (13Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: Molecular Mechanisms in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 185-208Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the pathway for Q biosynthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In yeast, mutation in any of the eight COQ genes results in cells that cannot synthesize Q and fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. Yeast coq3–coq8 mutants each accumulate the same early intermediate in Q biosynthesis, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (Fig. 1, HHB or compound 1) (15Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F.

Transformation of coq6 mutant strains with a plasmid bearing wild type COQ6 restores Q biosynthesis and growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. In contrast to a previous report (16Fiori A. Bianchi M.M. Fabiani L. Falcone C. Francisci S. Palleschi C. Solimando N. Uccelletti D. Frontali L. Yeast. 2000; 16: 377-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we find COQ6 to be a nonessential gene. Here we show the Coq6 polypeptide is imported into mitochondria and is peripherally associated with the inner membrane on the matrix side. Based on sequence analysis and alignment with other known hydroxylases, the proposed function of Coq6 polypeptide is that of a flavin-dependent monooxygenase required for one or more steps in Q biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Media—The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Growth media for yeast were prepared as described (17Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Open table in a new tab Cloning of the COQ6 Gene—The haploid strain SR128-3C containing the coq6-1 allele was obtained from mating C128 and FY250 (Table I). SR128-3C yeast were grown to early-log phase in YPD medium and transformed (20Marbois B.N. Hsu A. Pillai R. Colicelli J. Clarke C.F. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with the YCp50 centromeric plasmid library of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (21Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) containing the URA3 gene as a selectable marker. Transformants were selected on SD–Ura plates and after a 3-day incubation at 30 °C were replica-plated onto YPG plates to test for respiratory growth. Putative Q prototrophic transformants, able to grow on medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source, were further purified and tested for co-segregation of uracil prototrophy and respiration competency following vegetative growth in rich medium. Such co-segregation was observed in two transformants, indicating that these traits were plasmid-linked. Yeast plasmid DNA was recovered from one transformant (494SR) and was amplified in DH5α E. coli (Invitrogen). The plasmid p494SR contained an insert of 4.1-kb and transformation of SR128-3C with p494SR restored growth on YPG medium. A similar cloning procedure was also performed with a multicopy expression library prepared from yeast genomic DNA in the vector YEp24 (22Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and resulted in the isolation of pG63/T1, which was found to contain a 2.8-kb segment of DNA that overlapped with the insert present in p494SR (Fig. 2). Seven other rescuing yeast genomic DNA clones were similarly isolated from a recombinant pUV1-based plasmid library (generous gift of Junichi Nikawa and Michael Wigler, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Southern analysis showed that all of the clones contained overlapping DNA fragments (data not shown).Fig. 2Restriction map of isolated yeast genomic DNA containing the COQ6 gene and strategy of COQ6 deletion. The gray bars indicate the positions of the GND2 and COQ6 genes present on p494SR. Each of the plasmids depicted was able to restore growth of coq6 yeast mutant strains on YPG plate medium as identified by the + sign. A deletion construct was prepared by replacing a 414-bp BglII fragment (black bar) with the HIS3 gene on a BamHI fragment, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Restriction sites are symbolized by either one or two letters and correspond to the following DNA restriction enzymes: B, BglII; H, HindIII; RI, EcoRI; RV, EcoRV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subcloning and Disruption of the COQ6 Gene—A 3.8-kb HindIII fragment was isolated from p494SR and was ligated to the HindIII site of pRS316 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pSR1-1. The insert of pSR1-1 was sequenced and found to contain two ORFs located on a segment of chromosome VII. Only one ORF, YGR255C, was also present on pG63/T1, and was designated COQ6 (deposited in GenBank™ with accession number AF003698).To construct a disruption allele of COQ6, a 2.9-kb HindIII fragment, containing about 350 bp of the YEp24 sequence and 2.55 kb of yeast genomic DNA, was excised from pG63/T1 and inserted into the HindIII site of YEp352 to generate the plasmid pG63/ST2. As shown in Fig. 2, the coq6 deletion plasmid was constructed by replacing a 414-bp BglII fragment in pG63/ST2 with a 1.7-kb BamHI fragment containing HIS3 (24Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pG63/ST3 was used to obtain a 4.0-kb EcoRI fragment with the disrupted gene. W303-1A, W303-1B, and SR128-3C were each transformed with 1 μg of DNA (25Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the histidine prototrophic clones issued from the transformations were respiration-defective and were complemented by the ρ° test strains JM6 or JM8 but not by the coq6-1 mutant strains, implying a genetic linkage between the coq6Δ::HIS3 and the coq6-1 alleles. Nuclear DNA from three independent transformants (one from each of the three separate parental strains) was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV, separated on 1% agarose, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The probe, a 1.1-kb EcoRI/EcoRV fragment within the COQ6 ORF, recognizes a 1.1-kb fragment in the genomic DNA of the parental strain. The genomic DNA of the mutant strains (W303ΔCOQ6-1, αW303ΔCOQ6-1, and SRΔCOQ6-1) contained a larger hybridizing species at ∼3.15 kb, as expected for the disrupted allele. To verify the allelism between coq6Δ and coq6-1 mutations, SRΔCOQ6-1 was mated to wild type strain W303-1A to form diploid cells, which were then sporulated to produce meiotic progeny. Spores from 14 tetrads showed 2:2 segregation for respiration competence and histidine auxotrophy. In all cases, the spores competent to grow on glycerol medium were histidine auxotrophs, whereas the spores unable to grow on glycerol were histidine prototrophs, confirming the allelism between the cloned COQ6 gene and the original coq6-1 mutation.Complete Deletion of the COQ6 ORF—A complete deletion of the COQ6 open reading frame was performed with a PCR-targeting strategy (26Baudin A Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). A 1.53-kb fragment containing LEU2 was generated from the YEp13 vector (GenBank™ accession number U03498) using forward primer pPG6DLF 5′-ATAATTCTTAAAAGTGGAGCTAGTCTATTTCTATTTACATACCTCATTTTGTAATTTCGTGTCG-3′ and reverse primer pPG6DLR 5′-TCAAATTGGTCTTTCAGTGAACCTTGTATCGATTGACACAGAGGCAGAGGTCGCCTGACGCATA-3′. The 5′ end of the forward primer contained 45 nucleotides corresponding to –45 to –1 upstream of the COQ6 ORF and at the 3′ end 19 nucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 5579–5597 of YEp13. The reverse primer similarly corresponded to 45 nucleotides from +1485 to +1441 of the reverse strand of the COQ6 ORF followed by 19 residues from 7018 to 7000 of the reverse strand of YEp13. A W303-1AB diploid was created by mating W3031A with W3031B. W3031A, W3031B, CEN.PK2-1C, and W303-1AB cells were transformed with 1 μg of the fragment using the lithium-acetate method as described (27Gietz R. Schiestl R. Willems A. Woods R. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown on SD–Leu plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Gene disruption was verified by PCR using forward primer Coq6SeqF1 5′-ACCTTTGCATTACAAGTGCAACGCTCTACC-3′ and reverse primer Coq6SeqR1 5′-GGTGACGCGTGTATCCGCCCGCTCTTTTGG-3′ and produced a product of 1.84-kb for both the wild type and disrupted strains. The PCR product was then digested using the restriction enzyme EcoRI, which digests the wild type product and produces two products of 0.44 and 1.4 kb, whereas the EcoRI digestion fragments of the disrupted product are 1.2 and 0.64 kb. Tetrad analysis was performed as described above.In Vivo Radiolabeling of Q 6 Intermediates, Lipid Extraction, and Analysis by HPLC—Yeast strains SR128-3C and W303ΔCOQ6-1 were grown in 1 liter of SDC medium supplemented with 0.65 μCi of 4-[U-14C]hydroxybenzoic acid (365 Ci/mol), synthesized from l-[U-14C]tyrosine by alkali heat fusion (28Clarke C.F.

Cells the were harvested after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm, A 600 nm = 10), and the lipids were extracted as described (29Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were concentrated, the volume was adjusted to 1 ml with hexane, and 0.10-ml aliquots (5.0–12.0 × 103 cpm) were analyzed by normal phase HPLC employing a cyanopropyl column (Zorbax, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Mac-Mod Analytical, Chadds Ford, PA) as described (30Poon W.W.

The column was equilibrated with a mobile phase composed of 98% solvent A (hexane) and 2% solvent B (isopropanol:hexane:water:methylene chloride, 52:41: 5:2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Ten minutes after sample injection, the percentage of solvent B was increased linearly from 2 to 27% in 25 min (35 min from the start) and then from 27 to 100% in 20 min (55 min after the start). In the next 5 min, the percentage of solvent B was decreased linearly from 100 to 2% and remained at 2% for 30 min to equilibrate the column before next sample injection. The radioactivity of 1-ml fractions was measured by scintillation counting in 10 ml of BIOsafe nonaqueous scintillation mixture (Research Products International) with a Beckman scintillation counter (model LS-3133P). The efficiency of 14C detection was 90%.Determination of Q6 Content in Lipid Extracts by HPLC and Electrochemical Detection—Lipid extraction and analysis were performed as described previously (31Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12381-12387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Yeast strains W303-1A, SR128-3C, W303ΔCOQ6-1, and W303ΔCOQ6-1:pSR1-1 (the coq6-null strain harboring a COQ6 containing plasmid) were grown at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm) in 50 ml of YPGal to an A 600 nm of about 4 or alternatively were grown to saturation (2 days). 750 ng of Q9 was added as an internal standard to a yeast cell pellet (100 mg of wet weight), and the cells were lysed by vortexing with 1 g of glass beads in 0.35 ml of water.Mitochondrial Import Assay—An in vitro transcription template plasmid was constructed by inserting the COQ6 ORF into the pRS426 vector downstream of the T7 promoter (32Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The COQ6 ORF with SalI and NotI linkers at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was PCR-amplified with the template pSR1-1, 5′ primer JF3 (5′-ACGCACGCGTCGACATGTTCTTTTCAAAAGTTATGC-3′), and 3′ primer JF4–1 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCTCATTTCTCATTTCCTCC-3′) using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR product was digested with SalI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding SalI and NotI sites in pRS426. The resulting product, pT7Q6, was linearized with XhoI and provided template DNA for in vitro transcription (Promega Ribomax large scale RNA production system). The resulting mRNA was then translated with Promega Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine from Amersham Biosciences (1000 Ci/mmol, at a final concentration of 0.75 μm). Both the mRNA and the 35S-labeled polypeptides were stored at –80 °C. The isolation of mitochondria (from D273-10B/A1) and import reaction conditions were performed according to Yaffe (33Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.A. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cell cultures (1 liter) were grown in semisynthetic lactate medium to saturation density. The spheroplasts were prepared and lysed by Dounce homogenization with a tight fitting pestle as described (19Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were isolated from a linear Nycodenz gradient as described (19Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Each import reaction contained 6 μl of radiolabeled in vitro translated product and isolated mitochondria (200 μg of protein). Following the 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the mitochondria were reisolated and washed once as described (33Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Proteinase K treatment after the import was performed by adding proteinase K at final concentration of 50 μg/ml to resuspended mitochondria. The proteolytic digest was allowed to proceed at 0 °C for 20 min and was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm.Plasmid Construction of HA-tagged COQ6 —Two yeast expression plasmids, one single copy and one multicopy, were constructed to express the Coq6 polypeptide containing a carboxyl-terminal peptide (MYPYDVPDYASLDGPMST) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the influenza HA viral protein, an epitope for the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (35Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Walker L.E. Reisfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The COQ6 ORF region without the stop codon was PCR-amplified using 5′ primer JF3 (5′-ACGCACGCGTCGACATGTTCTTTTCAAAAGTTATGC-3′) and 3′ primer JF4 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAGTTTCTCATTTCCTCCTAATGTG-3′). The PCR product was directionally cloned into the multicopy pADCL vector (SalI and NotI at 5′ and 3′, respectively) (36Spain B.H. Koo D. Ramakrishnan M. Dzudzor B. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), to generate pHA6. pSHA6, a single copy version of COQ6-HA construct, was generated by removing the 3.6-kb transcriptional cassette from pHA6 by BamHI partial digestion and insertion into BamHI site of the vector pRS316 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast cells were transformed with pHA6, pSHA6, or pSR1-1 (25Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for the presence of either the LEU2 (pHA6) or URA3 (pSHA6) gene on SD–Leu or SD–Ura plate media. Colonies obtained on the respective plate medium were subsequently replica-plated to YPG plate medium.Generation of Antisera against Coq6p—The 1.44-kb COQ6 ORF was PCR-amplified with forward primer pPG6F 5′-GCGGATCCGATGTTCTTTTCAAAAGTTATGCTT-3′ and a reverse primer pPG6R 5′-GCGGATCCTCATTTCTCATTTCCTCCTAATGTG-3′ and Vent DNA polymerase. The product was then digested with BamHI and inserted into PET15b (Novagen) at the BamHI site to generate a fusion protein containing a His6 tag at the amino terminus. The fusion protein was overexpressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) under induction by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and was purified over His-Bind resin (Novagen) and used to generate antiserum in rabbits (Cocalico).Mitochondrial Localization of Coq6p—Yeast cultures (W303-1A) were grown in YPGal to an A 600 nm between 2 and 4, and mitochondria were isolated and purified as described above. Mitoplasts were generated by hypotonic treatment of mitochondria (19Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were suspended in five volumes of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixture was then sedimented in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the intermembrane space components (supernatant) and the mitoplasts (pellet). The mitoplasts were then sonicated and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to generate matrix (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. Alternatively, the mitoplasts were alkaline-extracted by incubating with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to separate the integral membrane components (pellet) from the peripheral membrane and matrix components (supernatant) (37Jarosch E.

Proteinase K protection experiments were carried out as described (38Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by immunoblot.Immunoblot Analysis—The fractions were assayed for protein concentration by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein from the mitochondrial fractions of cells were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% Tris/glycine gels and were subsequently transferred to Hybond ECL Nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot analysis and treatment of membranes for reuse with another antisera were performed as described by Amersham Biosciences. An exception to the stated protocol was the use of washing buffer: 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-Coq6p, 1:500; anti-Coq3p, 1:1000; anti-Coq4p, 1:1000; anti-cytochrome b 2, 1:1000; anti-Hsp60p, 1:10,000; anti-β subunit of F1-ATPase, 1:10,000; anti-cytochrome c 1, 1:1000; anti-OM45p, 1:1000; and anti-Mas2p, 1:1000. Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) were used at a 1:10,000 dilution.RESULTSIsolation and in Situ Disruption of the COQ6 Gene—The original mutant in the coq6 complementation group of yeast mutants (G63) was identified as a Q-deficient nuclear petite strain (13Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respiratory deficiency was ascribed to a defect in Q because addition of exogenous Q2 or Q6 to isolated mitochondria rescued NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity (39Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR128-3C, one of the strains resulting from the cross between C128 (coq6-1) and FY251, had a very low reversion rate and provided the biological tool for cloning the COQ6 gene by screening yeast genomic DNA libraries as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nine respiration-competent transformants were obtained, and the representative plasmid p494SR was studied in detail. A 3.8-kb HindIII fragment was isolated from p494SR and ligated to the HindIII site of pRS316, a centromeric vector, to form pSR1-1 (Fig. 2). Transformation of SR128-3C with pSR1-1 restored growth on media containing glycerol. DNA sequence analysis revealed the insert to contain two complete ORFs, identified as YGR256W (the GND2 gene) and YGR255C. The plasmids pG63/T1 and pG63/ST2 containing the complete YGR255C ORF and only a portion of the GND2 gene, each restored the ability of SR128-3C to grow on YPG (Fig. 2). Expression of the YGR255C ORF as a carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged fusion protein from the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter also rescued YPG growth of SR128-3C.The one-step gene replacement procedure (24Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) was used to obtain strains harboring disrupted alleles of the COQ6 gene (W303ΔCOQ6-1, αW303ΔCOQ6-1, and SRΔCOQ6-1). Analysis of these strains (see “Experimental Procedures"
https://openalex.org/W2093177647,"Benzalacetone synthase (BAS) and chalcone synthase (CHS) are plant-specific type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) that share ∼70% amino acid sequence identity. BAS catalyzes a one-step decarboxylative condensation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to produce a diketide benzalacetone, whereas CHS performs sequential condensations with three malonyl-CoA to generate a tetraketide chalcone. A homology model suggested that BAS has the same overall fold as CHS with cavity volume almost as large as that of CHS. One of the most characteristic features is that Rheum palmatum BAS lacks active site Phe-215; the residues 214LF conserved in type III PKSs are uniquely replaced by IL. Our observation that the BAS I214L/L215F mutant exhibited chalcone-forming activity in a pH-dependent manner supported a hypothesis that the absence of Phe-215 in BAS accounts for the interruption of the polyketide chain elongation at the diketide stage. On the other hand, Phe-215 mutants of Scutellaria baicalensis CHS (L214I/F215L, F215W, F215Y, F215S, F215A, F215H, and F215C) afforded increased levels of truncated products; however, none of them generated benzalacetone. These results confirmed the critical role of Phe-215 in the polyketide formation reactions and provided structural basis for understanding the structure-function relationship of the plant type III PKSs.

BAS is thought to play a crucial role for construction of the C6-C4 moiety of a variety of biologically active phenylbutanoids, including anti-inflammatory glucoside lindleyin (7Borejsza-Wysocki W.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Google Scholar), we reported cloning and heterologous expression of a cDNA encoding BAS from rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), a medicinal plant that produces the pharmaceutically important lindleyin. The cDNA encoded a 42-kDa protein sharing 60–75% amino acid sequence identity with other members of the CHS superfamily enzymes including stilbene synthase (STS) from groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) (8Schöppner A.

The catalytic center of CHS is composed of four amino acid residues: the catalytic triad of Cys-164, His-303, and Asn-336 and the “gatekeeper” Phe-215, absolutely conserved in all of the known type III PKSs. Interestingly, BAS is the only exception that lacks the active site Phe-215; the conserved residues 214LF are uniquely replaced by IL (numbering in M. sativa CHS) (Fig. 3) (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Google Scholar). In CHS, Phe-215, located at the junction between the active site cavity and the CoA binding tunnel, has been proposed to facilitate decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA and help orient substrates and intermediates during the sequential condensation reactions (Fig. 2) (12Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Google Scholar, 18Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Noel J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5319-5324Google Scholar). We proposed a hypothesis that the absence of Phe-215 in BAS may be the reason why the polyketide chain elongation is terminated at the diketide stage and followed by a second decarboxylation reaction to generate benzalacetone. In order to test the hypothesis, a mutant R. palmatum BAS in which the residues 214IL were substituted by LF was constructed. Furthermore, to investigate the structure-function relationship of the type III PKS enzymes, we also carried out functional analysis of a series of Phe-215 mutants of CHS from Scutellaria baicalensis (19Abe I. Morita H. Nomura A. Noguchi H. J. Am. Chem.

The cells harboring the plasmid were cultured to an A600 of 0.6 in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. Then 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression, and the culture was incubated further at 30 °C for 16 h. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. Cell lysis was carried out by the freeze-thaw method and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 60 min. The supernatant was passed through a column of Pro-Bond™ resin (Invitrogen), which contained Ni2+ as an affinity ligand. After washing with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 40 mm imidazole, the recombinant BAS was finally eluted with 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol and 500 mm imidazole. Finally, the enzyme preparation was desalted by Bio-Gel P6DG desalting gel. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Protein Assay; Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Enzyme Reaction—The standard reaction mixture contained 27 μm 4-coumaroyl-CoA, 54 μm malonyl-CoA, and 20 μg of the purified enzyme in a final volume of 500 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. Incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min, and stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 20% HCl. By the acid treatment, naringenin chalcone is thus converted to racemic naringenin through a nonstereospecific ring-C closure. Furthermore, early released triketide and tetraketide intermediate are also converted to lactone derailment products, BNY and CTAL. The products were then extracted with 600 μl of ethyl acetate and concentrated by N2 flow. The residue was dissolved in an aliquot of MeOH containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and separated by reverse-phase HPLC (JASCO 880) on a TSK-gel ODS-80Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm; TOSOH) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Gradient elution was performed with H2O and MeOH, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid: 0–5 min, 30% MeOH; 5–17 min, linear gradient from 30 to 60% MeOH; 17–25 min, 60% MeOH; 25–27 min, linear gradient from 60 to 70% MeOH. Elutions were monitored by a multichannel UV detector (MULTI 340, JASCO) at 290, 330, and 360 nm; UV spectra (198–400 nm) were recorded every 0.4 s.On-line LC-ESIMS spectra were measured with a Hewlett-Packard HPLC 1100 series (Wilmington, DE) coupled to a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) fitted with an electrospray ionization source. HPLC separations were carried out under the same conditions as described above. The electrospray ionization capillary temperature and capillary voltage were 275 °C and 3.0 V, respectively. The tube lens offset was set at 20.0 V. All spectra were obtained in both negative and positive mode over a mass range of m/z 120–350, at a range of one scan every 2 s. The collision gas was helium, and the relative collision energy scale was set at 30.0% (1.5 eV). Enzyme reactions with nonphysiological substrates and analysis of their product were carried out as described before (19Abe I. Morita H. Nomura A. Noguchi H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11242-11243Google Scholar, 21Morita H. Takahashi Y. Noguchi H. Abe I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 190-195Google Scholar, 22Morita H. Noguchi H. Schröder J. Abe I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3759-3766Google Scholar).Enzyme Kinetics—Steady state kinetic parameters were determined by using [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (1.8 mCi/mmol) as a substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate using four concentrations of 4-coumaroyl-CoA (11.0, 5.5, 2.8, and 1.4 μm) in the assay mixture, containing 28 μm malonyl-CoA, 4.4 μg of purified enzyme, 1 mm EDTA, in a final volume of 500 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer. Incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were extracted and separated by HPLC, and the radioactivity in each fraction was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka LSC-3100). The kinetic parameters were calculated for formation of major product of the enzyme reactions at optimum pH, except for those of BAS I214L/L215F mutant, which was measured for formation of naringenin chalcone. Lineweaver-Burk plots of data were employed to derive the apparent Km and kcat values (average of triplicates ± S.D.) using EnzFitter software (BIOSOFT).Three-dimensional Homology Modeling—The model of R. palmatum BAS was produced by the SWISS-MODEL package (available on the World Wide Web at expasy.ch/spdbv/) provided by the Swiss-PDB-Viewer program (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). A standard homology modeling procedure was applied based on the sequence homology of residues 5–384 of R. palmatum BAS and the x-ray crystal structures of CHS superfamily enzymes (63–68% identity) including M. sativa CHS (1BI5A.pdb, 1BQ6A.pdb, 1CGKA.pdb, 1CGZA.pdb, 1CHWA.pdb, 1CHWB.pdb, 1CMLA.pdb), M. sativa CHS C164A mutant (1D6FA.pdb), M. sativa CHS N336A mutant (1D6HA.pdb), M. sativa CHS H303Q mutant (1D6IA.pdb, 1D6IB.pdb), M. sativa CHS G256A mutant (1I86A.pdb), M. sativa CHS G256V mutant (1I88A.pdb, 1I88B.pdb), M. sativa CHS G256L mutant (1I89A.pdb, 1I89B.pdb), M. sativa CHS G256F mutant (1I8BA.pdb, 1I8BB.pdb), M. sativa CHS F215F mutant (1JWXA.pdb), and G. hybrida 2-PS (1EE0A.pdb, 1EE0B.pdb, 1QLVA.pdb, and 1QLVB.pdb). The corresponding Ramachandran plot was also created with Swiss PDB-Viewer software to confirm that the majority of residues grouped in the energetically allowed regions. Calculation of cavity volumes (Connolly's surface volumes) was then performed with the CASTP program (available on the World Wide Web at cast.engr.uic.edu/cast/) (24Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Google Scholar). The cavity volume of BAS was estimated to be 881 Å3, whereas that of M. sativa CHS (1CGKA.pdb) and G. hybrida 2-PS (1EE0A.pdb) were 1019 and 298 Å3, respectively.RESULTSSequence Analysis and Homology Modeling—The primary sequence of R. palmatum BAS exhibits 60–75% identity to those of CHS superfamily enzymes from other plant species including M. sativa CHS (11Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Google Scholar) and G. hybrida 2-PS (25Jez J.M. Austin M.B. Ferrer J. Bowman M.E. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 919-930Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). R. palmatum BAS maintains an almost identical CoA binding site and the catalytic triad of Cys-164, His-303, and Asn-336 (numbering in M. sativa CHS) (Fig. 3). In addition, the active site residues, including Met-137, Gly-211, Gly-216, Ile-254, Gly-256, Ser-338, and Pro-375, along with Phe-265, the second “gatekeeper” phenylalanine (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Google Scholar) of CHS, are well conserved in BAS. One of the most characteristic features is that R. palmatum BAS lacks active site Phe-215 absolutely conserved in all type III PKSs of plant and bacterial origin; the conserved residues 214LF are uniquely replaced by IL (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Google Scholar). In CHS, the hydrophobic Phe-215 located at the interface of active site cavity and the CoA-binding tunnel has been proposed to facilitate malonyl-CoA decarboxylation and help orient substrates and intermediates during the sequential condensation reactions (12Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Google Scholar, 18Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Noel J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5319-5324Google Scholar).In the absence of a crystal structure of BAS, we constructed a homology model based on the sequence identity of residues 5–384 of R. palmatum BAS with those of M. sativa CHS (11Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Google Scholar) and G. hybrida 2-PS (25Jez J.M. Austin M.B. Ferrer J. Bowman M.E. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 919-930Google Scholar), whose x-ray crystal structures were recently reported by Noel and co-workers. In the Ramachandran plot calculated for the model, most amino acid residues group in the energetically allowed regions with only few exceptions, primarily glycine residues that can adopt Φ/Ψ angles in all four quadrants. The homology model predicted that R. palmatum BAS has the same overall fold as M. sativa CHS (Fig. 4), with cavity volume estimated to be 881 Å3, which is almost as large as that of M. sativa CHS (1019 Å3) but much larger than that of G. hybrida 2-PS (298 Å3) (25Jez J.M. Austin M.B. Ferrer J. Bowman M.E. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 919-930Google Scholar). This suggested that the active site cavity of BAS is easily large enough to accommodate the tetraketide chalcone product.Fig. 4Ribbon display (top) along with an enlargement of the active site (bottom) of three-dimensional structure of R. palmatum BAS predicted by Swiss-PDB-Viewer software (A) and crystal structure of M. sativa CHS (1CGKA.pdb) (B). Active site residues Cys-164, Leu-214 (Ile-214), Phe-215 (Leu-215), His-303, and Asn-336 (numbering in CHS) are represented with ball and stick models.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Enzyme Activity of BAS I214L/L215F Mutant—In order to test the hypothesis that the substitution of the conserved 214LF residues by IL in R. palmatum BAS would account for the interruption of the chain extension at the diketide stage, a mutant enzyme in which the residues 214IL were replaced by LF was constructed. The BAS I214L/L215F mutant was heterologously overexpressed in E. coli as a recombinant protein with a His tag at the C terminus as in the case of wild-type BAS, and purified to homogeneity by a nickel-chelate column. As we had expected, BAS I214L/L215F mutant exhibited chalcone-forming activity and performed sequential condensations with three acetate units from malonyl-CoA to produce a tetraketide naringenin chalcone (6Schröder J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 373-378Google Scholar), although the activity was rather weak, and a triketide pyrone, BNY (4Akiyama T. Shibuya M. Liu H.M. Ebizuka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 834-839Google Scholar) was obtained as a major product (Fig. 5B). It was thus confirmed that the residues 214IL are indeed involved in the formation of a diketide benzalacetone and that the polyketide chain elongation was interrupted because of the absence of the active site Phe-215 in BAS.Fig. 5HPLC elution profiles of enzyme reaction products of wild-type BAS (at pH 8.0) (A), BAS I214L/L215F mutant (at pH 6.5) (B), wild-type CHS (at pH 8.0) (C), and CHS L214I/F215L mutant (at pH 7.0) (D). Note that by acid treatment, naringenin chalcone is converted to racemic naringenin through a nonstereospecific ring-C closure. HPLC separation conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interestingly, the chalcone-forming activity of the mutant enzyme was dependent on pH, which was maximum at pH 6.5, whereas at pH 8.0, most of the reactions were terminated at the triketide stage, leading to formation of BNY as a major product along with a trace amount of benzalacetone and CTAL (Fig. 6B). Enzyme kinetics analysis revealed that BAS I214L/L215F mutant showed Km = 33.5 μm and kcat = 0.169 min–1 for 4-coumaroyl-CoA and Km = 46.6 μm and kcat = 0.181 min–1 for malonyl-CoA (chalcone-forming activity at pH 6.5) (Table I), whereas wild-type BAS showed Km = 10.0 μm and kcat = 1.79 min–1 for 4-coumaroyl-CoA and Km = 23.3 μm and kcat = 1.78 min–1 for malonyl-CoA (benzalacetone-forming activity at pH 8.0). The mutant enzyme thus exhibited 36-fold decreases in kcat/Km for 4-coumaroyl-CoA and 20-fold decreases in kcat/Km for malonyl-CoA compared with wild-type BAS.Fig. 6The pH dependence of enzyme activities of wild-type BAS (A), BAS I214L/L215F mutant (B), wild-type CHS (C), and CHS L214I/F215L mutant (D) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) or in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (Tris).BA, benzalacetone; NAR, naringenin chalcone.

Consistent with our previous report (5Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Google Scholar), it was reconfirmed that the formation of benzalacetone was maximum within a range of pH 8.0–8.5; however, interestingly, there was a dramatic change in the product profile under acidic pH. Instead of a diketide benzalacetone, formation of a triketide pyrone was dominant, and BNY was obtained almost as a single product at pH 6.0 (Fig. 6A). This indicated that both wild-type and I214L/L215F mutant BAS performed increased numbers of condensation reactions under acidic conditions.Enzyme Activity of CHS L214I/F215L Mutant—In order to further investigate the structure-function relationship between BAS and CHS enzyme, the conserved active site residues 214LF of S. baicalensis CHS were in turn substituted by IL as in the case of BAS. As a result, the chalcone-forming activity of CHS L214I/F215L mutant was significantly reduced, and BNY was obtained as a major product (Fig. 5D), indicating that most of the chain elongation reactions were terminated at the triketide stage. The BNY forming activity was maximum at pH 7.0, whereas production of tetraketides, chalcone and CTAL, was prominent under acidic conditions within a range of pH 6.0–6.5 (Fig. 6D). In contrast, wild-type S. baicalensis CHS shows maximum chalcone-forming activity at pH 8.0 (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, both wild-type and L214I/F215L mutant CHS did not produce benzalacetone derived from the diketide intermediate, which was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.CHS L214I/F215L mutant showed Km = 23.5 μm and kcat = 0.056 min–1 for 4-coumaroyl-CoA and showed Km = 125 μm and kcat = 0.054 min–1 for malonyl-CoA (BNY-forming activity at pH 7.0) (Table I), whereas wild-type S. baicalensis CHS showed Km = 5.8 μm and kcat = 0.824 min–1 for 4-coumaroyl-CoA and showed Km = 25.5 μm and kcat = 0.862 min–1 for malonyl-CoA (chalcone-forming activity at pH 8.0). The mutant enzyme thus exhibited 60-fold decreases in kcat/Km for 4-coumaroyl-CoA and 77-fold decreases in kcat/Km for malonyl-CoA.Substrate Specificities of BAS I214L/L215F and CHS L214I/F215L Mutant—In previous studies, we have demonstrated that S. baicalensis CHS has remarkably broad substrate specificities toward starter and extension substrate of the polyketide formation reaction (19Abe I. Morita H. Nomura A. Noguchi H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11242-11243Google Scholar, 21Morita H. Takahashi Y. Noguchi H. Abe I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thus, instead of 4-coumaroyl-CoA, the enzyme accepted a variety of starter molecules, both aromatic and aliphatic CoA esters of different chain length including benzoyl-CoA (7Borejsza-Wysocki W. Hrazdina G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 791-799Google Scholar) and hexanoyl-CoA (8Schöppner A. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6806-6811Google Scholar), and efficiently converted to a series of chemically and structurally different unnatural polyketides (Fig. 7C). In contrast, R. palmatum BAS showed rather narrow substrate specificities and did not accept aliphatic CoA esters such as hexanoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, whereas benzoyl-CoA was converted to a triketide pyrone (9Eckermann S.

However, little is known about the mechanism of how apoptosis is executed in mycobacteria-infected macrophages.

This work provides the first elucidation of a signaling pathway in which ASK1 plays a central role in innate immunity. Mycobacterium avium is an intracellular facultative bacterium that proliferates inside host macrophages (1Inderlied C.B. Kemper C.A. Bermudez L.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 266-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 2Frehel C. de Chastellier C. Offredo C. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It causes severe pulmonary and disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts, especially in individuals with AIDS (3Hawkins C.C. Gold J.W. Whimbey E. Kiehn T.E. Brannon P. Cammarata R. Brown A.E. Armstrong D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1986; 105: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The bacterium poses a threat in these individuals particularly in view of the fact that 40–50% of all patients with M. avium infection are refractory to conventional antibiotics and antimycobacterial drugs (4Ellner J.J. Goldberger M.J. Parenti D.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 163: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The innate immune response to mycobacteria is initiated when the bacteria interact with cell surface receptors. This results in subsequent internalization of the mycobacterium within the macrophage. The macrophage represents the first line in innate immune defense against mycobacteria. In macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria, apoptotic death is associated with a reduction in bacillary viability (5Oddo M. Renno T. Attinger A. Bakker T. MacDonald H.R. Meylan P.R.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5448-5454PubMed Google Scholar, 6Molloy A. Laochumroonvorapong P. Kaplan G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 7Fratazzi C. Arbiet R.D.

On the other hand, the success of virulent mycobacteria as pathogens is attributed largely to their ability to survive and multiply within macrophages for extended periods of time. Mycobacteria live and proliferate within phagosomes, which unlike those containing other bacteria, are arrested in their maturation (9Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. J. Exp.

The balance between the pathogen-eliminating mechanisms employed by the macrophage, and the survival pathways used by the mycobacterium determines the fate of the organism. In this context it is of foremost importance to understand the pathways of macrophage cell death upon challenge with mycobacteria and the strategies used by the pathogen to offset cell death and prolong its own survival within macrophages. Apoptosis is an orchestrated suicide program, that among its other functions, enables an organism to remove invading pathogens without causing an inflammatory response. The key morphological alterations of apoptosis are mediated by a family of cysteine proteases called the caspases, which are activated by proteolytic cleavage (14Cohen G.M Biochem.

Activation of caspases is achieved via two principal signaling pathways, namely the extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways (17Li H. Yuan J. Curr. Opin.

One mechanism for this cross-talk is the cleavage of Bid by caspase 8. Bid is a BH3-domain-only member of the Bcl-2 family of death-regulating proteins (34Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain-only family are upstream activators of apoptosis that signal to downstream proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax or Bak leading to their oligomerization at the mitochondria. Activated caspase 8 can cleave p22 Bid to generate a p15 active truncated Bid (t-Bid) fragment, which is then targeted to the mitochondria (35Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

The relationship between the course of mycobacterial infection in vivo and the pro- or anti-apoptotic cell signaling within the host is still unclear. However, in vitro studies suggest that induction of apoptosis in macrophages is the host cell strategy to eliminate the invading pathogen, whereas prevention of programmed cell death can result in the possibility of prolonged intracellular survival of mycobacteria. The organism therefore tries to commandeer the host cell signaling machinery to offset cell death (43Maiti D. Bhattacharyya A. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 329-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of apoptotic cell death in macrophages challenged with mycobacteria are largely unknown, other than reports of apoptotic signaling involving both Fas and TNF receptor (5Oddo M.

Immunol. 1999; 116: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken with the objective of understanding the signaling pathways mediating macrophage apoptosis upon challenge with M. avium. Our results suggest that M. avium-induced apoptosis involves FADD-mediated activation of caspase 8, cleavage of t-Bid, release of cyt c and activation of caspases 9 and 3. Further, we identify the ASK1/p38 signaling pathway as being critical to caspase 8 activation and subsequent M. avium-induced cell death. Reagents—Antibodies against total MAP and phosphospecific kinases, cleaved caspase 3, PARP, and caspase 9 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA. Antibodies against ASK1, cyt c, β-actin, and Bid, and protein A/G (plus)-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-ASK1-specific antibody was a gift from Hidenori Ichijo, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), SB203580, U0126, z-DEVD-FMK, z-LEHD-FMK, z-IETD-FMK, Ac-DEVD-pNA, Ac-LEHD-AFC, Ac-IETD-AFC, and protease inhibitors were from CN Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Culture of the Murine Macrophage-like Cell Line J774A-1—Media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. The murine macrophage cell line J774A-1 was obtained from the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Dishes were washed to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were ≥95% viable as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Growth of M. avium—M. avium (NCTC 8562) was obtained from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi), grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OADC) supplement and 0.04% Tween 80 until mid-log phase, harvested, washed, and resuspended in a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.04% (v/v) Tween 80. The suspension was briefly sonicated until no bacterial clumps were visualized by microscopy. The preparation was diluted to a concentration of 2 × 108 CFU/ml in 10% glycerol and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Freshly thawed aliquots were used no more than once. Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfections—HA-tagged wild-type ASK1 (ASK1, WT) and a catalytically inactive mutant (K709M) of ASK1 (ASK1, KM) were obtained from Hidenori Ichijo. FLAG-tagged p8 MAPK and its dominant-negative mutant (p38 (agf)) were obtained from Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, and dominant-negative FADD (FADD (dn)) was from Claudius Vincenz, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 2 × 106 cells were plated in each well of 6-well plates, and cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid (empty vectors or recombinants) using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase reporter plasmid was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Infection and Preparation of Cell Lysates—J774A-1 cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 × 105 cells per well and were infected with M. avium at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 or as stated under the legends to figures. Cells were lysed with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the lysate was diluted and plated on Middlebrook 7H10 agar to quantitate the number of viable intracellular bacteria. The incubation of J774–1 with M. avium at a bacteria/macrophage ratio of 10:1 for 6 h led to infection of 50% of the cells. The viability of the control monolayers was monitored during the experiments by the trypan blue exclusion method. The viability was ≥95% in all the experiments described. After incubation with M. avium, the wells were washed with ice-cold PBS to remove free bacteria. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% v/v glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 4 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4 1 mm pefabloc, 1 mm benzamidine) on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min after the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Where necessary, J774A-1 cells were first treated with pharmacological inhibitors or vehicle (Me2SO) alone, prior to incubation with M. avium. When performing Western blotting for detection of caspases, 6 × 106 cells were pelleted and freeze-thawed thrice in 20 μl of cell extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pefabloc). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for detection of caspases. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBS-Tween 20 (1%, v/v) (TBST) with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Following three washes of 5 min each with TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) (or appropriate secondary antibody) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the blots were developed with BM chemiluminescence reagent (Roche Applied Science) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR5). ASK1 Kinase Assay—After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (equivalent to 200 μg of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker with rabbit polyclonal ASK1 antibody. 10 μl of protein A/G plus agarose was subsequently added and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 3 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Na-β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The pellet was washed once with kinase buffer without protease inhibitors. The beads were then incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol) with 1 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding protein gel denaturing buffer. After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, the band intensities were quantified by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms. Cell Death ELISA—J774A-1 cells were plated (6 × 104 cells/plate) on 96-well plates. Cells were either treated with inhibitors or transfected with different plasmid constructs prior to incubation without or with M. avium. Cell death was detected with the cell death detection ELISA plus kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Caspase Activity Assays—Cells (6 × 105) were lysed by incubating with 25 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm pefabloc) on ice for 15 min. The supernatant was kept frozen at –70 °C until used. Lysate (20–100 μg of protein) was taken in 100 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 200 μm substrate. For measuring caspase 3 activity, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with Ac-DEVD-pNA as substrate, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Caspase 8 and 9 activities were measured using the fluorigenic substrates Ac-IETD-AFC and Ac-LEHD-AFC respectively. Fluorescence of the released AFC was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 530 nm, respectively. Isolation of Cytosol and Mitochondrial Fractions for Detection of Cyt c and Bid—After treatments, 18 × 106 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of resuspension buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 mm sucrose). The cells were broken with 20 passages through a 26-gauge needle, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min, to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 40 μl of resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was the cytosolic fraction. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (20 μg of protein) were used for quantification of cyt c and Bid, respectively. Prior to Western blotting, protein concentrations were assayed and all samples were normalized to equal protein concentrations. Blots were stripped and reprobed for β-actin expression. M. avium Induces Activation of ASK1 and p38 MAP Kinases in J774A-1 Macrophages—Taking into account the facts that challenge of macrophages with M. avium leads to macrophage apoptosis (44Hayashi T. Catanzaro A. Rao S.P. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5262-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through a process in which oxidative stress plays a key role and that ASK1 is required for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis involving the stress-activated MAP kinases p38 and JNK, we asked the question whether ASK1 is activated in response to incubation of J774A-1 macrophages with M. avium. Incubation of macrophages with M. avium at an MOI of 10 led to a time-dependent increase in ASK1 kinase activity as evidenced by in vitro phosphorylation of MBP (Fig. 1, panel A). ASK1 kinase activity increased directly with increasing MOI (Fig. 1, panel B). Pretreatment of cells with NAC prior to challenge with M. avium abrogated the M. avium-induced ASK1 activation (Fig. 1, panel C), suggesting the probable involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ASK1 activation mediated by M. avium. Control experiments showed that equal amounts of precipitated ASK1 were used to assay kinase activity. In subsequent experiments, cells were transfected with wild type or a catalytically inactive mutant (KM) of ASK1, prior to challenge with M. avium. Whereas p38 MAP kinase activation was observed in ASK1(wt)-transfected cells challenged with M. avium as evidenced for phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 1, panel D), no activation of p38 MAP kinase was evident in cells transfected with ASK1(KM). This suggested that ASK1 mediates the activation of p38 MAP kinase in M. avium-challenged macrophages. This effect was abrogated when cells were pretreated with the pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580 (45Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, panel D). M. avium-induced Macrophage Cell Death—Taking into account previous reports that M. avium induces apoptosis of macrophages, and our results showing M. avium-induced ASK1 activation, we asked the question whether ASK1-dependent signaling is linked to death of J774A-1 macrophages challenged with M. avium. M. avium induced macrophage cell death in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, panel A) as measured using histone ELISA. Transfection of cells with catalytically inactive ASK1 abrogated M. avium-induced cell death (Fig. 2, panel B). Dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase exerted a similar effect, supporting the view that cell death was dependent on ASK1/p38 MAP kinase signaling. This was further supported by the fact that SB203580 could inhibit M. avium-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, panel C), whereas U0126, an inhibitor of ERK 1/2 MAP kinase was without effect. In order to evaluate the role of FADD-mediated signaling in M. avium-induced apoptosis, cells were transfected with dominant-negative FADD (FADD(dn)) prior to challenge with M. avium. FADD (dn) abrogated M. avium-induced cell death (Fig. 2, panel B). FADD was not upstream of ASK1/p38 MAP kinase signaling since M. avium-induced ASK1 and p38 MAP kinase activation (assessed by probing Western blots with phospho-ASK1 and phospho-p38-specific antibodies) occurred even in FADD (dn)-transfected cells (Fig. 1, panel E). Cell death was also inhibited by treatment with NAC (Fig. 2, panel C). It is presently unclear how NAC regulates ASK1 activation and cell death in this case. ROS may oxidize thioredoxin thus dissociating it from ASK1 leading to ASK1 activation (46Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). It is also possible that a sequential signaling pathway links ROS production to ASK1 activation. Members of the caspase family are crucial mediators of apoptosis. Therefore the role of caspases, in M. avium-mediated cell death was evaluated using specific inhibitors for different caspases. As evident from Fig. 2 (panel D), the involvement of caspases 8, 9, and 3 was evident from the death-inhibitory effects z-IETD-FMK, z-LEHD-FMK, and z-DEVD-FMK, respectively. Caspase Activities in M. avium-challenged J774A-1 Macrophages—Western blot analysis for cleaved, active caspases was undertaken to determine caspase activation. Consistent with the effect of caspase inhibitors on M. avium-induced cell death, M. avium was found to activate the executioner caspase 3 (Fig. 3, panel A) and the initiator caspase 9 (Fig. 3, panel E) in a time-dependent manner as evid"

However, the molecular mechanism of the integrin activation inside platelets remains largely unknown. Pharmacological experiments have demonstrated that protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in platelet aggregation. Because PKC inhibitors can have multiple substrates and given that non-PKC-phorbol ester-binding signaling molecules have been demonstrated to play important roles, the precise involvement of PKC in cellular functions requires re-evaluation. Here, we have established an assay for analyzing the Ca2+-induced aggregation of permeabilized platelets. The aggregation of platelets was inhibited by the addition of the arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine peptide, an integrin-binding peptide inhibitor of αIIbβ3, suggesting that the aggregation was mediated by the integrin. The aggregation was also dependent on exogenous ATP and platelet cytosol, indicating the existence of essential cytosolic factors required for the aggregation. To examine the role of PKC in the aggregation assay, we immunodepleted PKCα and β from the cytosol. The PKC-depleted cytosol lost the aggregation-supporting activity, which was recovered by the addition of purified PKCα. Furthermore, the addition of purified PKCα in the absence of cytosol did not support the aggregation, whereas the cytosol containing less PKC supported it efficiently, suggesting that additional factors besides PKC would also be required. Thus, we directly demonstrated that PKCα is involved in the regulation of Ca2+-induced platelet aggregation.

Although αIIbβ3 of platelets in the resting stage does not bind fibrinogen or von Willebrand factors (vWF), 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factors; PKC, protein kinase C; cPKC, conventional protein kinase C; SLO, streptolysin-O; RGDS, arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine; RGES, arginine-glycineglutamate-serine. the activation of platelets results in conformation changes, which allow αIIbβ3 to bind these ligands (1Shattil S.J.

When fibrinogen or vWF binds to αIIbβ3, the ligand-occupied integrin signals downstream to stabilize platelet aggregation through reorganization of the actin cytoskeletal network and the release of bioactive substances stored in the granules (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P.

McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1753-1770Google Scholar). Thus, the process of platelet activation and aggregation consists of a series of orchestrated responses (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P.

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process remain unclear because it is difficult to use molecular biology and biochemistry in platelets that do not synthesize new proteins. To overcome this difficulty, semi-intact assays using permeabilized platelets have been established for the study of granule secretion (4Authi K.S. Rao G.H. Evenden B.J. Crawford N. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Flaumenhaft R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Sloan D.C.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although some semi-intact aggregation assays have now been developed, it has been difficult to demonstrate a cytosol dependence in these experiments (8Hers I. Donath J. Litjens P.E. van Willigen G. Akkerman J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) family members are important signaling molecules regulating many cellular functions (9Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Among the family members, conventional PKCs (cPKC), which include PKCα, βI, βII, and γ, have regulatory Ca2+- and phorbol ester-binding domains (9Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The involvement of cPKCs in the cellular functions has been analyzed mainly pharmacologically using cell-permeable small compounds of inhibitors and stimulators such as phorbol esters. However, these experiments are somewhat indirect because 1) no inhibitors have absolute specificity and 2) important signaling molecules other than PKCs have also been demonstrated to contain phorbol ester-binding C1-domains, which were first identified in cPKC (9Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For example, Ras-guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (11Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 12Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell.

Chimerin (13Hall C. Monfries C. Smith P. Lim H.H. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Vanniasingham V. Leung T. Lim L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Wang H.

Thus, the effects of phorbol esters could be through multiple pathways. Therefore, it is important to re-evaluate and demonstrate the involvement of PKCs in certain cellular functions in a direct fashion (15Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In platelets, PKC has been considered to play important roles in aggregation (16Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Sawamura M. Hoshijima M. Fujikura T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6701-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Siess W. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 309-318PubMed Google Scholar) and granule secretion (18Gerrard J.M. Beattie L.L. Park J. Israels S.J. McNicol A. Lint D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Blood. 1989; 74: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the granule secretion, we have recently demonstrated the direct involvement of PKC (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have established a semi-intact secretion assay (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A.

We purified an essential factor for the secretion and identified it to be PKCα (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been so far difficult to demonstrate the involvement of PKC in platelet aggregation without using small compounds of PKC inhibitors or phorbol esters. Here, we directly demonstrate the involvement of PKCα in the regulation of platelet aggregation by using a stable semi-intact aggregation assay with cytosol dependence. Materials—Anti-PKCα and anti-pan-PKCβ mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. This anti-PKCα antibody, which was described in the manufacturer's instruction to interact with PKCβ but not with other PKCs, was used for immunodepletion experiments. Another anti-PKCα mouse monoclonal antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology had no cross-reactivity with PKCβ and was used for the immunoblotting. Anti-PKCγ, anti-PKCδ, and anti-PKCθ mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-PKCβI and anti-PKCβII rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A control mouse IgG used for the immunodepletion experiment was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, which were used as secondary antibodies for immunoblotting visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise specified, all of the chemicals including peptides of arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine (RGDS) and arginine-glycine-glutamate-serine (RGES) were purchased from Sigma with the exception of SLO, which was from Dr. Bhakdi (Mainz University, Mainz, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio Rad) (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) or densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The Aggregation Assay with Permeabilized Platelets—The aggregation assay was established by modification of our previous assay (23Nishioka H. Horiuchi H. Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, the standard assay method was used as follows. Washed human platelets from healthy donors were prepared (24Phillips D.R. Agin P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the calculated free [Ca2+] was ∼20 nm (25Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar)) containing 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 ng/ml prostaglandin E1 and kept at 4 °C. The platelets were incubated with 0.6 μg/ml SLO at 4 °C for 10 min and washed once to remove unbound SLO (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T.

The permeabilized platelets were kept on ice for 15–30 min with 2 mg of proteins/ml human platelet cytosol (or rat brain cytosol), an ATP-regenerating system (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H.

EMBO J. 1988; 17: 1598-1605Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and tested substances. Because fibrinogen has been added in previously established aggregation assays using washed platelets at 0.4 mg/ml by Kinlough-Rathbone et al. (28Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Perry D.W. Rand M.L. Packham M.A. Thromb. Res. 1999; 95: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and 0.38 mg/ml by Santos et al. (29Santos M.T. Moscardo A. Valles J. Martinez M. Pinon M. Aznar J. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we also added fibrinogen (Sigma) in our assay at the concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The platelets then were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min and stimulated by the addition of calcium chloride to make final [Ca2+] at 200 μm (25Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregation was measured by a light transmission aggregometer, MCM HEMA TRACER 212 (MC Medical). For the morphological analysis, permeabilized platelets were incubated with 200 μm or 20 nm Ca2+ for 20 min in the standard assay condition. The samples then were immediately examined with a phase-contrast microscopy. Cytosol Preparation—For generation of platelet cytosol, platelets from healthy donors were washed and resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The platelets then were sonicated, and the supernatant after the low speed centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The final supernatant was dialyzed extensively with Buffer A and kept as platelet cytosol at –80 °C until use. The cytosol of rat brain was prepared in a similar way except using a Potter-type blender instead of sonication. For generating the PKC-depleted cytosol, the human platelet cytosol (0.4 mg of proteins) was incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics) coated with 25 μg of the anti-PKCα antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or the control mouse IgG for 6 h at 4 °C. After the beads were removed by centrifugation, the supernatants were used as the PKC-depleted cytosol and the control cytosol, respectively. PKCα was purified from rat brain cytosol as described previously (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Establishment of an Assay Analyzing the Ca2+-induced Aggregation of Permeabilized Platelets—We have established an aggregation assay with platelets permeabilized by SLO, which has been shown to form pores of ∼30 nm in diameter in the membrane (27Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Keboe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1988; 17: 1598-1605Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this method, we permeabilized only the plasma membrane judging from observations that the intracellular membrane structures of the platelets appeared to be intact morphologically (30Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and that vWF stored in α-granules did not leak out (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the condition used here with 0.6 μg/ml SLO induced leakage of 80% cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase from platelets (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it was presumed that most of ATP and cytosol were also lost by diffusion through the pores in the plasma membrane. Therefore, we exogenously added ATP and cytosol in the assay to reconstitute the aggregation. We also added 0.4 mg/ml fibrinogen in our assay, which would bridge the activated integrin αIIbβ3 on both sides of platelets to be aggregated (2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1741-1752Google Scholar, 3Brass L.F. Hoffman R.

Because calcium ionophore has been demonstrated to induce platelet aggregation (31Girolami A. Fabris F. Marco L. Peruffo R. Acta Haematol. 1976; 56: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 32Bottecchia D. Fantin G. Gruppo F. Nassuato G. Haemostasis. 1976; 5: 176-188PubMed Google Scholar), we used calcium ions at a calculated concentration at 200 μm (25Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) as a stimulus. We first examined morphologically whether aggregates of permeabilized platelets were indeed generated in the assay. After confirming the Ca2+-induced aggregation by the light-transmission aggregometer (data not shown), the samples were subjected to observation with a phase-contrast microscopy. A typical set of photographs showed that many platelet aggregates were formed upon stimulation with 200 μm Ca2+, whereas the permeabilized platelets incubated with 20 nm Ca2+ remained unaggregated (Fig. 1A). The quantification of the platelets in the images revealed that unaggregated platelets were reduced upon Ca2+ stimulation (Fig. 1B) and that the aggregates consisting of >10 platelets were drastically increased (Fig. 1C). Thus, the formation of the aggregates in the assay was confirmed morphologically. We next examined the effects of Ca2+ concentrations on the platelet aggregation. Although Ca2+ at 20 and 200 nm did not induce the platelet aggregation, Ca2+ at 2–200 μm efficiently induced the aggregation (Fig. 2). Because it has been shown that [Ca2+] in resting platelet cytosol is around 10 nm and that it increases to 1–10 μm upon platelet activation (33Knight D.E. Hallam T.J. Scrutton M.C. Nature. 1982; 296: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the Ca2+ sensitivity of the aggregation in the assay using permeabilized platelets was similar to physiological conditions. Aggregation of Permeabilized Platelets Was Mediated by the Integrin—It has been well known that platelet aggregation is mediated by activated integrin αIIbβ3 (2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1741-1752Google Scholar, 3Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1753-1770Google Scholar). We examined whether it was the case for the aggregation of permeabilized platelets. RGD is the integrin-binding sequence (34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar), which is present in both fibrinogen and vWF, and the aggregation of intact platelets has been shown to be inhibited by the addition of the RGD-containing peptide (35Lefkovits J. Plow E.F. Topol E.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 36Basani R.B. D'Andrea G. Mitra N. Vilaire G. Richberg M. Kowalska M.A. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13975-13981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the RGDS peptide inhibited the Ca2+-induced aggregation of permeabilized platelets, whereas the control RGES peptide did not. Furthermore, when fibrinogen was omitted from the assay, the aggregation was also inhibited (data not shown). Taken together, the aggregation in the assay was mediated by the integrin. Platelet Aggregation Was Cytosol-dependent—ATP and cytosol in the permeabilized platelets would be lost by diffusion through the pores. Without the addition of ATP, the permeabilized platelets did not aggregate upon the Ca2+ stimulation (data not shown), indicating that ATP is essential for the aggregation. When the cytosol was not added exogenously into the assay, the permeabilized platelets did not aggregate upon the Ca2+ stimulation in the condition where ATP and fibrinogen were sufficiently supplemented (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the aggregation was reconstituted by the addition of platelet cytosol in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). These results indicated the existence of cytosolic essential factor(s). We next tested rat brain cytosol for the reconstitution of the aggregation. The rat brain cytosol also supported the aggregation as efficiently as the human platelet cytosol (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that cytosolic essential factor(s) were expressed ubiquitously. Involvement of PKC in the Regulation of Platelet Aggregation—The cytosol dependence of the aggregation indicates that some cytosolic factors are required for the platelet aggregation. Although the identity of these factors is unknown, one important factor could be cPKC. As shown previously with intact platelets (37Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. KiriloFvsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GF109203X, an inhibitor of cPKCs, also affected the Ca2+-induced aggregation in our semi-intact assay in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). To examine the involvement of PKC directly, we first prepared PKC-depleted platelet cytosol. As shown in Fig. 6A, PKCα was completely depleted from the platelet cytosol with the anti-PKCα antibody-coated beads while PKCα stayed in the cytosol after the same procedure with control IgG-coated beads. Among other cPKCs, PKCβI and PKCβII were detected in platelets, whereas PKCγ, a neuronal specific cPKC, was not (data not shown). By the immunodepletion, PKCβ was also completely depleted because of the cross-reactivity of the antibody (Fig. 6A). When we used lower amounts of the anti-PKCα antibody for the immunodepletion, PKCβ was completely depleted while PKCα still remained in the cytosol (data not shown), suggesting that platelet cytosol contained more PKCα than PKCβ. As expected, although PKCδ and PKCθ, both of which are classified as novel PKCs, were detected in platelets, they were not affected by the immunodepletion procedure either with anti-PKCα antibody or control IgG (Fig. 6A). The PKC-depleted cytosol lost the aggregation activity, whereas the Ca2+-induced platelet aggregation was efficiently reconstituted with the cytosol treated with the control IgG (Fig. 6C). When PKCα purified from rat brain (Fig. 6B) (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol.

We next examined whether PKCα is a sufficient cytosolic factor for the aggregation. As shown in Fig. 7, purified PKCα (50 nm) alone was not sufficient to support the Ca2+-induced platelet aggregation. On the other hand, platelet cytosol at 0.6 mg of proteins/ml, which contained 15 nm PKCα determined by Western blot with the anti-PKCα antibody using purified PKCα as a control (data not shown), efficiently induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 7). Thus, PKCα is not a sufficient cytosolic factor for platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the addition of purified PKCα to the low concentration of cytosol (0.6 mg of proteins/ml) strongly enhanced the platelet aggregation, suggesting that PKCα is a limiting factor for the Ca2+-induced platelet aggregation. Thus, PKCα is an essential but not sufficient cytosolic factor for the Ca2+-induced platelet aggregation. Here we established an aggregation assay system using permeabilized platelets, and using this assay, we first directly demonstrated that PKC is an essential but not sufficient factor in the cytosol for platelet aggregation. Because platelets lack the protein-producing activity, it is difficult to apply molecular biology for investigating the molecular mechanism of aggregation and granule secretion inside activated platelets. Therefore, the research in these fields has been performed mainly pharmacologically. To overcome this difficulty, much effort has been made to establish semi-intact assay systems using permeabilized platelets. In the research of platelet granule secretion, several semi-intact assays have been established (4Authi K.S. Rao G.H. Evenden B.J. Crawford N. Biochem.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, for platelet aggregation, only a few semi-intact aggregation assays have been established (8Hers I. Donath J. Litjens P.E. van Willigen G. Akkerman J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and as far as we know, no stable assays with cytosol dependence have been established. We have previously established an aggregation assay system with SLO-permeabilized platelets and demonstrated that small GTPase Rho plays an important role in thrombin-induced aggregation (23Nishioka H. Horiuchi H. Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the assay did not demonstrate cytosol dependence since a low concentration of SLO (0.1 μg/ml) was used for the permeabilization and the aggregation was induced without adding exogenous cytosol (23Nishioka H. Horiuchi H. Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we have established another semi-intact aggregation assay by modifying the previous one (23Nishioka H. Horiuchi H. Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The aggregation of the permeabilized platelets in our in vitro assay appears physiological since the time course, the Ca2+ sensitivity and the involvement of the integrin are similar to those of intact platelets. Since the cytosol was extensively depleted from the permeabilized platelets in our semi-intact aggregation assay using a higher concentration of SLO than that used previously (23Nishioka H. Horiuchi H. Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), permeabilized platelets did not aggregate in response to calcium stimulation without adding exogenous cytosol. This cytosol dependence would widen the application of the assay to investigate the molecular mechanism of platelet aggregation. The cytosol dependence also indicated the existence of essential cytosolic factor(s) for aggregation. A cytosolic protein PKC has been shown to play an important role in platelet aggregation by pharmacological experiments using cell-permeable small compounds of inhibitors and stimulators such as phorbol esters (16Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Sawamura M. Hoshijima M. Fujikura T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6701-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Siess W. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 309-318PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results obtained from such experiments appear somewhat indirect because the specificity of inhibitors is not absolutely strict and important signaling molecules containing the phorbol ester-binding C1 domain other than PKC have been recently identified such as Ras-guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (11Ebinu J.O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Munc13-1 present in the presynapse also contains the C1 domain (38Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and it has very recently been demonstrated that the effect of phorbol ester in the neurotransmitter release is through Munc13-1 (39Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, at the moment, it is ambiguous whether phorbol esters exert their functions through PKC or other non-PKC-signaling molecules. Therefore, re-evaluation and direct demonstration are required in various cell functions where PKCs have been suggested to be involved (15Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Brose N. Rosenmund C. J. Cell. Sci. 2000; 115: 4399-4411Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Using the semi-intact aggregation assay, we have directly demonstrated the involvement of PKCα in the Ca2+-induced platelet aggregation. First, an inhibitor of conventional PKC affected the aggregation. Second, immunodepletion of PKCα and PKCβ from the cytosol abolished the Ca2+-induced aggregation. Third, the aggregation-supporting activity of PKCα/β-depleted cytosol was rescued by supplementation of purified PKCα. Supplementation of PKCα alone to the PKCα/β-depleted cytosol was enough to reconstitute the aggregation, suggesting that PKCα but not PKCβ is the essential factor or otherwise that the activity of cPKC, namely PKCα or PKCβ, is essential. Because PKCα and PKCβ show similar substrate specificity in vitro (40Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude a possibility that added PKCα covered the lack of PKCβ activity in the assay. Although cPKC is an essential factor for the aggregation, it is not a sufficient cytosolic factor since the addition of purified PKCα alone without exogenous cytosol did not support the aggregation. Furthermore, platelet cytosol containing less PKC supported the aggregation efficiently, and purified PKCα strongly enhanced the aggregation in the presence of low concentration of cytosol, suggesting that PKCα is a limiting factor in the cytosol for the aggregation and that additional factors besides PKC would also be required for the aggregation. PKCα and PKCβ are known to be activated by Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine (9Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although we did not add these stimulators besides Ca2+, the purified PKCα added to the assay was indeed active since the purified PKCα phosphorylated a PKC substrate efficiently in the similar assay condition used here (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We speculate that the components inside the platelets, possibly including phosphatidylserine, help support the activity of PKCα (19Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because PKC increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by modulating Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane in neurons (41Swartz K.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 42Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether PKC acts upstream and/or downstream of increased Ca2+. Because we used Ca2+ as a stimulus, we could safely say that PKCα plays an important role at least at the downstream of increased Ca2+. Further investigation is required for elucidation of how PKCα activates the integrin αIIbβ3 and induces platelet aggregation. The assay established here will be a powerful tool for future experiments aimed at elucidating these mechanisms. We are grateful to Dr. H. McBride and Dr. H. Arai for the critical reading of the paper and to T. Matsubara for excellent technical assistance."

We evaluated the effects of endogenous modulation of GM3 expression on epithelial cell motility on several matrices and the mechanism of these effects. Endogenous accumulation of GM3 decreased cell migration on fibronectin, types I, IV, and VII collagen matrices; depletion of GM3 dramatically increased cell migration, regardless of matrix. GM3 overexpression and depletion in vitro correlated inversely with the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9; consistently, the cell migration stimulated by GM3 depletion is reversed by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. Accumulation and depletion of GM3 in epithelial cells grown on fibronectin also correlated inversely with epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen activated protein kinase phosphorylation and with Jun expression. Ganglioside depletion facilitated the co-immunoprecipitation of matrix metal-loproteinase-9 and integrin α5β1, while endogenous accumulation of GM3, but not GT1b, blocked the co-immunoprecipitation.

Epithelial cell motility plays a fundamental role in both physiologic and pathologic conditions, such as tissue resorption and remodeling during embryogenesis, wound healing, and metastasis. However, the mechanisms involved in cell motility are not well understood.

We have evaluated the effects of GM3 on squamous carcinoma cell migration and invasion and have addressed the possibility that GM3 expression modulates MMP activity. These studies show that endogenous alterations in GM3 expression in this carcinoma cell line affect migration and invasion potential by a mechanism that is not FN-specific. Instead, GM3 content dictates MMP-9 expression and activation through the effect of GM3 on EGFR signaling. The content of ganglioside GM3, but not of GT1b, also affects the ability of MMP-9 and α5β1 integrin to associate in the membrane, suggesting a regulatory role for GM3 in membrane complex formation.

SCC12 cells were stably transfected with human plasma membrane ganglioside-specific sialidase cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB008185, courtesy of Dr. T. Miyagi, Tokyo, Japan) (35Wada T.

Gene and protein expression in the resultant “SSIA cells” were demonstrated by Northern blot, sialidase activity measurements, and ganglioside depletion shown by thin layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining (4Wang X.

Gangliosides were also eliminated by inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis. Cells were treated with 2 μm of racemic threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoyl-amino-3-pyrrolidinopropan-1-ol, HCl (PPPP, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 5 days. PPPP inhibits the activity of glucosylceramide synthase, and thus prevents the formation of glucosylceramide, a precursor for GM3. In contrast to 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, PPPP does not significantly increase ceramide content (37Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R.

Specific Endogenous Depletion of GM3 Expression—Sialidase overexpression or treatment with PPPP deplete all SCC12 cell gangliosides, although GM3 is the predominant ganglioside. To compare the results of total ganglioside depletion and specific depletion of GM3, a model of specific GM3 depletion was generated. Up-regulation of GD3 synthase expression by gene transfection results in a specific decrease in expression of GM3 and an increase in expression of GD3. Because in vitro studies had suggested that overexpression of GD3 would result in cell apoptosis, an inducible system was employed (a generous gift from Dr. S. Tsai and X. Wang, Houston, TX) (38Wang Y. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl.

The GD3 synthase cDNA-containing construct (GenBank™ accession number X77922, courtesy of Dr. Lloyd, New York) (40Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsuji S. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15950-15956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced following the technique previously described for GM2/GD2 synthase (8Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40410-40419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), except that the linearized gene was inserted into purified p17 × 4-tkA vector opened at XhoI and EcoRV after treatment with XhoI and StuI restriction enzymes. The purified p17 × 4-tkA/GD3 synthase construct was cotransfected into SCC12 cells with the purified pCEP4·GL-VP (hygromycin-resistant) transactivator construct using LipofectAMINE reagent. Putative cotransfectants were selected by antibiotic resistance to both 500 μg/ml G418 and 60 μg/ml hygromycin B, followed by limiting dilution to ensure clonality. The time course of gene expression after stimulation with mifepristone (RU-486) and the leakiness of the in vitro inducible system was tested initially by the concurrent generation and testing of β-galactoseexpressing cells as described previously (8Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40410-40419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Peak expression was demonstrated at 24–48 h after addition of RU-486, and no leakiness was detected in vitro. GD3 synthase expression in the p17 × 4-tkA/GD3-pGL-VP cells after 24–48 h stimulation with RU-486 (100 nm) was examined by Northern blotting assay using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 636-bp GD3 synthase cDNA probe and by RT-PCR. For Northern assays, a DIG-labeled 316-bp fragment of the constitutively expressed human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was used as a control for RNA loading. Expression was detected with a DIG-high Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter kit II as indicated by the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). For RTPCR, total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNeasy Isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was quantified by measuring the absorption at 260 nm. An aliquot of purified total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel to verify its integrity, and the remaining purified RNA was stored at –80 °C. GD3 synthase primers for RT-PCR were: 5′-AGAGGGGCCATGGCTGTACTG-3′ (GD3 synthase sense primer) and 5′-CAGTACAGCCATGGCCCCTCT-3′ (GD3 synthase antisense primer). Equal loading of total RNA was confirmed by determining the expression of GAPDH with both sense primer 5′-GCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTTTGGTTCTCCAGCTTCAGG. The PCR reaction was activated with HotStar TaqDNA polymerase and performed in a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler 480 as follows: 2 min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 60 °C for GADPH and 68 °C for GD3 synthase, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C; cycles were followed by a 10-min extension phase at 72 °C. The RT-PCR products of GADPH (498-bp) and GD3 synthase (285-bp) were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels. Gene expression after RU-486 stimulation was compared with expression in transfected cells without RU-486 induction, mock-transfected, and parental SCC12 cells. Successful transfection of cells with human GD3 synthase cDNA was also further confirmed by ganglioside ELISA assays as previously reported (8Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40410-40419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and by TLC immunostaining with anti-GM1, -GM2, -GM3, -GD2, -GT1b (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo) and anti-GD3 (Sigma) antibodies as described (36Arnsmeier S.L. Paller A.S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 911-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays and other studies were largely performed in the absence of EGF ligands, but in the presence of FN, to evaluate strictly the effect of matrix activation on signaling, in the absence of additional stimulation by EGFR ligands. Cell migration assays were performed using both chemotaxis migration assay (Transwell cell culture system from BD Biosciences) and scratch analysis. The Transwell insert with a polycarbonate filter of an 8-μm pore size was coated with or without 20 μg/cm2 of FN or 30 μg/cm2 poly-l-lysine (Sigma) overnight at room temperature. After air-drying, the insert was placed into a 6-well cell culture plate, and the lower portion of the plate was filled with 500 μl of serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). SCC12 cells, pretreated with or without antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or PPPP, the SSIA cells, the pcDNA3 vector mock-transfected SCC12 cells, and the GD3 synthase overexpressors with or without 100 nm RU-468 induction for 30 h were plated onto the upper surface of the filter. Cells were allowed to grow for 18 h at 37 °C in same medium as in the lower level with the continued addition of oligodeoxynucleotides, PPPP or RU-486. Cells that migrated into the lower level were collected and counted. Results were presented as mean ± S.D. from three different experiments with triplicate wells per experiment. To perform scratch assays, cells were plated into 8-well cell culture plate, precoated with or without FN (5 μg/cm2), type I collagen (20 μg/cm2), type IV collagen (20 μg/cm2), type VII collagen (5 μg/cm2), or poly-l-lysine (10 μg/cm2) as described above. Cells were allowed to grow in 10% FBS containing DMEM/F12 medium for 4 h, then were washed with serum-free medium and starved of both serum and growth factors for overnight. A 1-mm wide scratch was made across the cell layer using a pipette tip. After washing with serum-free medium twice, DMEM/F12 medium containing 10 μg/ml FN, 40 μg/ml type I or IV collagen, 10 μg/ml type VII collagen or 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine was added to replace matrix depleted with the SCC12 cells. Plates were photographed after 6, 12, and 24 h. All experiments were performed at least 6 times. Quantitative scratch assays were performed as described above except that a deep permanent gouge was made with a razor blade into the culture plate at the border of the scratch to allow definitive separation of migrating cells. After 6, 12, and 24 h in culture, cells that had migrated into the scratched area were identified and counted. Results were presented as mean ± S.D. from 3 high power fields per experiment in at least four different experiments. Using the quantitative scratch assays, cell migration was also observed in the presence of MMP inhibitors including 200 nm anti-MMP-9 blocking antibody, 10 nm recombinant TIMP-1, and 5 μm cyclic peptide inhibitor CTTHWGFTLC (CTT) [H-Cys1-Thr-Thr-His-Trp-Gly-Phe-Thr-Leu-Cys10-OH (cyclic: 1→10)] (CalBioChem, Ref. 41Medina O.P.

Invasion Assays—Cell invasion assays were performed using BD BioCoat™ Matrigel™ Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instruction. The lower portion of both invasion and control chambers was filled with 500 μl of serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 1 mg/ml BSA with or without either 10 nm EGF or, as a stimulant of MMP-9 expression, 100 ng/ml PMA. SCC12 cells pretreated with or without sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, PPPP, or Me2SO (<0.1% v/v, vehicle control), SCC12 cells stably transfected with sialidase cDNA or mock-transfected with the pcDNA vector, SCC12 cells transfected with GD3 synthase cDNA and treated with or without RU-486 were plated onto the upper surface of the filter. Cells were allowed to grow for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells that invaded the lower level were collected and counted. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. from three different experiments, performed in duplicate. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was carried out as described (6Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with total protein from either whole cell lysates or conditioned cell culture medium. In brief, cells were treated with or without antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or PPPP, or were stably transfected with sialidase cDNA or pcDNA3 vector. Cells were incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium with or without either 20 μg/ml plasma FN or 10 ng/ml EGF after starvation overnight of serum, FN, and growth factors. Cells were also allowed to grow in FN or EGF-containing, serum-free medium with or without either 250 nm AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR-related kinase, 100 μm PD98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, or 100 nm PMA, a broad spectrum stimulant of MMP expression, for 48 h at 37 °C. Incubation of cells with oligodeoxynucleotides or PPPP was continued in cell culture throughout the treatment with inhibitors. Total protein from the cell culture conditioned medium was concentrated using Protein-Concentrate Kit (Chemicon) and mixed with the non-denatured whole cells lysate. Total protein was quantified by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to ensure equal loading. 8–50 μg of total protein from whole cell lysates, conditioned cell culture medium, or the protein mixture was boiled in Laemmli buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar), and loaded onto SDS-PAGE mini-gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes, the separated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-MAPK, anti-EGFR, anti-Jun, or anti-MMP-9 antibodies. Blots were reprobed as previously described (6Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loading. All blots were repeated in at least three different experiments. Immunoprecipitation—After starvation of serum, FN, and EGF overnight, cells were stimulated with or without either 20 μg/ml plasma FN, or both FN and 100 nm PMA for 30 min. Cells were harvested and lysed in cold immunoprecipitation buffer (6Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total protein (1 mg) from the cell lysates was mixed with 5 μg of anti-α5β1 integrin polyclonal antibody and the total reaction volume was adjusted to 1 ml in the immunoprecipitation buffer. After incubation with the antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, protein A-agarose was added, and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C (6Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Gelatin Zymography—The effect of ganglioside modulation of MMP-9 activity was analyzed by gelatin zymography (43Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of protein from the mixture prepared as described (see “Immunoblotting”) was applied onto 10% SDS-PAGE min-gels containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin after treating the protein with non-denatured sample buffer (17.4% SDS, 7% sucrose, and 0.01% phenol red) for 30 min at 25 °C. Following electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C to remove the SDS.

Since Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis, we examined the effects of H2O2 on the expression of principal Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bad) in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting. Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad were all down-regulated in myocytes exposed to 0.2 mm H2O2, a concentration that induces apoptosis. In contrast, although Bcl-xL levels initially declined, the protein was re-expressed from 4–6 h. Bcl-xL mRNA was up-regulated from 2 to 4 h in neonatal rat or mouse cardiac myocytes exposed to H2O2, consistent with the re-expression of protein. Four different untranslated first exons have been identified for the Bcl-x gene (exons 1, 1B, 1C, and 1D, where exon 1 is the most proximal and exon 1D the most distal to the coding region). All were detected in mouse or rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, but exon 1D was not expressed in adult mouse hearts. In neonatal mouse or rat cardiac myocytes, H2O2 induced the expression of exons 1B, 1C, and 1D, but not exon 1. These data demonstrate that the Bcl-x gene is selectively responsive to oxidative stress, and the response is mediated through distal promoter regions. Oxidative stress promotes cardiac myocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial death pathway.

These data demonstrate that the Bcl-x gene is selectively responsive to oxidative stress, and the response is mediated through distal promoter regions. Cardiac myocytes, the contractile cells of the heart, are terminally differentiated cells, which withdraw from the cell cycle in the perinatal period. Consequently, myocyte cell death, as occurs (for example) following ischemia and/or reperfusion, significantly affects cardiac function. One of the principal insults that may promote cardiac myocyte death is oxidative stress, and the levels of oxidative stress are increased in ischemic hearts (1Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Becker L.B. Vanden Hoek T.L. Shao S.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J.

Visioli O. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: B2-B11PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 (0.1–0.5 mm), as an example of oxidative stress, promotes cardiac myocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial death pathway (4Cook S.A. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, lower concentrations are non-toxic and may have cytoprotective and/or growth promoting effects (5Ytrehus K. Walsh R.S. Richards S.C. Downey J.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Valen G. Starkopf J. Takeshima S. Kullisaar T. Vihalemm T. Kengsepp A.T. Lowbeer C. Vaage J.

Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulatory components of the mitochondrial cell death pathway (9Adams J.A. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 21: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 10Antonsson B. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Some family members are cytoprotective (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1), whereas others promote apoptosis (e.g. Bad, Bak, Bax, Bid, Bim, Bmf). These proteins act at the mitochondria to regulate cytochrome c release. Bcl-2 family proteins act either as heterodimers or as oligomers and the dynamic equilibrium between such complexes appears to determine the predisposition to apoptosis. Translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and oligomerization of Bax and/or Bak promotes permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome c and other apoptosis-inducing factors, possibly by forming a pore in the membrane. Heterodimerization with either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevents oligomerization and protects from apoptosis. Other pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bad, Bim, or Bmf compete for binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL causing release of Bax/Bak, which can then form oligomers and induce apoptosis. Thus, the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins influences the rate of apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are the principal Bcl-2 family proteins that protect cells from apoptosis. The regulation of the Bcl-x gene appears particularly complex. Initial studies of the mouse Bcl-x gene demonstrated that, like Bcl-2, the Bcl-x gene consisted of three separate exons (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 1 is untranslated and is separated from the first coding exon, exon 2, by a short facultative intron. Exon 3 codes for the C terminus of Bcl-xL and is separated from exon 2 by a large intron of at least 9 kb. At least four proteins potentially derive from alternatively spliced Bcl-x mRNAs. Exons 1, 2, and 3 are spliced together to produce Bcl-xL. Splicing from an alternative donor site within exon 2 to exon 3 results in a shorter form of the protein (Bcl-xS), which lacks a central region present in Bcl-xL, but the reading frame is maintained and the C terminus is identical (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS induces apoptosis. Read-through of the donor site at the end of exon 2 produces Bcl-xβ (12Shiraiwa N. Inohara N. Okad S. Yuzaki M. Shoji S. Ohta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13258-13265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and splicing of exon 2 to a novel exon 4 generates Bcl-xγ (13Yang X.-F. Weber G.F. Cantor H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Apart from alternative splicing of the coding exons of the Bcl-x gene, there is additional complexity in the regulation of the 5′ non-coding region. Grillot et al. (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of at least two principal transcription initiation sites for exon 1 at –655 and –727, in addition to a cluster of initiation sites at the start of exon 2. Subsequently, an alternative first exon upstream of exon 1 (exon 1B) was identified in human lymphoma cells (14MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Wood L. Brimmell M. Johnson P.W.M. Packham G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5534-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A third study suggested that at least five different promoters (P1–P5) operate in the mouse Bcl-x gene, each of which is associated with a different first exon (exons A–E) (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This terminology is confusing, since exons A and B correspond, respectively, to exons 2 and 1 identified by Grillot et al. (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), and exon C corresponds to the region identified as exon 1B (14MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Wood L. Brimmell M. Johnson P.W.M. Packham G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5534-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The different exons of the Bcl-x gene are summarized in Fig. 1. Despite the identification of potential promoters and transcriptional start sites further upstream in the Bcl-x gene (i.e. exons D and E (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), expression of these exons was not detected in erythroid progenitor cells or differentiating erythroblasts in which Bcl-xL is up-regulated (16Tian C.

A number of Bcl-2 family proteins are expressed in cardiac myocytes including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, Bax, and Bid (4Cook S.A. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ.

As in other cells, overexpression of Bcl-2 in cardiac myocytes is cytoprotective (19Kirshenbaum L.A. de Moissac D.

H2O2-induced apoptosis in neonatal myocytes is associated with rapid translocation of Bad and Bax to the mitochondria (<5 min), an event which precedes cytochrome c release (4Cook S.A. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17von Harsdorf R. Li P.-F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), suggesting that, in the context of oxidative stress, Bad/Bax translocation may be one of the initiating events. Bcl-2 family proteins are therefore key regulators of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes, as in other cells, and the expression of the various family members is likely to influence the rate of myocyte death. In this study, we examined the effects of H2O2 on the expression of four key family members which are readily detected in cardiac myocytes (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad). Preparation of Neonatal Rat or Mouse Cardiac Myocytes—Myocytes were dissociated from the ventricles of 1–3-day Sprague-Dawley rat hearts as described previously (22Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 1.4 × 103 cells/mm2 in 35-mm Primaria tissue culture dishes precoated with 1% (w/v) gelatin. Neonatal mouse myocytes were prepared from the ventricles of C57Bl6 mice using essentially the same procedure as for neonatal rat myocytes, and cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 103 cells/mm2. Myocytes were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/M199 (4:1) containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) horse serum (16 h, 37 °C), and then incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to experimentation. Myocytes were exposed to H2O2 (0.02 mm, 0.2 mm, 2 mm) for the times indicated. Immunoblot Analysis—Myocytes were washed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Dulbeccos phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), extracted in Buffer A (20 mm glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 2 μm microcystin LR, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm benzamidine, 200 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μm phenylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min). The supernatants were boiled with 0.33-volume sample buffer (0.33 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 13% (v/v) glycerol, 133 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Proteins (15 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (23Clerk A.

Blots were incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder to block nonspecific binding. Blots were washed (TBST, 3 × 5 min) and incubated with primary antibodies in TBST containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (16 h, 4 °C). Primary antibodies to Bcl-xL (H-5), Bcl-2 (C-2), or Bax (B-9) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. and used at 1/400 dilution; antibodies to total Bad (B36420) were from BD Transduction Laboratories and used at 1/1000 dilution. Blots were washed (TBST, 3 × 5 min) and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase diluted in TBST containing 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder (1 h, 20 °C). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and were quantified by scanning densitometry. Total RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Myocytes were homogenized in 0.5 ml of RNAzol B (AMS Biotech) and total RNA prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA pellets were dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and the concentrations were calculated from the A 260. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed from total RNA (2 μg) in a reaction mixture containing 500 oligo(dT) and 1 mm dNTP mix. Tubes were heated (65 °C, 5 min). 5 × first-strand buffer, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units) and Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen) were added, and cDNA synthesis was performed (50 min, 42 °C). Preparation of Genomic DNA—Rat spleen (stored at –80 °C) was powdered under liquid N2, homogenized in Buffer ATL (Qiagen DNeasy tissue DNA extraction kit), and passed through a 21-gauge needle 5–20 times. DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions, eluted in 100 μl, and the concentration was calculated from the A 260. Ratiometric RT 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. -PCR Analysis—Ratiometric RT-PCR was performed as previously described, and in our hands, results from this method are comparable with those obtained by quantitative “real-time” PCR (24Clerk A.

Primers were designed for the coding regions of rat Bcl-2, Bad, and Bax and for mouse or rat Bcl-xL coding region. Primers for the Bcl-xL coding region (exon 2) were designed not to detect Bcl-xS. Primers were also designed for each of the potential first exons upstream of exon 2 of the Bcl-x gene and to amplify the region across exons 1 and 2 (Table I and Fig. 1). To avoid confusion, we have used the Grillot/MacCarthy-Morrogh (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J.

RT-PCR reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 100 ng of cDNA or 20 ng of genomic DNA template, 100 μm concentration of each primer, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4 at 25 °C), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and a 0.2 mm concentration each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, using 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The following conditions were used: 95 °C, 3 min followed by 24–31 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 50 s), annealing (61 °C, 50 s), and extension (72 °C, 50 s). Amplification products were analyzed by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis using 2% (w/v) agarose gels and the bands captured under UV illumination. All primer sets generated clean products of the predicted sizes (Table I). Products were analyzed by scanning densitometry and normalized to GAPDH.

Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas higher concentrations induce non-apoptotic cell death. 0.02 mm H2O2 is non-toxic, but has effects on gene expression. 2T. J. Kemp and A. Clerk, unpublished data. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to H2O2 for up to 24 h, and the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad were compared by immunoblotting. High concentrations of H2O2 (2 mm) induced profound down-regulation of all four proteins (Fig. 2, A–D). Down-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bad was apparent within 1–2 h (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was not significant before ∼4 h (Fig. 2, C and D). The levels of Bax and Bad were also decreased in myocytes exposed to 0.2 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2, E and F), albeit to a lesser extent than in myocytes exposed to 2 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Bcl-2 was down-regulated to a similar degree and over a similar time course in response to both concentrations (Fig. 2, C and G). In contrast, although Bcl-xL protein initially decreased in myocytes exposed to 0.2 mm H2O2 (∼70% over 2–4 h), it was re-expressed, and after 24 h the levels of Bcl-xL were similar to those of unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2H). The expression of all four Bcl-2 family proteins did not change in myocytes exposed to 0.02 mm H2O2 (results not shown). These data indicate that, of the four Bcl-2 family proteins, only Bcl-xL is re-expressed following stimulation by oxidative stress at a concentration that promotes apoptosis. H 2 O 2 Induces Bcl-xL mRNA Expression—To determine whether re-expression of Bcl-xL protein in response to 0.2 mm H2O2 reflected an increase in mRNA expression (rather than an effect on protein synthesis or stability) and that this was a selective effect, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to 0.2 mm H2O2, and ratiometric RT-PCR analysis of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad was performed. Primers were designed to detect expression of the coding regions of the mRNAs for each gene (Table I). Consistent with the protein data (Fig. 2H), Bcl-xL (exon 2) mRNA was up-regulated from 2 to 4 h, and this was sustained over the 8-h period studied (Fig. 3A). In contrast, there was no change in expression of Bcl-2 or Bax mRNA (Fig. 3, B and C), and Bad was marginally down-regulated at the mRNA level (Fig. 3D). Since more detailed analysis of the regulation of Bcl-x has been performed for the mouse gene than for the rat gene (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we confirmed that Bcl-xL mRNA was up-regulated in neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes in response to 0.2 mm H2O2.As in rat myocytes, Bcl-xL mRNA expression was increased at 2 and 4 h (Fig. 3F). Thus, 0.2 mm H2O2 increases the expression of Bcl-xL mRNA in cardiac myocytes, and this probably accounts for the selective re-expression of Bcl-xL protein. Up-regulation of Bcl-xL mRNA by H 2 O 2 Is Mediated by Selective Promoter Activation—As illustrated in Fig. 1, four putative untranslated first exons have been identified for the mouse Bcl-x gene (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To avoid confusion we have extended the terminology used by MacCarthy-Morrogh et al. (14MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Wood L. Brimmell M. Johnson P.W.M. Packham G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5534-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and refer to exons 1 (the original first exon identified by Grillot et al. (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar)), 1B, 1C, and 1D (which correlate to exons C, D, and E described by Pecci et al. (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Transcripts containing exons 1 and 1B had been previously detected in heart extracts, but whether exons 1C and 1D are also expressed had not been studied. Using specific primers to each of the untranslated exons of the mouse Bcl-x gene for ratiometric RT-PCR analysis, we confirmed that exons 1 and 1B were expressed in adult mouse heart and all other tissues studied (spleen, kidney, liver, and brain) (Fig. 4A). Exon 1C, but not exon 1D, was also detected in all adult mouse tissues (Fig. 4A and results not shown). Bcl-x exons 1, 1B, and 1C were all readily detected in neonatal mouse cardiac myocyte cultures confirming expression in the myocytes themselves. However, although it was not detected in adult hearts, exon 1D was expressed in neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4B), suggesting that expression of this region is down-regulated during postnatal development of the heart. Since all primers were designed to amplify regions within individual predicted exons, we considered it necessary to confirm that there was no contamination of samples with genomic DNA and primers were designed for RT-PCR to amplify the region across the intron between exons 1 and 2. RT-PCR analysis of cDNA samples resulted in a single product of 433 bp, consistent with splicing of exon 1 to exon 2 generating a single mRNA species (Fig. 4C). This contrasts with a previous study in which differential splicing across this region produced three different mRNAs (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Amplification of genomic DNA resulted in a product of 615 bp (Fig. 4C) encompassing the intron and confirming that there was no significant contamination of samples with genomic DNA. To determine which of the untranslated exons are expressed in response to H2O2, neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes were exposed to 0.2 mm H2O2, and the different exons were analyzed by ratiometric RT-PCR. The expression of exon 1 did not change in response H2O2, whereas exons 1B, 1C, and 1D were all significantly increased (Fig. 5A). The sequence for the region 5′ to the rat Bcl-x gene has recently become available and comparison of the region encompassing all potential untranslated first exons with the mouse sequence indicates a high degree of conservation from some distance upstream of exon 1D through to the first coding ATG of the Bcl-x gene (see on-line Supplemental Material). Using primers specific for the rat sequence (Table I), we demonstrated that, consistent with the data for mouse myocytes (Fig. 5A), 0.2 mm H2O2 selectively increased the expression of exons 1B, 1C, and 1D in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes with no change in expression of exon 1 (Fig. 5, B and C). These data suggest that oxidative stress results in specific expression of the distal untranslated exons of the Bcl-x gene in cardiac myocytes rather than the most proximal exon 1. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 Family Proteins during Cardiac Myocyte Death—H2O2, as an example of oxidative stress, induces cardiac myocyte death. In response to 2 mm H2O2, which should induce a more necrotic phenotype, all four Bcl-2 family proteins studied were profoundly down-regulated (Fig. 2, A–D). In contrast, in response to 0.2 mm H2O2, which induces apoptosis, although the down-regulation of Bcl-2 was similar to that seen in response to 2 mm H2O2, the effect on Bax and Bad was less pronounced (Fig. 2, E–G). Furthermore, although Bcl-xL decreased initially, the protein was re-expressed (Fig. 2H). The effects of the two concentrations on Bcl-2 family proteins are therefore distinct and may be a reflection of the type of cell death. The mechanisms involved in the down-regulation of these Bcl-2 family proteins were not investigated in this study. However, the down-regulation of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad in response to 0.2 mm H2O2 is likely to be primarily due to increased protein degradation and/or reduced protein synthesis, since the mRNA levels for Bcl-2 and Bax did not change and, although there was a decrease in Bad mRNA, this was relatively modest (Fig. 3, B–D). The initial decline in Bcl-xL protein also probably reflects increased degradation, since Bcl-xL mRNA expression did not change significantly before ∼2 h (Fig. 3A). The subsequent increase in Bcl-xL mRNA presumably accounts for the re-expression of Bcl-xL protein from ∼ 4–6 h (Fig. 2H). There was some variability in the time at which Bcl-xL protein was re-expressed, which may be due to a conflict between the rate of protein degradation and synthesis of new protein. The significance of Bcl-xL re-expression in response to 0.2 mm H2O2 is not clear. However, this concentration does not induce apoptosis in all myocytes over 24 h (4Cook S.A. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and re-expression of Bcl-xL in surviving cells may be a significant component of the survival program. Regulation of Bcl-xL mRNA Expression in Cardiac Myocytes—Although Bcl-x transcripts have been reported to derive from at least five different promoters (i.e. the region between exons 1 and 2 and regions upstream of exons 1, 1B, 1C, and 1D), only the three most proximal (regions upstream of exons 2, 1, and 1B) were previously shown to be operative in the heart (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that exon 1C was expressed in adult mouse heart and neonatal cardiac myocytes, and although it was not detected in adult hearts, exon 1D was expressed in neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that there is developmental regulation of the upstream promoters such that exon 1D is no longer expressed in adult hearts. Our preliminary data suggest that, in neonatal cardiac myocytes, exons 1D and 1C are expressed as a single exon that incorporates the intervening sequence (results not shown). This suggests that during development there is a switch in the transcriptional initiation site that is used. Exons 1C/1D do not appear to be continuous with exon 1B (results not shown). Consistent with this, comparison of the mouse and rat sequences indicates that there is a region of low homology between exon 1C and exon 1B (see on-line Supplemental Material). Although all four untranslated exons were detected in neonatal cardiac myocytes, only the expression of exons 1B, 1C, and 1D was significantly increased by 0.2 mm H2O2, with no increase in exon 1 (Fig. 5). The reasons for multiple promoter usage and differential expression of untranslated exons are unclear, although previous studies suggest that the promoter may influence the isoform of Bcl-x which is produced (15Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, Bcl-xL (Fig. 2) and Bcl-xS (results not shown) were up-regulated concomitantly, and it is possible that, for example, exon 1B may preferentially induce Bcl-xL whereas exons 1C/1D may induce Bcl-xS. However, there is minimal evidence in support of such a scenario. Alternatively, switching of non-coding exons to produce different 5′-untranslated regions may influence the mode and rate of translation. In cardiac myocytes, H2O2 (>0.1 mm) suppresses global protein synthesis by ∼95% over at least 4 h, probably because of repression of cap-dependent initiation of translation (25Pham F.H. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, a small group of proteins continues to be synthesized, including p21CIP1/WAF1 (26Pham F.H. Cole S.M. Clerk A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), presumably through cap-independent mechanisms. An increasing number of eukaryotic mRNAs have been identified which contain internal ribosome entry sites required for cap-independent protein synthesis (see ifr31w3.toulouse.inserm.fr/IRESdatabase), and many of these are associated with apoptosis (27Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the case of insulin-like growth factor 2, mRNAs are produced with three different 5′-untranslated regions, only one of which confers cap-independent protein synthesis (28Pedersen S.K. Christiansen J. Hansen T.O. Larsen M.R. Nielsen F.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The specific up-regulation of exons 1B, 1C, and 1D, but not exon 1, by H2O2 in cardiac myocytes may therefore be required for translation to occur in the context of global inhibition of protein synthesis. Most studies so far have focused on the regulation of expression of Bcl-xL from the promoter regions upstream of exons 1 and 2, and binding sites for a number of transcription factors have been identified in this region (11Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that further analysis of sequences upstream from exons 1B, 1C, and 1D is required to identify the regions that are responsive to H2O2 and establish which transcription factors are involved. It is of note that the homology between rat, mouse and human Bcl-x gene is extremely high across the region encompassing exons 1B through to exon 3. However, although the homology between the rat and mouse sequences across exons 1C and 1D is high (see on-line Supplemental Material), we have had problems aligning this region with the human sequence (42% identity at best). It is possible exons 1C and 1D represent a different gene from Bcl-x, but the homology between rat and mouse extends almost continuously from some distance 5′ to exon 1D through the first coding ATG of Bcl-x, and the regulation of exons 1C and 1D in response to H2O2 is similar to that of exons 1B and Bcl-xL exon 2. Furthermore, the homology between the rat and mouse sequences is lost abruptly some distance 5′ to exon 1D (see on-line Supplemental Material), suggesting that this may be the extreme 5′ end of the gene. The reasons for the lack of homology with the human sequence are not clear. If exons 1C and 1D are part of another gene, it is possible that this gene is elsewhere on the human genome, but we have been unable to find any human sequences with significant homology to the rat/mouse sequences. It seems more probable that evolutionary constraints on the primary sequence were not high. Motifs for internal ribosome entry sites are not conserved at the primary sequence level, and it is the secondary structure that appears to be of prime importance (29Martinez-Salas E. Ramos R. Lafuente E. Lopez deq Uinto S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). If the upstream region of the Bcl-x gene produces a mRNA capable of promoting cap-independent translation, the constraints would therefore be expected to occur at the level of secondary structure rather than primary sequence. Further analysis is required to determine whether the upstream region is relevant to expression of human Bcl-x gene products and if this region does indeed promote translation through cap-independent mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2035431530,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is important in attracting monocytes to sites of inflammation. Using predominantly pharmacological approaches, prior studies have indicated that serine/threonine kinases are involved in the MCP-1-induced signaling pathways. We report here that there is substantial inhibition of MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes treated with inhibitors selective for the subset of serine/threonine kinases, protein kinase C (PKC). Selective inhibitors of PKC such as GF109203X and Calphostin C both caused ∼80% inhibition of chemotaxis. Because these pharmacological inhibitors do not specifically inhibit individual PKC isoforms, we chose to use antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) to specifically reduce PKC isoform expression, first by inhibiting expression of the conventional PKC family, and next by using specific antisense ODN for PKCα and PKCβ. Conventional PKC-antisense ODN treatment completely and significantly inhibited monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1, whereas sense-control ODN caused no significant inhibition. PKCβ-antisense ODN caused 89.2% inhibition of chemotaxis at its highest dose. In contrast, PKCβ-sense ODN and PKCα-antisense and -sense ODN were without effect. Further studies evaluating the calcium response that is triggered upon MCP-1 interaction with its receptor, CCR2, indicate that this response is not altered by antisense or sense ODN treatment, thus supporting our hypothesis that PKCβ is critical for post-receptor signal transduction downstream of the immediate calcium signal. These data contribute to our developing understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in the chemotactic response of human monocytes to MCP-1 and uniquely identify the requirement for the PKCβ isoform in this important process. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is important in attracting monocytes to sites of inflammation. Using predominantly pharmacological approaches, prior studies have indicated that serine/threonine kinases are involved in the MCP-1-induced signaling pathways. We report here that there is substantial inhibition of MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes treated with inhibitors selective for the subset of serine/threonine kinases, protein kinase C (PKC). Selective inhibitors of PKC such as GF109203X and Calphostin C both caused ∼80% inhibition of chemotaxis.

These data contribute to our developing understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in the chemotactic response of human monocytes to MCP-1 and uniquely identify the requirement for the PKCβ isoform in this important process. Recruitment of monocytes into the peripheral tissue is essential for effector responses in inflammation and contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19366) Google Scholar). The monocyte chemotactic response is usually a multistep process involving adhesion molecules, binding, rolling, flattening, and diapedesis. When cells move toward a concentration gradient of a chemotactic factor, the process is known as chemotaxis. Multiple proteins and lipids have been identified as having chemotactic activity; however, a family of small peptides known as chemokines are primarily responsible (2Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemokines are an important group of low molecular weight cytokines that play a major role in chemoattraction and activation of blood leukocytes. They are involved in multiple disease processes and are of major importance during acute and chronic inflammation (3Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). Chemokines are divided into four families depending on their location of the first two cysteines located nearest the NH2 terminus. The families include α, β, lymphotactin, and fractalkine. α chemokines have one amino acid separating the first two cysteines (CXC). β chemokine cysteines are adjacent to each other (CC). In contrast, lymphotactin has only one cysteine (C) in this region, and fractalkine is a membrane-bound protein that has three amino acids separating the first two cysteines (CXXXC) (2Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

It exhibits its most potent chemotactic activity toward monocytes. MCP-1 binds to CCR2 and CCR11 receptors; however, binding to CCR11 does not result in increased intracellular calcium mobilization, which is essential for chemotaxis (17Schweickart V.L. Epp A. Raport C.J. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9550-9556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Further, MCP-1 has a lower affinity for CCR11 than other chemokines. Our studies focus on the intracellular signaling pathways that are involved in the monocyte chemotactic response to MCP-1. CCR2 is one of 11 β-chemokine receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains and coupled to a GTP-binding protein (18Sozzani S. Locati M. Zhou D. Rieppi M. Luini W. Lamorte G. Bianchi G. Polentarutti N. Allavena P. Mantovani A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When MCP-1 binds to CCR2, it results in increased arachidonic acid release and influx of extracellular calcium, which is inhibited by Bordetella pertussis toxin treatments (19Sozzani S. Molino M. Locati M. Luini W. Cerletti C. Vecchi A. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1544-1553PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rollins B.J. Walz A. Baggiolini M.

Serine/threonine kinases are thought to be involved in post-CCR2 signaling as a result of numerous studies using pharmacological inhibitors (18Sozzani S. Locati M. Zhou D. Rieppi M. Luini W. Lamorte G. Bianchi G. Polentarutti N. Allavena P. Mantovani A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P.

General serine/threonine inhibitors such as C1, staurosporine, and H7 have all been shown to inhibit MCP-1-induced chemotaxis in treated monocytes (22Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622PubMed Google Scholar). MCP-1 has been shown to induce a rapid and transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in human monocytes, which was shown to be sensitive to H7 (24Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This evidence indicates that serine/threonine kinases are required for MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis. Because each of the aforementioned inhibitors inhibits PKC as well as other serine/threonine kinases, we designed experiments to examine the role of PKC in regulating monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. To date, at least 12 isoforms of PKC have been identified. They differ in cellular distribution, substrate specificity, and responsiveness to different activation. They are divided into three major groups: conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ); novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ); and atypical PKCs (ς, λ, μ, and ι). Only cPKCs are calcium-dependent; however, all three groups are believed to participate in signal transduction (25Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). In this study, we first used general and selective pharmacological and peptide inhibitors of PKC to verify an involvement of PKC and to suggest the particular group of PKCs that might be regulating this process. We then tested antisense ODN to an mRNA sequence conserved among the cPKC group of PKCs and found that cPKC expression was required for the monocyte chemotactic response to MCP-1. Finally we utilized antisense ODN with the two cPKC enzymes that are expressed in monocytes, PKCα and PKCβ, and found that PKCβ plays a critical role in human monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. Materials—H7, HA1004, GF109203X, and Calphostin C were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Each of these reagents was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as 100-fold stock solutions and stored at 1–20 °C prior to use. PKCβ C2-4 peptide inhibitor from BIOMOL Research Laboratories was dissolved in sterile water at 1 mm stock solution and stored at –20 °C prior to use. Human MCP-1 from Pharmingen was diluted to 50 μg/ml with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as a 1000-fold stock solution and stored at –80 °C. MCP-1 was used at 50 ng/ml to attract human monocytes. Isolation of Human Monocytes and Cell Culture—Human monocytes were isolated from EDTA (3–4 mm) anticoagulated whole blood by sequential centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque density solution. Platelet removal and adherence to tissue culture flasks precoated with bovine calf serum (BCS) for monocyte isolation were performed as described previously (26Cathcart M.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 27Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Nonadherent cells were removed. The adherent cells were released with 5 mm EDTA, washed twice with PBS, and added to polypropylene tubes at 2 × 106 cells/ml. This cell population consisted of more than 95% monocytes (27Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1969PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated monocytes were usually rested for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% BCS at 37 °C in 10% CO2 before use in experiments. Treatment of Cells with Pharmacological Inhibitors—Monocytes were washed once in PBS and resuspended in DMEM without serum. The cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitors and incubated for1hat37 °C with 10% CO2 prior to performing the chemotaxis assay. Treatment of Cells with ODN—The antisense ODN used in our studies were derived from our prior published work, which reported their efficacy (28Li Q. Subbulakshmi V. Fields A.P. Murray N.R. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3764-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence for cPKC-antisense ODN was 5′-CCC CAG ATG AAG TCG GTG CA-3′, and its control-sense ODN sequence was 5′-GGG GTC TAC TTC AGC CAC GT-3′. The sequence for PKCα isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN was 5′-CGC CGT GGA GTC GTT GCC CG-3′, and its control-sense ODN sequence was 5′-CGG GCA ACG ACT CCA CGG CG-3′. Lastly, the sequence for PKCβ isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN was 5′-AGC GCA CGG TGC TCT CCT CG-3′. The control-sense ODN for PKCβ-specific isoenzyme was 5′-CGA GGA GAG CAC CGT GCG CT-3′. Phosphorothioate-modified ODN were used for these studies to limit ODN degradation. Importantly, the oligonucleotides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography prior to use (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX). For these experiments, human monocytes (0.5 ml of 2 × 106 cells/ml in each tube) were cultured in DMEM with 10% BCS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of sense or antisense ODN in polypropylene tubes (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 10% CO2 prior to performing the chemotaxis assay. Western Blotting Analysis—Human monocytes (1 × 106 cells/0.5 ml/tube, in seven tubes; total cells 7 × 106) were incubated in polypropylene tubes with sense or antisense ODN for either PKCα or PKCβ for 24 h in DMEM with 10% BCS. Subsequently, the cells were washed two times with PBS to remove traces of DMEM and 10% BCS. The tubes were placed on ice, and the cells were lysed using 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μl of protease inhibitor mix (Sigma)/ml of lysis buffer). After 30 min, the lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE (100 μg of lysate/well). The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm) (Bio-Rad) using a TRANS-BLOT SD electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and then probed with primary antibody. PKCα protein was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-human recombinant PKCα (H-7) mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). PKCβ protein was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-human recombinant PKCβI (E-3) mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody for PKCβI protein or anti-human recombinant PKCβII (F-7) mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody for PKCβII protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). These were followed by incubation with 1:1000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories). These antibodies recognized a band at the predicted migration of 85 kDa. The hybridization signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's guide and were followed by autoradiography. Chemotaxis Assay—Monocyte migration was evaluated using a microchamber technique (30Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Human recombinant MCP-1 (50 ng/ml) in DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the lower compartment of the disposable 96-well chemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) in a volume totaling 29 μl. The cell suspension (50 μl of 2 × 106 cells/ml; 1 × 105 cells/well) was added to the upper compartment of the chamber that had been precoated with BCS for 2 h. The two compartments were separated by a 5-μm pore size, polycarbonate, polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filter. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C in air with 10% CO2 for 90 min. At the end of the incubation, the filter facing the upper compartment was scraped with a sponge and rinsed gently with PBS to remove all nonmigrated cells. The side of the filter with the migrated cells was fixed and stained with Hema 3 Stain Set (Fisher). Migrated monocytes were counted in five high-power fields (400×) using a light microscope. All samples were tested in triplicate, and the data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Analysis of Intracellular Calcium Mobilization—This method has been described in detail previously by Rabinovitch et al. (31Rabinovitch P.S. June C.H. Grossmann A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 952-961PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended at a final concentration of 3 × 106/ml of cell loading buffer (Hanks' buffered salt solution with 1 mm calcium, 1 mm magnesium, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Probenecid (4 mm) was added in addition to 2 μg/ml acetomethylester form of indo-1 (indo-1 AM, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were loaded at 37 °C for 30 min, washed, resuspended in cell-loading buffer, and stored at room temperature. Analysis was performed on a BD-LSR (BD Biosciences). The UV excitation (325 nm) was provided by a helium/cadmium laser; blue emission was detected at 510–520 nm, and violet emission was detected at 400–440 nm. The results were analyzed by FlowJo 4.2 software and plotted as percent of cells above threshold in violet/blue emission over time. Mean fluorescence in violet/blue emission over time was also determined. H7, a general serine/threonine-kinase inhibitor including inhibition of PKC and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, suppressed MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes in a dose-dependent manner causing 75% inhibition at the highest dose (Fig. 1A). HA1004, a chemical related to H7, inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase preferentially to PKC. HA1004 only caused partial inhibition of monocyte chemotaxis (about 40%), but this was not dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). The H7 finding confirms previously published data (23Sozzani S. Luini W. Molino M. Jilek P. Bottazzi B. Cerletti C. Matsushima K. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2215-2221PubMed Google Scholar). We next investigated the effects of more selective inhibitors of PKC such as GF109203X and Calphostin C. GF109203X is an inhibitor of the cPKC family, whereas Calphostin C inhibits PKC isoforms in both the cPKC family and the nPKC family (32Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 10 μm GF109203X inhibited MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of human monocytes by 80.6% (Fig. 1C). Calphostin C inhibited 79.1% at its highest dose (Fig. 1D). Inhibition mediated by both of these agents was dose-dependent. Calphostin C inhibition indicated that cPKC and/or nPKC isoforms were involved in regulating chemotaxis to MCP-1, but since GF109203X caused equivalent inhibition, it narrowed our focus to the cPKC isoforms. It should be noted that trypan blue staining was performed at the end of all studies using pharmacological inhibitors, and no toxicity was observed. To specifically test whether cPKC was playing a role in MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis, we treated cells with a myristoylated peptide of PKCβII (amino acids 218–226) that was also conserved in PKCα, -βI, and -γ in the C2 domain (BIOMOL Research Laboratories). Among these isoforms, only PKCα and PKCβ are expressed in human monocytes. This resulted in dose-dependent, significant inhibition of chemotaxis (Fig. 2A). We also used a general cPKC-antisense ODN, which was directed to an mRNA sequence that was conserved among the cPKC members, PKCα, -β, and -γ (29Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with this antisense ODN totally inhibited the MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of human monocytes (Fig. 2B). There was very slight inhibition (9%) at 10 μm by the cPKC-sense ODN; however, this was not significant (Fig. 2B). There was no toxicity as assessed by trypan blue staining caused by peptide inhibitor, sense ODN, and antisense ODN at the highest doses. To discriminate between regulation by PKCα and PKCβ, we used antisense ODN selective and specific to these PKC isoforms. These antisense ODNs were previously characterized and were shown to be selective for their targets in opsonized zymosan-activated human monocytes and not to affect the expression of other isoforms (28Li Q. Subbulakshmi V. Fields A.P. Murray N.R. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3764-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We also characterized these antisense ODN in our system by looking at protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 3). PKCα-antisense ODN specifically inhibited PKCα protein without affecting PKCβI- or PKCβII-protein levels (Fig. 3A). PKCα protein expression was inhibited by densitometry 80–90% after being normalized to β-tubulin expression over several experiments (data not shown). PKCβ-antisense ODN specifically inhibited PKCβI- and PKCβII-protein levels without affecting PKCα-protein levels (Fig. 3B). PKCβI-protein expression was inhibited by 70–95%, and PKCβII-protein expression was inhibited by 65–92%, both after being normalized to β-tubulin expression by densitometry over several experiments (data not shown). We used these PKCα- and PKCβ-antisense ODNs to identify the cPKC isoform involved in MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes. Antisense ODN for PKCβ inhibited the monocyte chemotactic response to MCP-1 by 75.4 and 89.2% at 5 and 10 μm, respectively (Fig. 4A). Although PKCβ-sense ODN showed some inhibition (23.8%) at the highest dose, this inhibition was not significant. No reduction of MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis was seen in monocytes treated with PKCα-antisense or -sense ODN (Fig. 4B). Therefore, PKCβ expression is required for MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of human monocytes, whereas PKCα is not involved in this process. To ensure that PKCβ was indeed functioning in a post-receptor signal transduction pathway, we evaluated the effect of the ODN on the MCP-1-induced calcium signal in human monocytes. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5A depicts the numbers of monocytes with increased calcium concentration in response to treatment with ionomycin. Fig. 5B shows similar results for monocytes responding to MCP-1. Neither sense ODN nor antisense ODN affected the number of responding cells (Fig. 5, C and D, respectively, as compared with B). We also evaluated the mean level of fluorescence in these same populations and found no effect of ODN treatment on mean violet over blue fluorescence. Treatment of monocytes with the PKCα-sense ODN and -antisense ODN also did not alter the calcium response induced by MCP-1 (data not shown). Serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in regulating chemotactic responses to MCP-1 (18Sozzani S. Locati M. Zhou D. Rieppi M. Luini W. Lamorte G. Bianchi G. Polentarutti N. Allavena P.

Most studies have used general inhibitors with specificity for a wide range of kinases. More selective inhibitors have been used to investigate the contribution of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and although several investigators have speculated that PKC is required, this has not been definitively shown (23Sozzani S.

In primary human monocytes, PKC has been shown to be part of the signaling pathways controlling the respiratory burst (29Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Myers M.A. McPhail L.C. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 35Pike M.C. Jakoi L.

PKC has been proposed to sustain calcium influx and be involved in the second phase diacylglycerol accumulation during chemotaxis (36Truett 3rd, A.P. Verghese M.W. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. Proc.

To date, no specific inhibitors of PKC have been evaluated for their effects in regulating the chemotaxis of monocytes to MCP-1. Because we have previously shown that antisense ODN can specifically inhibit certain PKC isoforms, we used these tools to address the question of whether PKC participates in regulating MCP-1-induced chemotaxis and if so, what specific isoforms are involved. PKC has been studied in many different cell types and has been shown to be important in chemotaxis to different stimuli. The chemotactic responses of cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and neutrophils have been reported to involve PKC to stimuli such as fMLP, serum amyloid A, macrophage-inflammatory protein α, secretineurin, platelet-activating factor, fibroblast growth factor, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1, and others (43Fine J.S.

Although these studies suggest a general involvement of PKCs in chemotaxis, many of them used general or selective pharmacological inhibitors, which can possibly affect other pathways. Our experience with general pharmacological inhibitors corroborates previous studies and shows that serine/threonine kinases are indeed required for MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes (Fig. 1). In addition, cAMP-dependent protein kinase may be partially involved because of the partial inhibition by HA1004, but the lack of dose-dependent inhibition does not strongly support a role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Fig. 1). Because we did not pursue the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with more selective inhibitors or antisense ODN, definition of its exact role in chemotaxis to MCP-1 will require further investigation. A synthetic peptide, Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-d-Met, has been shown to be a chemotactic stimulus to phagocytic leukocytes including human monocytes (54Bae Y.S. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even though the peptide-induced monocyte chemotaxis is pertussis toxin-sensitive, the peptide-specific receptor is different from receptors for MCP-1 and is insensitive to GF109203X. Chemotaxis to Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-d-Met is sensitive to genistein (a tyrosine kinase pharmacological inhibitor) and a Rho-A inhibitor. This finding highlights the concept that different chemotactic stimuli for human monocytes can act through different receptors and involve different signaling pathways. A study using pharmacological inhibitors indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity are not required for monocyte migration toward MCP-1, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), MIP (macrophage inflammatory protein)-1α, or fMLP using wortmannin, LY294002, and PD098059 (43Fine J.S. Byrnes H.D. Zavodny P.J. Hipkin R.W. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, other studies in which monocytes were pretreated with wortmannin and PD098059 showed direct inhibition of MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis (24Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, some studies using pharmacological inhibitors are conflicting. Other studies from knockout mice indicate the importance of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in macrophage chemotaxis to a variety of stimuli; however, chemotaxis to MCP-1 was not evaluated (55Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Additionally, the study investigating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase focused on MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of monocytes and found that GF109203X did not affect monocyte migration alone; however, pretreatment of monocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly impaired the response to MCP-1 and other chemotactic agents such as fMLP (43Fine J.S. Byrnes H.D. Zavodny P.J. Hipkin R.W. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). That study showed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibition was reversed by co-treatment with GF109203X implying that PKC activation is capable of desensitizing MCP-1- and fMLP-induced monocyte chemotaxis. That report is different from our results, which show that pretreatment with GF109203X directly inhibits MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes (Fig. 1C). Their study relied entirely on pharmacological inhibitors/activators and did not address the particular isoforms of PKC involved (43Fine J.S. Byrnes H.D. Zavodny P.J. Hipkin R.W. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to our observations that GF109203X inhibits monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1, we also show that Calphostin C is an equally effective inhibitor of this process (Fig. 1D). Because there are conflicting studies using pharmacological inhibitors and the specificity of these drugs remains uncertain, we found it necessary to use other more selective and specific inhibitors such as antisense ODN. One of our important findings is that a cPKC peptide inhibitor and cPKC-antisense ODN were able to substantially and significantly inhibit MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of human monocytes (Fig. 2). Because PKCγ is not expressed in human monocytes, this led us to focus on PKCα and PKCβ isoenzymes. We show the isoenzyme specificity of PKCα- and PKCβ-antisense ODN in primary human monocytes (Fig. 3) and indicate that these reagents do not inhibit the initial receptor response such as intracellular calcium mobilization (Fig. 5). Our novel finding is that PKCβ is an essential cPKC isoform in MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human monocytes in vitro (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PKCα-antisense ODN had no effect (Fig. 4B). An atypical PKC isoform, PKCζ, was shown to be essential in the chemotaxis of neutrophils to IL-8 and fMLP (56Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This study used pseudosubstrate peptides to PKCζ and PKCα and demonstrated that PKCζ, and not PKCα, was essential in adhesion and chemotaxis to IL-8 and fMLP in neutrophils. Lastly, the study showed that pharmacological inhibitors to classic and novel PKC families such as Calphostin C, G06850, and G06976 had no effect on adhesion or chemotaxis in pretreated neutrophils. It is possible that α chemokines such as IL-8 activate different PKC isoforms than β chemokines like MCP-1. Thus, different cells appear to utilize alternative regulatory pathways in chemotaxis, and these differences may serve as a focus for further investigation. We have previously shown that iPLA2 is essential in human monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 using antisense ODN and have confirmed the importance of cPLA2 (57Carnevale K.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, iPLA2-antisense ODN inhibition of MCP-1-stimulated chemotaxis was restored by lysophosphatidic acid and not arachidonic acid, whereas the reverse was found for cPLA2-antisense ODN inhibition. The exact mechanism of their involvement in chemotaxis is unknown; however, they seem to be independently involved. Both novel and conventional PKC isoforms have been implicated in phosphorylation of iPLA2 in ventricular myocytes and in the zymosan-activated macrophage cell line, P388D1 cells (58Steer S.A.

Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of these enzymes after MCP-1 stimulation remain unknown; however, this is an important direction for future studies. In summary, relatively little is known about the regulation of monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. The majority of studies have used pharmacological inhibitors to understand possible pathways that may be involved. Some pathways that have been implicated as regulators of monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C, and PLA2 (18Sozzani S.

Blood. 2001; 97: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our study clearly demonstrates that the cPKC isoform, PKCβ, is essential for human monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. The exact role that PKCβ is playing in the signaling pathway is unknown and is the topic of our current studies. PKCβII has previously been shown to bind and be activated by cytoskeletal elements such as F-actin (62Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Additionally, T-cell initiation of crawling locomotion via integrin receptors is dependent on the phosphorylation of microtubules by PKCβI (63Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Whatever mechanism PKCβ regulates, it may serve as a specific target for inhibiting human monocyte chemotaxis in different disease processes while possibly not affecting neutrophil migration or monocyte migration to other chemokines.

After co-reconstitution of the ab2 subcomplex with purified subunit c, passive proton translocation rates as well as coupled ATPase activities after binding of F1 were measured that were comparable with those of wild type F0. The interaction between subunits a and b, which has been shown to be stoichiometric and functional, is not triggered by any cross-linking reagent and therefore reflects subunit interactions occurring within the F0 complex in vivo."

A large number of mutations have been identified in tyrosinase, with many leading to its misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, and degradation. Here we describe the folding and maturation of human tyrosinase (TYR) using an in vitro translation system coupled with ER-derived microsomes or with semipermeabilized cells, as an intact ER source. TYR remained misfolded as determined by its sensitivity to trypsin digestion and its persistent interaction with the ER resident lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin when produced in ER-derived microsomes or nonmelanocytic semipermeabilized cells. However, when TYR was translocated into semipermeabilized melanocytes, chaperone interactions were transient, maturation progressed to a trypsin-resistant state, and a TYR homodimer was formed. The use of semipermeabilized mouse melanocytes defective for tyrosinase or other melanocyte-specific proteins as the ER source indicated that proper TYR maturation and oligomerization were greatly aided by the presence of wild type tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1.

Tyrosinase (monophenol monooxygenase; EC 1.14.18.1) catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation step in melanin production (1Lerner A.B. Fitzpatrick T.B. Calkins E. Summerson W.H. J. Biol.

This melanocyte-specific type I membrane glycoprotein is localized to the post-Golgi compartment termed the melanosome (for review, see Ref. 2Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

In addition, wild type (WT) tyrosinase in amelanotic melanoma cells is retained in the ER in response to an acidic environment characteristic of tumor cells and is eventually subjected to ER-associated protein degradation (7Halaban R.

Tyrosinase has been used as a model substrate to study glycoprotein maturation in the secretory pathway because of its association with human inherited conditions and the ease in assessing its enzymatic activity by monitoring the production of melanin.Proteins that traverse the eukaryotic secretory pathway, such as tyrosinase, are generally co-translationally inserted through a translocon located within the ER membrane (9Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Upon emergence of the polypeptide chain into the ER lumen, the protein is immersed into a specialized maturation environment. The oxidizing conditions of the ER support protein-assisted disulfide bond formation (10Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Additional ER protein-mediated maturation processes include signal sequence cleavage, protein folding, glycan transfer and trimming, chaperone binding, and oligomerization (11Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Understanding these maturation steps has implications for the etiology of albinism, the production of antigenic peptides associated with melanoma, and the wide array of other ER retention diseases.Human tyrosinase (TYR) contains seven N-linked glycosylation sites. Although all seven sites are utilized, one site (Asn290) is inefficiently processed due to an adjacent Pro residue (Asn-Gly-Thr-Pro) (12Újvári A. Aron R. Eisenhaure T. Cheng E. Parag H.A. Smicun Y. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5924-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of this inefficient glycosylation site, which is absent in mouse tyrosinase (Tyr), creates a heterogeneous population of TYR possessing six or seven glycans. Glycan trimming by glucosidases I and II generates monoglucosylated side chains, which are, in turn, substrates for calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT), ER lectin chaperones that specifically bind monoglucosylated glycans (13Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 14Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The interaction of CNX and CRT with TYR appears to be essential for its proper maturation and the acquisition of its activity within the cell. Inhibition of glucose trimming in human melanoma cells decreased TYR activity and stability (15Takahashi H. Parsons P.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 481-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, inactive tyrosinase was produced in B16 mouse melanoma cells treated with glucosidase inhibitors (16Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.-J. Titu H.N. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol.

Reglucosylation by the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which reglucosylates proteins containing non-native regions (18Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), can initiate rebinding of the substrates to the lectin chaperones (19Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar).In this study, a semipermeabilized melanocyte system coupled with in vitro translations that supported the proper oxidation, chaperone binding, and oligomerization of TYR was developed. This system provides a high degree of experimental versatility, as well as the ability to isolate and identify the ER components required for TYR maturation. We found that TYR matured to a newly defined homodimer after oxidation and release from CNX. This oligomerization required melanocyte-specific factors.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), wheat germ (WG), dithiothreitol, and RNasin were from Promega.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS; 14 mm) in 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS to block free sulfhydryls. Lysates of alkylated samples were analyzed directly on SDS-PAGE or after immunoprecipitation with various antibodies before electrophoresis. In most experiments, one half of the sample was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and the other half was reduced by the addition of dithiothreitol (100 mm) before electrophoresis.Preparation of Semipermeabilized Cells—Semipermeabilized cells were prepared from confluent cultures as described previously (24Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent cells (∼5 × 107 cells) were detached from the culture dish (75 cm2) with 4 ml of a solution of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and collected in 8 ml of KHM buffer (110 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in KHM buffer (6 ml) and permeabilized with digitonin (20 μg/ml) on ice for 5 min. Permeabilization was stopped by the addition of KHM buffer (8 ml) followed by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer (14 ml; 50 mm KOAc, 90 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 7 min at 0 °C. Pellets were resuspended in KHM buffer (∼4 × 106 cells/100 μl KHM) and treated with a calcium-dependent nuclease at 25 °C for 12 min to remove the endogenous mRNAs. Nuclease treatment was stopped by EGTA (final concentration, 4 mm). The cells were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and cell pellets were resuspended in KHM buffer to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells/μl. Radioactively labeled TYR was translated for 1 h at 27 °C in RRL with semipermeabilized cells (1.3 × 104 cells/μl) substituting for the rough ER-derived microsomes.Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—To determine the size of the monomeric and oligomeric TYR generated with semipermeabilized cell system, 35S-labeled samples were lysed in 2% CHAPS in 90 mm HEPES and 50 mm NaCl (HBS), pH 7.5. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant (150 μl) was layered on top of a 5–25% linear sucrose gradient (4 ml) in HBS supplemented with 0.5% CHAPS, pH 7.5. The gradients were centrifuged at ∼197,600 × g in a Beckman (Model L80-M) ultracentrifuge for 15 h at 4 °C; fractions were collected manually, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TYR antibodies, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Trypsin Digestion—Radioactively labeled in vitro-translated TYR was treated with trypsin to assess its stability. After increasing maturation times, samples were removed, and free thiols were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide. ER-translocated TYR was isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Microsome or semipermeabilized cell pellets were solubilized in 1% CHAPS/HBS (25 μl/10 μl translation mixture) and divided into two fractions. Trypsin was added to one set of samples (1–3 ng/μl), followed by incubation at 27 °C for 10 min. The digestions were stopped with soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (4 mm).Chemical Cross-linking—To identify the TYR oligomer, WT Tyr or mutant (TyrC85S) albino mouse melanocytes were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1–3 × 106), and half of the samples were subjected to chemical cross-linking with bismaleimidohexane (BMH; 1 mm) at 25 °C for 30 min followed by blocking with 2-mercaptoethanol (10 mm). After centrifugation, cell pellets were lysed with 2% CHAPS/HBS supplemented with protease inhibitors, cell lysates were cleared from debris by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to Western blotting with anti-tyrosinase M-19 goat polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSDefective TYR Maturation in Rough ER Microsomes Derived from Pancreatic Acinar Cells—A cell-free system was used to characterize the maturation of TYR in the early secretory pathway. We have shown previously that ER translocation and co-translational glycosylation of TYR can be monitored in a cell-free system composed of an in vitro translation system coupled with canine pancreas ER-derived microsomes (12Újvári A. Aron R. Eisenhaure T. Cheng E. Parag H.A. Smicun Y. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5924-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In these studies, replacing the native signal sequence of TYR with that of the murine major histocompatibility complex class I molecule Kb (KbSS) increased the efficiency of translation and translocation by severalfold. Therefore, this construct, termed pSP72-KbSS/TYR, has been used throughout the following studies and is referred to as WT TYR.To monitor the oxidation of TYR in the ER, WT TYR was translated in RRL or WG translation systems supplemented with rough ER-derived microsomes. After 1 h of translation, protein synthesis was arrested with cycloheximide, and the protein was allowed to mature for increasing periods of time (Fig. 1A). The oxidative state of TYR was trapped with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide and analyzed directly (Lysate) or after immunoprecipitation with anti-tyrosinase antibodies (α-TYR) by nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE.ER-translocated and N-linked glycosylated TYR (TYR) appeared as a 70-kDa doublet upon reduction (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). The doublet corresponds to TYR possessing all seven (TYR7) or six (TYR6) N-linked glycans (12Újvári A. Aron R. Eisenhaure T. Cheng E. Parag H.A. Smicun Y. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5924-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As reported previously, the fraction of TYR6 was increased in the faster-translating RRL system compared with the slower WG translation, where each form was present in equal amounts. In the nonreduced (NR) samples, TYR displayed a slight increase in mobility indicative of intramolecular disulfide formation creating a more compact structure (Fig. 1A, top panel). TYR aggregates were also observed at the top of the nonreduced gel. These aggregates disappeared upon reduction, demonstrating that they involved intermolecular disulfide bonds. An artifact of the cell-free maturation system is the generation of untranslocated protein ( UTYR) that is not properly targeted to the ER microsomes. Therefore, translated TYR also accumulates as unglycosylated protein possessing an intact N-terminal signal sequence with an electrophoretic mobility of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). The untranslocated protein accounts for a portion of the aggregates observed upon oxidation.TYR has 15 lumenal Cys that can potentially form multiple intra- and/or intermolecular disulfide bonds. Because the mobility shift observed under nonreduced conditions was slight, the status of the Cys thiols upon oxidation was determined by modification of free thiols with a bulky membrane-impermeable alkylating agent, AMS (536 Da). Radioactively labeled TYR was translated in RRL or in WG in the presence of ER-derived microsomes under reducing or oxidizing conditions, followed by alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide or AMS before SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. A large decrease in mobility of translocated and untranslocated TYR was observed when the protein was translated under reducing conditions, in which Cys residues are accessible to AMS (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). However, no mobility shift in TYR was seen under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8), indicating that most of the Cys residues were protected from alkylation, probably due to their involvement in disulfide bonds. Similar results were observed regardless of the cell-free translation system used (RRL or WG), indicating that TYR formed disulfide bonds in both conditions.Calnexin Binding to TYR Persists in the RER Microsomes— Chaperones bind transiently to substrates until they acquire correct tertiary or quaternary structure. Similarly, TYR associates with two lectin chaperones, CNX and CRT, before exit from the ER (7Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether TYR was maturing correctly in ER-derived microsomes by monitoring complex formation with CNX. Immunoprecipitation of radioactively labeled TYR with anti-TYR (α-TYR) or anti-CNX (α-CNX) antibodies showed that TYR interaction with CNX persisted even after 4 h of processing, regardless of the cell-free system used (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6 and 10–12). Persistent interactions were similarly observed for CRT, the soluble lumenal paralogue of CNX (data not shown). Therefore, unlike other membrane glycoproteins such as influenza hemagglutinin and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (14Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 25Cannon K.S. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the canine pancreatic microsomes cell-free system does not support the proper maturation of the type I membrane glycoprotein TYR.TYR Matures Efficiently in Semipermeabilized Melanocytes—Since TYR is a melanocyte-specific protein, it is possible that a factor specific to melanocytes is required for its proper maturation. To address this concern, we used a semipermeabilized cell system that can be coupled to the in vitro translation of a substrate (26Wilson C.M. Farmery M.R. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21224-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Treatment of mouse melanocytes with digitonin produced semipermeabilized cells with a leaky plasma membrane but an intact ER as confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). We have previously found that this semipermeabilized melanocyte system supports the efficient ER translocation and glycosylation of TYR (12Újvári A. Aron R. Eisenhaure T. Cheng E. Parag H.A. Smicun Y. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5924-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).In vitro-translated TYR translocated into the ER of wild type semipermeabilized melanocytes was analyzed directly or after immunoprecipitation with anti-TYR or anti-CNX antibodies. As previously observed in microsomes, TYR translocated into the ER from semipermeabilized cells migrated as a doublet (Fig. 2A, lane 1). TYR migrated faster in SDS-PAGE under nonreduced (NR) compared with reduced (RD) conditions after 2 and 4 h of maturation, indicative of disulfide bond formation (Fig. 2, compare A with B). Interestingly, a disulfide-linked oligomer band of 140 kDa appeared after 2 h of maturation, increasing in intensity with time (Fig. 2A, arrow). This oligomer disappeared after reduction, suggesting that it was created by intermolecular disulfide bonds (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2TYR matures and oligomerizes in semipermeabilized wild type melanocytes. WT TYR translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of semipermeabilzied wild type mouse melanocytes was allowed to mature for increasing periods of time. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-TYR or anti-CNX antibodies. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were visualized by autoradiography after nonreducing (NR; A) and reducing (RD; B) SDS-PAGE. C, TYR was translated under oxidizing condition for the indicated times in the presence of microsomes (MS) or semipermeabilized melanocytes (SP melan). Translocated proteins were separated by centrifugation of the membranes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Solubilized membrane pellets were treated with trypsin at 25 °C for 10 min, and reduced samples were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. D, TYR oxidation was initiated during translation (co-translationally, Co-T; lanes 1 and 2) or post-translationally (Post-T; lanes 3 and 4) by the addition of FAD. Radioactive TYR was resolved by nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE. The arrow indicates TYR oligomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Evidence for proper maturation in semipermeabilized melanocytes was provided by the transient binding of CNX to TYR. The CNX·TYR complex observed during the first 2 h of processing was greatly diminished at the end of 4 h of maturation (Fig. 2A, lane 9). Furthermore, the 140-kDa TYR oligomer was not bound by CNX. The temporal relationship indicated that TYR oligomerization occurred after CNX release and is a properly folded form because CNX is released from monoglucosylated substrates once the substrate is trimmed of its final glucose and is no longer reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (13Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 14Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The time-dependent accumulation of trimmed or unglucosylated TYR side chains was supported by the persistence of an increase in TYR mobility observed after reduction with dithiothreitol (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–15).Resistance to limited proteolysis was used as an additional measure for TYR maturation because folded proteins acquire a more stable conformation that is often resistant to digestion by proteases. The vast majority of TYR produced in the RRL microsome system under oxidizing conditions that permit the formation of disulfide bonds remained protease-sensitive, even after 8 h of maturation (Fig. 2C, bottom panel, lanes 5–8). In contrast, a substantial level of trypsin-resistant TYR was already present after 4 h of maturation, a time at which CNX no longer bound to TYR. Therefore, semipermeabilized melanocytes appear to support the proper folding of TYR in the ER.Folding and disulfide bond formation commence co-translationally in the ER (27Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether TYR could form oligomers when proper oxidizing conditions were initiated post-translationally, 35S-TYR was translated for 1 h under reducing condition, and the oxidizing agent FAD was added after inhibition of further protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig. 2D). Oligomerization of TYR was observed after 4 h of post-translational oxidation, indicating that the physiological co-translational maturation process was not obligatory for oligomerization in semipermeabilized melanocytes (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 4).Time-dependent Oligomerization of TYR—To further characterize the oligomeric state, 35S-TYR generated in the presence of WT semipermeabilized mouse melanocytes was solubilized with the nondenaturing detergent CHAPS and subjected to centrifugation through a 5–25% linear sucrose gradient. After 1 h of processing, TYR was predominantly in the ∼5S form (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7, 1hr) corresponding to monomeric TYR. An additional smaller peak in lanes 8–10 was indicative of oligomeric TYR of ∼8S. The quaternary structure of the 8S form of TYR was disrupted by an ionic detergent because it migrated as a monomer of 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The 8S isoform likely represented TYR heterocomplexes with CNX and/or CRT because the interaction is stable in CHAPS but not in SDS-containing buffer (28Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Characterization of TYR oligomer by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Radioactively labeled tyrosinase samples were lysed in 2% CHAPS and separated on a 5–25% linear sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. TYR was immunoprecipitated with anti-TYR antibodies before separation by nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After further maturation for 2 and 4 h, the monomeric peak moved from lane 7 to lane 6, indicative of a decline in CNX and CRT binding to TYR. In addition, a 7.5 S peak that was resolved as ∼150 kDa by SDS-PAGE emerged (Fig. 3, 2hr and 4hr, arrow). The intensity of this peak increased with time, as did the aggregated form of TYR, which accumulated at the top of the gel. Both velocity centrifugation and SDS-PAG"

In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), OnM transiently elevates mRNA encoding for suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). By 1 h of OnM treatment, HUVEC become refractory to the restimulation by OnM, measured as failure to reinduce SOCS-3 mRNA. OnM-induced desensitization also prevents responses to other gp130-signaling cytokines (e.g. leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin 11). OnM treatment does not affect gp130 expression levels and desensitizes signaling mediated by a transduced chimeric receptor containing extracellular domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) and the cytoplasmic region of gp130. Interestingly, a chimeric PDGFRβ-gp130 mutant receptor, in which intracellular Tyr residue 759 of gp130 is replaced by a Phe residue, mediates prolonged signaling and is not cross-desensitized by OnM. Phospho-Tyr759 is the binding site for both SOCS-3 and for Src homology domain 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2). In human aortic smooth muscle cells, neither prevention of SOCS-3 protein induction, using STAT3 or SOCS-3 antisense, nor prevention of SHP-2 expression, also with antisense, ablates desensitization. These data suggest that desensitization of vascular cells to OnM is mediated in trans and involves Tyr residue 759 in gp130 but is not mediated by either SOCS-3 or SHP-2, the only two proteins currently known to bind to gp130 at this site.

Other members of this family include IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1. OnM, IL-6, and IL-11 have overlapping immunoregulatory and cytoprotective effects that reduce both inflammation and host injury (1Trepicchio W.L. Bozza M. Pedneault G. Dorner A.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3627-3634Google Scholar, 2Qiu B.S. Pfeiffer C.J. Keith Jr., J.C. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1996; 41: 1625-1630Google Scholar, 3Wallace P.M. MacMaster J.F. Rouleau K.A. Brown T.J. Loy J.K. Donaldson K.L. Wahl A.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5547-5555Google Scholar). This functional redundancy can be explained by the shared use of a common cytokine receptor signaling subunit, called gp130, by all members of this family (4Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-4111Google Scholar). In the case of IL-6 or IL-11, cytokine binds to cell surface-associated receptor subunits (α chains) that lack signaling domains. Ligand binding induces association of these α chains with gp130 and causes gp130 homodimer formation. OnM initiates signals by binding directly to gp130 and the OnM/gp130 complex induces formation of either a LIFRα-gp130 receptor complex or an OnMRβ-gp130 receptor complex (5Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658Google Scholar, 6Anhuf D. Weissenbach M. Schmitz J. Sobota R. Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Linnemann S. Behrmann I. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2535-2543Google Scholar). Binding of LIF to LIFRα chain results in the formation of the LIFRα-gp130 receptor complex. Each of these clustered receptors initiates signaling via transphosphorylation of receptor-associated cytosolic tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family, namely Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) (7Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Google Scholar). Once activated, these kinases phosphorylate gp130 on several intracellular tyrosine residues, providing docking sites for various cytoplasmic proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH-2) domains. For example, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) binds to four different phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the intracellular region of gp130 (Tyr767, Tyr814, Tyr905, and Tyr915); two of these tyrosine residues (Tyr905 and Tyr915) also contribute to the binding of STAT1 (8Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Google Scholar, 9Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr residue 759 leads to recruitment of SH-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) (10Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Google Scholar, 11Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Google Scholar, 12Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Bode J.G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol.

Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Google Scholar). STAT and SHP-2 molecules bound to gp130 subsequently become tyrosine phosphorylated by receptor-associated JAKs. Phospho-STAT proteins form homo- and/or heterodimers which translocate to the nucleus where they act as transcriptional activators of cytokine-inducible genes. SHP-2 is thought to provide regulatory feedback through its phosphatase activity but also acts as a gp130-associated linker/adapter protein, binding Grb2/Sos and initiating the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway independent of its tyrosine phosphatase activity (11Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Google Scholar, 15Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Google Scholar). The same phosphotyrosine residue that binds SHP-2 also recruits suppressor of cytokine signaling protein (SOCS-3). OnM, but not IL-6 or LIF, induces recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) which, in turn results, in membrane association phosphorylation, and activation of PI-3 dependent kinases and of protein kinase B/AKT (16Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Olivier C. Auguste P. Chabbert M. Lelievre E. Chevalier S. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Google Scholar). This response is initiated by phosphorylation of Tyr residue 861 in the OnMRβ chain (16Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Olivier C. Auguste P. Chabbert M. Lelievre E. Chevalier S. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Google Scholar). Activation of signal transduction pathways through gp130 are transient, implying that JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway activated through gp130 is under negative control. As noted above, SHP-2 is a potential regulator of this pathway (17Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Google Scholar, 18Stein-Gerlach M. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 559-566Google Scholar). SHP-2 is an ubiquitiously expressed and highly conserved enzyme. JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 is believed to increase its catalytic activity (19Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar). SHP-2 can down-regulate gp130-mediated signaling upon association with the phosphorylated Tyr residue 759 of gp130 by exerting tyrosine phosphatase activity both on other tyrosine residues of the receptor and possibly on associated JAK proteins (11Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Google Scholar, 12Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Bode J.G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18810-18817Google Scholar, 14Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr residue 759 to Phe in gp130 inhibits SHP-2 binding to gp130 and leads to elevated and prolonged activation of JAKs and STATs. SOCS proteins have also been implicated in the down-regulation of gp130 signaling (10Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol.

Overexpression of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 inhibits IL-6- and LIF-induced differentiation of murine monocytic leukemia M1 cells and LIF induction of a STAT3-responsive reporter construct in 293T fibroblast (22Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Google Scholar). SOCS-1 protein interacts directly with JAKs by binding to their activation loop in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (20Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Google Scholar). In contrast, SOCS-3 binds directly to Tyr residue 759 on gp130 (10Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Google Scholar, 12Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Bode J.G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18810-18817Google Scholar), and this interaction is necessary for the inhibitory effect of overexpressed SOCS-3, but not of SOCS-1, on both STAT1 and STAT3 activation in HepG2 cells (10Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Google Scholar). SOCS-3 mRNA is rapidly and transiently induced by IL-6 and LIF, and LIF-stimulated SOCS-3 gene expression is at least in part is mediated by STAT3 and STAT1 (23Blanchard F. Wang Y. Kinzie E. Duplomb L. Godard A. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47038-47045Google Scholar, 24Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Google Scholar, 25Paul C.

Net. 2001; 12: 309-315Google Scholar). In this way, SOCS-3 acts as a negative regulator of its own gene expression. We have previously shown that in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) OnM and IL-11 rapidly but transiently activate STAT1, STAT3, p42, and p44 MAPK (27Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Google Scholar). Tyr residue 759 of gp130 signaling domain was demonstrated to be necessary for this transience of activation of STAT1 in HUVEC (27Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Google Scholar), implying that the short duration of active signaling through gp130 is mediated by SHP-2 or SOCS-3. In the present study, we show that stimulation with OnM desensitizes HUVEC as well as human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) to further activation by OnM. Desensitization can occur in trans, affecting other gp130-signaling cytokines, and also involves Tyr residue 759 in gp130. However, our data indicate that this desensitization is not mediated by either SOCS-3 or SHP-2, the only two proteins to date shown to bind to this site. Reagents, Cells, and Treatment Protocol—Recombinant human OnM was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGFBB) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant human IL-11 was provided by Genetics Institute (Andover, MA).

Mouse monoclonal Ab to SHP-2 and mouse monoclonal Ab to JAK1 were purchased from BD Pharmingen (Los Angeles, CA). Rabbit polyclonal Ab to phosphotyrosine JAK1 was purchased from Biosource International, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Mouse monoclonal Ab to hemagglutinin (HA) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal Ab to gp130 and mouse monoclonal Ab to phosphotyrosine were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Human umbilical vein EC were isolated from discarded umbilical cords as previously described (28Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28Google Scholar, 29Thornton S.C. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. Science. 1983; 222: 623-625Google Scholar) under a protocol approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee. ECs from 3–5 cords were pooled and serially cultured on gelatin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ)-coated tissue culture plastic at 37 °C in 5% CO2-humidified air in Medium 199 containing 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) 50 μg/ml of fibroblast growth factor-1 (Collaborative Research/Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) and 100 μg/ml of porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma). Confluent cultures were serially passaged, and cells were typically used at the second or third subculture. Such cultures are uniformly positive for von Willebrand factor and CD31 and lack detectable contamination by CD45-expressing leukocytes. HASMC were isolated from aorta removed from donor human heart prior to transplantation under a protocol approved by Yale Human Investigation Committee. The intimal cell layer and adventitial layer were peeled off, and the medial layer, containing smooth muscle cells, was dissected into small fragments, which were explanted on gelatin-coated tissue culture plastic at 37 °C in 5% CO2-humidified air in Medium 199 containing 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin to permit outgrowth of HASMC. Confluent HASMC cultures were serially passaged in the same media, and cells were typically used at the second or third subculture. Such cells are uniformly positive for smooth muscle specific α-actin. The Phoenix-Ampho packaging cell line for production of high titer amphotropic retroviruses was obtained from Dr. G. Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To perform pretreatment experiments, cells were pretreated with OnM for various times as indicated. The medium was removed, and cells were then treated with either OnM, LIF, or IL-11 for the times indicated. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC with Qiagen Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) as recommended by the supplier. Total RNA was quantitated by OD at 260 using a Du-64 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Columbia, MD). Using equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) from HUVEC, stimulated under various conditions, mRNA was primed with random hexamers, and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from mRNA by TaqMan reverse transcription with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster, CT) according to the manufacturer's description. The final cDNA product was used for subsequent cDNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction. cDNA was amplified and quantitated by using SYBR Green PCR reagents from PE Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cDNA for SOCS-3 and GAPDH were amplified by AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase using specific primers, which were synthesized by Yale HHMI/Keck oligonucleotide synthetic facility (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The cDNA for GAPDH was amplified by using a specific forward primer (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′) and a specific reverse primer (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′). The following specific primers were used to amplify SOCS-3 cDNA: a forward primer, 5′-GGCCACTCTTCAGCATCTC-3′ and a reverse primer, 5′-ATCGTACTGGTCCAGGAACTC-3′. The PCR reaction mixture (final volume 25 μl) contained 5 μl of cDNA, 1 μl of 10 μm forward primer, 1 μl of 10 μm reverse primer, 2.5 μl of PCR 10× SYBR Green PCR buffer, 3 μl of 25mm MgCl2, 2 μl of dNTP mix (2.5 mm dATP, 2.5 mm dCTP, 2.5 mm dGTP, and 5 mm dUTP), 0.25 μl of AmpErase UNG (1 unit/μl uracil-N-glycosylase), 0.125 μl of AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase (5 units/μl AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase), and 10.125 μl of H2O. The PCR reaction was performed in triplicate (3 wells of C96 well plate). The reaction was amplified with iCycler iQ Multicolor Real Time PCR Detector (Bio-Rad) for 37 cycles with melting at 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min in iCycler iQ PCR 96-well plates (Bio-Rad). The relative quantification values for the SOCS-3 gene expression were calculated from the accurate CT, which is the PCR cycle at which an increase in reporter fluorescence from SYBR Green dye can be first detected obtained above a baseline signal. CT values for GAPDH cDNA were subtracted from CT values for SOCS-3 cDNA for each well to calculate Δ-CT. The triplicate Δ-CT values for each sample were averaged. To calculate the fold induction of SOCS-3 mRNA in cells treated with cytokines over control cells, the averaged Δ-CT values calculated for control cells was subtracted from Δ-CT values calculated for cytokine-treated cells to calculate ΔΔ-CT. Then, the fold induction for each well was calculated by using 2–(ΔΔ-CT) formula. The fold induction value for triplicate wells was averaged, and data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate wells. Immunoblotting—Following the indicated treatment, confluent EC cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride and lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentrations of the supernatant were determined by using a Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad). Clarified lysates were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and heating the mixture in a boiling water bath for 3 min. 20 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electrophoresis. After blocking with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with blocking solution containing the indicated Ab overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detecting reagent specific for the primary Ab (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA), and HRP activity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Exposed films were scanned using a laser densitometer (Fast Scan, Series 300, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). gp130 was immunoprecipitated and P-gp130 was detected as described previously (27Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation prior to immunoblotting of P-JAK1, 500 μg of total cell lysate was precleared by addition of 50 μl of GammaBind G Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with continual incubation on a rotator at 4 °C for 90 min. The beads were removed from the precleared lysates by centrifugation. To form specific immune complexes, 2.5 μg of anti-JAK1 Ab was added to the precleared lysate, which was then incubated for 3 h on a rotator at 4 °C. To collect specific immune complexes, 50 μl of GammaBind G Sepharose beads were added and the sample was incubated on a rotator at 4 °C overnight at which time beads were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min. The beads containing immune complexes were washed five times with PBS, the immune complexes were solubilized from the beads by addition of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for total JAK1 and for P-JAK1, as described above. Direct Immunofluorescence and FACS Analysis—For immunostaining, HUVEC were washed with Hanks-buffered saline solution and incubated for 1 min with trypsin/EDTA. Detached cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated with specific phycoerythrin(PE)-conjugated mouse monoclonal Ab to gp130 (R&D Systems) or control PE-conjugated mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS/1% BSA and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were analyzed by FACS using a FACSort and Lysis II software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Corrected mean fluorescence values were calculated as follows: for each treatment the mean fluorescence value for control PE-conjugated mouse IgG was subtracted from the mean fluorescence value for the specific PE-conjugated Ab to gp130. Construction of Retroviral Vectors Expressing Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP), PDGFRβ-gp130, and (Δ446–474)SHP-2—Retroviral expression vectors coding for chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domains of human PDGFRβ receptor and transmembrane and cytosolic portions of wild-type gp130 (gp130(Tyr759)) or mutant gp130 (gp130(Y759F)), in which Tyr residue 759 was replaced with Phe, were constructed as described previously (27Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Google Scholar). Retroviral expression vectors coding for [Δ446–474]SHP-2 was constructed as follows. Human SHP-2 cDNA coding for SHP-2, which lacks amino acids 446–474 ([Δ446–474]SHP-2) in expression vector pBluescript KS was kindly provided by Dr. A. Bennett (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The cDNA was isolated by PCR amplification, and a sequence coding for HA was tagged into 5′-end of the cDNA. The BamH1-EcoR1 fragment containing cDNA coding [Δ446–474]SHP-2-HA was subcloned into the LZRSpBMN-Z retroviral vector using 5′ BamH1 and 3′ EcoR1 cloning sites. The LZRSpBMN-Z retroviral vector and LZRSpBMN-Z retroviral vector containing EGFP was kindly provided from Dr. A. Bothwell (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) (30Zheng L. Dengler T.J. Kluger M.S. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Maher S.E. Pober J.S. Bothwell A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4665-4671Google Scholar). These retroviral vectors containing EGFP, PDGFRβ-gp130(Tyr759), and PDGFRβ-gp130(Y759F), and [Δ446–474]SHP-2-HA were directly transfected into the Phoenix-Amphoteric packaging cell line using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection Phoenix cells were selected in media containing puromycin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma), and puromycin-resistant cells were used to condition medium, providing a source of retroviral stock. Transduction of HUVEC was accomplished by serial infections over 2 weeks without drug selection as previously described (30Zheng L. Dengler T.J. Kluger M.S. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Maher S.E. Pober J.S. Bothwell A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4665-4671Google Scholar). A round of viral infections in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml) (Sigma) was performed for 5 h with HUVEC in primary culture. The normal growth medium was replaced, and cells were maintained overnight. The infection was repeated the next day. After the second round of infection, cells were passaged, and then the process of double infection was repeated. Using this protocol the percentage of HUVEC expressing transduced genes is routinely >95%. Antisense Oligonucleotide Transfection of HASMC—Specific antisense oligonucleotides for human STAT3, human SHP-2, and mismatch controls were designed and synthesized by ISIS Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA). The following oligonucleotides were used: SHP-2 antisense (ISIS 103918, 5′-CGCGATGTCATGTTCCTCCC-3′); scramble control antisense for SHP-2 (ISIS 12307, 5′-TCGTCCAGGCCTCGTTCACT-3′); STAT3 antisense (ISIS 113176, 5′-GCTCCAGCATCTGCTGCTTC-3′); mismatch control antisense for STAT3 (ISIS 129987, 5′-GCTCCAATACCCGTTGCTTC-3′); SOCS3 antisense (ISIS 267676, 5′-GCAGCTGGGTGACTTTCTCA-3′). To transfect HASMC with oligonucleotides, cells were grown to 70% confluency in 6-well plates and then incubated with either 200 nm of STAT3 or mismatch control or 3 μm of SHP-2 antisense or mismatch control antisense or 500 nm SOCS-3 antisense or the mismatch control along with 20 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, the transfection was repeated, and cells were used 48 h after the second round of transfection. Preincubation with OnM Desensitizes HUVEC to OnM, IL-11, and LIF—Signal transduction pathways activated through gp130 leads to up-regulation of target genes. Many of these are tissue (e.g. liver)-specific, but SOCS-3 is a protein, which is widely induced by gp130-signaling cytokines (23Blanchard F. Wang Y. Kinzie E. Duplomb L. Godard A. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47038-47045Google Scholar, 24Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Google Scholar, 26Magrangeas F. Boisteau O. Denis S. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. Eur. Cytokine. Net. 2001; 12: 309-315Google Scholar). We examined the effects of OnM on SOCS-3 mRNA expression in HUVEC by stimulating confluent cultures with OnM for various times measuring SOCS-3 mRNA using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method (Fig. 1A). Resting cells expressed little SOCS-3 mRNA. OnM caused a time-dependent increase in SOCS-3 mRNA levels above that of untreated cells, which peaked 30 min to 1 h after stimulation with OnM and was significantly reduced at 3 h and only slightly elevated 24 h after stimulation with OnM (Fig. 1A). OnM induced the expression of SOCS-3 protein, detected by immunblotting using a specific polyclonal Ab. OnM also increased SOCS-3 protein in a time-dependent manner, which peaked 1 h after stimulation, and in contrast to mRNA, remained elevated for up to 36 h (Fig. 1B). We next examined whether OnM-treated HUVEC are able to respond to restimulation with OnM. Preincubation of HUVEC for 24 h with OnM blocked a second round of up-regulation of SOCS-3 mRNA in response to treatment with OnM (Fig. 1C). Like OnM, other gp130-signaling cytokines IL-11 and LIF induced SOCS-3 mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment with OnM also inhibited the induction of SOCS-3 mRNA by LIF and IL-11 (Fig. 1C). These experiments show that treatment of HUVEC with OnM desensitized these cells not only to OnM but also to other cytokines that use gp130 to transduce signals. The induction of SOCS-3 mRNA by gp130-signaling cytokines is mediated by STAT proteins (24Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Google Scholar, 25Paul C. Seiliez I. Thissen J.P. Le Cam A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5849-5857Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in cultured HUVEC, OnM stimulates phosphorylation of gp130, STAT1, STAT3, and p42 and p44 MAPK in a time-dependent man"
