https://openalex.org/W2017338379,"The neural bases of imitation learning are virtually unknown. In the present study, we addressed this issue using an event-related fMRI paradigm. Musically naive participants were scanned during four events: (1) observation of guitar chords played by a guitarist, (2) a pause following model observation, (3) execution of the observed chords, and (4) rest. The results showed that the basic circuit underlying imitation learning consists of the inferior parietal lobule and the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus plus the adjacent premotor cortex (mirror neuron circuit). This circuit, known to be involved in action understanding, starts to be active during the observation of the guitar chords. During pause, the middle frontal gyrus (area 46) plus structures involved in motor preparation (dorsal premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule, rostral mesial areas) also become active. Given the functional properties of area 46, a model of imitation learning is proposed based on interactions between this area and the mirror neuron system."
https://openalex.org/W2737972362,"Watching the movie scene in which a tarantula crawls on James Bond's chest can make us literally shiver—as if the spider crawled on our own chest. What neural mechanisms are responsible for this “tactile empathy”? The observation of the actions of others activates the premotor cortex normally involved in the execution of the same actions. If a similar mechanism applies to the sight of touch, movies depicting touch should automatically activate the somatosensory cortex of the observer. Here we found using fMRI that the secondary but not the primary somatosensory cortex is activated both when the participants were touched and when they observed someone or something else getting touched by objects. The neural mechanisms enabling our own sensation of touch may therefore be a window also to our understanding of touch."

https://openalex.org/W2025843494,Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that is required to synthesize DNA repeats at the ends of each chromosome. The RNA component of this reverse transcriptase is mutated in the bone marrow failure syndrome autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita. Here we show that disease anticipation is observed in families with this disease and that this is associated with progressive telomere shortening.
https://openalex.org/W2001443196,"Over the years, studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of oncogenesis. More recently, a growing emphasis has been placed on translational control. The Ras and Akt signal transduction pathways play a critical role in regulating mRNA translation and cellular transformation. The question arises: How might the Ras and Akt signaling pathways affect translation and mediate transformation? These pathways converge on a crucial effector of translation, the initiation factor eIF4E, which binds the 5′cap of mRNAs. This review focuses on the role of eIF4E in oncogenesis. eIF4E controls the translation of various malignancy-associated mRNAs which are involved in polyamine synthesis, cell cycle progression, activation of proto-oncogenes, angiogenesis, autocrine growth stimulation, cell survival, invasion and communication with the extracellular environment. eIF4E-mediated translational modulation of these mRNAs plays a pivotal role in both tumor formation and metastasis. Interestingly, eIF4E activity is implicated in mitosis, embryogenesis and in apoptosis. Finally, the finding that eIF4E is overexpressed in several human cancers makes it a prime target for anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2160643911,"The aggregation of α-synuclein has been implicated as a critical step in the development of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra; currently, no cure exists. Baicalein is a flavonoid with antioxidant properties; upon oxidation, it forms several products including quinones. We show here that low micromolar concentrations of baicalein, and especially its oxidized forms, inhibit the formation of α-synuclein fibrils. In addition, existing fibrils of α-synuclein are disaggregated by baicalein. The product of the inhibition reaction is predominantly a soluble oligomer of α-synuclein, in which the protein molecules have been covalently modified by baicalein quinone to form a Schiff base with a lysine side chain in α-synuclein. The binding of baicalein was abolished by conversion of the Tyr residues into Phe, demonstrating that Tyr is involved in the interaction of α-synuclein with baicalein. In disaggregation baicalein causes fragmentation throughout the length of the fibril. These observations suggest that baicalein and similar compounds may have potential as therapeutic leads in combating Parkinson's disease and that diets rich in flavonoids may be effective in preventing the disorder.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001Google Scholar). α-Synuclein has been shown to be a major fibrillar component of Lewy bodies (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar), and a variety of evidence implicates the aggregation of α-synuclein as a key step in the etiology of PD (6Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that α-synuclein undergoes aggregation via partially folded intermediates, which form a critical nucleus, resulting in protofibrils (7 nm wide) and mature fibrils (10 nm wide), or via a pathway of soluble oligomers, resulting in amorphous aggregates (7Khurana R.

Recently, it has been suggested that the precursors of fibrils, oligomers of α-synuclein, might be more toxic than fibrils (8Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Currently, no preventative therapy is available for Parkinson's disease; consequently, a compound that slows and/or prevents fibrillation and aggregation of α-synuclein could lead to a therapeutic strategy for PD. Current treatments ameliorate the motor symptoms by supplementation of the deficient neurotransmitter, dopamine. A precursor of dopamine, l-dopa, has been used in the treatment of PD since the 1960s. However, severe side effects are frequently observed within a few years of l-dopa therapy. Oxidative stress is thought to be an important factor PD due to the destructive effect of free radicals (10Butterfield D. Kanski J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 945-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 11Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol.

Dis. 2000; 7: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and enhanced fibrillation of α-synuclein due to oxidized stress has been reported (13Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J.M. Farer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both l-dopa and dopamine are known to produce free radicals during normal metabolism (14Asanuma M.

Antioxidants, acting as free radical scavengers, have been suggested to prevent or reduce the rate of progression of this disease (16Prasad K.N. Cole W.C. Kumar B. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1999; 18: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Abbott R.A. Cox M. Markus H. Tomkins A. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1992; 46: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nie G. Cao Y. Zhao B. Redox.

Suppl. 1994; 43: 183-201PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, a combination of l-dopa and antioxidants has been recommended in the treatment of PD. Flavonoids, a group of polyphenolic compounds, are important components in the human diet and medicinal plants. The intake of flavonoids is in the range of 50–800 mg/day, depending on the types of vegetables, fruits, and beverages consumed. Flavonoids have broad pharmacological activities, due to the inhibition of certain enzymes and/or antioxidant activity. Dietary flavonoids have been demonstrated as potential neuroprotective agents (21Joseph J.A. Shukitt-Hale B. Denisova N.A. Bielinski D. Martin A. McEwen J.J. Bickford P.C. J.

Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3871-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For example, the consumption of flavonoid-rich blueberries or strawberries can reverse cognitive and motor behavior deficits in rats (21Joseph J.A. Shukitt-Hale B. Denisova N.A. Bielinski D. Martin A. McEwen J.J. Bickford P.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and intake of antioxidant flavonoids is associated with a lower incidence of dementia (24Commenges D. Scotet V. Renaud S.

Baicalein, a typical flavonoid compound (Fig. 1), is the main component of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine Scutellaria baicalensis and has multiple biological activities including antiallergic, anticarcinogenic, and anti-HIV properties (25Li B.Q.

Lin C.C. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 2861-2865PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies report that baicalein protects rat cortical neurons from amyloid β-induced toxicity by its inhibition of lipoxygenase (30Lebeau A. Esclaire F. Rostene W. Pelaprat D. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2199-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Natural medicines containing these compounds have been reported to have beneficial effects in treating memory loss and dementia (31Perry E.K. Pickering A.T. Wang W.W. Houghton P.J. Perry N.S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1999; 51: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Watanabe C.M. Wolffram S. Ader P. Rimbach G. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Schultz P.G. Gohil K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6577-6580Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that baicalein inhibits the fibril formation of α-synuclein. In particular, the quinone oxidation form of baicalein forms a Schiff base with a lysine in α-synuclein and prevents the progress of fibrillation by stabilizing an oligomeric form. Thioflavin T assays, light scattering, circular dichroism, electron microscopy, and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to verify the inhibiting effects. Further, we show that baicalein disaggregates existing fibrils of α-synuclein, again leading to formation of a soluble oligomer. Purification of Human α-Synuclein—Human wild-type α-synuclein was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cell line and purified as described previously (33Yamin G. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Materials—Baicalein, baicalin, and thioflavin T (ThT) were obtained from Sigma. TRITC was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Aggregation/Fibrillation Studies and ThT Assays—The flavonoids were dissolved in Me2SO to make a stock solution at a concentration of 10 mm. Lyophilized α-synuclein was dissolved in 0.001 m NaOH and adjusted to pH 7.4 prior to centrifugation at 95,000 rpm with a Beckman Airfuge ultracentrifuge to remove any aggregated material. The protein solution (1 mg/ml; 70 μm) was mixed with flavonoids to give a final concentration of 5, 20, 50, or 100 μm with a final Me2SO concentration of 1%. A control α-synuclein solution containing 1% Me2SO was also prepared. All of the solutions consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer solution at pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and were stirred at 37 °C with a mini-Teflon stir bar. Aliquots of 5 μl were removed from the incubated solution and added to 1 ml of 10 μm ThT solutions in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) as a function of time to monitor the fibrillation kinetics. ThT fluorescence was recorded at 482 nm with excitation at 450 nm and slits of 2.5 nm for both excitation and emission using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba). The lag times for all of the incubated solutions were estimated from curve-fitting the kinetics using the equation described previously (34Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The solution was examined for fibril formation by electron microscopy (EM) and AFM. Anaerobic conditions were obtained by flushing the incubation solution with nitrogen gas for 10 min in a sealed vial. Light Scattering Measurements—Light scattering of the incubated solutions (in a 220-μl cuvette) was monitored over time using the spectrofluorometer with both excitation and emission at 300 nm. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Far-UV CD spectra were collected on an Aviv 60DS spectrophotometer using a 0.01-cm path length cell. CD spectra were recorded with a step size of 1 nm, a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and an averaging time of 5 s. An α-synuclein concentration of 1 mg/ml was used for all spectra, and an average of five scans after subtracting the appropriate buffer was obtained. Size Exclusion HPLC Measurements and Collection of Fractions—An aliquot of each sample was removed from the α-synuclein incubation at various times, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. Sample volumes of 18 μl of supernatant were eluted from a TSK-GEL G2000SWXL size exclusion column (7.8-mm inner diameter × 30 cm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mm Na2SO4 using a Waters 2695 separations module with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. The HPLC system was controlled, and data were collected and analyzed by Millennium software. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance of the mobile phase was monitored over the wavelength range from 220 to 450 nm with a bandwidth of 1.2 nm. The retention times were calibrated with the following protein molecular mass standards: ribonuclease A (13.6 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (bovine serum) (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and blue dextran 2000 (∼2000 kDa). The elution peaks were collected manually and concentrated ∼2-fold with an SVC 100H SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant Instruments Inc.). The concentrated protein solutions were then analyzed by AFM. UV-visible Spectrophotometric Titration Experiments—The binding ratio and equilibrium dissociation constants Kd for ligand-α-synuclein complexes were measured by a spectrophotometric method. For the measurement of binding ratio, samples of α-synuclein/inhibitor in the range from 0.05 to 20 were prepared, and the change in absorbance was plotted versus protein/inhibitor ratio. For estimation of dissociation constants, 18 samples with different α-synuclein concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 times Kd were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Absorption spectra over the range from 220 to 500 nm were measured using a UV-2401 PC UV-visible recording spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) immediately following the addition of 25 μm baicalein to the samples. The binding constant, Kd, was calculated with the Benesi-Hilderbrand equation (35Benesi A.H. Hilderbrand J H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 2703-2707Crossref Scopus (7081) Google Scholar), Cα−synCint/ΔA=Kd/Δε+(1/Δε)Cα−syn where Cα-syn and Cint are concentrations of α-synuclein and inhibitors, respectively. By linearly plotting Cα-synCint/ΔA versus Cα-syn, Kd can be estimated from the slope and the intercept. Cyclic Voltammetry Measurements—Three electrode systems were used in these experiments. The working electrode was a glass-carbon electrode (3-mm diameter) with a saturated calomel electrode reference and Pt counter electrode. Voltammetry experiments were performed on a CH Instruments model 440 electrochemical work station in a 5-ml electrochemical cell containing 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 100 mm NaCl as supporting electrolyte. A cyclic voltammogram (CV) was employed at 25 mV/s with the potential window set from –0.4 to 1.0 V. All of the electrolyte solutions were purged with N2 gas prior to the voltammetric measurements. Electron Microscopy Measurements—Transmission electron microscopy was used to estimate the size and structural morphology of α-synuclein. Aliquots of 5-μl sample were applied to carbon-coated pioloform copper grids and incubated for 10 min. Salts were washed out with distilled water, and samples were dried, negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and visualized on a JEOL JEM-100B transmission electron microscopy operated at 80 kV. Typical magnifications ranged from × 75,000 to 300,000. The grids were thoroughly examined to obtain an overall evaluation of the samples. AFM Measurements—In situ AFM images were obtained using a flow cell sample chamber with a mica bottom and collected with a PicoScan SPM microscope (Molecular Imaging, Phoenix, AZ) equipped with the MAC mode in which the magnetically coated probe oscillates near its resonant frequency under an alternating magnetic field. Probes with a 2.8 newton/m spring constant and a 75-kHz resonance frequency (Molecular Imaging) were used for the MAC mode imaging. The imaging was carried out at a scan rate of 0.5–1 line/s with 512 data points per line, at a driver current of 10 ± 5 A. The amplitude change of the probe was sufficiently low that the imaging was essentially nondestructive to the sample. Heights ranging from 1.0 to 100 nm were estimated by section analysis, and lateral sizes were calibrated with various standard gold colloid particles, using the same type of probe and similar set point for imaging. At least four regions of the mica surface were examined to verify that similar structures existed through the sample. No filter treatment was used to modify the images. For non-in situ AFM imaging, aliquots of 5 μl of sample were placed on a freshly cleaved mica substrate. After incubation for 10 min, the substrate was rinsed with water twice to remove salt and loosely bound protein and blown dry with N2. Some AFM images were collected with an Autoprobe CP Multiple AFM (Park Scientific) in tapping mode using silicon cantilevers with a spring constant of 50 newtons/m and a resonance frequency of 290–350 kHz. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were obtained using a MicroMass Quattro II electrospray instrument. Samples for mass spectrometry analysis were prepared by diluting 2 μl of protein solution in 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 50% HCl, pH 2.0, mixture and introduced via a Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA) syringe pump at a flow rate of 6 μl/min. The source temperature was set to 50 °C, and the capillary voltage was 3.0 kV. Labeling α-Synuclein with TRITC—TRITC is an amine-reactive fluorescent label, forming thiourea upon reaction with the amine side chain of lysine residues. The absorption maximum is 544 nm, and the emission maximum 571 nm. A molar excess of TRITC (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide) was added slowly to the protein solution while stirring. The dye was allowed to react with α-synuclein for l h in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 ml of freshly prepared 1.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 8.5, to the reaction solution. The labeled protein was separated from free dye by dialysis against 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 48 h. Labeling was confirmed by UV-visible spectra. The protein concentration was estimated by Lowry assay. The fibrillation of dye-labeled protein was monitored by the ThT assay. Baicalein Binds Tightly to α-Synuclein—The chemical structures of baicalein and baicalin are shown in Fig. 1. The binding of baicalein to α-synuclein results in changes in the absorbance spectrum of baicalein, in particular a substantial red shift in λmax, from 320 to 360 nm. Thus, the affinity of α-synuclein for baicalein was measured by spectral titration (Fig. 2A), from which a Kd of 500 nm was determined. The protein-ligand binding ratio was measured at two wavelengths; only one binding site for α-synuclein was observed. Since α-synuclein is intrinsically unstructured (i.e. natively unfolded), it is likely that baicalein binding is associated with some structural change in the protein. This was confirmed by circular dichroism experiments (see below). α-Synuclein Fibril Formation Is Inhibited by Baicalein and Baicalin—The kinetics of fibril formation were monitored by the increase in ThT fluorescence associated with dye binding to fibrils (36Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar); upon binding to α-synuclein fibrils, ThT fluorescence is typically enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude. When monitored by ThT fluorescence in the absence of baicalein, the incubation of α-synuclein (70 μm) at pH 7.5 and 37 °C shows a gradual rise with a sigmoidal shape, with a lag time of ∼18 h (Fig. 3), consistent with a nucleated polymerization mechanism. In the presence of baicalein (5–100 μm), α-synuclein fibrillation was inhibited, as indicated by the negligible or reduced ThT fluorescence over the time course (Fig. 3A). With 50 or 100 μm baicalein, no fibrillation was observed for >70 h, compared with the 18-h lag time in its absence. Baicalin has the same backbone structure as baicalein but with an additional sugar ring (Fig. 1). As with baicalein, fibril formation of α-synuclein was markedly inhibited when incubated with baicalin (Fig. 3B). The aggregation of α-synuclein incubated with baicalein and baicalin was also monitored by static light scattering, in order to confirm the inhibition of fibrillation observed with the ThT assay. The kinetics of α-synuclein aggregation monitored by light scattering are shown in Fig. 4 and are consistent with the data from the ThT assays. In the presence of baicalein or baicalin, the dose-dependent decrease in scattering indicates that aggregation is inhibited by baicalein and baicalin. However, even at higher concentrations of baicalein or baicalin, the light scattering signal does not disappear, suggesting the formation of nonfibrillar aggregates, probably large soluble oligomers. Additional confirmation of the inhibition was obtained from centrifugation and SDS gels, which showed essentially all of the protein in the supernatant at the end of the incubation in the presence of 100 μm baicalein, compared with essentially all of the protein in the pellet in the control, lacking baicalein. The SDS gels of both the supernatant and dissolved pellet showed only monomeric α-synuclein, indicating that under the experimental conditions, no detectable intermolecular cross-linking occurred. Oxidation of Baicalein Increases Its Inhibitory Potency— Since flavonoids are susceptible to oxidation, we examined the stability of baicalein under the conditions used to form α-synuclein fibrils. Baicalein oxidation was monitored by change in absorbance (Fig. 2B), which demonstrated that it underwent oxidization under the incubation conditions used (pH 7.5, 37 °C). The half-life for loss of baicalein was 15.2 h. Baicalin showed changes in its absorbance spectrum upon incubation at 37 °C similar to those seen with baicalein, indicating a similar rate of oxidation, t½ = 14.3 h. In order to determine if the active inhibitory species was baicalein or its oxidation products, we preincubated baicalein for 12–24 h prior to the addition to α-synuclein incubation solutions. Aged baicalein required lower concentrations to effect similar inhibition of fibril formation (Fig. 3C). This observation suggests that the oxidized form of baicalein may play an important role in the inhibition of fibrillation. When the incubation of α-synuclein was monitored by light scattering, similar results were obtained with aged baicalein (preincubated for 12 or 24 h) as with those of freshly prepared baicalein (data not shown). To address the question of the role of flavonoid oxidation in inhibiting α-synuclein fibrillation, the incubations were carried out under anaerobic conditions. The data (Fig. 5) indicate that in the absence of oxygen there is much less inhibition observed in the presence of baicalein, demonstrating that oxidized products are the major inhibitors of fibrillation, although the parent compound does have some inhibitory effects. Both freshly prepared and aged baicalein alone at a concentration of 100 μm showed no effect on ThT fluorescence itself (i.e. baicalein does not interfere with the ThT assay for fibrils). Baicalein Affects α-Synuclein Nucleation but Not Fibril Elongation—The inhibition of α-synuclein fibril formation by baicalein may involve two broadly different mechanisms, either inhibition of nucleus formation or inhibition of the growth/extension of fibrils. To resolve this issue, we initially added baicalein at various times during the incubation of α-synuclein. As shown in Fig. 6, we found that baicalein stopped the progress of fibrillation regardless of the time it was added, namely at 0, 6, 12, 21, 25, and 45 h. Thus, baicalein rapidly prevented further fibril growth whenever it was added to the solution. Further, the subsequent decrease in ThT signal suggests that the addition of baicalein led to disaggregation of the fibrils that were present (see below). However, these results do not allow us to determine which stage of fibrillation is inhibited by baicalein. To address this question more directly, we used seeding experiments. The addition of seed fibrils to α-synuclein solutions eliminates the lag observed when starting with soluble monomeric α-synuclein. Thus, if baicalein affects the rate of fibril growth, it would be apparent in such experiments. When α-synuclein was seeded in the presence of baicalein, there was no difference in rate of fibril growth in comparison with the control sample lacking baicalein. This demonstrates that there is no effect of baicalein (either fresh or aged) on the rate of fibril elongation (Fig. 7), which means the inhibitory effect must be on or prior to nucleation. This was confirmed in subsequent experiments that show the build-up of an oligomer (see below). The data in Fig. 7 show that after the initial growth of the seeds, the ThT signal declines; we attribute this to disaggregation of the fibrils, as discussed below. Baicalein Stabilizes a Partially Folded Conformation of α-Synuclein—Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of baicalein on the time-dependent changes in the secondary structure of α-synuclein. Both baicalein-treated (50 μm) and control solutions containing 70 μm α-synuclein were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Freshly prepared α-synuclein gave a CD spectrum characteristic of an unfolded protein conformation (Fig. 8). The spectrum for α-synuclein incubated for 21 h without baicalein showed a gradual change in molar ellipticity, especially at 218 nm, indicating the presence of partially folded structures with significant β-structure (Fig. 8A). In contrast, for the incubation solution containing baicalein, the CD spectrum showed an initial rapid change to the spectrum of a partially folded intermediate and then no further changes, indicating that baicalein stabilized a partially folded conformation of α-synuclein (Fig. 8B). Baicalein Stabilizes an Oligomer of α-Synuclein—The soluble aggregated forms of α-synuclein in the presence and absence of baicalein were further studied by size exclusion HPLC. Monomeric α-synuclein eluted at 18 min in this experiment. α-Synuclein solution was incubated at 37 °C, pH 7.4, for 3 days; at appropriate time periods, an aliquot of the solution was centrifuged and loaded on the SEC HPLC column. The elution profile of α-synuclein incubated for 6 h showed a major peak corresponding to the monomer and a much smaller peak eluting at 14 min (Fig. 9A). With increasing time, the monomer peak decreased in size and the oligomer peak area increased, suggesting that at later stages of the fibrillation, most of the soluble protein is present as large soluble aggregates (oligomers) (however, the majority of the protein was insoluble fibrils). In the presence of 20 μm baicalein, an oligomer peak eluting at 14 min was observed immediately after the addition of baicalein to the protein solution, and its area increased over the time course of the reaction (Fig. 9A); ultimately, essentially all of the protein was present as the oligomer. The large intensity of the oligomer peak could be due to an increased amount of oligomer or to increased absorbance at 275 nm (the wavelength monitored) due to the presence of baicalein or a derivative. Spectral analysis of the peak eluting at 14 min indicated that baicalein or its breakdown products was present in the oligomer (Fig. 9B). Since the presence of baicalein in complex with α-synuclein will increase the absorbance at 275 nm, it will contribute to the increased peak intensity observed with monitoring at 275 nm. The effect of baicalein on oligomer formation was examined as a function of baicalein concentration, as shown in Fig. 9C. Both freshly prepared and preincubated baicalein led to formation of the soluble oligomeric aggregates. To verify that the high molecular weight peaks are produced by protein aggregates, and not oligomers of the flavonoids, we did two control experiments. First, we loaded preincubated baicalein onto the HPLC column, and no peaks were observed at 14 min. Second, we mixed the incubation sample with 0.1 mm Coomassie Blue and monitored the elution profile at 520 nm, which is the adsorption wavelength for Coomassie Blue-protein complex. Baicalein does not contribute to the optical adsorption at this wavelength. The peak with retention time at 14 min in Fig. 9A is consistent with the peak at the sa"
https://openalex.org/W2101137688,"Hemostasis initiates angiogenesis-dependent wound healing, and thrombosis is frequently associated with advanced cancer. Although activation of coagulation generates potent regulators of angiogenesis, little is known about how this pathway supports angiogenesis in vivo. Here we show that the tissue factor (TF)-VIIa protease complex, independent of triggering coagulation, can promote tumor and developmental angiogenesis through protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) signaling. In this context, the TF cytoplasmic domain negatively regulates PAR-2 signaling. Mice from which the TF cytoplasmic domain has been deleted (TF Delta CT mice) show enhanced PAR-2-dependent angiogenesis, in synergy with platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB). Ocular tissue from diabetic patients shows PAR-2 colocalization with phosphorylated TF specifically on neovasculature, suggesting that phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain releases its negative regulatory control of PAR-2 signaling in angiogenesis. Targeting the TF-VIIa signaling pathway may thus enhance the efficacy of angiostatic treatments for cancer and neovascular eye diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1984275656,"Skin is the most commonly affected organ in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To explore the role of Langerhans cells in GVHD, the principal dendritic cells of the skin, we studied the fate of these cells in mice transplanted with allogeneic bone marrow. In contrast to other dendritic cells, host Langerhans cells were replaced by donor Langerhans cells only when donor T cells were administered along with bone marrow, and the extent of Langerhans cell chimerism correlated with the dose of donor T cells injected. Donor T cells depleted host Langerhans cells through a Fas-dependent pathway and induced the production in skin of CCL20, which was required for the recruitment of donor Langerhans cells. Administration of donor T cells to bone marrow–chimeric mice with persistent host Langerhans cells, but not to mice whose Langerhans cells had been replaced, resulted in marked skin GVHD. These findings indicate a crucial role for donor T cells in host Langerhans cell replacement, and show that host dendritic cells can persist in nonlymphoid tissue for the duration of an animal's life and can trigger GVHD despite complete blood chimerism."

In addition, this study points to a common virulence strategy between the oomycete plant pathogen P. infestans and several mammalian parasites, such as the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. Parasitic and pathogenic lifestyles have evolved repeatedly in eukaryotes (1Sogin M.L. Silberman J.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Several parasitic eukaryotes represent deep phylogenetic lineages, suggesting that they feature unique molecular processes for infecting their hosts. One such lineage is formed by the oomycetes, a group of fungus-like organisms that are distantly related to fungi but closely related to brown algae and diatoms in the Stramenopiles (1Sogin M.L. Silberman J.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 2Margulis L. Schwartz K.V. Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth. W. H.

One of the most notorious and destructive oomycete is the Irish famine pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. This species causes late blight, a re-emerging and ravaging disease of potato and tomato (4Birch P.R.J. Whisson S. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2001; 2: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Smart C.D. Fry W.E. Biol. Invas. 2001; 3: 235-243Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Ristaino J.B.

During the early stages of infection, P. infestans requires living host cells but later causes extensive necrosis of host tissue, a lifestyle that is known as hemibiotrophy. As with other biotrophic plant pathogens, processes associated with P. infestans pathogenesis are thought to include the suppression of host defense responses (3Kamoun S. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Heath M.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 9Bouarab K. Melton R. Peart J. Baulcombe D. Osbourn A. Nature. 2002; 418: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In P. infestans, water-soluble glucans have been reported to suppress host defenses in a plant cultivar-specific manner (10Sanchez L.M. Ohno Y. Miura Y. Kawakita K. Doke N. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Japan. 1992; 58: 664-670Crossref Google Scholar, 11Yoshioka H. Hayakawa Y. Doke N. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Japan. 1995; 61: 7-12Crossref Google Scholar, 12Andreu A. Tonón C. Van Damme M. Van Damme M. Huarte M. Huarte M. Daleo G. Eur. J. Plant Pathol. 1998; 104: 777-783Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular basis of suppression of host defenses by Phytophthora remains poorly understood (3Kamoun S. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that unique classes of suppressor genes have been recruited to aid in infection and counteract host defenses during the evolution of pathogenesis in the oomycete lineage. Parasitic eukaryotes often face inhospitable environments in their hosts. For example, parasites that colonize or transit through the mammalian digestive tract must adapt to the diverse and abundant array of proteases secreted in the gastric juices (13Dubey J.P. Parasitology. 1998; 116: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Milstone A.M. Harrison L.M. Bungiro R.D. Kuzmic P. Cappello M. J. Biol.

Some of these parasites secrete inhibitors that target host proteases and may aid in survival and colonization of the host. For instance, the apicomplexan obligate parasite Toxoplasma gondii secretes TgPI-1 and TgPI-2, four-domain serine protease inhibitors of the Kazal family (15Morris M.T. Coppin A. Tomavo S.

In plants, the apoplast (intercellular fluid) forms a protease-rich environment that is colonized by many pathogens, including P. infestans and the fungus Cladosporium fulvum. In tomato, apoplastic proteases are integral components of the plant defense response. Serine proteases of the P69 subtilase family have long been tied to pathogen defense, and two isoforms, P69B and P69C, are known as pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-7 class) (20Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Jorda L. Coego A. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol.

Plant Pathol. 1999; 55: 85-97Crossref Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). More recently, an apoplastic papain-like cysteine protease, Rcr3, was shown to be required for specific resistance to C. fulvum (23Kruger J. Thomas C.M. Golstein C. Dixon M.S. Smoker M. Tang S. Mulder L. Jones J.D. Science. 2002; 296: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, several C. fulvum extracellular proteins are processed or degraded by host proteases in the apoplast, resulting in altered functionality (24Van den Ackerveken G.F. Vossen P. De Wit P.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of extracellular proteases in plant defense, to date no protease inhibitor has been reported from microbial plant pathogens. In this paper, we describe and functionally characterize an extracellular protease inhibitor, EPI1, from P. infestans. EPI1 contains two domains with significant similarity to the Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors, which also occurs in many animal species and in apicomplexan parasites. In vitro studies indicated that recombinant EPI1 (rEPI1) 1The abbreviations used are: rEPI1, recombinant EPI1; BTH, benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester; EST, expressed sequence tag; RT, reverse transcriptase. specifically inhibited subtilisin A among the major serine proteases. rEPI1 was further demonstrated to inhibit and interact with tomato P69B subtilisin-like serine protease. The epi1 and P69B genes were coordinately expressed and up-regulated during infection of tomato by P. infestans. Overall these results suggest that inhibition of tomato proteases by P. infestans EPI1 could form a novel type of defense-counterdefense mechanism between plants and microbial pathogens. In addition, this study points to a common virulence strategy between the oomycete plant pathogen P. infestans and mammalian parasites, such as the apicomplexan T. gondii. Phytophthora Strains and Culture Conditions—P. infestans isolate 90128 (A2 mating type, race 1.3.4.7.8.9.10.11) was used throughout the study. P. infestans 90128 was routinely grown on rye agar medium supplemented with 2% sucrose (26Caten C.E. Jinks J.L. Can. J. Bot. 1968; 46: 329-347Crossref Google Scholar). For RNA extraction, plugs of mycelium were transferred to modified Plich medium (27Kamoun S. Young M. Glascock C. Tyler B.M. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 15-25Crossref Google Scholar) and grown for 2–3 weeks before harvesting. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Escherichia coli XL1-Blue was used in this study and was routinely grown at 37 °C in LB medium (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pFLAG-EPI1 was constructed by cloning PCR-amplified DNA fragment corresponding to the mature sequence of EPI1 into the HindIII site of pFLAG-ATS (Sigma), a vector that allows secreted expression in E. coli. The oligonucleotides EPI1-F1 (5′-GCGAAGCTTCAAAGCCCGCAAGTCATCAG-3′) and EPI1-R1 (5′-GCGAAGCTTATCCCTCCTGCGGTGTC-3′) were used to amplify the fragment. The introduced HindIII restriction sites are underlined.

Plant Growth, BTH Treatment, and Infection by P. infestans—Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cultivar Ohio 7814 was used throughout the study and grown in pots at 25 °C, 60% humidity, under 16 h-light/8 h-dark cycle. We used the salicylic acid analog BTH to mimic pathogen infection. For BTH treatment, 10 ml of a 25 μg/ml BTH solution was applied to 3-week-old tomato plants by soil drench. Plants treated with 10 ml of water were used as controls. Leaves from BTH-treated and control plants were detached for isolation of intercellular fluids 6 days after treatment. Time courses of P. infestans infection of tomato leaves were performed exactly as described earlier (29Kamoun S. van West P. Vleeshouwers V.G. de Groot K.E. Govers F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). 10-μl droplets containing 1,000 zoospores of P. infestans were used to inoculate the underside of detached tomato leaves. Leaf discs of similar sizes were dissected from the inoculated regions while making sure that the inoculation spot is in the center of sampled area. Leaf discs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for later use in RNA extraction. For isolation of intercellular fluids, tomato leaves were sprayed with zoospore suspensions at the concentration mentioned above (105/ml), and the intact leaves were collected at different time points for immediate preparation of intercellular fluids. Isolation of Intercellular Fluids—Intercellular fluids were prepared using a 0.24 m sorbitol solution according to the method of de Wit and Spikman (30de Wit P.J.G.M. Spikman G. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1982; 21: 1-11Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The intercellular fluids were filter-sterilized (0.22 μm) and were used immediately or stored at -20 °C. Sequence Analyses—GC counting was performed as described elsewhere (31Huitema E. Torto T.A. Styer A. Kamoun S. Grotewold E. Functional Genomics: Methods and Protocols.

Li S. Styer A. Huitema E. Testa A. Gow N.A.R. van West P. Kamoun S. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Probes for epi1, actA, and tomato α-tubulin were generated by random primer labeling using gel-purified fragments digested or PCR-amplified from the corresponding cDNA clones (Ref. 41Unkles S.E. Moon R.P. Hawkins A.R. Duncan J.M. Kinghorn J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and this study). Probe for tomato P69B was generated from a gel-purified RT-PCR fragment amplified from total RNA isolated from infected tomato tissue. For RT-PCR, total RNA was treated with DNA-free™ (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove contaminating DNA, and first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system from 5 μg of total RNA following the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were carried out with 0.005% of the cDNA product. The oligonucleotide primer pairs, P69A-RTF1 (5′-TGGCAGGTGGTGGAGTTCCGAGGG-3′) and P69A-RTR1 (5′-CATTGGATCAACAAAAGTGCAATTGG-3′), P69B-RTF1 (5′-CAGCACTCGGCCATGTAGCCAATGTT-3′) and P69B-RTR1 (5′-CTAGGCAGACACAACTGCAATTGGACTTC-3′), P69D-RTF1 (5′-TGCGAAGTATAAGTCTTCTCAGAGTTGC-3′), and P69D-RTR1 (5′-TCAGCAGACACTCTAACTGCAATTGGAC-3′), were designed to be gene-specific based on the published P69 gene sequences (21Jorda L. Coego A. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2360-2365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and were used for the amplification of P69A, P69B, and P69D sequences, respectively. The oligonucleotides EPI1-F1 and EPI1-R1, previously used for cloning epi1 into pFLAG-ATS vector, were used to detect epi1 transcripts by RT-PCR. Primer specificity was confirmed by sequencing the RT-PCR products. The expression of P69A, P69B, and P69D was controlled with primer pair EF1α-F1 (5′-GCTGCTGTAACAAGGTTTGCTTTAATTCG-3′) and EF1α-R1 (5′-CCAGCATCACACTGCACAGTTCACTTC-3′), which are specific for the constitutively expressed tomato elongation factor 1α gene (42Shewmaker C.K. Ridge N.P. Pokalsky A.R. Rose R.E. Hiatt W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The expression of epi1 was controlled with P. infestans elongation factor 2α gene using the primer pair described previously (43Torto T.A. Rauser L. Kamoun S. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses—Proteins were subjected to 10–15% SDS-PAGE as previously described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were stained with silver nitrate following the method of Merril et al. (44Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar) or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), or the proteins were transferred to supported nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Mini Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Detection of antigen-antibody complexes was carried out with a Western blot alkaline phosphatase kit (Bio-Rad). Antisera to P69 subtilases were produced by immunizing rabbits with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, H2N-TTHTPSFLGLQQNC-amide. The sequence underlined is located at the N terminus of mature P69B and P69D proteins (21Jorda L. Coego A. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2360-2365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and was chosen for its highly antigenic characteristics and conservation among P69 proteins. Selection of peptides for highly antigenic characteristics, peptide synthesis, and conjugation, as well as antisera production, was performed by Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). In Western blot analyses, the antisera to the P69 peptide reacted only with ∼70-kDa bands from tomato intercellular fluids. Expression and Purification of rEPI1—Expression of rEPI from pFLAG-EPI1 was conducted as described previously (45Kamoun S. van West P. de Jong A.J. de Groot K. Vleeshouwers V. Govers F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of E. coli XL1-blue containing pFLAG-EPI1 were diluted (1: 100) in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C. When the A600 of the cultures reached 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The cultures were further incubated for 5–6 h before processing. rEPI1 was recovered from the culture supernatant and was purified by immunoaffinity using gravity column packed with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, and immediately equilibrated to neutral pH with 20 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, for each 1-ml eluted fraction. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. To determine the purity of rEPI1, 0.5 μg of the purified protein was run on a SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with silver nitrate. Assays of Protease Inhibition—Inhibition assays of commercial serine proteases by rEPI1 were performed by the colorimetric QuantiCleave™ Protease Assay Kit (Pierce). 20 pmol of rEPI1 was preincubated with 20 pmol of trypsin (Pierce), chymotrypsin (Sigma), or subtilisin A (Carlsberg) (Sigma), in a volume of 50 μl for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by incubation with 100 μl of succinylated casein (2 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 20 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 20 min. Protease activity was measured as absorbance at 405 nm using a HTS 7000 Bio Assay Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 20 min after the addition of chromogenic reagent 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, which reacts with the primary amine of digested peptide and produces a color reaction that can be quantified by absorbance reader. Detailed kinetic analysis of Subtilisin A inhibition by rEPI1 was performed as follows. 2 pmol of subtilisin A was preincubated with increasing concentrations of rEPI1 in a volume of 50 μl for 15 min at 25 °C and was followed by the addition of 150 μl assay buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5% Me2SO, and 500 μm subtilisin chromogenic substrate Boc-Gly-Gly-Leu-pNA (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The experiments were performed three times and in triplicate each time. Initial reaction velocities were measured by monitoring the absorbance change at 405 nm over reaction time using the HTS 7000 Bio Assay Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kiapp was determined following the method described by Morris et al. (15Morris M.T. Coppin A. Tomavo S. Carruthers V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45259-45266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The slope of the linear plot of [V0/Vi] - 1 versus [I] was estimated as 1/ Kiapp. Kiapp was converted to Ki according to the formula Ki = Kiapp /(1 + [S]/Km) (46Delaria K.A. Muller D.K. Marlor C.W. Brown J.E. Das R.C. Roczniak S.O. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12209-12214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Varying concentrations of substrate were incubated with 2 pmol of subtilisin A in a total volume of 200 μl under the conditions described above, and the initial velocities were measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm. The Km was determined graphically by double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/[v] versus 1/[s]. Inhibition assays of plant proteases by rEPI1 were carried out with the QuantiCleave™ Protease Assay Kit (Pierce) and in-gel protease assays using the Bio-Rad zymogram buffer system. For the first method, 50 μl of intercellular fluids were preincubated with or without 10 pmol of rEPI1 at 25 °C for 30 min, and the protease activities were subsequently measured. For the in-gel protease assays, 10 pmol of rEPI1 were preincubated with 8 μl of intercellular fluids for 30 min at 25 °C and then mixed with zymogram sample buffer and loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel without boiling or addition of reducing reagents. Following electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in 1× zymogram renaturation buffer for 30 min. Then the gel was incubated in 1× zymogram development buffer for 4 h at 37 °C before staining with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Coimmunoprecipitation—Coimmunoprecipitation of rEPI1 and tomato intercellular fluid proteins was performed using the FLAG-tagged"
https://openalex.org/W2089495387,"We investigated the relationship between neuronal activity, oxygen metabolism, and hemodynamic responses in rat somatosensory cortex with simultaneous optical intrinsic signal imaging and spectroscopy, laser Doppler flowmetry, and local field potential recordings. Changes in cerebral oxygen consumption increased linearly with synaptic activity but with a threshold effect consistent with the existence of a tissue oxygen buffer. Modeling analysis demonstrated that the coupling between neuronal activity and hemodynamic response magnitude may appear linear over a narrow range but incorporates nonlinear effects that are better described by a threshold or power law relationship. These results indicate that caution is required in the interpretation of perfusion-based indicators of brain activity, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and may help to refine quantitative models of neurovascular coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2096884914,"In relaxed wakefulness, the EEG exhibits robust rhythms in the α band (8–13 Hz), which decelerate to θ (∼2–7 Hz) frequencies during early sleep. In animal models, these rhythms occur coherently with synchronized activity in the thalamus. However, the mechanisms of this thalamic activity are unknown. Here we show that, in slices of the lateral geniculate nucleus maintained in vitro, activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mGluR1a induces synchronized oscillations at α and θ frequencies that share similarities with thalamic α and θ rhythms recorded in vivo. These in vitro oscillations are driven by an unusual form of burst firing that is present in a subset of thalamocortical neurons and are synchronized by gap junctions. We propose that mGluR1a-induced oscillations are a potential mechanism whereby the thalamus promotes EEG α and θ rhythms in the intact brain."

Here we show that the Rho family GTPase, RhoA, conveys the “cell shape signal” to the cell-cycle machinery in human capillary endothelial cells. Cells accumulating p27kip1 and arrested in mid G1 phase when spreading were inhibited by restricted extracellular matrix adhesion, whereas constitutively active RhoA increased expression of the F-box protein Skp2 required for ubiquitination-dependent degradation of p27kip1 and restored G1 progression in these cells. Studies with dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of mDia1, a downstream effector of RhoA, and with a pharmacological inhibitor of ROCK, another RhoA target, revealed that RhoA promoted G1 progression by altering the balance of activities between these two downstream effectors. These data indicate that signaling proteins such as mDia1 and ROCK, which are thought to be involved primarily in cytoskeletal remodeling, also mediate cell growth regulation by coupling cell shape to the cell-cycle machinery at the level of signal transduction.

Previous studies have demonstrated that cell-cycle progression can be controlled in the presence of soluble mitogens and ECM by altering physical interactions between cells and the ECM: substrates that prevent cell spreading inhibit proliferation, whereas those that support cell extension permit cell-cycle progression (2Ingber D.E.

This shape-dependent growth control allows neighboring cells to undergo distinct cell fate transitions, a prerequisite for the generation of specialized tissue patterns (1Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat.

Cell spreading is an active process that is mediated by the binding of cell surface integrin receptors to ECM molecules and associated tension-dependent rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (11Ezzell R.M.

Both cell spreading and maintenance of integrity of the actin cytoskeleton are required for endothelial cells or fibroblasts to complete the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enter S phase (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 15Hansen L.K. Mooney D.J. Vacanti J.P. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol.

Cell Res. 2002; 275: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Past work on the requirement of an intact cytoskeleton for growth control focused on early G1 events, notably those mediated by the MAPK/Erk pathway (19Aplin A.E. Short S.M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31223-31228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Danen E.H. Yamada K.M. J.

However, when endothelial cells are prevented from spreading by culturing them in the presence of soluble mitogens on dishes coated with a low density of the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) or on small, micrometer-sized, high density FN islands that are surrounded by non-adhesive regions, the G1/S transition is similarly inhibited, despite normal activation of the canonical MAPK/Erk pathway (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal disruption also can prevent G1 progression in many other cell types (16Iwig M. Czeslick E. Muller A. Gruner M. Spindler M. Glaesser D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 145-157PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol.

Thus, additional signals that emanate from the intact cytoskeleton of spread cells in mid-G1 seem to be critical for the successful passage through late G1 and entry into S phase (17Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Huang S. Ingber D.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, virtually nothing is known about how distortion of the cell and cytoskeleton impact the biochemical signaling machinery that is responsible for this control of mid-late G1 progression. Cell-cycle progression through the late G1/S restriction point, which represents the “point of no return” in the cell cycle, is associated with the hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) (17Assoian R.K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Notably, the cdk inhibitor p27kip1 (p27) that binds and inactivates the cyclin D1/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2 complexes is a major target for many physiological growth regulatory signals (29Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del, Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Importantly, p27 levels remain high, and cell-cycle progression is blocked in mid- to late G1 when endothelial cell spreading is prevented by either altering the ECM substrate or disrupting the actin cytoskeleton using various cytoskeletal modulators that act by means of distinct mechanisms (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The effects of cell shape on cell-cycle progression are similarly mediated by p27 in other cell types (30Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J.

Thus, to understand the molecular basis of cell shape-dependent growth control, we must elucidate how cell spreading controls the level of this critical cell-cycle inhibitory protein. Skp2, a member of the family of proteins that contain an F-box motif (34Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS3002)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is part of the Skp2, Cul1, and F-box protein complex which is responsible for degradation of various cell-cycle proteins. Availability of the Skp2 subunit is rate-limiting, and it directly regulates ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of phosphorylated p27 in vitro and in vivo (35Carrano A.C. Eytan E.

Skp2 has been shown to play a role in cell-cycle control by signals elicited by both growth factor receptors and integrins (33Carrano A.C. Pagano M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in past studies using micropatterned ECM islands that allowed us to dissociate signals elicited by direct integrin binding from cell spreading, we showed that integrin-mediated adhesion to ECM and subsequent changes of cell shape convey distinct growth signals to the cell-cycle machinery, and that cell spreading is a critical determinant of p27 levels in these cells (1Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell. Bio. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 4Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E.

Thus, Skp2 is a potential candidate for mediating the effects of cell shape on p27, but there is still no known link between cytoskeletal distortion and Skp2. Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42, are interesting candidates for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. These small G proteins regulate a multitude of cellular functions including cell adhesion, focal adhesion formation, cytoskeletal remodeling, spreading, motility, polarization, and cytokinesis by ligation of growth factor receptors and integrin receptors, as well as by mechanical stresses (39Hall A.

However, the downstream targets of RhoA that link it with the cell-cycle machinery remain elusive. Because of its dual roles in integrin-mediated actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements during cell spreading and in control of G1 progression, the Rho signaling pathway is a prime candidate for mediating cell shape-dependent cell-cycle regulation. Two well studied downstream effectors of RhoA, rho-associated kinases (ROCK) and the formin homology protein mDia1 (mDia) have emerged as the chief mediators of the effect of Rho on the actin cytoskeleton. ROCK stimulates actomyosin-based cell contractility by promoting myosin light chain phosphorylation and increases cytoskeletal tension that is necessary for formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers (59Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 60Kawano Y.

In contrast, mDia promotes actin polymerization (61Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), mediates the effects of external mechanical stresses on actin-dependent focal adhesion formation (62Riveline D. Zamir E. Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Kam Z. Geiger B. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), and regulates alignment of stress fibers with microtubules by targeting microtubules to focal adhesions (63Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell. Bio. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 64Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat.

ROCK and mDia seem to act jointly in controlling cytoskeletal rearrangements to provide a scaffold for the stabilization of a normal cell shape (62Riveline D. Zamir E. Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Kam Z. Geiger B. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 63Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T.

But these studies of RhoA effector functions were largely limited to their structural effects; their role in cell-cycle progression has yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that RhoA mediates cell shape-dependent cell-cycle progression in human microvascular endothelial cells. Our data show that RhoA acts downstream of cell spreading to promote G1 progression by activating the Skp2-p27kip1 pathway, and that its effects are mediated, in part, by a balance between the activities of its two downstream signaling targets, mDia and ROCK. Cell Culture—Human microvascular endothelial cells from neonatal dermis (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) were cultured in EBM-2 (Cascade Biologics), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were synchronized at the G0/G1 border by serum starvation (0.3% fetal bovine serum/EBM-2) for 40–42 h and then released into G1 by trypsinizing the cells and replating them on FN-coated dishes in EBM-2 containing 1% fetal bovine serum and growth factors. Experimental System—To control cell shape, cells were cultured on bacteriological Petri dishes (35-mm Petri dishes; Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) that were pre-coated with different densities (22 ng/cm2 or 666 ng/cm2) of FN (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) using a carbonate buffer-coating technique, as described previously (3Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For morphological analysis, cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, incubated for 5 min in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS, and then blocked overnight with 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Focal adhesions were visualized using anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). F-actin was visualized using Alexa-488 phalloidin (Sigma). In the study examining the morphological effect of mDia978 on Y27632-treated cells, 5 μm lysophosphatidic acid (Sigma) was used in place of serum, as described previously (68Tsuji T. Ishizaki T. Okamoto M. Higashida C. Kimura K. Furuyashiki T. Arakawa Y. Birge R.B. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cell-cycle Analysis—Cell cycle-associated proteins were detected by Western blotting and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as described previously (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In these studies, cells cultured on 60-mm dishes were lysed with 0.3 ml of boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and scraped, and lysates were collected (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Homogenized total cell lysates (10 μg protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and SuperSignal Ultra (Pierce) as a chemiluminescence substrate. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the following antigens were obtained from these suppliers: pRb (LM95.1) from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), Skp2 (SKP2–8D9) from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and actin (AC-15) from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody against p27kip1 (clone 57) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Y27632 was purchased from Calbiochem. Results were quantified by densitometric analysis using NIH image software. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analysis of statistical significance of replicate Western blots. RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of Skp2 mRNA. Adherent cells were lysed and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA (500 ng/sample) was treated for 1 h at 37 °C with reverse transcriptase using OmniScript reverse transcriptase assay kit (Qiagen). The PCR was carried out with a series of 1:3 dilutions of the RT product (2 μl). Only reactions in the log-linear range (product quantity versus input template quantity) were used. The forward and reverse PCR primers for Skp2 were 5′-CAACTACCTCCAACACCTATC-3′ and 5′-TCCTGCCTATTTTCCCTGTTCT-3′, respectively. PCR cycling conditions were 3 min at 94 °C, then 26 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. For internal control, we used β actin mRNA, whose forward and reverse primers were 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCC-3′ and 5′-TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATG-3′, respectively. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers were designed with Oligo version 4.0 software (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) and synthesized by Sigma Genosys (Biotechnologies Industries, The Woodlands, TX). Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoA14V) and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli expression plasmid pGEX4T-RhoA14V and pCNF24-CNF1 (kindly provided by Alan Hall, University College London, UK, and Melody Mills, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, respectively). The plasmids encoding full-length mDia were kindly provided by Yoshimi Takai (Osaka University, Japan). The dominant-negative form of mDia (mDia978, amino acids 543–978) and the constitutively active form of mDia (mDia1192, amino acids 543–1192) were constructed using PCR and subcloned into the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein/E. coli expression vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) at the EcoRI/XhoI and BamHI/XhoI sites, respectively. GST-tagged RhoA14V, mDia978, and mDia1192, as well as GST recombinant proteins, were purified from E. coli, as previously described (69Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For RhoA14V, the GST tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin (10 units/ml, Sigma) at 4 °C for 8–10 h; thrombin was removed by incubating the supernatant with p-amino-benzamidine-agarose (Sigma). Because of the presence of multiple thrombin target sites, the GST fragment could not be cleaved away from the mDia fusion protein. The His-tagged CNF1 was purified with Ni-agarose nitrilotriacetic acid beads following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). C3 exoenzyme was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Protein Transfection—For protein transfection (proteofection), we used BioPORTER protein delivery reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 0.5–5 μg of recombinant protein in 200 μl of PBS was incubated in a tube containing a film of 15 μl of BioPORTER that was formed by drying for 5 min. The complexes were then added to the cells (400,000 cells/60-mm dish) in 2.5 ml of serum-free EBM-2; after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were replated onto the experimental FN-coated dishes with experimental medium. In the case of RhoA14V and C3, we used the BioPORTER reagent alone without added protein cargo as a proteofection control. In the case of mDia978 and mDia1192, which contained a GST sequence, we proteofected the GST portion of the protein as a control. The samples were collected at the indicated time points after replating. FN Density-dependent Control of Capillary Cell Shape and G1 Progression—We demonstrated previously that pulmonary capillary endothelial cell spreading and growth can be controlled in parallel by culturing the cells on dishes coated with different molecular coating densities of the ECM protein, FN (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Experiments were first carried out to confirm the generality of this behavior by demonstrating that cell shape and progression through the G1/S transition can be similarly controlled in microvascular endothelial cells from human neonatal dermis. The levels of the critical G1 protein, p27, were measured in total cell lysates; the phosphorylation status of pRb was used as a read-out of successful progression through the late G1 restriction point. Cells synchronized in G0 by serum starvation were replated on dishes coated either with a high density (666 ng/cm2) of FN (high FN) that allows maximal cell spreading, or with a low density (22 ng/cm2) of FN (low FN), on which cells attach but remain retracted or round. Western blot analysis confirmed that the levels of hyperphosphorylated pRb increased and p27 decreased, as the spread cells on high FN progressed from G0 (time 0) to late G1 phase (from 8 to 18 h after release) (Fig. 1). In contrast, round cells on low FN did not down-regulate p27 or hyperphosphorylate pRb over the same time course, even though they were stimulated by the same soluble mitogens (basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor in 1% serum) (Fig. 1). These results confirm that cell spreading is necessary to promote passage through the G1/S restriction point in human dermal capillary endothelial cells, just as it is in human pulmonary capillary cells (6Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubM"
https://openalex.org/W2064400743,"For the elucidation of the very early steps of immune cell activation by endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) leading to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines the question concerning the biologically active unit of endotoxins has to be addressed: are monomeric endotoxin molecules able to activate cells or is the active unit represented by larger endotoxin aggregates? This question has been answered controversially in the past. Inspired by the observation that natural isolates of lipid A, the lipid moiety of LPS harboring its endotoxic principle, from Escherichia coli express a higher endotoxic activity than the same amounts of the synthetic E. coli-like hexaacylated lipid A (compound 506), we looked closer at the chemical composition of natural isolates. We found in these isolates that the largest fraction was hexaacylated, but also significant amounts of penta- and tetraacylated molecules were present that, when administered to human mononuclear cells, may antagonize the induction of cytokines by biologically active hexaacylated endotoxins. We prepared separate aggregates of either compound 506 or 406 (tetraacylated precursor IVa), mixed at different molar ratios, and mixed aggregates containing both compounds in the same ratios. Surprisingly, the latter mixtures showed higher endotoxic activity than that of the pure compound 506 up to an admixture of 20% of compound 406. Similar results were obtained when using various phospholipids instead of compound 406. These observations can only be understood by assuming that the active unit of endotoxins is the aggregate. We further confirmed this result by preparing monomeric lipid A and LPS by a dialysis procedure and found that, at the same concentrations, only the aggregates were biologically active, whereas the monomers showed no activity.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; compound 406, synthetic tetraacylated precursor IVa; compound 506, synthetic E. coli-like hexaacylated lipid A; CL, diphosphatidylglycerol cardiolipin; LAL, Limulus amebocyte lysate; LBP, LPS-binding protein; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MNC, mononuclear cell; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; aggr., aggregate; PL, phospholipid; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. is one of the most potent activators of the immune system in mammals. During cell growth or as a result of the action of antibacterial host factors or antimicrobial peptides, LPS is released from the outer leaflet of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Manifold interactions of LPS with host factors have been described, such as the activation of the complement system, activation of immune cells, and interaction with a variety of serum proteins, to name only a few. The most prominent activity of LPS is its immunostimulatory potency leading to the complex clinical syndrome of Gram-negative sepsis when the initial host response to an infection becomes dysregulated. The clinical manifestation of sepsis is characterized by fever, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and intravascular disseminated coagulation (1Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). These effects are not the result of LPS toxicity but are rather a consequence of cell activation by LPS and a subsequent dysregulation of the inflammatory host response. The biological activity of LPS is harbored in the lipid anchor of the molecule, termed lipid A or “the endotoxic principle” of LPS (2Lüderitz O. Galanos C. Lehmann V. Mayer H. Rietschel E.T. Weckesser J. Naturwissenschaften. 1978; 65: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A variety of investigations in the structural prerequisites for biological activity of lipid A have revealed that the immune response is critically dependent on a certain chemical structure. Based upon detailed investigations showing that variations of the chemical structure of Escherichia coli-type lipid A, such as the reduction of the number of acyl chains or the cleavage of phosphate groups, lead to a strong decrease in biological activity (3Loppnow H. Brade H. Dürrbaum I. Dinarello C.A. Kusumoto S. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.-D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3229-3238PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pohlman T.H. Munford R.S. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that the most potent lipid A is the hexaacylated lipid A from E. coli with a bisphosphorylated diglucosamine backbone. In contrast, the nature of the physical state of biologically active LPS has long been under debate. In an aqueous environment and at concentrations above a lipid-specific concentration, amphiphilic molecules like lipid A form supramolecular aggregate structures. The type of aggregate strongly depends on the chemical structure of the aggregate-forming molecules. Combined biophysical and immunological investigations into the role of the aggregate structure for biological activity have shown that only conical molecules, which form cubic inverted aggregate structures, exhibit high endotoxic activity, whereas cylindrical molecules, forming lamellar aggregate structures, exhibit low or no endotoxic activity (5Brandenburg K. Mayer H. Koch M.H.J. Weckesser J. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, the shape of the aggregate-forming molecules, including the aggregate structure, correlate with the ability to activate host cells. This dependence has been shown for a variety of endotoxin and non-endotoxin structures (6Seydel U. Hawkins L. Schromm A.B. Heine H. Scheel O. Koch M.H. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1586-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The information on the nature of the biologically active unit of LPS is of utmost importance and can be very valuable for an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell activation. Thus, there is only limited information on the specific interaction of LPS with cellular receptors such as CD14 or Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (7Akashi S. Saitoh S. Wakabayashi Y. Kikuchi T. Takamura N. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Adachi Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Synthetic lipid A analogues and partial structures are invaluable tools for systematic elucidation of the physicochemical requirements for biological activity. The available preparations have a broad range of biological activities, ranging from high endotoxicity for compound 506, corresponding to the hexaacylated lipid A from E. coli, to compounds without endotoxic activity in humans such as compound 406, corresponding to the tetraacylated lipid A precursor IVa. However, we describe here that, in contrast to what one might expect and what was found earlier (8Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.T. Westphal O. Brade H. Brade L. Freudenberg M. Schade U. Imoto M. Yoshimura H. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), the biological activity of pure synthetic preparations of hexaacylated lipid A from E. coli (compound 506) is much lower than that of preparations of natural lipid A. Based on this observation, we analyzed the chemical composition of several natural lipid A preparations. The data presented reveal high heterogeneity of natural lipid A preparations, an observation that has been described earlier by others as well (9Nowotny A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1987; 9: S503-S511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of mixing chemically different lipid A for biological activity are, however, not well understood. We asked the question whether the higher biological activity of these heterogeneous lipid A preparations is due to the influence of heterogeneity on the physical state of such preparations. Using chemically well characterized lipid A and LPS preparations, we performed a panel of experiments to investigate the importance of the chemical composition for the biological activity of lipid A preparations. Thus, we prepared mixtures of compounds 506 and 406 in varying molar ratios and observed an increase in endotoxic activity as compared with the same total amount of pure 506 at low admixtures of 406 (<20%) when the compounds were mixed in chloroform prior to their transference into the aqueous phase to form mixed aggregates (aggr.(506 + 406)) and their administration to the immune cells. However, when pure aggregates of compound 506 and of compound 406 were mixed in water (aggr.(506) plus aggr.(406)), the expected antagonistic action of 406 was observed. We then performed experiments using various phospholipids instead of compound 406 and arrived at very similar results and concluded that underacylated endotoxin or even phospholipid molecules introduce heterogeneities in endotoxin aggregates and, thus, reduce the binding energy. These results seemed, therefore, to support the hypothesis that the biologically active state of endotoxin is the aggregate and not the monomer. To further prove this hypothesis, we applied a dialysis procedure to separate endotoxin monomers from mixed suspensions of aggregates and monomers and compared the biological activities of monomers and aggregates at same concentrations. These experiments provided unequivocal evidence that only endotoxin in the aggregated form is biologically active. Lipids and Other Chemicals—Deep rough mutant Re LPS from E. coli strain F515 and rough mutant Ra LPS from Salmonella enterica sv. Minnesota strain R60 were extracted by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method (10Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), purified, lyophilized, and transformed into the triethylamine salt form. To obtain free lipid A, the deep rough mutant LPS was treated with acetate buffer (1 m, 100 °C, 1.5 h), dialyzed, and transformed into the triethylamine salt form. The synthetic hexaacylated lipid A compound 506 and the synthetic tetraacylated lipid A compound 406 were synthesized as described earlier (11Imoto M. Yoshimura N. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B. 1984; 60: 285-288Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Imoto M. Yoshimura H. Shimamoto T. Sakaguchi N. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1987; 60: 2205-2214Crossref Google Scholar, 13Oikawa M. Wada A. Yoshizaki H. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1997; 70: 1435-1440Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin, CL) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). For the preparation of LPS, lipid A, or CL suspensions, the compounds were first suspended in chloroform, and the solvent was evaporated under N2. The dry lipids were then resuspended in distilled water by thorough vortexing and the suspension was temperature cycled at least twice between 4 and 56 °C, each cycle followed by intense vortexing for a few minutes, and then stored at 4 °C for at least 12 h prior to measurement. We prepared mixtures of compounds 506 and 406 in two different ways: 1) The two compounds were mixed in chloroform at different molar ratios, the solvent was evaporated, and the dry mixtures were resuspended in distilled water to produce aggregate suspensions that were mixed on the molecular level, consisting of both types of molecules, 406 and 506. These mixed aggregates are termed “aggr.(506 + 406).” 2) Aggregates containing only compound 506 or compound 406 were prepared as described above (suspension in chloroform, evaporation of solvent, and resuspension in distilled water), and the aggregates were mixed in the aqueous phase in different molar ratios. These aggregate mixtures are termed “aggr.(506) plus aggr.(406).” Preparations with CL instead of compound 406 were done analogously. Preparation of Monomer Suspensions—Monomer solutions were obtained in a dialysis setup consisting of a donor and an acceptor chamber, separated by a dialysis diaphragm with a cut-off of 5000 Da, thus allowing only monomers to pass. The donor chamber was filled with endotoxin suspensions at a concentration (10-6m) well above the assumed critical micellar concentration of about 10-8m (14Buschner S. Ph.D. thesis, Bestimmung der kritischen Aggregatkonzentrationen von Lipiden: Implikationen für die biologische Wirksamkeit von Endotoxinen. Christian-Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany1999Google Scholar). The acceptor chamber was filled with distilled water. After 48 h, the concentrations of the endotoxin aggregates and the monomers on the donor and on the acceptor side, respectively, were determined mass spectrometrically via the measurement of the hydroxy-fatty acid concentration. For this, a deuterium-labeled standard (3OH-D5-14:0, Amersham Biosciences) was added to each sample. The samples were then lyophilized, resuspended in 1 ml of 4 m HCl, and heated for 4 h at 100 °C. After centrifugation, the samples were resuspended in 1 ml of 5 m NaOH and incubated for 30 min at 100 °C. The fatty acids were extracted with chloroform, and the solvent was evaporated under N2. For analysis in the GC-MS (GC model 5890, MSD model 5970, both Hewlett Packard) the fatty acids were methylated with diazomethane. The endotoxin concentration was determined by calculating the area ratio of the standard mass peak and hydroxy fatty acid mass peak. Stimulation of Human Mononuclear Cells—In experiments for determining the cytokine-inducing capacity of LPS, human mononuclear cells (MNCs) were stimulated with LPS, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α production of the cells was determined in the supernatant. Blood for human mononuclear cell preparation was obtained from healthy volunteers. MNCs were isolated by separation from whole blood, using Ficoll-Hypaque as previously described (15Gutsmann T. Müller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Stimulation experiments were done either under serum-free conditions or in the presence of serum or LPS-binding protein (LBP). For stimulation experiments under serum-free conditions, cells were washed several times in RPMI 1640 (containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and 200 μl/well MNCs (1 × 106 cells/well) were transferred to 96-well culture plates. For experiments in the presence of serum or LBP either 4% AB serum or 100 ng/ml LBP (kind gift of R. Dedrick, XOMA Corp.) was added to the cell culture medium. LPS was serially diluted in RPMI 1640 and added to the cultures at 20 μl per well. The cultures were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation of the culture plates for 10 min at 400 × g and stored at -20 °C until determination of cytokine content. The immunological determination of TNFα in the cell supernatant was determined in a sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described elsewhere (16Gallati H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1982; 20: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar). Microtiter plates (Greiner, Solingen, Germany) were coated overnight at room temperature with a monoclonal mouse antibody against human TNFα (Intex AG, Switzerland) followed by three washings with water. One-hundred-microliter samples of culture supernatants were dispensed into the wells and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human TNFα antibody (Intex) for 16–24 h at 4 °C. After washing, the color reaction was started by addition of tetramethylbenzidine/H2O2 and stopped by the addition of 1 m sulfuric acid. Serial dilutions of human recombinant TNFα (Intex) provided a standard curve. Plates were read at 450 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay photometer. Quantification of TNFα was determined in duplicate with detection ranges of 0–500 pg/ml. Due to donor-specific variations in the TNFα production from MNCs, one representative data set out of three is shown, and data given are mean of triplicates ± S.D. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay—Endotoxic activity of aggregates and monomers was determined by a quantitative kinetic assay based on the reactivity of Gram-negative endotoxin with Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) at 37 °C using test kits of LAL Coamatic Chromo-LAL K (Chromogenix, Hemochrom) (17Friberger P. Sörskog L. Nilsson K. Knös M. Watson S.W. Levin J. Novitsky T.J. Detection of Bacterial Endotoxin with the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test. Alan R. Liss, New York1987: 49-169Google Scholar). The standard endotoxin used in this test was from E. coli (O55:B5), and 1 ng/ml of this LPS corresponds to ∼10 endotoxin units/ml according to the manufacturer. In this assay, saturation occurs at 125 endotoxin units/ml and the resolution limit is >0.1 endotoxin unit/ml (maximum value for ultrapure water for embryo transfer, Sigma). Endotoxin-free water (Aqua B. Braun) was used for sample dilution. Data shown are mean of duplicates and are representative of two individual experiments. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—The chemical structure and the biological heterogeneity of the lipid A used in the different experiments were controlled by MALDI-TOF MS applying a Bruker-Reflex II instrument (Bruker-Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) in linear configuration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Lipid A samples were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (50:50, v/v) at a concentration of 2 μg/μl and treated with a small amount of an Amberlite IR-120 (H+) cation exchange resin to remove disturbing sodium and potassium ions as described elsewhere (18Lindner B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 311-325PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-μl sample was mixed with a 1-μl matrix solution (0.5 m 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone, Aldrich) in methanol. Aliquots of 0.5 μl were deposited on a metallic sample holder and analyzed immediately after drying in a stream of air. Mass spectra were recorded in negative and positive ion modes. Mass scale calibration was performed externally with similar compounds of known chemical structure. Variations in the Chemical Structure and Biological Activities of Synthetic Lipid A Analogue 506 and Natural Lipid A Preparations—The chemical structure of the lipid A part of LPS critically determines the biological activity of lipid A and LPS preparations. When stimulating MNCs with synthetic and natural lipid A preparations ex vivo to produce TNFα, the biological activity of pure preparations of synthetic hexaacylated compound 506 showed reduced TNFα production in comparison to equal amounts of preparations of natural lipid A, such as lipid A derived from E. coli strain F515 (Fig. 1). Based upon this observation, we analyzed the chemical composition of the synthetic compound 506 and several natural lipid A preparations by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As expected the negative ion mass spectrum of compound 506 (Fig. 2A) comprises only one abundant molecular ion at m/z 1796 representing the pure hexaacylated bisphosphorylated lipid A. In contrast, the analysis of two different batches of natural lipid A isolated from LPS of E. coli F515 revealed heterogeneities to different extents (Fig. 2, B and C), possibly caused by different environmental growth conditions or minor differences in the isolation procedure. Besides the still predominant molecular ion of the hexaacylated lipid A, the spectra revealed abundant peaks at m/z 1586 and 1360 corresponding to pentaacylated and tetraacylated lipid A species missing the secondary 14:0 fatty acid linked to the primary 14:0(3-OH) fatty acid or the complete double ester 14:0[3-O(14:0)] in position 3′ of the non-reducing GlcN (Δm 436). It has been shown earlier that the underacylated species after separation and purification exhibit almost no endotoxic activity but instead act as antagonists (19Zähringer U. Salvetzki R. Wagner F. Lindner B. Ulmer A.J. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2001; 7: 133-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Loppnow H. Moran A.P. Koch M.H. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the spectra of both lipid A batches provide evidence for the presence of minor amounts of monophosphorylated species and heptaacylated species carried in position 3 of the reducing GlcN 14:0[3-O(16:0)] instead of 14:0[3-OH] (Δm 238). The isolated heptaacylated compound has been shown to express moderate endotoxic activity (21Janusch H. Brecker L. Lindner B. Alexander C. Gronow S. Heine H. Ulmer A.J. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2002; 8: 343-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Variations in the chemical structures of synthetic lipid A analogue 506 and of natural lipid A. Negative ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra of synthetic hexaacyl lipid A analogue 506 (A) and natural lipid A isolated from different batches of LPS obtained from E. coli strain F515 (B and C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Considering the significant quantities of antagonistic structures in the natural preparations of lipid A, their high biological activity is particularly surprising. We put up the hypothesis that the presence of endotoxically inactive structures in those preparations have an impact on the physical state of the biologically active structures and by this means increase their endotoxic activity. Molecular Composition of Aggregates Critically Determines Their Biological Activity—Even though there is a broad collection of data showing a strong relationship between aggregate structure and biological activity, the role of the physical state of endotoxin for the display of endotoxic activity is not very well understood. We sought to investigate whether the observed differences in biological activity of homo- versus heterogeneous endotoxin preparations is the result of differences in the physical state of such preparations. We used two chemically pure and highly defined synthetic lipid A preparations to address this question, the endotoxically active compound 506 and the endotoxically inactive and even antagonistic compound 406, and prepared mixtures of these in two different ways to obtain either mixed aggregates (aggr.(506 + 406)) or aggregate mixtures (see “Experimental Procedures”). The two differently prepared mixed suspensions were used to stimulate human mononuclear cells to produce TNFα. In Fig. 3A the result of a representative stimulation experiment is shown. It is obvious that there is a clear difference in the biological effects in dependence on the type of aggregates added to the cells. When compounds 406 and 506 were added as aggregate mixtures (aggr.(506) plus aggr.(406)) to stimulate the cells, the production of TNFα induced by compound 506 was reduced in the presence of compound 406, representing the known antagonizing effect of compound 406. This antagonistic effect of compound 406 was already evident at a ratio of 406 to 506 of 0.1:1. However, when mixed aggregates of compounds 406 and 506 (aggr.(506 + 406)) were used to stimulate the cells, the results were different depending on the molar ratios of compound 406 and compound 506. In contrast to stimulation with aggregate mixtures (aggr.(506) plus aggr.(406)), stimulation with mixed aggregates (aggr.(506 + 406)), at molar ratios of 406 to 506 between 0.1:1 and 0.2:1, resulted in clearly higher biological activity than stimulation with compound 506 alone. This observation clearly shows that the antagonistic action of 406 depends on the physical state of the molecule, which is obviously different in mixed aggregates than in pure aggregate suspensions. However, at molar ratios of 406 to 506 equal or above 0.5:1, the biological activity was reduced, showing an antagonistic effect of compound 406. Analogous results can be observed, when, instead of compound 406, suspensions of phospholipids (PLs) such as diphosphatidylglycerol CL (Fig. 3B), phosphatidylcholine, or lysophosphatidylcholine, respectively, were used (data not shown). Thus, the presence of these phospholipids at low molar ratios in preparations of compound 506 (aggr.(506 + PL)) led to an increase of TNFα production of MNCs, whereas aggregate mixtures of phospholipids and compound 506 (aggr.(506) plus aggr.(PL)) led to a decrease of TNFα production. The observed differences in the biological activities of the differently prepared aggregate suspensions allow us to conclude that the activation of cells, as well as the inhibition of cell activation by antagonistic structures, are most likely mediated by aggregates instead of monomeric molecular endotoxin structures. Lipid A and LPS Display Their Biological Activity Only in the Form of Aggregates but Not as Monomers—To get further evidence for the nature of the biologically active unit of endotoxin, we constructed a dialysis system that allows the separation of monomers from aggregate suspensions and that always contains a certain number of monomers. The dialysis system consists of two Teflon chambers, separated by a dialysis membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 5000 Da. Because the molecular mass of hexaacylated E. coli-type lipid A is 1797 Da, only monomers or dimers are supposed to pass the membrane. Dimers are, however, not stable in aqueous environments and decompose readily to monomers. Aggregate suspensions at a concentration of 10-6m, which is still well above the assumed critical micellar concentration of lipid A of ∼10-8m (14Buschner S. Ph.D. thesis, Bestimmung der kritischen Aggregatkonzentrationen von Lipiden: Implikationen für die biologische Wirksamkeit von Endotoxinen. Christian-Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany1999Google Scholar, 22Israelachvili J.N. Intermolecular and Surface Forces. 2nd. Ed. Academic Press, London1991: 341-364Google Scholar), were filled into one side of the dialysis chamber, and samples were taken from both sides after 48 h and analyzed to determine the endotoxin concentration by GC-MS via the determination of the concentration of the hydroxy fatty acids. With this method concentrations of endotoxin as low as 5 × 10-10m could be determined. Using aggregated and monomeric samples of lipid A or of Re LPS (Fig. 4) to stimulate human mononuclear cells showed, that aggregate suspensions have significantly higher biological activity than monomer solutions of identical concentration. In independent stimulation experiments using cells from various donors, this result could be observed for stimulation under serum-free culture conditions (Fig. 4A), under serum-free conditions in the presence of the LPS-binding protein LBP (Fig. 4B), and in the presence of human AB serum (Fig. 4C). In Table I, respective data for lipid A, Re LPS, and Ra LPS from several independent experiments are summarized. To account for donor-specific variations in response to endotoxin, the data were normalized by setting the TNFα production induced by aggregates to 100%. These data clearly indicate that the biologically active unit of lipid A and LPS is the aggregate and not the monomer.Table ITNFα production from human MNC induced by endotoxin monomers given as percentage of TNFα production induced by the corresponding aggregates Human MNC were stimulated for 4 h either under serum-free conditions, in the presence of 100 ng/ml LBP, or in the presence of 4% AB serum with endotoxin aggregates or monomers at 10-9m.

Using aggregate and monomer samples obtained as described above, we could show that, again, at identical concentrations aggregates of lipid A or Re LPS have comparable activity in this assay, whereas the respective monomers show no activity (Fig. 5). The elucidation of the biologically active chemical structure of LPS has been addressed by a number of scientists in the past. The definition of lipid A as the “endotoxic principle” was a benchmark, initiating a variety of investigations to pinpoint the chemical groups that harbor the activating principles within the lipid A structure. The data available assemble into a detailed picture of the submolecular structures that are important for biological activity. However, bacteria display and release a variety of different LPS species from their outer membranes. As we describe here and has been discussed by others in the past (23Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1994; 50: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Wollenweber H.W. Broady K.W. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), natural preparations of LPS or lipid A do not contain a single molecular species with defined chemical structure but are complex mixtures of molecules differing mainly in the degree of acylation (Fig. 2). This heterogeneity leads to surprising consequences for biological activity. In contrast to what one might expect, the presence of low concentrations of structures, which per se express low agonistic or even antagonistic activity found in natural LPS preparations such as pentaacylated or tetraacytaled lipid A, respectively, does not lead to a decrease but to an increase in the inflammatory activity of the respective LPS or lipid A preparation. In line with this observation is the finding, that the synthetic compound 506 is less active than the according natural lipid A preparation derived from E. coli (Fig. 1). The difference in the biological activity between the different preparations becomes even more obvious when considering that in the case of sample A only ∼80% and in the case of sample B ∼45% of the total mass correspond to hexaacylated Lipid A. These observations could be confirmed and can be explained by the results from mixing experiments, in which we compared the biological activity of defined mixtures with those of the respective pure components of the mixture. The presence of chemical structures such as biologically non-active compound 406 at low molecular ratios in preparations of hexaacylated lipid A leads to an increase in biological activity (Fig. 3A). The same effect could be observed when, instead of compound 406, tetraacylated diphosphatidylglycerol CL (Fig. 3B), diacylated phospholipids such as PC, or even lysophospholipids were used. Because these non-lipid A structures give rise to the same biological effect as antagonistic lipid A structures, the underlying mechanism is unlikely to be based on specific chemical structures of these compounds. The enhancing effect on the biological activity of homogenous hexaacyl lipid A by the admixture of low amounts of amphiphilic compounds with less than six fatty acid residues was observed, however, only when the two compounds were mixed in an organic phase and the mixture was then transferred to the aqueous phase. The mixtures thus represented mixed aggregates. By mixing the preformed aggregates of the two compounds in the aqueous phase, the aggregates stay separated, and under these conditions the presence of aggregates made from per se antagonistic molecules leads to the expected antagonistic effect already at low concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, it seems more likely that a mechanism responsible for the enhancing effect of compound 406 or phospholipids in mixed aggregates could be the reduction of the binding energy in aggregates by the presence of molecules of different chemical structure. In crystallography such heterogeneities would be defined as imperfections. These results definitely support the idea that aggregates play an important role in cell activation by endotoxin. The question, whether LPS activates host cells as monomeric molecules or as multimeric aggregates, has been under debate for a long time. Several publications have addressed this question with contrasting results. Shnyra et al. (25Shnyra A. Hultenby K. Lindberg A.A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5351-5360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that aggregated LPS activated the LAL cascade to a higher degree than monomerized LPS and was lethal in galactosamine-sensitized mice in lower doses, whereas Takayama et al. (26Takayama K. Din Z.Z. Mukerjee P. Cooke P.H. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14023-14029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that LPS is an order of 2.5 more active in stimulating a pro-B-cell line in a disaggregated state (26Takayama K. Din Z.Z. Mukerjee P. Cooke P.H. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14023-14029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was more active in the LAL assay than aggregated LPS (27Takayama K. Mitchell D.H. Din Z.Z. Mukerjee P. Li C. Coleman D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2241-2244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several years ago, the term pathogen-associated molecular pattern was introduced as a superordinate term for a variety of molecules displayed by pathogens such as LPS, peptidoglycan, and lipopeptides. These molecules are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the host cell, leading to an inflammatory response. The term pattern implies that PRRs recognize recurrent molecular motives such as those displayed in supramolecular structures represented by aggregates. With the aim of supporting the results from the mixing experiments (Fig. 3), which give evidence that the biological activity of LPS, whether agonistic or antagonistic, is displayed by aggregates rather than by single molecules, we employed a dialysis system to separate monomers from aggregate suspensions. With these experiments we could confirm these results and show that monomers, separated from aggregate suspensions, are not able to stimulate cells, whereas aggregates at the same concentration are highly active (Fig. 4 and Table I). Several reports have described that the role of LPS-binding proteins CD14 and LBP is the transport and disaggregation of LPS aggregates (28Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Chest. 1994; 105: 48S-50SPubMed Google Scholar, 29Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar, 30Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Assuming this, one would expect that monomers by themselves would be able to activate cells. Thus, the presentation of molecules, monomers or aggregates, by CD14 and LBP seems to be as important as the transport activity of these proteins. For example, very recent publications show that CD14 delivers LPS to a complex of TLR4 and MD2 (31Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the nature of LPS in these complexes has not been defined. Our data unequivocally show that aggregates are the biologically active unit of LPS under serum-free conditions as well as in the presence of LBP or of human serum. The fact that LPS monomers show no endotoxic activity even when LBP or serum is present indicates that these molecules can obviously not be presented to cells in a manner that is sufficient for cell activation. We acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of R. Engel, C. Hamann, and S. Groth. We thank Dr. S. Buschner for the construction of the prototype dialysis chamber, which has been modified for these experiments."

We report here the crystal structures of the ToMO hydroxylase (ToMOH), azido ToMOH, and ToMOH containing the product analogue 4-bromophenol to 2.3 A or greater resolution. The catalytic diiron(III) core resembles that of the sMMO hydroxylase, but aspects of the α2β2γ2 tertiary structure are notably different. Of particular interest is a 6–10 A-wide channel of ∼35 A in length extending from the active site to the protein surface. The presence of three bromophenol molecules in this space confirms this route as a pathway for substrate entrance and product egress. An analysis of the ToMOH active site cavity offers insights into the different substrate specificities of multicomponent monooxygenases and explains the behavior of mutant forms of homologous enzymes described in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2158196548,"The mechanisms involved in the mechanical loading-induced increase in bone formation remain unclear. In this study, we showed that cyclic strain (CS) (10 min, 1% stretch at 0.25 Hz) stimulated the proliferation of overnight serum-starved ROS 17/2.8 osteoblast-like cells plated on type I collagen-coated silicone membranes. This increase was blocked by MEK inhibitor PD-98059. Signaling events were then assessed 0 min, 30 min, and 4 h after one CS period with Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation. CS rapidly and time-dependently promoted phosphorylation of both ERK2 at Tyr-187 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr-397 and Tyr-925, leading to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. Cell transfection with FAK mutated at Tyr-397 completely blocked ERK2 Tyr-187 phosphorylation. Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of phosphotyrosine residues showed an increase in focal adhesion plaque number and size in strained cells. CS also induced both Src-Tyr-418 phosphorylation and Src to FAK association. Treatment with the selective Src family kinase inhibitor pyrazolopyrimidine 2 did not prevent CS-induced FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation suggesting a Src-independent activation of FAK. CS also activated proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a tyrosine kinase highly homologous to FAK, at the 402 phosphorylation site and promoted its association to FAK in a time-dependent manner. Mutation of PYK2 at the Tyr-402 site prevented the ERK2 phosphorylation only at 4 h. Intra and extracellular calcium chelators prevented PYK2 activation only at 4 h. In summary, our data showed that osteoblast response to mitogenic CS was mediated by MEK pathway activation. The latter was induced by ERK2 phosphorylation under the control of FAK and PYK2 phosphorylation orchestrated in a time-dependent manner.

It is now well evidenced that mechanical stimulation can increase bone mass in vivo (1Oxlund H. Andersen N.B. Ortoft G. Orskov H. Andreassen T.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) through an increase in the number of osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells. In vitro experiments have revealed that physical forces act directly at the cellular level and showed that bone cells are able to respond physiologically to mechanical stress (2Banes A.J. Tsuzaki M.

Res. 2000; 15: 1731-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It was shown that cyclic mechanical loading is more effective in inducing osteoblast proliferation and gene expression than is static loading (4Damien E. Price J.S. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). There is a large body of evidence showing that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; HA, hemagglutinin A; MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, proliferation index; PYK2, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis (o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester. controls cell proliferation in various cell types, including osteoblasts (5Lai C.F.

Recent reports demonstrated that mechanical strain is able to activate ERK1/2 in several adherent cells such as mesangial cells (6Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K. Ly H. Scholey J.W. J. Biol.

Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Bone. 2002; 31: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, cell stretch appears to be a relevant model of mechanical stimulus in the bone field (16Basso N. Heersche J.N. Bone. 2002; 30: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Miyauchi A. Notoya K. Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Takagi Y. Goto M. Miki Y. Takano-Yamamoto T. Jinnai K. Takahashi K. Kumegawa M.

Howard R.L. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E751-E758PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that control mechanically induced ERK activation in osteoblasts remain obscure. Integrins are strong candidates as mechanotransducers in mechanical strain-induced ERK activation (19Schmidt C. Pommerenke H. Durr F. Nebe B. Rychly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5081-5085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Li W. Sanders M.A. Sumpio B.E. Panja A. Basson M.D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 926-928PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, integrin-mediated cell attachment activates many intracellular signaling pathways such as tyrosine phosphorylation cascades, calcium influx, inositol lipid turnover, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, (21Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar, 22Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the first aim was to determine whether ERK1/2 activation mediated stretch-induced mitogenicity in a cyclic strain model using cell stretch. In particular, we focused on tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of proteins activated by mechanical strain. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that has been reported to play an important role in integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways (22Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, some studies showed that the adhesion of suspended cells onto components of the extracellular matrix induces the activation of proteins such as FAK at multiples sites, including Tyr-397 (23Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 24Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the only apparent autophosphorylation site (25Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 26Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). This autophosphorylation is critical, because it creates a high affinity binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of Src family kinases, leading to a signaling complex between FAK and Src family kinases (24Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). This association of FAK-Src, together with the Grb2 adaptor protein, represents one mechanism of activation of ERK by FAK (30Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). This cascade of phosphorylation events and protein-protein interaction was reported upon integrin binding. However, it is not known whether similar events are induced by the mechanical strain applied to adherent cells. Among strain-induced tyrosine phosphorylated proteins we found expression of the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, also known as proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) (31Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), cell adhesion kinase β (32Sasaki H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), or calcium-dependent protein-tyrosine kinase (33Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (for convenience, it is referred to here as PYK2). PYK2 (116 kDa) shares a 45% overall sequence similarity with FAK (125 kDa), and four of the six FAK tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr-397, -576, -577, and -925) are conserved at analogous positions in PYK2 (Tyr-402, -579, -580, and -881). Interestingly, PYK2 was found to be activated in osteoblasts by fluoroaluminate, a strong bone anabolic agent (34Jeschke M. Standke G.J. Scaronuscarona M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11354-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that this tyrosine kinase might play a critical role in the stimulation of osteoblast proliferation (35Kassem M. Mosekilde L. Eriksen E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 was markedly enhanced when the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration is increased (31Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). In our study, we therefore began to analyze the potential involvement of Ca2+ regulatory role in PYK2 activation by mechanical strain. Materials—Y402F-c-Myc-tagged PYK2 and Y397F-HA-tagged FAK were kindly provided by Dr. Shelton Earp (University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit P0448 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse P0447 were obtained from DAKO, and the phosphospecific antibodies anti-ERK-Tyr(P)-187, anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397, anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-925, anti-Src-Tyr(P)-418, and anti-PYK2-Tyr(P)-402 were purchased from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were obtained from Pierce. The stripping solution Re-Blot Plus was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). ERK2 (D-2), c-Src (B-12), Tyr(P) (PY99), and FAK (H-1) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Pyrazolopyrimidine 2 (PP-2) and PD-98059 inhibitor were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-HA and anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells—We used ROS 17/2.8 osteoblast-like cells, a well defined cell line (36Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) with the characteristics of mature osteoblasts (alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin and type I collagen expression, and the ability to mineralize), and the mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, which consists of primary osteoblastic cells from old male Wistar rats. Briefly, after removing soft tissues, metaphyses reduced to ∼2-mm-wide fragments were submitted to fractional digestions every 15 min with 1 mg/ml clostridium histolyticum neutral collagenase (Sigma) in medium at 37 °C three times with stirring. Collagenase was neutralized with medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 2 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate. The medium was changed after the first 24 h to remove non-adherent cells. Cells were grown in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas MC3T3-E1 and primary rodent osteoblastic cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. After reaching a subconfluent state, cells were trypsinized with 1× trypsin-EDTA and plated onto flexible type I collagen-coated, silicon-bottomed, six-well culture plates (Bioflex; Flexcell Corp., McKeesport, PA). Cyclic Deformation—The Flexcell Strain Unit Fx-3000 (Flexcell Corp.) was used for the application of mechanical stretch to osteoblasts (37Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes with type I collagen-coated, flexible silicone bottoms (Bioflex; Flexcell Corp.) at 5·104 cells per well density for proliferation studies and 1·105 cells per well for signal transduction studies. Seventy-two hours after seeding, cells were serum-starved overnight and then subjected to mechanical deformation. Mechanical deformation was induced with a Flexercell strain unit, which consists of a vacuum manifold regulated by solenoid valves that are controlled by a computer timer program. The Bioflex baseplate contain the Bioflex loading station that consists of six buttons per plate that insert into each plate, allowing a uniform magnitude of the strain across 85% of the surface of the flexible well. For these experiments a negative pressure of 80 kilopascals was applied through an air pump to the culture plate, bottoms were deformed to a known percentage of elongation, and then the membranes were released to their original conformation. The experimental regimens used in this study delivered 1% elongation at a rate of 15 cycles/min (a 2-s deformation period followed by a 2-s neutral position). Cells remained adherent, and the deformation of the membrane is directly transmitted to cells. Unstretched cells grown on Bioflex plates were used as controls. Proliferation Studies—ROS 17/2.8 cell proliferation was analyzed with PKH26 (38Yamamura Y. Rodriguez N. Schwartz A. Eylar E. Bagwell B. Yano N. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1995; 41: S121-S132PubMed Google Scholar, 39Barani A.E. Sabido O. Freyssenet D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). PKH26 is a fluorescent reporter molecule that incorporates into the cell membrane and is equally distributed to daughter cells following division. It was shown that PKH26 labeling is stable and reproducible and has no effect on cell proliferation (40Boutonnat J. Muirhead K.A. Barbier M. Mousseau M. Ronot X. Seigneurin D. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 4243-4251PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspension was washed in PBS/EDTA (5 μm) and incubated in 4·10-6m PKH26 staining solution for 4 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of FCS and 4 ml of proliferation medium. Cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min and washed with complete medium to remove cells from the staining solution. Then, cells were seeded at 5·104 cells onto type I collagen-precoated flexible membranes. An aliquot was fixed at day 0 in 2% paraformaldehyde and kept at 4 °C until analysis as a time 0 reference. For experimental studies, cells were allowed to recover for 72 h after seeding. Cells were then placed in serum-free media overnight and then submitted to static or strained conditions as described in the previous paragraph (“Cyclic Deformation”) in the absence or presence of 20 μm PD-98059 added 30 min before the mechanical stimulus (41Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15742-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When indicated, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and kept at 4 °C until analysis. Analysis was performed on a FACStarplus cell sorter with a 585/42-nm bandpass filter using the Cell Quest program. Each analysis was carried out on a minimum of 5 × 104 cells. Deconvolution of the cell fluorescence into peaks was performed using the Cell Proliferation Model program ran on Modftit 2.0 software. Parameters calculated included the percentage of cells in each subsequent generation, the proliferation index (PI), and the goodness of fit measured by a reduced χ2. The PI, a measure of the proliferation activity of total cell population, was calculated by ModFit 2.0 using Equation 1,PI=∑K=0K=nAk/∑K=0K=nAk2k(Eq. 1) in which Ak is the summation of the Gaussian areas in each generation and k equals the generation number. PI represents the total expansion of the parent generation as described by Nk = 2k·N0 or Nk = PI·N0, where N0 is the number of cells in the parent generation. Therefore, PI = 2k with k = t/Tg, where t is the time point considered and Tg is the generation time. Data are representative of a minimum of two separate experiments performed in triplicate with statistically significant and similar results. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentration of lysates was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were typically performed by using 1–2 mg of cell lysate and 2 μg of purified monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for Tyr(P), FAK, PYK2, Src, and ERK2. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating device, immune complexes were precipitated at 4 °C overnight on a rotating device by using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) by boiling for 5 min, electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After transfer, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-Tyr(P) (PY99), anti-ERK-Tyr(P)-187, anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397, anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-925, anti-Src-Tyr(P)-418, and anti-PYK2-tyr(P)-402 antibodies. All of these antibodies were used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (with 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with secondary antibodies (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:2000) or peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse (1:6000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents. Immunoblot were stripped by using mild antibody stripping solution and reprobed with another antibody. Band intensities were determined by densitometry using Scion Image program (Scion Corporation, Frederick, Maryland). Immunofluorescence Image Analysis—Cells were exposed to mechanical strain, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation was studied by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Cells (1·105 cells per well) were grown for 72 h on flexible type I collagen-coated, silicone-bottomed, six-well culture plates. Cells were then placed in serum-free media overnight and then submitted to static or mechanical strain conditions as described above in the paragraph entitled “Cyclic Deformation.” Immunostaining was performed on stretched and control cells at various time points after the end of the stimulation. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with cold PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99; 1:100 in 1% PBS/bovine serum albumin) and rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397 (1:100 in 1% PBS/bovine serum albumin) antibodies were applied for 1 h at 37 °C, and the cells were rewashed in PBS on a rocking platform. Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 in PBS/bovine serum albumin 1%) for 1h at 37 °C Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues were observed with fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRB, Lyon, France) and acquired with a coded CCD camera (CoolSNAP.fx, Roper Scientific, Evry, France) and Metaview system software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Image Analysis—Cells were analyzed with a semi-automatic image analyzer (Samba-Alcatel, France) on ∼120 cells per condition. Quantification was performed on confocal scanning laser images of phosphotyrosine staining (details are reported in Ref. 42Usson Y Guignandon A. Laroche N. Lafage-Proust M.H. Vico L. Cytometry. 1997; 28: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several morphological features were calculated by the image analysis program. They included the mean area or number of phosphotyrosine-positive spots (42Usson Y Guignandon A. Laroche N. Lafage-Proust M.H. Vico L. Cytometry. 1997; 28: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA and Purification—pcDNA3.1/lacZ control vector (Invitrogen), mutated PYK2 cDNAs, pcDNA3-PYK2Y402F, and the mutated FAK cDNA pcDNA3-FAKY397F vector were amplified in ultraMAX™DH5a-FT™ competent cells (Invitrogen), purified on Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France) columns, and then resuspended in sterile endotoxin-free saline solution (Qiagen; EndoFree plasmid mega kit). Plasmid DNA concentration was spectrophotometrically measured at 260/280 nm. Plasmids were digested by the specific restriction endonucleases EcoRI and PvuI (Invitrogen), and the quality of non-digested and digested DNA was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. At least 90% of non-digested plasmid DNA was supercoiled. Plasmid was stocked at -20 °C before use. Transient Transfection in Rat ROS17/2.8 Cells—pcDNA3.1/lacZ control vector (pcDNA3 vector), pcDNA3-PYK2Y402F, and the pcDNA3-FAKY397F vector were transfected into ROS 17/2.8 cells with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were fed fresh medium and allowed to grow for 1 day. Cells were then placed in serum-free medium overnight and then submitted to static or strained conditions as described above in the paragraph entitled “Cyclic Deformation.” Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. On average, 30% of the cells were highly stained as determined by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining. We also obtained similar results when we transfected ROS 17/2.8 with HA-FAKY397F and then immunostained with the HA antibody (not shown). Statistics—All data were obtained from at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed with Mann-Whitney's nonparametric test for unpaired samples. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Strain-induced Proliferation—In this experiment, ROS 17/2.8 cell proliferation was analyzed 24 and 48 h after strain stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, the fraction of cells in each generation can be assessed by the PI, a measure of the proliferation activity of total cell population. ROS 17/2.8 cells submitted to cyclic strain were more numerous than unstrained cells at 24 h as well as at 48 h after a 10-min strain period (Fig 1A). Indeed, in a typical 48-h experiment as shown by both the FL2 histogram (i.e. PKH-26 profile; Fig 1B, upper panel) and the percentages of cells in each generation (Fig 1B, table), the strained cell numbers were 24.9 ± 1.4% and 52.4 ± 2.4% in the second and the third generation, respectively, whereas the unstrained cell numbers were 66.14 ± 1.9% and 9.3 ± 3.2% in the second and the third generation, respectively. MEK Inhibition Blocked Strain-induced Proliferation—We hypothesized that the mitogenic cyclic strain was mediated by MEK pathway activation. Treatment of the culture medium with the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 (20 μm) during the 24- or 48-h incubation period did not affect the cell morphology, at least not at the light microscopic level, but completely blocked strain-induced proliferation. PD-98059-treated static monolayers in the same experiment proliferated equivalently to static monolayers in control or Me2SO-treated media, but no increase in proliferation was observed in response to strain (Fig 1A). No effect on either basal or strain-stimulated proliferation was observed with the Me2SO vehicle control. Cyclic Strain Phosphorylated ERK—Because cyclic strain stimulated ROS 17/2.8 proliferation, we measured ERK phosphorylation in time course experiments using phosphospecific antibodies. Cyclic strain induced ERK2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in contrast to the case with ERK1, which was weakly phosphorylated. Strain-induced ERK2 at Tyr-187 phosphorylation increased progressively from 0 min to 4 h after strain up to 429 ± 84% of control (p < 0.05; n = 3) as measured by densitometric scanning (Fig. 2). Identification of Phosphotyrosine-containing Proteins Induced by Cyclic Strain—To investigate the involvement of upstream protein tyrosine phosphorylation involved in stretch-induced ERK activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was examined by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. In response to cyclic strain, a time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins was observed in ROS 17/2.8 cells (Fig. 3) as well as in the mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 (data not shown). These proteins included broad bands of 125, 116, 68, and 60 kDa. The increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation level was detected as early as the end of strain and was extended up to 4 h. Under basal conditions (i.e. after an overnight serum starvation), a significant level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed, probably because of integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation linked to the extracellular matrix adhesion (43Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Because major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected at 60–70 and 110–125 kDa, we examined the involvement of the tyrosine phosphorylations of pp125FAK (125 kDa) (44Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2052938761,"Apoptosis results in cell shrinkage and intracellular acidification, processes opposed by the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 Na+/H+ exchanger. In addition to mediating Na+/H+ transport, NHE1 interacts with ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM), which tethers NHE1 to cortical actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell shape, adhesion, motility, and resistance to apoptosis. We hypothesize that apoptotic stress activates NHE1-dependent Na+/H+ exchange, and NHE1-ERM interaction is required for cell survival signaling. Apoptotic stimuli induced NHE1-regulated Na+/H+ transport, as demonstrated by ethyl-N-isopropyl-amiloride-inhibitable, intracellular alkalinization. Ectopic NHE1, but not NHE3, expression rescued NHE1-null cells from apoptosis induced by staurosporine or N-ethylmaleimide-stimulated KCl efflux. When cells were subjected to apoptotic stress, NHE1 and phosphorylated ERM physically associated within the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction, resulting in activation of the pro-survival kinase, Akt. NHE1-associated Akt activity and cell survival were inhibited in cells expressing ERM binding-deficient NHE1, dominant negative ezrin constructs, or ezrin mutants with defective binding to phosphoinositide 3-kinase, an upstream regulator of Akt. We conclude that NHE1 promotes cell survival by dual mechanisms: by defending cell volume and pHi through Na+/H+ exchange and by functioning as a scaffold for recruitment of a signalplex that includes ERM, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Akt.

Apoptosis is necessary for organogenesis, resolution of tissue injury, and pathobiologic cell deletion programs. Typical morphologic features of apoptotic cells include membrane blebbing, which is invariably followed by cytoplasmic shrinkage and chromatin condensation. Pathways regulating apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) 1The abbreviations used are: AVD, apoptotic volume decrease; HRPT, human renal proximal tubule; STS, staurosporine; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein; ERM, ezrin/radixin/moesin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RVI, regulatory volume increase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EIPA, ethyl-N-isopropylamiloride; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; ANOVA, analysis of variance. have been extensively studied and include activation of ion channels that mediate Na+,K+, and Cl- efflux (1Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, less is known about counter-regulatory pathways, which promote cell survival by maintaining intracellular volume. In contrast to lymphocytes and mesenchymal cells, epithelial cells are relatively resistant to shrinkage from hypertonic stimuli or AVD (2Orlov S.N. Dam T.V. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because of robust intracellular volume expansion through activation of regulatory volume increase (RVI) pathways (4Grinstein S.

Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Activation of the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger is an important RVI component (5McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 6Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol.

Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), resulting in Na+ influx and cytoplasmic volume expansion. Concomitant NHE1-dependent H+ extrusion also leads to intracellular alkalinization, which may defend against apoptosis by inhibiting caspase catalysis (8Matsuyama S. Llopis J. Deveraux Q.L. Tsien R.Y. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 9Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1196-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); by preventing conformational changes in Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (10Tafani M. Cohn J.A. Karpinich N.O. Rothman R.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49569-49576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); or by extruding cytosolic H+ resulting from apoptosis-induced mitochondrial H+ release (8Matsuyama S. Llopis J. Deveraux Q.L. Tsien R.Y. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that NHE1 is cleaved by caspase-3 in renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, and apoptosis in an NHE-deficient cell line was diminished by NHE1 reconstitution (11Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wang L.M. Jarad G. Miller R.T. Konieczkowski M. Brown A.M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F829-F839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that NHE1 activity is critical for cell survival. Furthermore, mutant NHE1 expression studies demonstrated that domains regulating Na+/H+ exchange, as well as interaction with ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, were required for cell survival (11Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wang L.M. Jarad G. Miller R.T. Konieczkowski M. Brown A.M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F829-F839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERM proteins bind directly to the membrane-proximal NHE1 cytoplasmic domain (12Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), which tethers NHE1 to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and regulates Na+/H+ transport-independent functions, such as maintenance of cell shape, focal adhesion formation, and specific aspects of cell migration (12Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 13Denker S.P. Barber D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), implying that NHE1 directs separable Na+/H+ exchange- and ERM-dependent cell functions. Linkage of NHE1 and ERM to downstream cell survival signaling pathways has not been described. ERM proteins were originally identified as molecular linkers between cytoskeleton and plasma membrane proteins and have therefore been viewed primarily as structural proteins. However, ezrin has subsequently been shown to directly interact with signaling enzymes, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (14Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Perez O.D. Kinoshita S. Hitoshi Y. Payan D.G. Kitamura T. Nolan G.P. Lorens J.B. Immunity. 2002; 16: 51-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting that ERM proteins may also regulate cell phenotype by functioning as molecular scaffolds for assembly and integration of cytoskeleton-based signalplexes. Because PI3K phosphorylates diverse protein substrates, including precursors in a cascade that results in activation of the survival kinase Akt, we have hypothesized that cell survival is promoted by a signaling complex that includes NHE1, ERM, PI3K, and Akt. We show that apoptotic or hypertonic stress causes NHE1-mediated Na+/H+ exchange, as well as activation of a new pathway that involves NHE1 interaction with ERM proteins within a cytoskeletal compartment, which up-regulates Akt activity and cell survival.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-NHE1 IgG was generated against an NHE1 cytoplasmic domain peptide (17Kitamura K. Singer W.D. Cano A. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C101-C110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and affinity-purified as previously described (11Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wang L.M. Jarad G. Miller R.T. Konieczkowski M. Brown A.M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F829-F839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal, HA epitope-tagged rat NHE1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. J. Orlowski (McGill University). Anti-NHE3 IgG was a gift from Dr. O. Moe (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). KR/A and E266I NHE1 mutant cDNAs were gifts from Dr. D. Barber (University of California at San Francisco). Cell Lines—The HRPT human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line (a gift from Dr. L. Racusen, Johns Hopkins University) and LLC-PK1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone solution (Sigma). NHE-deficient PS120 cells (gift from Drs. D. Grall and J. Pouysségur, University of Nice) were derived from CCL39 fibroblasts (18Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected with wild-type ezrin, constitutively active ezrin (T567D), dominant negative ezrin (T567A), amino-terminal ezrin, and Y353F ezrin point mutant constructs (gifts from Dr. M. Arpin, Institut Curie) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 0.7 g/liter G418 (Invitrogen). In some experiments, LLC-PK1 cells were rendered NHE-deficient according to established H+ suicide methods (18Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). NHE1 Stimulation—NHE1 was activated by the addition of NH4Cl (50 mm for 25 min at 37 °C) to stimulate cytosol acidification and immediate Na+/H+ exchange following NH4Cl washout (19Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar) or by hypertonic stress following the addition of sucrose to isotonic media (20Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pHi Measurement—Following experimental treatments, BCECF (1 μm for 20 min at room temperature) was added to adherent cells, which were maintained in serum-free medium in a dark environment. The cells were lifted with trypsin-EDTA, pelleted, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. BCECF fluorescence was measured immediately at 37 °C with a SLM-Aminco model 8100 spectrofluorometer (Rochester, NY) at 439-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths. Calibrations were performed by adding pH buffers to cells permeabilized with nigericin (5 mm stock, 10 μl in a 2-ml cuvette volume). pHi was calculated from fluorescence ratios using Intracellular Probe Math software (Rochester, NY). Apoptosis Assays—The cells were plated on glass coverslips at 0.25 × 106 cells/ml density, grown to 80% confluence, and then maintained in serum-free medium with apoptotic stimuli. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with PI3K or Akt inhibitors before apoptosis induction. Apoptotic cells were identified by simultaneous fluorescence labeling of chromatin with DAPI and externalized phosphatidylserine with annexin V as previously described (11Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wang L.M. Jarad G. Miller R.T. Konieczkowski M. Brown A.M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F829-F839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Khan S. Cleveland R.P.

Random fields were viewed at 40× magnification with a Nikon epifluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan), and the percentage of apoptotic cells was separately determined by two blinded observers from a total of 200 cells/experimental condition. Plasmid Transfections—Plasmids were transformed into DH-5α-competent bacterial cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), extracted using a Maxiprep kit (Qiagen), and amplified by culture in Luria-Bertani-ampicillin broth. cDNAs were transiently transfected into cells according to previously described methods (22Khan S. Koepke A. Jarad G. Schlessman K. Cleveland R.P. Wang B.C. Konieczkowski M. Schelling J.R. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 65-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated into six-well plates (0.25 × 106 cells/well) and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum to achieve 80% confluence. The transfection mixture, which contained 2.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in 100 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) was mixed for 20 min at room temperature and then added to each well with complete medium for 24 h. The cells were evaluated at 24–48 h post-transfection. Immunoblot Analysis—The methods have previously been described in detail (23Schelling J.R. Gentry D.J. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F682-F690PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared in boiling 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue) and assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad). The proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min, and the samples were resolved by 8% or 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and incubated with anti-HA (for NHE1 expression), anti-phospho-ERM, or antiphospho-Akt antibody (1:1000, 4 °C, overnight), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature) or anti-mouse (1:4,000, 1 h, room temperature) antibodies. In some experiments, the blots were stripped with 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and reprobed for protein loading with anti-ezrin (1:500 at 4 °C overnight) or anti-Akt1 (1:100, 4 °C, overnight) antibodies. Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, individual band intensity was quantified using Adobe Photoshop software (San Jose, CA). Immunoprecipitation from Cytoskeleton Fractions—The cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.05% SDS, 50 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (4 °C, 1 h). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cytoskeleton-rich pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS and then diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer. The protein content was quantified, and lysates containing 700 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-NHE1 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml, 4 °C, overnight) according to established methods (24Jarad G. Wang B. Khan S. DeVore J. Miao H. Wu K. Nishimura S.L. Wible B.A. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47826-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated with γ-bind protein G-Sepharose beads (4 °C for 1 h) and then washed with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 25 μlof 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and then evaluated as described under “Immunoblot Analysis.” RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition of Akt expression was achieved with the SignalSilence Akt siRNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Briefly, LLC-PK1 cells at 50% confluence were incubated with Akt siRNA, negative control β8 integrin (24Jarad G. Wang B. Khan S. DeVore J. Miao H. Wu K. Nishimura S.L. Wible B.A. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47826-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or fluorescein-labeled, nonspecific siRNA (to assess transfection efficiency) (50 nm each). At 48 h post-transfection, transfection efficiency was verified to be >90%. The cells were then induced to undergo apoptosis, lysed, and probed for Akt expression by immunoblot analysis. The blots were stripped and reprobed for α-tubulin as a control for protein loading and nonspecific RNA interference effects. In parallel experiments, siRNA-transfected cells were assayed for apoptosis by annexin V labeling and DAPI staining of chromatin, as described above. Statistics—The data are representative of three experiments/condition. The graphical results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by one-way analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls or Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons of parametric and nonparametric data, respectively. Comparison between two groups was made by paired t test methods. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. NHE1 Defends against Apoptotic Stress—To assess whether NHE1 is activated in cells subjected to apoptotic stress, HRPT cells were stimulated with staurosporine in the presence and absence of NHE1 selective inhibitor EIPA. Intracellular pH was determined by BCECF-acetoxymethyl ester fluorescence. HRPT cells demonstrated initial intracellular alkalinization in response to staurosporine, which was blunted by EIPA (Table I), suggesting that NHE1-dependent RVI is a defense against apoptosis. Staurosporine exposure beyond 2 h was associated with cytosol acidification (Table I), in agreement with the kinetics of NHE1 degradation by caspase-3 (11Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wang L.M. Jarad G. Miller R.T. Konieczkowski M. Brown A.M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F829-F839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were observed following UV light exposure (30 J/m2), a dissimilar stimulus of mitochondrial apoptosis (not shown). These data are consistent with a recent report by Bortner and Cidlowski (25Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39176-39184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which shows that apoptotic stress induces a transient increase and then a profound decrease in Nai+.Table IApoptosis induction causes NHE1-dependent intracellular alkalinization HRPT cells were preincubated with or without the NHE1 inhibitor EIPA (5 μm for 1 h at 37 °C) and then stimulated to undergo apoptosis with STS (1 μm at 37 °C) for the indicated times. Cytosolic pH was measured by BCECF fluorescence as an index of NHE1 activity. The results are the means from three experiments.TimepHiAfter STSAfter EIPA and STS0 min7.20 ± 0.027.23 ± 0.0230 min7.38 ± 0.04ap < 0.05 compared to pHi in EIPA- and STS-treated cells at the same time point by paired t test7.26 ± 0.0260 min7.31 ± 0.02ap < 0.05 compared to pHi in EIPA- and STS-treated cells at the same time point by paired t test7.23 ± 0.02120 min7.22 ± 0.027.20 ± 0.01240 min7.08 ± 0.03ap < 0.05 compared to pHi in EIPA- and STS-treated cells at the same time point by paired t test6.91 ± 0.01360 min6.99 ± 0.01ap < 0.05 compared to pHi in EIPA- and STS-treated cells at the same time point by paired t test6.84 ± 0.01a p < 0.05 compared to pHi in EIPA- and STS-treated cells at the same time point by paired t test Open table in a new tab To examine the specificity of NHE1 in cell survival, NHE-deficient PS120 cells were transiently transfected to express NHE1 or NHE3 and then assessed for sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Fig. 1 shows that NHE1 expression resulted in ∼50% decrease in apoptosis, consistent with our prior report (11Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wang L.M. Jarad G. Miller R.T. Konieczkowski M. Brown A.M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F829-F839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike NHE1, ectopic NHE3 expression did not rescue PS120 cells from apoptosis. These data are in agreement with observations that cell shrinkage stimulates NHE1 activity, whereas NHE3 activity is decreased (26Orlowski J. J. Biol.

NHE1 Rescues Cells from KCl Efflux-stimulated Apoptosis—Many apoptosis models predict irreversible commitment to cell death following AVD, which is characterized by intracellular K+ and Cl- loss, even in the presence of counter-regulatory NHE1 activity (7Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To address this issue, NHE-null PS120 cells, transfected with NHE1 cDNA, were incubated with NEM, a thiol compound that activates K+-Cl- co-transport (29Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), to induce K+ and Cl- efflux. Fig. 2A demonstrates that NEM caused apoptosis, with a threshold effect at ∼10 μm, a concentration that diminished Ki+ (not shown). Importantly, Fig. 2B shows that NHE1 expression significantly blunted NEM-mediated apoptosis, consistent with staurosporine data from Fig. 1. These studies demonstrate that NHE1 is important for cell survival, because activation was sufficient to block AVD, even under circumstances associated with robust K+ and Cl- efflux. NHE1 Stimulation Leads to ERM Activation—To explore the role of ERM proteins in the mechanism of NHE1-regulated cell survival, HRPT cells were pulsed with NH4Cl to stimulate cytosol acidification and immediate Na+/H+ exchange following NH4Cl washout (19Roos A.

Inactive, cytosolic ERM requires phosphorylation at conserved carboxyl-terminal Thr residues (ezrin, Thr567; radixin, Thr564; and moesin, Thr558) (33Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) to cause unfolding, translocation to the plasma membrane, and cross-linking between integral membrane proteins and cytoskeleton (34Takeda T. McQuistan T. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Lysates from NH4Cl-treated cells were assayed for the active ERM conformation by immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-ERM antibodies. Fig. 3A (upper panel) shows increased ERM protein phosphorylation within 5 min, which is sustained for 2 h. Enhanced phospho-ERM content was not due to increased ERM expression, as evidenced by equivalent ezrin expression at all time points (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Because NHE3 activity is also (a) associated with ERM binding (35Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (b) abundant in proximal tubule in vivo, and (c) activated by NH4Cl pulse, HRPT cells were screened for NHE3 expression by immunoblotting. These studies revealed undetectable HRPT cell NHE3 protein expression by immunoblot analysis (not shown), consistent with suppressed NHE3 expression in many proximal tubule cells lines. 2O. Moe, personal communication. Specificity of ERM regulation by NHE1 was further verified by hypertonic shrinkage, which activates NHE1 and inhibits NHE3 (26Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nath S.K. Hang C.Y. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. Am. J.

The addition of 100 mm sucrose to cell culture medium induced peak ERM phosphorylation at 15 min, which remained sustained at 60 min (Fig. 3B). Specificity of ERM phosphorylation following NHE1 activation was also assessed by comparing phospho-ERM content in NH4Cl-stimulated NHE-deficient PS120 fibroblasts versus PS120 cells transiently transfected to ectopically express NHE1. As expected, hypertonicity caused minimal ERM phosphorylation in PS120 cells (Fig. 3C, upper panel), whereas NHE1-transfected cells exhibited significantly greater basal and stimulated ERM phosphorylation, with a kinetic pattern similar to HRPT cells (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Furthermore, phospho-ERM content was significantly diminished in cells pretreated with 5 μm EIPA, suggesting that NHE1-dependent Na+/H+ exchange is linked to ERM activation. Collectively, the Fig. 3 data provide evidence that NHE1 activation stimulates ERM phosphorylation. NHE1 and ERM Directly Interact in the Cytoskeleton Fraction—To determine whether NHE1-regulated ERM phosphorylation leads to cytoskeleton-based, physical NHE1-ERM interaction, NHE1 was stimulated with either NH4Cl (Fig. 4A)or sucrose (Fig. 4B) and then co-precipitated with phospho-ERM from Nonidet P-40-insoluble cytoskeleton fractions. Fig. 4 shows NHE1 interaction with phosphorylated ERM in the cytoskeleton-enriched compartment. NHE1-phospho-ERM binding was time-dependent, with peak interaction at 15 min, which was sustained for at least 60 min. The data represent the first evidence of direct association between NHE1 and phospho-ERM proteins. NHE1-Ezrin Interaction Protects against Apoptosis—We have previously demonstrated that cells expressing a mutant NHE1 construct, with nonconserved Ala substitutions for membrane-proximal Lys and Arg residues (KR/A), which impairs binding to negatively charged proteins, such as ERM (12Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), were more susceptible to apoptosis (11Wu K.L.

To determine whether NHE1-dependent cell survival requires ERM interaction, LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected to express constitutively active and dominant negative ezrin were induced to undergo apoptosis by anisotonic shrinkage"

GPx-3 deficiency has been associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke. The regulation of GPx-3 expression remains largely uncharacterized, however, and we studied its transcriptional and translational determinants in a cultured cell system. In transient transfections of a renal cell line (Caki-2), the published sequence cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene produced minimal activity (relative luminescence (RL) = 0.6 ± 0.4). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to identify a novel transcription start site that is located 233 bp downstream (3′) of the published site and that produced a >25-fold increase in transcriptional activity (RL = 16.8 ± 1.9; p < 0.0001). Analysis of the novel GPx-3 promoter identified Sp-1- and hypoxia-inducible factor-1-binding sites, as well as the redox-sensitive metal response element and antioxidant response element. Hypoxia was identified as a strong transcriptional regulator of GPx-3 expression, in part through the presence of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1-binding site, leading to an almost 3-fold increase in expression levels after 24 h compared with normoxic conditions (normalized RL = 3.5 ± 0.3 versus 1.2 ± 0.1; p < 0.001). We also investigated the role of the translational cofactors tRNASec, SECIS-binding protein-2, and SelD (selenophosphate synthetase D) in GPx-3 protein expression. tRNASec and SelD significantly enhanced GPx-3 expression, whereas SECIS-binding protein-2 showed a trend toward increased expression. These results demonstrate the presence of a novel functional transcription start site for the human GPx-3 gene with a promoter regulated by hypoxia, and identify unique translational determinants of GPx-3 expression.

It is a glycosylated tetramer of 23-kDa subunits that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides at the expense of glutathione and is a major scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during normal metabolism or after oxidative insult (4Takebe G.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown an association between decreased levels of GPx-3 activity in plasma and familial childhood stroke (14Freedman J.E. Loscalzo J. Benoit S.E. Valeri C.R.

Avissar, and J. Loscalzo, unpublished data.; however, the mechanism for this down-regulation is unknown. The regulation of GPx-3 transcription and translation remains largely uncharacterized (16Flohe L. Wingender E. Brigelius-Flohe R. Forman H.J. Cadenas, E. Foreman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman & Hall, New York1997: 415-435Google Scholar, 17Flohe L. Andreesen J.R. Brigelius-Flohe R. Maiorino M. Ursini F.

Taniguchi Y. Arimori K. Kawabe N. Moriuchi T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), yet no basal activity has been detected with promoter constructs based upon this tsp (20Comhair S.A. Bhathena P.R.

Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Only one study to date has reported regulation of the promoter of the GPx-3 gene: Comhair et al. (20Comhair S.A. Bhathena P.R. Farver C. Thunnissen F.B. Erzurum S.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) showed that transfection of a reporter gene construct containing 3.2 kb of the GPx-3 promoter into epithelial lung cells (BET1A) results in increased expression levels in response to treatment with a combination of pyrogallol and GSH. In addition, GPx-3 synthesis has been shown to be regulated in part by selenium levels (22Nakane T. Asayama K. Kodera K. Hayashibe H. Uchida N. Nakazawa S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but whether this regulation occurs at the transcriptional or translational level remains to be determined. Thus, we sought to identify the determinants of GPx-3 expression by studying its transcriptional and translational regulation in vitro. Cell Culture—Media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. Complete medium refers to medium with FBS as described for each cell type. Except for human astrocytoma-derived cells (HTB13), cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Caki-2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, and 10% FBS. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 4.5 g/liter l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter pyridoxine HCl, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS. Human vascular endothelial cells (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) were maintained in EBM-2 medium (Clonetics Corp.), which consists of EBM endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with the EBM-bullet kit (final concentrations: 2% FBS, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract; Clonetics Corp.). HTB13 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C without CO2 supplementation in Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 10% FBS. Normoxic conditions corresponded to pO2 = 150 mm Hg. To induce hypoxic conditions (pO2 = 35 mm Hg), cells were placed in a modular incubation chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) and exposed to 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 30 min; the chamber was then sealed and returned to the incubator. Experiments with hypoxic cells were performed inside an inflatable glove bag purged with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 to maintain hypoxic conditions. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—Human kidney RACE-ready cDNA (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) was amplified using three GPx-3 gene-specific antisense primers, 5′-GAGGACGTATTTGCCAGCAT-3′ (located in exon 2), 5′-GAGACCCTTGCAGCCAAATC-3′ (located 152 bp downstream of the published tsp), and 5′-ACAGCGGTCTCCATTACAGC-3′ (located 24 bp upstream of the published tsp), in combination with the manufacturer's 5′-RACE sense primer, 5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′, which anneals to an adapter region ligated immediately 5′ to the cDNA end. PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume with 0.5 ng of cDNA, 0.4 μm sense and antisense primers, 0.2 mm dNTP, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 10× buffer components. The PCR product was excised from a 1% low melting point agarose gel, purified using a Wizard PCR prep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI), and ligated into a TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. GPx-3 Reporter Constructs—A reporter construct containing ∼1300 bp of the GPx-3 5′-region (positions –1237 to +35) was generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using the sense primer 5′-ATATGGTACCGTCAGAGAGATTTGAGACTGATTCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CCTAAAGCTTTGAGCCGCTGCCTGATCCC-3′, which contain a KpnI site and a HindIII site, respectively (underlined). This construct was designated the full-length construct (construct A). Four deletion constructs (constructs B–E) were generated with the same antisense primer described above and the sense primers shown in Table I, each of which included a KpnI site. The PCR mixtures contained ∼200 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 μm each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 1 unit of high fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) in a final volume of 25 μl. After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, PCR was carried out for 35 cycles, each composed of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension time of 7 min at 72 °C. All of the above fragments were constructed so that the 3′-end terminated downstream of the newly proposed tsp and upstream of the ATG site. To obtain an additional construct lacking the new tsp (construct F), the full-length fragment was digested at an XmaI site in the GPx-3 sequence, located at position –147. Each of the fragments was digested and cloned into the corresponding sites (KpnI and HindIII sites for constructs A–E and KpnI and XmaI sites for construct F) of the pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega) with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and transformed into competent HB101 cells (Promega). Plasmids were amplified using endotoxin-free maxiprep kits (EndoFree plasmid maxi kit, QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA).Table IPrimers used for amplification of inserts for GPx-3 deletion constructsConstructPrimerPositionLengthbpSense primers A5′-ATATGGTACCGTCAGAGAGATTTGAGACTGATTCC-3′-1237/+351272 B5′-ATATGGTACCGCCACAGATAGGCCAAGAAG-3′-834/+35869 C5′-ATATGGTACCCCACCTTCTCTGTCCCTACA-3′-543/+35578 D5′-ATATGGTACCCAATTTCCAGAAGACCATCG-3′-390/+35425 E5′-ATATGGTACCTCTCTGCCCAGATTTGCTTA-3′-180/+35215Antisense primer All5′-CCTAAAGCTTTGAGCCGCTGCCTGATCCC-3′ Open table in a new tab DNA Sequencing—All constructs and 5′-RACE products were sequenced following a fluorescence dideoxy chain termination method using an automated sequencer (Big Dyes Model ABI 377-96, Applied Biosystems). DNA sequencing was performed by the Molecular Genetics Core Laboratory at the Boston University School of Medicine. Transient Transfections of GPx-3 Reporter Constructs—Four different cell types were transfected with the GPx-3-luciferase constructs: Caki-2, human vascular endothelial, HTB13, and HEK293 cells. The transfection methods were optimized for each cell type. Caki-2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and the remaining cell types in 24-well plates and allowed to reach 70–90% confluence. For Caki-2 cells, 2 μg of luciferase construct, 20 ng of pRL-CMV (cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase construct, Promega), and 3 μl of Superfect (QIAGEN Inc.) were combined with serum-free medium for a total volume of 75 μl. This mixture was incubated for 10 min before adding 400 μl of prewarmed complete medium. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and the transfection mixture was added to the cells for 2 h at 37 °C. The transfection mixture was removed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with complete medium until cells were either treated with conditioned medium or harvested. For human vascular endothelial cells, 0.5 μg of luciferase construct, 0.133 μg of pRL-CMV, and 2.5 μl of Superfect were combined with serum-free medium for a total volume of 37.5 μl and incubated for 10 min. Complete medium (200 μl) was then added, and the transfection mixture was incubated with the previously washed cells. The transfection was stopped after 2 h by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and adding complete medium for 22 h. For HTB13 and HEK293 cells, a transfection mixture containing 0.105 μg of pRL-TK (thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase construct, Promega), 0.21 μg of luciferase construct, 2.1 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and 17 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) was incubated at room temperature for 15–45 min according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immediately prior to use, 170 μl of prewarmed (37 °C) Opti-MEM I was added to the mixture. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and the transfection mixture was incubated with the cells for 5 h at 37 °C. The transfection mixture was removed and replaced with complete medium for 22 h. Luciferase Assays—Cells were harvested by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline without calcium (Invitrogen) and then rocked in the presence of 100 μl (for 24-well plates) or 250 μl (for 12-well plates) of passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 1–2 h. All luciferase measurements (Dual-Reporter assay, Promega) were made using a Turner TD-20e luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase luminescence measurements were normalized to Renilla luciferase luminescence measurements prior to any additional comparison or analysis. Generation of GPx-3 cDNA—GPx-3 cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR on RNA purified from Caki-2 cells by standard methods using 5′-AGGGATCAGGCAGCGGCTCAG-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-CTGCAGAAAGGCTTTTACTGGGCAGA-3′ as the antisense primer. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1-min denaturing at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 65 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C, lengthened by 15 s every cycle. The final product was gel-purified, directly cloned into a pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, transferred to a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and resequenced. From this vector, the cDNA was digested with HindIII and NotI and ligated into the same sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). GPx-3 Protein Expression—HEK293 cells were plated in either 100-mm dishes or 6-well plates and grown until 60–70% confluent prior to treatment. Experimental conditions are described for 100-mm dishes. Selenium incorporation was performed after overnight recovery from transfection using published procedures (23Low S.C. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The transfection medium included 75 μl LipofectAMINE with the GPx-3 plasmid (12.5 μg). When noted, cofactors were present at 2.5 μg. The cells were transfected for 8 h (7.2-ml total volume), after which the transfection medium was replaced with complete medium for 16 h. The cells were then incubated with 5 ml of serum-free medium containing 15 μCi of 75Se (3 μCi/ml; University of Missouri Reactor) and 100 nm sodium selenite for an additional 24 h. The harvested medium was combined with lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and reducing agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were denatured and electrophoresed through NuPAGE® BisTris gels (12%, pH 6.4) in the presence of MOPS buffer (NuPAGE® system, Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Constructs for SelD (selenophosphate synthetase D) (GenBank™/EBI accession number U34044), selenocysteine-specific tRNASec from Xenopus laevis (accession number M34507), and SECIS-binding protein-2 (SBP2) (accession number NM_024002) were kind gifts from Drs. Marla Berry, Dolph Hatfield, and Paul Copeland, respectively. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaStat Version 3.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Comparison between two groups was performed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Multiple groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc analysis with the Student-Newman-Keuls test for pairwise comparison. All values are given as means ± S.E. 5′-RACE—Previously published chromosomal alignment and primer extension studies have suggested that the tsp of the GPx-3 gene is located 298 bp upstream of its translation start site (6Yoshimura S. Suemizu H. Taniguchi Y. Arimori K. Kawabe N. Moriuchi T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Preliminary work with this start site showed little promoter activity in a luciferase-based reporter construct in Caki-2 cells, a cell line derived from renal proximal tubules, and prompted the use of a RACE procedure to identify potential alternative start sites in these cells. We used human kidney RACE-ready cDNA with an adapter sequence ligated to its 5′-end. A sense primer specifically designed against the adapter sequence was used in combination with three different antisense primers specific to GPx-3: upstream of the published tsp, in exon 1 relative to the published tsp, and in exon 2. The only combination of primers that resulted in a reproducible RACE product was that with the antisense primer based in exon 2 (Fig. 1). Sequencing of this product confirmed that it aligns with the published GPx-3 cDNA sequence and showed that it contains 64 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence. This result suggested the location of a novel tsp (Fig. 2) 233 bp downstream of the tsp published previously by Yoshimura et al. (6Yoshimura S. Suemizu H. Taniguchi Y. Arimori K. Kawabe N. Moriuchi T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Plasma glutathione peroxidase promoter sequence.

Our sequence (accession number AY552097) is 100% homologous to that reported most recently by Rieder et al. (accession number AY310878) (24Rieder M.J. Livingston R.J. Daniels M.R. Chung M.W. Miyamoto K.E. Nguyen C.P. Nguyen D.A. Poel C.L. Robertson P.D. Schackwitz W.S. Sherwood J.K. Witrak L.A. Nickerson D.A. NIEHS-SNPs, Environmental Genome Project, NIEHS ES15478. Department of Genome Sciences, Seattle, WA2003Google Scholar). We analyzed the sequence located between the published tsp and our newly identified downstream tsp for conserved sequence motifs and potential transcription factor-binding sites by identifying consensus sequences (with the Web-based program MatInspector (25Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar) and with MacVector Version 7 (Accelyrs, San Diego, CA)). We found a classical CCAAT box in reverse orientation at positions –77 to –81, but no TATTA box. In addition, we identified a metal response element (MRE) from positions –73 to –79, a GC-rich region from positions –104 to –109 corresponding to an Sp-1 site, an antioxidant response element (ARE) from positions –148 to –158, and a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-binding site from positions –203 to –209. The positions of these newly described elements are shown in Fig. 2. Promoter Function—Caki-2 cells have previously been shown to express GPx-3 in greater quantities compared with cell lines from other source organs (21Avissar N. Kerl E.A. Baker S.S. Cohen H.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test whether the newly identified promoter sequence could drive basal expression, luciferase constructs containing varying lengths of the GPx-3 promoter were transfected into Caki-2 cells. Experiments were run in triplicate and performed a minimum of three times. Expression levels measured after 24 h as the ratio of firefly-to-Renilla luciferase luminescence are shown in Fig. 3. All constructs that included the newly identified tsp (constructs A–E) resulted in ∼25-fold higher activity compared with the construct based on the published tsp alone (construct F) (p < 0.0001). Expression levels were similar for constructs A–E, suggesting that elements critical for promoter function lie within the 180 bp immediately upstream of the newly proposed tsp. To determine whether this new tsp functions in other cell types, we transfected three additional cell types: HEK293 cells (another kidney-derived cell line), human vascular endothelial cells (because of their contact with plasma), and HTB13 cells (as selenoproteins are reported to be most stable in the brain) (18Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). To account for differences in transfection efficiency among cell types, the average ratio of firefly-to-Renilla luciferase luminescence was normalized to the average ratio produced by the pGL3 enhancer vector. As observed in the Caki-2 cells, the constructs containing the new downstream start site produced activity that was significantly higher than that of the construct lacking the new start site. The relative level of expression of all GPx-3 constructs in Caki-2 cells was, however, ∼10-fold higher than that in the other cell types (data not shown); for this reason, all subsequent experiments were performed in Caki-2 cells. Treatment with Oxidants—Comhair et al. (20Comhair S.A. Bhathena P.R. Farver C. Thunnissen F.B. Erzurum S.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reported an increase in GPx-3 promoter activity and in GPx-3 mRNA expression in BET1A cells (a human bronchial epithelial cell line that expresses GPx-3) in response to a combination of 100 μm pyrogallol (a superoxide generator) and 10 mm GSH. Aside from this study, no other work has provided evidence for transcriptional regulation of the GPx-3 gene. There is evidence, however, that GPx-1, the cellular isoform of GPx, is regulated by oxidant stress; and thus, we postulated that GPx-3 might have similar transcriptional determinants. We treated Caki-2 cells transfected with the full-length construct A with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide (relative luminescence (RL) = 13.2 ± 2.1), 100 μmtert-butyl hydroperoxide (RL = 16.3 ± 0.6), or 100 μm pyrogallol (RL = 18.7 ± 1.9) for 2 h and found no significant change in expression levels compared with untreated cells (RL = 15.8 ± 1.7). In addition, we were unable to reproduce the significant stimulation of promoter activity with GSH and pyrogallol described by Comhair et al. (20Comhair S.A. Bhathena P.R. Farver C. Thunnissen F.B. Erzurum S.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) using this new promoter in Caki-2 cells (data not shown). Modulation by Hypoxia—As hypoxia has been shown to induce antioxidant enzyme expression and as the proposed new promoter sequence contains an HIF-1-binding site, we exposed Caki-2 cells transfected with the full-length promoter construct A to hypoxic conditions for 6-h intervals up to 24 h. Values were normalized to the expression levels of the full-length construct A in normoxia at 6"
https://openalex.org/W2019468853,"Considerable knowledge has been gained from temporal analyses of molecular events culminating in gene activation1, but technical hurdles have hindered comparable studies of gene silencing. Here we describe the temporal assembly of silent chromatin at the mouse terminal transferase gene (Dntt), which is silenced and repositioned to pericentromeric heterochromatin during thymocyte maturation2. Silencing was nucleated at the Dntt promoter by the ordered deacetylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3-Lys9), loss of methylation at H3-Lys4 and acquisition of methylation at H3-Lys9, followed by bidirectional spreading of each event. Deacetylation at H3-Lys9 coincided with pericentromeric repositioning, and neither of these early events required de novo protein synthesis. CpG methylation increased primarily in mature T cells that had left the thymus. A transformed thymocyte line supported reversible inactivation of Dntt without repositioning. In these cells, histone modification changes were nucleated at the promoter but did not spread. These results provide a foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of silent chromatin assembly during development."

Here, we investigated the impact of the recruitment into virus particles of the nuclear form of uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2), a cellular DNA repair enzyme, on the virus mutation rate and on replication in macrophages. We demonstrate that the interaction of Vpr with UNG2 led to virion incorporation of a catalytically active enzyme that is directly involved with Vpr in modulating the virus mutation rate. The lack of UNG in virions during virus replication in primary monocyte-derived macrophages further exacerbated virus mutant frequencies to an 18-fold increase compared with the 4-fold increase measured in actively dividing cells. Because the presence of UNG is also critical for efficient infection of macrophages, these observations extend the role of Vpr to another early step of the virus life cycle, e.g. viral DNA synthesis, that is essential for replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in nondividing cells.

Vpr is a 96-amino acid non-structural protein that is associated with virus particles and can accumulate at the nuclear envelope and in the nucleus of infected cells (1Cohen E.A. Dehni G.

The incorporation of Vpr into particles requires a direct interaction with the p6 region of the Gag polyprotein precursor (5Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X.

First, expression of Vpr alters the cell cycle progression by arresting cells in the G2 phase (7He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 8Heinzinger N.K. Bukinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M.

Second, Vpr influences the reverse transcription process of the viral DNA, and this can modulate the in vivo mutation rate of HIV-1 (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Mansky L.M. Le Rouzic E. Benichou S. Gajary L.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, Vpr is required for the infection of nondividing cells, and this requirement is related, at least in part, to its role in the nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex (PIC) containing the viral DNA. Vpr possesses an affinity for the components of the nuclear pore complex, and it has been proposed that Vpr may facilitate the nuclear translocation of the PIC across the nuclear envelope (4Le Rouzic E.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Infection of nondividing, terminally differentiated macrophages and resting T cells represents a viral reservoir in the host that is crucial for subsequent virus spread to lymphoid organs and T-helper lymphocytes and finally for AIDS pathogenesis (17Cohen O.J. Fauci A.S. Adv. Intern. Med. 2001; 46: 207-246PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 Vpr protein has been found to interact with several cellular partners, including the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) (18Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a DNA-repair enzyme involved in the base excision repair pathway that specifically removes the RNA base uracil from DNA. Uracil can occur in DNA either by misincorporation of dUTP or by cytosine deamination (19Chen R. Wang H. Mansky L.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2339-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two distinct forms of UNG are generated by alternative splicing and localize in mitochondria (UNG1) and in the nucleus (UNG2). Initially identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen using Vpr as bait (18Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the interaction between Vpr and UNG was confirmed both in vitro and ex vivo in Vpr-expressing cells (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Trp residue in position 54 located in the exposed loop connecting the second and the third α-helix of HIV-1 Vpr has been shown critical to maintain the interaction with UNG, the Vpr-binding site was mapped within the common C-terminal part of UNG2 (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of the peptide phage display or yeast twohybrid systems revealed that peptides able to bound Vpr had a common WXXF motif (20BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8009-8016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Yao X.J. Lemay J. Rougeau N. Clement M. Kurtz S. Belhumeur P. Cohen E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48816-48826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, UNG proteins contain such a motif in their C-terminal region, which may be necessary for the interaction with Vpr (20BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8009-8016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Vpr has been found to specifically recruit the nuclear form of UNG into HIV-1 virions (UNG2, commonly named UNG in this report) (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although the viral integrase may also participate in this recruitment (22Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the Vpr-dependent packaging of UNG2 into virions strikingly correlated with the ability of Vpr to influence the mutation rate of HIV-1 (24Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This indicated that the interaction between Vpr and UNG2 may directly influence the reverse transcription accuracy and, thus, play a role in the modulation of the in vivo mutation rate of HIV-1 (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Mansky L.M. Le Rouzic E. Benichou S. Gajary L.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this report, we further investigated the specific contribution of UNG2 incorporated into HIV-1 particles in the early phase of the virus life cycle. To address this question, we developed an experimental system in which UNG2 was incorporated into virus particles independently of Vpr by expressing UNG2 as a chimeric protein fused to the C-terminal extremity of the VprW54R mutant, a Vpr variant that fails to recruit UNG2 into virions and to influence the virus mutation rate even though it is incorporated as efficiently as the wild type Vpr protein (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The VprW54R-UNG fusion was efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 virions and restored a mutation rate equivalent to that observed with wild type Vpr. Because we showed that VprW54R variant specifically influenced HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages, these results support the conclusions that the Vpr-dependent recruitment of UNG2 into virions is directly involved in the modulation of the HIV-1 mutation rate and is required for efficient virus replication in non-dividing cells such as macrophages. Retroviral Vectors and Expression Plasmids—Most of the retroviral vectors and yeast and mammalian expression plasmids used in this study have been described previously (5Selig L. Pages J.C.

The 231WXXF234 motif found within the nuclear UNG2 form (numbering according to Haug et al. (25Haug T. Skorpen F. Lund H. Krokan H.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) was mutated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using specific primers containing the desired mutations to obtain the UNGW231A/F234G-mutated form. The PCR product was then cloned back into the EcoRI-XhoI restriction sites of pGadGE (5Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the pGEX-4T1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain plasmids for expression of UNGW231A/F234G fused either to the Gal4 activation domain or to the GST in yeast and in bacteria, respectively. To construct the plasmids for expression of the Vpr-UNG and VprW54R-UNG fusions, the Vpr- and VprW54R-coding sequences were, respectively, amplified by PCR using a specific set of primers to delete the stop codon, and the PCR products were cloned back into the BamHI-HindIII restrictions sites of the pAS1B plasmid (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The UNG-coding sequence was then amplified by PCR to create a HindIII site at the 5′ end, and the products were inserted in-frame into the HindIII-XhoI sites of either the pAS1B-Vpr- or the pAS1B-VprW54R-digested plasmids. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The HF7c yeast reporter strain containing the Gal4-inducible gene, HIS3, was cotransformed with vectors for expression of the indicated Gal4 DNA binding domain and Gal4 activation domain hybrids and plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine as reported (5Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double transformants were patched on the same medium and replica-plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine for auxotrophy analysis. In Vitro Binding Assay—The GST-UNG fusions were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Invitrogen) after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and an antiprotease mixture (Sigma). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C with 0.12% lysozyme, bacterial lysis was completed by adding 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml RNase A, and 20 μg/ml DNase I. Lysates were centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with 1 m NaCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and then with phosphate-buffered saline. The concentration of the fusion proteins was estimated on a SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad) and determined relative to a range of bovine serum albumin standard. Cell lysates from 6 × 106 HeLa cells expressing HA-Vpr (WT or W54R) were prepared and incubated with purified GST or GST-UNG proteins as previously described (4Le Rouzic E. Mousnier A. Rustum C.

Bound proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting as described (4Le Rouzic E. Mousnier A. Rustum C. Stutz F. Hallberg E. Dargemont C. Benichou S. J. Biol.

Assay for Incorporation of Vpr-UNG Fusions into HIV-1 Particles—Incorporation of the Vpr-UNG fusions into HIV-1 virions was analyzed as previously described (5Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a virion packaging assay in which HA-tagged fusions were expressed in trans in virus-producing cells. UNG Catalytic Assay—A catalytic assay was developed to detect the incorporation of UNG into virus particles. Briefly, we cotransfected (Superfect, Qiagen) a vpr-defective HIV-1 vector and Vpr and UNG expression plasmids derived from pAS1B (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) into 293T cells. After 48 h, cell culture supernatants were collected, and virions were concentrated by ultracentrifugation as previously described (5Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virions were resuspended as described (5Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 μg of crude viral protein was used in the UNG assay. The DNA oligonucleotide 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTUTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ used for the UNG assay was chosen based on previous studies (26Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3737-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was obtained from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Assays of UNG activity were done with the single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide substrate and were performed in UNG reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. Apurinic sites were cleaved by adding ½ volume of 0.5 m NaOH and ½ volume of 30 mm EDTA and then boiling for 30 min (27Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Samples were then applied to a nondenaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel with electrophoresis at 60 V for 3.5 h or were applied to a denaturing 19% polyacrylamide gel run at 400 V for 2 h. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and nucleic acids were visualized with an ultraviolet transilluminator. Analysis of HIV-1 Mutant Frequencies—The HIV-1 vectors used in these studies have been previously described (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Mansky L.M. Le Rouzic E. Benichou S. Gajary L.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Mansky L.M. Virology. 2003; 307: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To produce vector virus, the HIV vectors were complemented in trans with pSV-gagpol-rre-MPMV, the amphotropic murine leukemia virus env expression plasmid, pSV-A-MLV-env, and a Vpr expression plasmid derived from pAS1B (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). HIV-1 vector and expression plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells by using Superfect (Qiagen). Infection of HeLa target cells was also done by cocultivation of virus-producing cells with target cells (29Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protocols for analysis of mutant frequencies have been previously described with minor modifications (12Mansky L.M. Le Rouzic E. Benichou S. Gajary L.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Mansky L.M. Virology. 2003; 307: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes-derived macrophages (MDMs) were not placed under drug selection, and after purification of proviral DNA with the lac repressor protein, the vector cassette containing the mutation target was PCR amplified before analysis of mutant frequencies in E. coli. Isolation and Infection of PBMCs and MDMs—PBMCs from HIV-1 seronegative donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cells were plated in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum containing 10 units/ml interleukin-2 and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from fresh PBMCs by adherence to plastic at 37 °C. After overnight culture the adherent cells were removed from plates by gentle scraping, and residual T-lymphocytes were further depleted using anti-CD2 immunomagnetic beads. Cells were cultured in medium without added growth factors. Mature macrophages were derived by culturing the purified monocytes 7–14 days in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum without additional cytokines. Cells typically became enlarged or spindle shaped with extended processes. Virus infection of primary cells was done using virus produced from 293T cells transfected (Superfect, Qiagen) with T-cell tropic or macrophage-tropic HIV-1 molecular clones expressing either WT or mutant Vpr. CAp24 equivalent amounts of virus produced from infected cells was used for infection of primary cells and corresponded to a multiplicity of infection of about 0.05. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice and placed in either RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum (macrophages, resting T-cells) or medium supplemented with 10 units/ml interleukin-2 (stimulated PBMCs/stimulated T-cells). Sampling of cell culture supernatants was done immediately after washing (day 0) and on subsequent time points. Amounts of CAp24 produced were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Characterization of the Determinants Involved in the Interaction between Vpr and UNG2—Previous studies have established a correlation between the property of Vpr to interact with UNG and to influence the HIV-1 mutation rate (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In particular, a VprW54R variant (see Fig. 1B) that failed to bind UNG in a yeast two-hybrid assay also failed to recruit UNG into HIV-1 virions and was not able to complement a vpr null mutant HIV-1 in a mutation rate assay (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further characterize the respective molecular determinants of Vpr and UNG involved in the interaction, we developed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant UNG expressed in E. coli in fusion with the glutathione S-transferase (GST-UNG). Because it has been reported that Vpr binding is related to the presence of a WXXF motif found within the C-terminal part of UNG2 (amino acids 231–234), a GST-UNGW231A/F234G mutant was included as a control of specificity in this in vitro binding assay. Purified recombinant GST-UNG and GST-UNGW231A/F234G fusions were immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads and then incubated with lysates from cells expressing either HA-tagged WT Vpr or VprW54R. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA (Fig. 1A). HA-Vpr specifically bound to GST-UNG but not to GST alone. In contrast, VprW54R was not retained on GST-UNG, and neither WT Vpr nor VprW54R bound to GST-UNGW231A/F234G. These results were in complete agreement with the yeast two-hybrid data reported in Fig. 1, B and C. Only WT UNG, but not UNGW231A/F234G, fused to Gal4 activation domain interacted with Vpr fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain, as indicated by growth of the HF7c yeast reporter strain on medium without histidine. As expected, the VprW54R variant failed to interact with UNG in the two-hybrid assay. Together, these observations provide further data in support that the Trp in position 54 of Vpr is critical to maintain the interaction with UNG and that the 231WXXF234 motif of UNG2 is involved in binding to Vpr. UNG-associated Enzymatic Activity Is Recovered from HIV-1 Particles—To determine whether the UNG incorporated into virions was catalytically active, we developed a simple assay for UNG activity using a 25-base T homopolymer oligonucleotide substrate containing a single uracil residue located at position 12 (see Fig. 2A). In the presence of UNG activity, the uracil residue is excised and leaves the phosphodiester backbone. Heating the sample can destroy the backbone at that position, resulting in a 12-base product that can be visualized on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. UNG activity from purified HIV-1 virions was, thus, determined by transiently transfecting 293T cells with an HIV-1 vector with either Vpr or VprW54R in combination with UNG expression plasmids. HIV-1 virions were collected 48 h later, concentrated, and used in the UNG activity assay (Fig. 2A). Expression of Vpr in virus-producing cells led to UNG enzymatic activity from purified virions. This indicates that the fully active endogenous UNG was incorporated into HIV-1 virus particles, but expression of Vpr in combination with a HA-tagged UNG form led to the detection of a higher level of UNG activity into virions. In contrast, expression in virus-producing cells of the VprW54R mutant alone or in combination with UNG was not associated with the detection of enzymatic activity from virions. Similarly, very low levels of UNG activity were detected from virions produced from cells co-expressing Vpr and a mutated UNGW231A/F234G form that does not interact with Vpr (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2B, no activity was detected when the assays were performed in the presence of a specific inhibitor of UNG (uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor) in the reaction mixtures (31Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Sanderson R.J. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Krokan H.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the activity detected into virions is related to a specific recruitment of UNG. These results show that Vpr-mediated recruitment of UNG results in the presence of catalytically active enzyme into HIV-1 virions. Incorporation of Vpr-UNG Fusion Proteins into HIV-1 Particles—To gain further insight on the functional role of the recruitment of UNG into HIV-1 virions, we took advantage of the VprW54R mutant to specifically incorporate UNG without requiring the interaction with Vpr by expressing UNG as a fusion to the C-terminus of VprW54R. We previously reported that this Vpr mutant failed to recruit UNG2 into virions even though it is efficiently incorporated into virions (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The virion incorporation of the VprW54R-UNG fusion was first analyzed using a packaging assay in which the fusion was expressed in trans in virus-producing cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with the HIV-1 vector lacking the vpr gene in combination with the VprW54R-UNG expression plasmid. Cell- and virion-associated Vpr-UNG fusions were then assayed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). The VprW54R-UNG fusion as well as the wild type Vpr-UNG fusion used as a control were well expressed in virus-producing cells (upper panels), and both fusions were detected from virions purified from the supernatant of transfected cells (lower panels). Using the same enzymatic assay as described above (see Fig. 2A), we checked that the VprW54R-UNG and Vpr-UNG fusions incorporated into virions were catalytically active (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the Vpr-UNG fusion proteins are efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 particles and retain UNG enzymatic activity. The Vpr-UNG Fusion Proteins Can Influence the HIV-1 Mutant Frequency—The VprW54R-UNG fusion, therefore, represents a valuable tool for analyzing the direct contribution of UNG to the modulation of the virus mutation rate. We, thus, used an HIV-1 mutation rate assay to determine whether the Vpr-UNG fusions could complement a vpr-defective HIV-1 for mutant frequencies (11Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmids for expression of Vpr-UNG fusions were transiently cotransfected with helper packaging plasmids into cells containing a single integrated HIV-1 vector provirus containing the lacZ gene as a mutation target. The viruses produced were then used to infect permissive cells, which allowed for a determination of the virus mutant frequency per round of replication (Fig. 4). In contrast to the 4-fold increase in mutant frequency observed by trans-complementation with the VprW54R mutant, the wild type fusion but also the VprW54R-UNG fusion gave rise to virus mutant frequencies equivalent to that observed by complementation with the wild type Vpr protein. These data show that the VprW54R-UNG fusion can rescue the defective phenotype of VprW54R and modulate HIV-1 mutant frequency as efficiently as Vpr, demonstrating that the recruitment of UNG into virions is directly responsible for this Vpr function. Recruitment of UNG into Virions Is Essential for Efficient Replication of HIV-1 in Macrophages—Because data presented here as well as a previ"

Selective activations under the HS condition were found in several regions including the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus (PITG) and the parieto-occipital cortex (PO), as compared with activations under a condition for familiar letters and speech sounds, and with those under the HN condition. The left PITG showed a selective activation increase under the HS condition over two days, the degree of which predicted individual performance improvement. Further, functional connectivity between the left PITG and the left PO was selectively enhanced under the HS condition. These results demonstrate that a new link between orthography and phonology is formed by the plasticity of a functional system involving the left PITG in association with the left PO."
https://openalex.org/W1995177392,"Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a rate-limiting step in protein synthesis. It is a complicated process that involves many eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Altering the expression level or the function of eIFs may influence the synthesis of some proteins and consequently cause abnormal cell growth and malignant transformation. P170, the largest putative subunit of eIF3, has been found elevated in human breast, cervical, esophageal, and lung cancers, suggesting that p170 may have a potential role in malignant transformation and/or cell growth control. Our recent studies suggested that p170 is likely a translational regulator and it may mediate the effect of mimosine on the translation of a subset mRNAs. Mimosine, a plant nonprotein amino acid, inhibits mammalian DNA synthesis, an essential event of cell growth. The rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis is the conversion of the ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides catalysed by ribonucleotide reductase of which the activity is regulated by the level of its M2 subunit. It has been reported that inhibiting the activity of M2 also inhibits cell growth. To understand the relationship between protein and DNA synthesis and between p170 and cell growth control, we investigated in this study whether p170 regulates the synthesis of M2 and, thus, cell growth. We found that altering the expression level of p170 changes the synthesis rate of both M2 and DNA. Decreasing p170 expression in human lung cancer cell line H1299 and breast cancer cell line MCF7 significantly reversed their malignant growth phenotype. However, the overall [35S]methionine incorporation following dramatic decrease in p170 expression was only ∼25% less than the control cells. These observations, together with our previous findings, suggest that p170 may regulate the translation of a subset mRNAs and its elevated expression level may be important for cancer cell growth and for maintaining their malignant phenotype."

Because of the chemical reactivity of ozone, it likely reacts with target molecules in pulmonary surfactant, a lipid-rich material that lines the epithelial cells in the airways. Phospholipids containing unsaturated fatty acyl groups and cholesterol would be susceptible to attack by ozone, which may lead to the formation of cytotoxic products. Whereas free radicalderived oxidized cholesterol products have been frequently studied for their cytotoxic effects, ozonized cholesterol products have not been studied, although they could reasonably play a role in the toxicity of ozone. The reaction of ozone with cholesterol yielded a complex series of products including 3β-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al, 5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestan-3β,7a-diol, and 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol. Mass spectrometry and radioactive monitoring were used to identify the major cholesterol-derived product during the reaction of 2 ppm ozone in surfactant as 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, which is only a minor product during ozonolysis of cholesterol in solution. A dose-dependent formation of 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol was also seen during direct exposure of intact cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE) to ozone. Studies of the metabolism of this epoxide in lung epithelial cells yielded small amounts of the expected metabolite, cholestan-3β,5α,6β-triol, and more abundant levels of an unexpected metabolite, cholestan-6-oxo-3β,5α-diol. Both 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol and cholestan-6-oxo-3β,5α-diol were shown to be cytotoxic to cultured 16-HBE cells.

A possible mechanism for cytotoxicity is the ability of these oxysterols to inhibit isoprenoid-based cholesterol biosynthesis in these cells. Human exposure to 0.2 ppm levels of ozone in ambient air has been shown to cause numerous pulmonary effects such as increased airway inflammation and decreased pulmonary function (1Aris R.M.

Studies of ozone in animals using up to 3 ppm ozone have been shown to cause increased airway hyperresponsiveness and epithelial cell death. It has been hypothesized that the very high chemical reactivity of ozone limits the distribution of this gas in the pulmonary system, preventing direct exposure to the cellular components of the lung. In part ozone may react with the various components of the epithelial cell lining fluid in the lung, also known as pulmonary surfactant, which includes proteins, lipids, and single electron antioxidant agents such as ascorbic acid (3Uppu R.M.

Because of the very high reactivity of ozone with lipids containing double bonds, considerable emphasis has been placed on the reaction of ozone with lipid compounds in the lungs and the possibility that the adverse effects of ozone are mediated by lipid-ozonized products (6Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Friedman M. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 934-941Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Evidence in support of this theory has been accumulating with the identification of biologically active phospholipids (7Kafoury R.M. Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Salgo M.G. Zou X. Friedman M. Am. J.

However, a relatively nonpolar component was also found to elute from this normal phase HPLC separation that was also cytotoxic, and preliminary data suggested that several oxidized neutral lipid products were present in this fraction. Cholesterol is the most abundant neutral lipid present in pulmonary surfactant, and this molecule has a double bond that would be susceptible to attack by ozone (3Uppu R.M. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L.

Although there has been some controversy about the exact chemical structure of the major ozonolysis product when cholesterol is ozonized in solution at high ozone concentrations (>0.1%) (11Gumulka J.

In fact, this reduced product has been detected in lung homogenate and broncheoalveolar lavage fluid of rats exposed to ozone, and it has thus been suggested as a biomarker for ozone exposure (16Pryor W.A. Wang K. Bermudez E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 613-618Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recent observation of 5,6-seco-sterol in arterial plaques has provided evidence that the formation of ozone may also occur as the result of normal biochemical events taking place in vivo during an inflammatory response (17Wentworth Jr., P. Nieva J. Takeuchi C. Galve R. Wentworth A.D. Dilley R.B. DeLaria G.A. Saven A. Babior B.M. Janda K.D. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is important to consider that the interaction between ozone and cholesterol has primarily been studied in organic solvents with high levels of ozone, where 5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestane-3β,7a-diol is the major product (11Gumulka J.

However, environmentally relevant concentrations of ozone acting on lipid cellular membranes or in lipid-rich pulmonary surfactant could involve different chemistry, because of the ordered nature of the lipid bilayer, yielding alternative products. Isolated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was exposed in vitro to precise levels of ozone in a carefully controlled ozone chamber to study the formation of cholesterol-derived ozonolysis products. This revealed the formation of 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol (β-epoxide) (Scheme 1) as a more abundant product than 5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestan-3β,7a-diol in this system. The ability of this compound and its cellular metabolites to cause cytotoxicity and to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells was subsequently studied. Materials—Cholesterol (>99%) was purchased from Sigma. Radioactive [4-14C]cholesterol (45–60 mCi/mmol dissolved in ethanol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Radioactive [1-14C]acetate (56.6 mCi/mmol dissolved in ethanol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Stable isotope labeled 2,2,3,4,4,6-d6-cholesterol (98% atom %, excess d6) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Solvents, cell culture media, and culture plates were purchased from Fisher. Bis(trimethylsilyl)fluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trypan blue dye (0.4%) were purchase from Sigma. Bis(trimethyl-d9-silyl)acetamide (99%) was purchased from Isotech (Miamisburg, OH). Rat lung lavage fluid was provided by Dennis Voelker (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO). Identification of Cholesterol Ozonolysis Products in Lung Surfactant—Bronchoalevolar lavage fluid from rats was concentrated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h in 5 mm CaCl2 (18Suwabe A. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to a final cholesterol concentration of 30 μg/ml cholesterol. For identification of cholesterol metabolites, 2.5 μl of tracer [14C]cholesterol was added to 1 ml of the lavage fluid for a final concentration of 200 nCi/ml (0.2% ethanol). Experiments were carried out in triplicate by ozonolysis of 100 μl of this labeled lavage fluid in 35-mm diameter tissue culture multiwell plates. The plates were exposed to various concentrations of ozone using a computer-controlled in vitro ozone exposure chamber. This system was capable of delivering precise concentrations of ozone from 0.1 to 10 ppm in humidified air, as described previously (8Uhlson C. Harrison K. Allen C.B. Ahmad S. White C.W. Murphy R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After ozonolysis, the samples in each well were diluted with 2 ml of water, transferred to glass tubes, and wells were washed with 2 ml of methanol. To the transferred samples, 3 ml of methylene chloride was added and lipids extracted essentially as described by Bligh and Dyer (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). After drying the extract with a stream of dry nitrogen, the products were dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol and then injected onto a C18 (250 × 4.6 mm) reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Solvent A was methanol/water/acetonitrile (v/v/v, 60:20:20) with 1 mm ammonium acetate; solvent B was methanol with 1 mm ammonium acetate. The gradient ran from 50 to 100% solvent B in 20 min and stayed at 100% solvent B for 20 min. Radioactive monitoring coupled with mass spectrometry was used to detect the products of cholesterol ozonolysis as described previously (15Pulfer M.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Epoxycholesterol, Cholesterol, and Phospholipids—Both the α and β isomers of 5,6-epoxycholesterol were synthesized based on the method of Sevanian et al. (20Sevanian A. Berliner J. Peterson H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 19.1 mg of chloroperoxybenzoic acid was added to 38.6 mg of cholesterol in 12 ml of methylene chloride and stirred overnight at 4 °C. Deuterated [2,2,3,4,4,6-2H6]cholesterol was used for synthesis of deuterated 5,6-epoxycholesterol. The solution was washed three times with water and then with a saturated salt solution. Finally, the solvent was evaporated using a roto-evaporator, and the product was resuspended in ethanol. Separation of the α and β isomers was achieved using RP-HPLC on an Alltech column (250 × 10.0 mm, C18; Deerfield, IL) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min with the gradient described above. Fractions were collected (1 min) and dried under vacuum; after weighing, the fractions were derivatized with BSTFA and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to determine purity of the reference standards (>95%). Quantitation of both cholesterol and β-epoxide was carried out using stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Deuterated β-epoxide (40 ng in 25 μl) was added to each point of the standard curve and to all samples before extraction with iso-octane. An identical protocol was used to determine total cholesterol. Samples (10% aliquot) were introduced onto the mass spectrometer using a 150 × 1.0-mm Columbus C18 column (Phenomenex, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA). The solvent system used was the same as for identification of cholesterol ozonolysis products, except a modified gradient was used, with 75–100% solvent B for 10 min followed by 100% solvent B for 20 min. Multiple reaction monitoring analysis was carried out on a Sciex API-2000 mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Positive ion mode was used with an ion spray voltage of 4500 V, declustering potential of 40 V, focusing potential 350 V, and collision energy of 12 V. Nitrogen was used in the collision cell with a collision gas thickness of 2.17 × 1015 mol/cm2. The transitions monitored were m/z 420 → 385 for α-epoxide and β-epoxide, m/z 426 → 391 for d6-β-epoxide, m/z 404 → 369 for cholesterol, m/z 436 → 383 for 5,6-seco-sterol and 6-oxo-3,5-diol, and m/z 438 → 385 for 3,5,6-triol. The dwell time for each transition was 800 ms. The standard curve was linear for the range tested, from 0.625 to 320 ng of 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol and from 100 ng to 6.4 μg of cholesterol. Quantitation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerophosphocholine (16:0a/18:1-GPCho) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(9′-oxo-nonanoyl)-glycerophosphocholine (16:0a/9al-GPCho) in 75-μl aliquots of rat BAL exposed to 0.2 ppm ozone was achieved by addition of 20 ng of d3-platelet activating factor and 320 ng d6-dipalmitoyl-glycerophosphocholine (d6-16:0a/16:0-GP-Cho) at the same time as the cholesterol and β-epoxide internal standards. After neutral lipid extraction of the samples with iso-octane (see below), 2 ml of methylene chloride was added to the remaining H2O/MeOH layer to extract the phospholipids. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen and solvated in 500 μl of normal phase solvent A (hexane/isopropyl alcohol/H2O, 30:40, v/v) for injection onto a 150 × 1.0-mm Prodigy silica column (Phenomenex; Rancho Palos Verdes, CA). Initial conditions were 75% solvent B (hexane/isopropyl alcohol/H2O, 30:40:7, v/v/v, 1% ammonium acetate). The gradient increased to 100% solvent B over 6 min and stayed constant for another 30 min. The mass spectrometer was run in positive ion mode with a higher declustering potential (100 V) and a higher collision energy (40 V) than used when monitoring cholesterol-derived products. The transitions monitored for the phospholipids were m/z 527 → 184 for d3-platelet activating factor, m/z 650 → 184 for 16:0a/9al-GPCho, m/z 740 → 184 for d6-16:0a/16:0-GPCho, and m/z 760 → 184 for 16:0a/18:1-GPCho. The standard curve was linear for the range tested, 20–640 ng of 16:0a/9al-GPCho and 80 to 2.56 μg of 16:0a/18:1-GPCho. Cell Ozonolysis, Cytotoxicity, and Inhibition of Cholesterol Synthesis—The 16 HBE 14o- (16-HBE) human bronchial epithelial cell line (21Gruenert D.C. Basbaum C.B. Welsh M.J. Finkbeiner W.E. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin on uncoated 6- or 24-well culture dishes. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator with 100% humidity. For ozonolysis, cells were grown to ∼50% confluency in 6-well plates. Before ozonolysis the media were removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. A small volume (300 μl) of Hanks' buffered saline solution was added to each well to keep the cells from drying out during ozone exposure. After exposure cells were trypsinized, and the lipids were extracted as described above. Trypan blue exclusion was used to measure cytotoxicity (22Ghelli A. Porcelli A.M. Zanna C. Rugolo M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 16-HBE cells were grown in 24-well plates to >50% confluency (2 × 105 cells) and then washed and covered with 1 ml of serum-containing media per well. Ethanolic solutions of oxysterol or corresponding vehicle were added to cell media (0.5% ethanol final concentration), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the duration of the exposure. At the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized, and a small aliquot was diluted 1:1 with a 0.4% trypan blue solution (final concentration 0.2%). At least 100 cells were counted per sample using a hemocytometer, and the percentage that incorporated the dye was calculated. No effect of vehicle was observed. For studies of protection by exogenous cholesterol, 1, 3, 10, or 30 μm cholesterol in ethanol was added immediately prior to treatment with oxysterol. For studies of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, the incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into cholesterol and neutral lipids was determined by modification of the method of Kandutsch and Chen (23Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8408-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at 50% confluency in 6-well dishes were washed, and fresh media (3 ml) was added. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of oxysterols in ethanol for 24 h and then 7 μCi of [14C]acetate was added for 3 h (final ethanol concentration 0.3%). Cells were trypsinized and lipids were extracted from the media and cells with 3 volumes of iso-octane. The extract was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate to remove residual water-soluble radioactive components. The iso-octane was then dried under N2 and resuspended in 100 μl of methylene chloride for TLC chromatography using Silica Gel G (Analtech; Newark, DE) activated for 2 h at 110 °C. The TLC solvent system employed was 99.5% ether with 0.5% ammonium acetate in which cholesterol and neutral lipids had an Rf of 0.61 and 0.83, respectively. The radioactive signal was quantitated by integration of the radioactive signal for the peak at each Rf using a Bioscan system 200 imaging scanner with Win-scan software (Bioscan, Washington, D. C.). Structural Characterization of the Metabolites—Three 10-cm diameter plates of 16-HBE cells (∼30 million cells) were treated with 3 μm β-epoxide overnight (final ethanol concentration 0.03%). Samples were pooled, and the lipids were extracted as described above prior to injection on an RP-HPLC column flowing at 1 ml/min with 50-μl eluate split to the mass spectrometer to monitor for the metabolite transition (m/z 436 → 383), and the remaining effluent directed to a fraction collector (1-min fractions). A portion of the HPLC fraction containing the metabolite was infused into the API III+ instrument (Applied Biosystems, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) for tandem mass spectrometric analysis, and the rest was dried under vacuum. The same method was used to acquire deuterated metabolites (cells were treated with deuterated β-epoxide under identical conditions). In order to characterize the metabolites by electron ionization (70 eV) mass spectrometry, an aliquot of the metabolite or its deuterated analog was derivatized by addition of 50 μl of acetonitrile and 50 μl of BSTFA followed by a 15-min heating to 65 °C for 15 min. An aliquot (2 μl) of each derivatization solution was analyzed by a gas chromatographmass spectrometer using electron ionization at +70 eV (Trace 2000, Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The temperature gradient ran from 150 to 260 °C at 20 °C/min and 260–310 °C at 4 °C/min on a 30-meter DB-1 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a 0.25 mm inner diameter and a 0.25-μm stationary film thickness. Sodium borohydride reduction of α-epoxide, β-epoxide, and the unknown metabolite was carried out by adding an excess of NaBH4 to the oxysterol dissolved in ethanol for 2 h followed by iso-octane extraction. Epoxide hydrolysis to vicinal diols of α-epoxide, β-epoxide, and the unknown metabolite was carried out by treating 5 μg of the oxysterol with 30 μl of perchloric acid in 0.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran/H2O/acetone (v/v/v, 4:1:0.5) and stirring for 4 h at room temperature (24Fieser L.F. Fieser M. Reagents for Organic Synthesis. Wiley Interscience, New York1959: 796Google Scholar). For large scale synthesis of cholestane-3,5,6-triol (3,5,6-triol), 10 mg of β-epoxide was treated with 0.5 ml of perchloric acid in 4 ml of tetrahydrofuran/H2O/acetone (v/v/v, 4:1:0.5). The lipids were extracted with methylene chloride, and the organic layer was washed three times with water. The 3,5,6-triol was purified by RP-HPLC as described above for β-epoxide. Cholestan-6-oxo-3,5-diol (6-oxo-3,5-diol) was synthesized by the method of Fieser and Rajagopalan (25Fieser L.F. Rajagopalan S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 3938-3941Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 mg of cholestanetriol was dissolved in 4.5 ml of ether, 750 μl of methanol, and 750 μl of water. N-Bromosuccinimide (108 mg) was added, and the reaction was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The solution was diluted with water and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic fraction was dried under vacuum and purified by RP-HPLC. The resulting product was derivatized with BSTFA and characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Treatment of diluted calf lung surfactant extract with high concentrations of ozone was reported previously (8Uhlson C. Harrison K. Allen C.B. Ahmad S. White C.W. Murphy R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to generate several classes of biologically active products, two of which had very different polarity when separated by normal phase chromatography. When analyzed by LC/MS, the early eluting normal phase fraction that reduced monocyte viability was found to generate abundant positive ions at m/z 383, 401, 419, 435, and 452 (data not shown). These ions were consistent with various neutral lipids, including oxidized cholesterol, suggesting that cholesterol within pulmonary surfactant could be transformed into biologically active metabolites that mediated the toxicity of ozone. In order to determine unambiguously whether components in lung surfactant could in fact be derived from cholesterol reacting with relevant concentrations of ozone, a trace amount of [14C]cholesterol was added to isolated rat BAL fluid, and the solution was exposed to 2.0 ppm ozone in a controlled chamber for 4 h. Lipids were then extracted and chromatographed by reversed phase HPLC, and the effluent was analyzed by on-line mass spectrometry and radioactive scintillation detection. Two major radioactive products were observed along with unreacted cholesterol (Fig. 1). The least lipophilic component (peak A) eluted at 16 min and generated an abundant ion at m/z 511 (negative ion mode) and at m/z 452 (positive ion mode). This component was identified as 5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestan-3,7a-diol based on collision-induced dissociation properties and RP-HPLC retention time in comparison with a previously identified product following the exposure of cholesterol to ozone in tetrahydrofuran and water (15Pulfer M.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The compound that eluted at 21 min (peak B) generated an abundant positive ion at m/z 420 by electrospray ionization that corresponded to an ammonium ion adduct of cholesterol with the addition of one oxygen atom, which agreed with a previously identified product of cholesterol ozonolysis, namely 5,6-epoxycholesterol (11Gumulka J. Smith L.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 1972-1979Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This oxidized cholesterol product had been studied previously (26Sevanian A. Mead J.F. Stein R.A. Lipids. 1979; 14: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) because it was observed to form during a very different type of oxidative stress, namely free radical-mediated cholesterol peroxidation. Synthesis of both epoxide stereoisomers had been described previously (20Sevanian A. Berliner J. Peterson H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which provided a facile means to synthesize deuterated 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol (α-epoxide) as well as deuterated β-epoxide. Each isomer was added in separate experiments to pulmonary surfactant after exposure to relatively low concentrations of ozone, and it was found that the radioactive peak eluting at 21 min was in fact only one of the epimers, namely 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol based on co-elution of the deuterated β-epoxide with peak B (data not shown). Deuterated β-epoxide was subsequently used as a mass spectrometry internal standard to facilitate quantitation of both isomers of epoxycholesterol in rat BAL treated with ozone. When BAL was exposed for 4 h to increasing levels of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm ozone, a dose-dependent formation of β-epoxide was observed (Fig. 2). Up to 200 ng of β-epoxide was observed to form under these conditions, whereas ∼3 μg of unreacted cholesterol remained in the surfactant. The β isomer was formed in preference to the α isomer at all ozone concentrations studied with a ratio of ∼5:1. Samples of rat BAL exposed to filtered air had low but detectable levels of β-epoxide; however, α-epoxide was not detected. Phospholipids that contain a double bond in a fatty acyl chain are also an abundant component of pulmonary surfactant, and therefore it was of interest to determine the abundance of cholesterol-derived ozonolysis products relative to phospholipid-derived ozonolysis products. Aliquots of surfactant containing 3.3 nmol of 16:0a/18:1-GPCho and 5.6 nmol of cholesterol contained 66 pmol of β-epoxide and 10 pmol of the phospholipid ozonolysis product; 16:0a/9al-GPCho was studied previously (8Uhlson C. Harrison K. Allen C.B. Ahmad S. White C.W. Murphy R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After exposure to 0.2 ppm ozone for 4 h, the level of 16:0a/9al-GPCho increased to 42 pmol and β-epoxide increased to 184 pmol. Therefore, there was a 3–4-fold increase in the levels of both products following ozonolysis, suggesting that cholesterol is a relevant target for oxidation by ozone and that cholesterol ozonolysis products are formed in similar abundance to phospholipid-derived ozonolysis products. The pulmonary surfactant layer in some areas of the lung may be sufficiently thin to permit direct exposure of underlying epithelial cells to ozone present in inspired air. This would be especially true for cells in the alveoli where surfactant sits mainly in the junctions between cells (27Weibel"
https://openalex.org/W2001856542,"The coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase, CARM1, is a positive regulator of transcription. Using high density protein arrays, we have previously identified in vitro substrates for CARM1. One of these substrates, TARPP (thymocyte cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein), is expressed specifically in immature thymocytes. Here, we have demonstrated that TARPP is arginine-methylated at a single residue, Arg650, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, recombinant TARPP is not methylated by extracts from Carm1-/- cells, indicating that there is no redundancy in this pathway. We show that thymi from Carm1-/- embryos (E18.5) have a 5–10-fold reduction in cellularity compared with wild type littermates. Flow cytometric analysis of thymocytes revealed a decrease in the relative proportion of double negative thymocytes in Carm1-/- embryos because of a partial developmental arrest in the earliest thymocyte progenitor subset. These results demonstrate that CARM1 plays a significant role in promoting the differentiation of early thymocyte progenitors, possibly through its direct action on TARPP.

Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The recruitment of CARM1 enhances transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, possibly as a result of the specific methylation of histone H3 and/or CBP/p300. Further attempts to elucidate the biological role of CARM1 have included the targeted disruption of the Carm1 genes in mice and the search for in vivo substrates for this enzyme (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). PRMTs target a wide array of different proteins for posttranslational modification. The majority of asymmetric NG,NG-dimethylarginine residues occur within glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domains (3Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with methylated GAR domains include Sam68, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, ILF3, and FUS (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CARM1 displays a higher degree of specificity than other Type 1 enzymes and does not methylate GAR domains (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). CARM1 substrates have been identified through candidate approaches (histone H3 and Hu antigen R) (4Chen D. Ma H. Hong H.

Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and through focused in vitro substrate screens (PABP1 and TARPP) (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the early T cell-specific factor TARPP (thymocyte cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein) (20Kisielow J. Nairn A.C. Karjalainen K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which was identified as a CARM1 substrate using high density protein arrays, is methylated in vivo. We went on to map the single arginine residue that is targeted for posttranslational modification by CARM1. Finally, we have shown that T cell development in Carm1 mutant embryos (E18.5) is aberrant, concomitant with the start of TARPP expression. Antibodies and Plasmids—pGEX-CARM1 was a gift from Michael Stallcup at the University of Southern California (4Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). pGEX-GAR was a gift from Steve Clarke at UCLA (3Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of pGEX-PABP1 has been described previously (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All TARPP·GST fusion proteins were subcloned in pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). For GFP fusion constructs, pGEX6P-1 fusion constructs were cut and directly subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on full-length TARPP in pEGFP-C1 by PCR using mutant primer sets. The αTARPP antibody was raised in rabbits against GST·TARPPd, which encodes amino acids 622–807 of TARPP (see Fig. 1A). The αCARM1 antibody was raised in rabbits against the peptide sequence KTMGGPAISMASPMSIPTNTMHYGS. Other antibodies were purchased from Clontech (αGFP) and BD PharMingen (αCD4, αCD8, αCD3, αB220, αCD11b, αGr-1, αCD44, and αCD25). Preparation of the GST Fusion Protein—GST fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen) by induction with a final concentration of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Washed cells were resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/g of cells and subsequently broken by four 30-s sonicator pulses (50% duty; setting “4”) on ice with a Sonifier cell disruptor W-350 (SmithKline Corp.). The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 23,000 × g at 4 °C. The GST fusion protein was then batch-purified from extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed in PBS according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purified proteins were eluted from the beads with 30 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl. In Vitro Methylation Assay—In vitro methylation reactions were performed in a final volume of 30 μl of PBS (pH 7.4). The reaction contained 0.5–1 μg of substrate and 1 μg of recombinant CARM1. All methylation reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.42 μm [3H]AdoMet (79 Ci/mmol from a 12.6-μm stock solution; Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then subjected to fluorography by separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, treatment with Enhance™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposure to film overnight. In Vitro Methylation Assay with Cell Lines—Mouse embryonic fibroblast lines (MEFs) were grown to 80% confluency on a 10-cm plate. Cells were washed with PBS and scraped off the plate into 500 μl of PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the supernatant was used as the enzyme source. In vitro methylation reactions were performed by adding the cell lysate to 1 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione beads in the presence of 0.42 μm [3H]AdoMet. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and then the beads were washed three times with PBS. The substrate-bound beads were then subjected to fluorography for 20 days after SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and treated with Enhance™. Transient Transfection and in Vivo Methylation Assay—Cells were labeled using a previously described in vivo methylation assay (21Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, for analysis of in vivo methylation of TARPP in HeLa cells, GFP fusion constructs were transiently transfected into cells using 30 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing non-essential amino acid solution. One day after transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS to remove serum and then incubated with 5 ml of Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 10 μCi/ml l-[methyl-3H]methionine, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 3 h. Cells were then lysed in a “mild” buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and immunoprecipitations were performed with αGFP, αSam68, or αTARPP antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE and transferral to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. To gauge the expression levels of GFP-fused proteins, Western blot with an αGFP antibody was performed using the same membrane. Cells—The generation of wild type and Carm1-/- MEFs from E13.5 embryos has been described (17Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and the BW5147 T cell lymphoma (mature) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The immature T cell lymphoma, LR1–9531, was derived from an atm-/-rag-2-/- thymoma and has been described (22Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The LR1–9531 cell line was a gift from Boris Reizis at Columbia University. Flow Cytometry—For three-color immunofluorescence analysis, cells in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide were incubated with directly conjugated or biotinylated Abs on ice for 30 min followed by three washes. Binding of biotinylated Ab was detected with streptavidin conjugated to allophycocyanin. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before analysis. For determination of double negative (DN) subsets, lineage-positive cells were gated out after staining with a mixture of biotinylated Abs to lineage markers CD4, CD8, CD3, B220, CD11b, and Gr-1 as well as with anti-CD44-phycoerythrin and anti-CD25-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD PharMingen). Cells were analyzed with a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer and analyzed using Coulter Elite software. Mapping of the Methylated Site in TARPP—Using an arrayed protein library (23Bussow K. Cahill D. Nietfeld W. Bancroft D. Scherzinger E. Lehrach H. Walter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5007-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we screened 37,200 clones of His-tagged fusion protein for substrates of the CARM1 arginine methyltransferase. In this manner we identified PABP1 and TARPP as in vitro substrates for CARM1 (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has since been established that PABP1 is methylated by CARM1 in vivo (17Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To determine the region of TARPP methylation by CARM1, we generated a contiguous set of GST·TARPP fusion constructs (Fig. 1A). For in vitro methylation, GST fusion proteins containing the sequences depicted in Fig. 1A were incubated with recombinant CARM1 in the presence of [3H]AdoMet. The C-terminal-most 185 amino acids, harboring four arginine residues, are methylated by CARM1 (Fig. 1B, denoted as construct d). This C-terminal portion of TARPP was further subdivided into two fragments of ∼100 amino acids each, with construct “e” being a good methyl-acceptor and construct “f” far less so. The fact that fragment f can be methylated in vitro, albeit at a low level, may point toward an additional minor methylation site closer to the C-terminal end of TARPP. We concentrated on identifying the major methylation site and subdivided construct “e” into two pieces that each harbored just one arginine residue. In this manner the predominant in vitro methylated region was mapped to an 80-amino acid stretch that contained a single arginine residue (Arg650) (Fig. 1B, construct g). Next, we used MEF extracts as a source of methyltransferase activity to transfer a tritium-labeled methyl group from AdoMet onto GST fusion proteins harboring the methylatable motifs of TARPP and PABP1, and the GAR motif of fibrillarin. Cell extracts from Carm1-/- MEF lines were unable to methylate GST·TARPP or GST·PABP1, but GST·GAR (an in vitro substrate for PRMT1, -3 and -6) was methylated by the knock-out lines (Fig. 1C). There is a major methylated band that runs at the gel front. This phenomenon has been seen in other studies (11Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and is likely because of degraded recombinant protein that acts as a good substrate. These in vitro data identify the region of arginine methylation in the TARPP molecule and suggest that methylation of TARPP by CARM1 is a non-redundant process. Full-length TARPP Is Methylated in Vivo—To determine whether TARPP is methylated in cells we used an in vivo methylation assay described by Liu and Dreyfuss (21Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The total methylated protein pool is labeled by incubating cells with l-[methyl-3H]methionine in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP, GFP·TARPP, and GFP·PABP1 and the methylated proteins labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GFP·PABP1 serves as a positive control for in vivo methylation (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). GFP is a negative control to confirm that translation was indeed inhibited. Both the GFP fusions of TARPP and PABP1 are methylated in HeLa cells, whereas GFP alone remains largely unmodified (Fig. 2A), indicating that cellular TARPP (fused to GFP) is methylated. Next, the single arginine residue that was identified as the in vitro methylation site (Fig. 1B) was replaced with an alanine residue to generate GFP·TARPPA650. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP·TARPP and GFP·TARPPA650 and the methylated proteins labeled. After immunoprecipitation with αGFP antibodies it was clear that the GFP fusion of TARPP but not TARPPA650 was methylated in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that arginine 650 is the only methylated residue in TARPP. In a number of studies arginine methylation has been implicated in the regulation of protein subcellular localization (24McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We thus compared the localization of GFP·TARPP and GFP·TARPPA650. Even though GFP·TARPPA650 cannot be methylated in the cell (Fig. 2B), no effect on its subcellular localization was observed (Fig. 2C). TARPP Is Methylated in Immature T Cells—TARPP expression is restricted to the brain and immature T cells (20Kisielow J. Nairn A.C. Karjalainen K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that ectopically expressed TARPP is methylated in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A) and that the site of methylation is Arg650 (Fig. 2B). To study endogenous TARPP we generated polyclonal antibodies to the human protein. TARPP expression was detected in a T cell line (LR1–9531) derived from an atm-/-rag-2-/- thymoma that displays an immature T cell phenotype (22Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). TARPP expression was not detected in the mature T cell line BW5147. Both mature and immature T cell lines express CARM1. To establish that endogenous TARPP is methylated, an in vivo methylation assay was performed on the T cells by incubating them with l-[methyl-3H]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide. TARPP was immunoprecipitated from these labeled cell extracts. TARPP was methylated in the immature T cell line (9531), and this methylation was inhibited in the presence of the global methylation inhibitor, adenosine dialdehyde (Fig. 3B). The arrowhead indicates the position of TARPP. Similar results were obtained when a known arginine-methylated protein, Sam68, was subjected to the same analysis (Fig. 3C). The presence of nonspecific bands seen in the TARPP fluorography may be because of the long exposure time (30 days) needed to clearly see the methylation of endogenous TARPP. This long exposure time is needed because only a single site (Arg650) on TARPP is methylated, as opposed to multiple arginine methylation sites in Sam68 (18Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and PABP1 (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, during its brief period of expression in immature T cells, TARPP is likely methylated specifically by CARM1. CARM1 Knock-out Mice Exhibit Aberrant T Cell Development—TARPP is expressed in thymocyte progenitors (20Kisielow J. Nairn A.C. Karjalainen K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is methylated by CARM1 (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1, 2, 3). These results, together with the smaller thymi observed in sections of Carm1-/- embryos (data not shown), prompted us to investigate T cell development in the Carm1 mutant embryos. T cell maturation is a highly ordered process in which discrete developmental stages are defined by cell surface expression of well defined differentiation markers such as the coreceptor molecules CD4 and CD8 (reviewed in Refs. 25Rodewald H.-R. Fehling H.J. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 69: 1-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Anderson G. Jenkinson E.J. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 27Gill J. Malin M. Sutherland J. Gray D. Hollander G. Boyd R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 195: 28-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The earliest intrathymic progenitors, which have a CD4-CD8- DN phenotype, give rise to the predominant cortical CD4+CD8+ double positive subset. Double positive thymocytes that express αβ T cell receptors (TCRs) with appropriate affinity for endogenous peptide/major histocompatibility complexes undergo positive selection during which either CD4 or CD8 is down-regulated. The resulting single positive thymocytes migrate to the medulla, undergo further maturation, and emigrate as naïve T cells to peripheral lymphoid tissues (reviewed in Refs. 28Sebzda E. Mariathasan S. Ohteki T. Jones R. Bachmann M.F. Ohashi P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 829-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 29Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Bevan M.J. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 13: 93-126Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Thymocyte cellularity is greatly reduced in E18.5 Carm1-/- embryos compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometric analysis showed a decrease in the percentage of DN thymocytes in Carm1-/- (8%) compared with wild type (22%) thymi (Fig. 4D). Although there is a corresponding increase in the percentage of DP thymocytes in homozygous Carm1-/- mice, the total number of thymocytes in each major subset is reduced (Fig. 4, B and C). These findings suggested that CARM1 affects the differentiation and/or survival of T cell precursors. To explore this possibility, we evaluated DN thymocyte maturation in greater detail. Subsets within the DN population can be recognized by the pattern of CD44 and CD25 expression (30Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Suda T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). The CD44+CD25- DN1 subset contains multipotent progenitors that are not yet committed to the T cell lineage (31Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Lenardo M.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Shortman K. Wu L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 29-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Rearrangement of the TCR β-chain locus is initiated at the CD44+CD25+ DN2 stage and continues as thymocytes advance to the CD44-CD25+ DN3 stage. DN3 thymocytes are committed to the T lineage but cannot differentiate to the CD44-CD25- DN4 stage unless they express pre-TCR heterodimers that consist of a TCR β-chain associated with an invariant pre-TCRα polypeptide. Pre-TCR signaling results in CD25 down-regulation, multiple rounds of proliferation, CD4 and CD8 expression, allelic exclusion at the TCR β-chain locus, and initiation of TCR α-chain gene rearrangement (reviewed in Ref. 33Michie A.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fig. 4E shows an increased proportion of DN1 thymocytes in Carm1-/- mice. Thus, the absence of CARM1 results in a partial arrest of thymocyte maturation at an early progenitor stage. Because of the developmental block at the DN1 stage, there is a notable reduction in the frequency and absolute number of DN2 thymocytes in Carm1-/- compared with wild type mice. Nevertheless, the small numbers of DN2 thymocytes that escape or bypass the developmental block imposed by a deficiency in CARM1 retain the ability to undergo developmental progression to DN3 and DN4 stages. Because it has been shown that the DN2 subset contains a high frequency of proliferating cells (34Penit C. Lucas B. Vasseur F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5103-5113PubMed Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the minor DN2 subset in Carm1-/- mice generates readily detectable DN3 cells, which are the immediate precursors of the DN4 thymocytes. DN4 thymocytes then undergo further expansion to generate the double positive subset (34Penit C. Lucas B. Vasseur F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5103-5113PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of the developmental block at the DN1 progenitor stage in Carm1-/- mice, there is a severe reduction in the absolute number of thymocytes at subsequent maturation stages, an effect that accounts for the overall reduction in thymocyte cellularity that occurs in the absence of CARM1 expression. Finally, the results demonstrate that CARM1 plays a role in the differentiation of early thymocyte progenitors. The block at the DN1 to DN2 transition is consistent with the fact that TARPP expression is initiated at the DN2 stage in wild type thymocytes (20Kisielow J. Nairn A.C. Karjalainen K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we have presented the following evidence that TARPP is methylated predominantly at one arginine residue by CARM1: 1) TARPP was identified in an in vitro screen as a specific substrate for recombinant CARM1 (7Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. Vandel L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); 2) the in vitro methylation of TARPP was mapped to arginine 650 within the C-terminal portion of the molecule (Fig. 1B); 3) TARPP is not methylated when using a cell extract from CARM1 knock-out cells as the enzyme source (Fig. 1C), thus providing genetic proof that CARM1 is the enzyme that is modifying TARPP; and 4) a GFP·TARPP fusion that has arginine 650 replaced with an alanine is not methylated in vivo (Fig. 2B). Thus within the context of the full-length TARPP the replacement of a single arginine residue prevents in vivo methylation. The fact that TARPP expression is largely restricted to thymocyte progenitors led us to compare T cell development in CARM1 wild type and knock-out embryos. The T cell developmental block in Carm1-/- mice at the CD44+CD25- stage may be caused by the lack of TARPP arginine methylation at the CD44+CD25+ stage. The biological function of TARPP is unknown. However, it is intriguing that TARPP expression accompanies TCR gene rearrangement and that TARPP harbors a R3H domain that is likely involved in nucleic acid binding (35Grishin N.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 329-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Many CARM1 substrates possess nucleic acid binding properties (PABP1, Hu antigen R, SmB, and histone H3), but others can remodel chromatin (p300/CBP). CARM1 is a positive regulator of p300/CBP function (6Xu W. Chen H. Du K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. Vandel L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and it may be this co-activator property of CARM1 that, when lost, results in reduced TCR gene rearrangement because of diminished accessibility to the recombination machinery. Indeed, there is a strong correlation between hyperacetylated and accessible regions of TCR loci in vivo (36McMurry M.T. Krangel M.S. Science. 2000; 287: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, lysine acetylation and arginine methylation may work together to enhance chromatin accessibility for RAG-mediated cleavage in the same way that these modifications synergize for nuclear receptor-regulated transcription (37Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that the absence of CARM1 indirectly affects thymocyte development by impairing the function of non-lymphoid cells that comprise the thymic microenvironment. In particular, thymocyte differentiation and survival are dependent on signals emanating from the thymic epithelial compartment (26Anderson G. Jenkinson E.J. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Therefore, future studies will dissect the significance of CARM1 expression in thymocytes versus thymic stromal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059678611,"The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is a complex process involving numerous interactions between the target cell and the macrophage. We have examined a role of the major soluble inhibitor of the classic and lectin complement pathways, C4b-binding protein (C4BP), in the clearance of apoptotic cells. The major form of C4BP present in blood is composed of seven α-chains and one β-chain, which binds protein S (PS). Approximately 70% of all PS in human plasma is trapped in such a complex and is able to localize C4BP to the surface of apoptotic cells due to the high affinity to phosphatidylserine. Free PS has recently been shown to enhance phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. We observed a stimulatory effect of free PS on the engulfment of apoptotic cells (BL-41 and Jurkat) by primary human macrophages or THP-1 cells and a decrease of activity in serum depleted of PS in agreement with previous results. However, we also show that the process is strongly inhibited in the presence of the C4BP-PS complex. Addition of the C4BP-PS complex to serum deficient in both molecules abolished the enhancing effect of serum on phagocytosis. The effect of both free PS and the C4BP-PS complex could be inhibited with monoclonal antibody directed against the Gla domain of PS. Although the presence of the C4BP-PS complex on apoptotic cells may lead to decreased phagocytosis, it may still be beneficial to the host, since it could prevent secondary necrosis because it inhibits further complement attack. The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is a complex process involving numerous interactions between the target cell and the macrophage. We have examined a role of the major soluble inhibitor of the classic and lectin complement pathways, C4b-binding protein (C4BP), in the clearance of apoptotic cells. The major form of C4BP present in blood is composed of seven α-chains and one β-chain, which binds protein S (PS). Approximately 70% of all PS in human plasma is trapped in such a complex and is able to localize C4BP to the surface of apoptotic cells due to the high affinity to phosphatidylserine. Free PS has recently been shown to enhance phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. We observed a stimulatory effect of free PS on the engulfment of apoptotic cells (BL-41 and Jurkat) by primary human macrophages or THP-1 cells and a decrease of activity in serum depleted of PS in agreement with previous results. However, we also show that the process is strongly inhibited in the presence of the C4BP-PS complex. Addition of the C4BP-PS complex to serum deficient in both molecules abolished the enhancing effect of serum on phagocytosis. The effect of both free PS and the C4BP-PS complex could be inhibited with monoclonal antibody directed against the Gla domain of PS. Although the presence of the C4BP-PS complex on apoptotic cells may lead to decreased phagocytosis, it may still be beneficial to the host, since it could prevent secondary necrosis because it inhibits further complement attack."

RGS17 contains an amino-terminal cysteine-rich motif and a carboxyl-terminal RGS domain with highest homology to hRGSZ1- and hRGS-Gα-interacting protein. RGS17 RNA was strongly expressed as multiple species in cerebellum and other brain regions. The interactions between hRGS17 and active forms of Gαi1–3, Gαo, Gαz, or Gαq but not Gαs were detected by yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro pull-down assay, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Recombinant RGS17 acted as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) on free Gαi2 and Gαo under pre-steady-state conditions, and on M2-muscarinic receptor-activated Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαz, and Gαo in steady-state GTPase assays in vitro. Unlike RGSZ1, which is highly selective for Gz, RGS17 exhibited limited selectivity for Go among Gi/Go proteins. All RZ family members reduced dopamine-D2/Gαi-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation and abolished thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor/Gαq-mediated calcium mobilization. RGS17 is a new RZ member that preferentially inhibits receptor signaling via Gi/o, Gz, and Gq over Gs to enhance cAMP-dependent signaling and inhibit calcium signaling. Differences observed between in vitro GAP assays and whole-cell signaling suggest additional determinants of the G-protein specificity of RGS GAP effects that could include receptors and effectors.

Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) 1The abbreviations used are: RGS, regulator of G-protein signaling; GAP, GTPase activating protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TRHR1, rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PTX, pertussis toxin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GS, Gly → Ser mutation; QL, Gln → Leu mutation; RC, Arg → Cys mutation; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone. proteins accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G-protein Gα subunits. All RGS proteins contain a conserved RGS core domain, which is an interaction site for the Gα subunits (1Burchett S.A. J.

There are more than 30 human RGS or RGS-like proteins that are classified into six subfamilies based upon their sequence homology and that have conserved functional and targeting domains outside of the RGS domain. For instance, a membrane-targeting domain immediately proximal to the RGS core domain directs small RGS proteins such as RGS1–5 and -16 to the cell membrane (4Heximer S. Lim H. Bernard J. Blumer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Putative nuclear localization signals have been found within (5Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and also outside of the RGS core domain (6Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and this may direct certain RGS subtypes to the nucleus (7Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Harkins L. Cobbs C.S.

RZ family members, such as RGSZ1 and RGS-Gα-interacting protein (GAIP), contain a cysteine-rich motif that may serve as a palmitoylation site for membrane association (9Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A more recent study showed that RZ family members also serve as adapter proteins for Gα subunit degradation (11Fischer T. De Vries L. Meerloo T. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8270-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich motif interacts with the leucine-rich region of GAIP-interacting protein N terminus, an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for Gαi3 degradation. Recently RGSZ1 and RGS6 have been shown to associate with SCG-10, a protein involved in neuronal differentiation (12Nixon A.B. Grenningloh G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18127-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Liu Z. Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 24: 30261-30271Google Scholar), and the Gz GTPase-activating protein (GAP) effects of RGSZ1 (and other RGS proteins) were found to be negatively regulated by synapsin-1a (14Tu Y. Nayak S.K. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52273-52281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, RZ proteins may play diverse and important roles in the regulation of signaling and cytoskeletal events in the brain. G-protein specificity of RGS proteins has been investigated in various studies. Some RGS proteins display a preference for Gα sub-families (15Posner B.A. Mukhopadhyay S. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7773-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with the majority regulating Gαi/o and a subset of these also acting on Gαq (16Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 17Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other RGS members are more selective regulators of specific Gα subunits. For instance, p115RhoGEF has a preference for Gα12/13 subunits (19Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). RGSZ1 seems to be selective for Gαz (20Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although at higher concentrations it has been shown to interact with and negatively regulate Gαi subunits (22Wang Y. Ho G. Zhang J.J. Nieuwenhuijsen B. Edris W. Chanda P.K. Young K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48325-48332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, a series of R7 family RGS proteins displayed a relative hierarchical preference in the regulation of Gαi proteins rather than an absolute specificity for one subtype (23Hooks S.B. Waldo G.L. Corbitt J. Bodor E.T. Krumins A.M. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10087-10093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The most abundant G-protein expressed in the brain is Gαo. However, many actions of Gαo are mediated by means of Gβγ subunits, and little is known of the effectors for the Gαo subunit. To identify Gαo-dependent regulators or effectors, we screened human brain cDNA library for interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system with constitutively active GαoR179C as bait. RGS17 was identified among a number of clones. RGS17 contains a cysteine-rich string at its N terminus followed by the highly conserved RGS domain, and is most homologous to RGSZ1 and other RZ family members. We have addressed the G-protein specificity of RGS17 by GAP interaction and functional assays. Our results indicate that RGS17, as well as RGSZ1, negatively regulates the functions of Gαi/o, Gz, and Gαq subunits. Plasmid Constructs—Constitutively active rat GαoR179C (24Pace A.M. Wong Y.H. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI-cut pAS2–1 (Clontech) for two-hybrid screening. GST-RGS17, GST-RGSZ1, His-RGS17, and His-GαoR179C for bacterial expression were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET-30a(+) (Novagen) using EcoRI or HindIII/EcoRI sites. All pcDNA3-FLAG and pcDNA3-myc constructs were made using PCR products of RGS17 or Gα subunits subcloned into EcoRI/XhoI-cut vectors. The Gly → Ser (GS) mutants of all Gα subunit cDNAs were constructed using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human Gαi1-Q204L, Gαi2-Q205L, Gαi3-Q204L, Gαz-Q205L, Gαz-wt, Gαq-Q209L, GαsL-Q227L, Gαcone-Q204L, RGSZ1 and RGS-GAIP fragment in pcDNA3.1+ were purchased from the Guthrie Institute (www.guthrie.org). Rat Gαo-wt, Gαi1-wt, Gαi2-wt, and Gαi3-wt for expression in mammalian cells were constructed in pcDNA3. For the purification of proteins from Escherichia coli for GTPase experiments, constructs for histidine-tagged RGS4, Gαi2, and Gαo were kindly provided by Dr. John Hepler (Emory University). Baculoviruses for Gαi1 and Gαi3 were kindly provided by Dr. Jim Garrison (University of Virginia). Baculoviruses for Gαo and Gαz, respectively, were gifts from Dr. John Hepler (Emory University) and Dr. Pat Casey (Duke University). Other baculoviruses were obtained as noted previously (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR1) cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Armen H. Tashjian, Jr. (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Rat GαoR179C was used as a bait to screen 5 × 106 clones of a human brain cDNA library (HL4004AH, Clontech) in AH109 yeast strain using the LiAc method (27Ito M. Yasui A. Komamine A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The yeast cells were grown at 30 °C for 5–7 days. Transformants (1.4 × 105) were selected on S.D.-Leu-Trp-His- plates with 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-trizole and screened by X-galactosidase assay. DNA from positive clones was extracted, re-transformed into MH6 cells, and selected on M9-Leu- plates for sequencing. For liquid β-galactosidase assay, pAS2-Gα subunits and pACT2 constructs (positive clones) were transformed into Y187 and AH109 strains and plated onto S.D.-Trp- and S.D.-Leu- plates, respectively. Resultant colonies were mated, selected on S.D.-Leu-Trp-His- plates and subcultured in S.D.-Leu-Trp-His- medium (30 °C, overnight). Yeast cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and re-suspended in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40mm NaH2PO4, 10mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). For quantitative assay, O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and yeast lysate were incubated at 30 °C; absorbance at 420 nm was measured to determine β-galactosidase activity units (28Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which was normalized by the β-galactosidase unit of the positive control vector pCL1 in each assay. The X-gal assay was performed by using the mated yeast cells described above. Briefly, the yeast cells grew in S.D.-Leu-Trp- medium at 30 °C overnight and were diluted to A600 = 0.7, from which 10 μl of the yeast cell medium was spotted on S.D.-Leu-Trp- plates. X-gal assay was performed on the plates after the yeast cells grew for 3–4 days at 30 °C. Northern Blot and 5′-RACE—RGS17 cDNA coding sequence was labeled with [32P]dATP using Strip-EZ™ DNA labeling kit (Ambion) and purified. Clontech blots (MTN blots 7780–1, 7755–1, and 7793–1) were pre-incubated with salmon sperm DNA in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for 2 h at 42 °C and then hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe overnight. The blots were washed three times with 2× SSC plus 1% SDS, followed by 0.2× SSC in 1% SDS. The blots were exposed to x-ray film for 2–4 days. For 5′-RACE, a Marathon-ready human brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences) was amplified with AP1 primer (CCA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC) and RGS17AS 1S-R primer (GCA TCT TCA TAC ATG TGA GGA TTG GGA) using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences). To perform the 5′-RACE, we used touchdown PCR with the following cycles: 30 s at 94 °C, 5 cycles at 94 °C (5 s)/72 °C (4 min), 5 cycles at 94 °C (5 s)/70 °C (4 min), and 25 cycles at 94 °C (5 s)/72 °C (4 min). PCR products were diluted in tricine-EDTA buffer (BD Biosciences) for nested PCR using RGS17AS 2S (GAC AAG ACT TCC TCT GCA GTG GGG T) and AP2 primers (ACT CAC TAT AGG GCT CGA GCG GC) with the following cycles: 30 s at 94 °C, 20 cycles 94 °C (5 s)/68 °C (4 min). The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the major band was excised, and DNA was recovered and subcloned into the pGEMT-easy vector for DNA sequencing. Purification of Proteins for GTPase Assays—RGS proteins and G-proteins were grown individually in transformed E. coli BL21/DE3 cells in LB medium (His-RGS17, His-RGS4) or enriched medium (others) (2% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% glycerol, and 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) containing antibiotics at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm until mid-log phase (optical density at 600 nm of 0.6). A 3-h induction was commenced by adding 30 μm (G-proteins) or 200 μm (RGS proteins) isopropylthio-B-d-galactoside. For purification, frozen bacteria expressing N-terminally histidine-tagged RGS17 were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose (w/v), 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm PMSF)), stirred for 30 min in the cold room, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The expressed protein was predominantly insoluble, and the pelleted material was resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors, passed three times through a French press, and centrifuged as above. The resultant pellet was resuspended and centrifuged again two times in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m guanidine hydrochloride, and protease inhibitors, and then resuspended once again in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The resultant pellet was resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidine HCl, and 0.1 mm PMSF and centrifuged again as above. The supernatant containing the denatured RGS17 protein was diluted with two volumes of a buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-ME, 10% glycerol, 6 m guanidine HCl, and protease inhibitors and dialyzed twice against a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-ME, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and either 2 mm (first dialysis) or 0.5 mm (second dialysis) urea. The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was equilibrated with Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen) for 90 min in the cold room. The resin was packed into a column and then washed with ∼10 volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-ME, 0.5 m urea, protease inhibitors, plus 20 mm imidazole. This first washing was followed by a second wash using the same buffer but minus Triton X-100 and with imidazole increased to 35 mm. The protein was eluted by further increasing the imidazole concentration to 500 mm. The chromatographic removal of imidazole and urea (Superdex 75 column) resulted in precipitation of the purified protein; therefore, RGS17 was stored in the elution buffer and added directly into assays (residual imidazole concentration in assays ranged from 3–6 mm, which was held equal for all conditions within a given experiment). N-terminally histidine-tagged RGS4 was purified as described previously (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GST-RGSZ1 was purified essentially as described previously (20Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and assayed in the uncleaved form, which exhibited GAP activity comparable with that of untagged RGSZ1. 2J. Wang, personal communication. For purification of histidine-tagged Gαi2 and Gαo proteins, transformed E. coli BL21/DE3 cells stored in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-ME, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μm GDP, and protease inhibitors) were thawed, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme was added, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by the addition of 25 μg/ml DNase I in the presence of 0.5 mm MgCl2 for 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the volume of the supernatant was increased to 25 ml/liter culture, with buffer A supplemented with glycerol and imidazole (final concentrations of 20% and 0.02 m, respectively). Nickel-NTA (1.5 ml) was added, gently rotated in the cold for 90 min, and then loaded onto a 5-ml column, washed with 30 ml of buffer A supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole, and then washed with 30 ml of buffer A without Triton X-100 and supplemented with 5% glycerol and 20 mm imidazole. G-protein was eluted with the final wash buffer plus 200 mm imidazole. The elution buffer was removed by dialysis or size-exclusion chromatography using a buffer of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5% glycerol, 2 μm GDP, and 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Steady-state GTPase Assay—Sf9 insect cells at a density of 2 × 106/ml were infected with baculoviruses encoding the following: Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, or Gαz, plus N-terminally c-myc-tagged M2 muscarinic receptors, Gβ1 and Gγ2. After 48 h of infection, cell membranes were prepared as described previously (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The steady-state hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP by Sf9 membranes was measured in the absence and presence of purified RGS proteins essentially as described previously (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10–50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (calculated free Mg2+ = 7.5 mm), were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with 1 μm GTP, 500 μm ATP, [32P]GTP (1 × 106 cpm/assay), either 100 μm carbachol or 10 μm atropine, and cell membranes (2 μg/assay). The assay was stopped by adding 950 ml of ice cold 5% (w/v) Norit in 0.05 m NaH2PO4 (pH 3) and centrifuging. Radioactivity of [32Pi] in the resulting supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The nonspecific membrane GTPase signal was estimated by adding 1 mm of unlabeled GTP to the above assay mix. Agonist- and RGS-dependent GTPase activity was calculated as described (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state GTPase Assay—Measurement of pre-steady-state, single-turnover GTP hydrolysis by Gαi2 and Gαo was conducted as described (29Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Purified Gαi2 or Gαo (1 μm) was incubated with 2 × 106 cpm [γ-32P]GTP at 20 °C(Gαo)or30 °C(Gαi2) for 15 min and then kept on ice. After 5 min, a single round of GTP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 mm), GTP (500 μm, to quench the binding reaction), and varying amounts of RGS protein. Reactions were terminated at various time points by mixing aliquots of sample with activated charcoal. The charcoal was pelleted, and the released 32Pi in the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting. GTP hydrolysis rates were determined by fitting to a single exponential function (Origin 6). In Vitro Pull-down Assay and Western Blotting—E. coli strain BL21DE3 was transformed with pET-GαoR179C, pGEX-4T-1, or pGEX-RGS17, induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthio-B-d-galactoside (37 °C, 4 h), harvested, and re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The bacteria were sonicated, centrifuged at (12,000 × g for 15 min) and the supernatants were incubated with Ni-NTA resin on ice for 20 min. The resin was washed 3× with lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, eluted in 200 mm imidazole, and resolved on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% skimmed milk in TTBS buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl). The membrane was blotted with anti-His (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ) or anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. The membrane was incubated with chemiluminescence substrate (peroxidase (POD), Roche Applied Science) and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film. Co-immunoprecipitation—The pcDNA3FLAG-RGS17 construct was transiently co-transfected with individual pcDNA3myc-Gα mutants into HEK293 cells by the CaPO4 precipitation method (30Albert P.R. Sajedi N. Lemonde S. Ghahremani M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35469-35474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were scraped in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science) and left on ice for 30 min to lyse. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants of FLAG-RGS17 and mycGα subunits were incubated with ∼5 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The gel was washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.3) at room temperature for 5 min to elute the proteins. The eluted supernatants were resolved on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting. cAMP Assay—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with dopamine-D1 (Gs-coupled) and -D2 (Gi/o-coupled) receptor expression plasmids with or without pcDNA3FLAG-RGS17, pcDNA3FLAG-GAIP, pcDNA3FLAG-RGSZ1, or PTX-insensitive rat Gα subunits as described (30Albert P.R.

Plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG was added to equalize the total DNA content for each transfection. After 24 h, cells were plated into six-well dishes. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were pre-treated with 100 ng/ml PTX (Sigma) for four hours and assayed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) with compounds indicated in the figure legends (37 °C, 20 min). The medium was collected, floating cells were pelleted (10,000 × g for 30 s), and the supernatant was collected for cAMP radioimmunoassay (30Albert P.R. Sajedi N. Lemonde S. Ghahremani M.H. J. Biol.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and washed in HBBS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 10 mm d-glucose, 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 2 μm Fura-2 AM in HBBS at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking (100 rpm). The cells were washed twice with HBBS, resuspended in 2 ml of HBBS, and subjected to fluorometric measurement. Experimental compounds were added directly to the cuvette from 100-fold concentrated solutions. RGS17, a Novel RZ-RGS—To identify novel Gαo-interacting proteins, we screened a human brain cDNA library with constitutively active GαoR179C for interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. Among eight positive clones, human RGS17 (GenBank accession no. AF202257.3) was identified. Its cDNA sequence encodes a protein of 210 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 24.4 kDa (Fig. 1). RGS17 contains a core RGS domain (Fig. 1, underlined) and a cysteine-repeat motif (Fig. 1, dotted underlined) at the N-terminal region. There are six putative casein kinase 2 sites (Fig. 1, black arrowheads) and three potential PKC sites (Fig. 1, white arrowheads). hRGS17 shares 93% amino acid identity to the rat RGS17 (GenBank accession no. XM_217837), 92% identity with the Gallus gallus homolog (GenBank accession no. AF151968), and 91% identity to murine RGSZ2 (GenBank accession no. AF191555), indicating that these are species homologues of RGS17. Human RGS17 has the highest homology to RZ subfamily RGS proteins with amino acid identity of 61 and 57% compared with hRGSZ1 and hRGS-GAIP, respectively, suggesting that RGS17 is a new member of the RZ subfamily. Expression of RGS17—To verify that RGS17 is expressed in vivo, we examined the distribution of RGS17 mRNA in human tissues by Northern blotting. At least five RGS17 transcripts were found in various brain regions, with three dominant bands at 8, 3, and 2 kb (Fig. 1B). Throughout the central nervous system, the 8-kb RGS17 transcript was expressed most abundantly in the cerebellum (Fig. 1B, lane 1), whereas the 2-kb species was more abundant in cortex and medulla (lanes 2 and 3). The multiple RGS17 transcripts in brain tissues may represent alternately spliced mRNA products. In contrast, in a variety of human peripheral tissues, only the single 2-kb RGS17 mRNA transcript was weakly detected (data not shown). The size of this transcript is similar to the 1.8-kb RGSZ1 (20Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the 1.6-kb RGS-GAIP (33De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple RGS17 transcripts are predominantly expressed in the cerebellum and other brain regions. Because we detected several large RGS17 RNA species in brain, we performed 5′-RACE studies of a human brain cDNA library (Marathon, Clontech) to search for alternate translational start sites (Fig. 1C). We obtained a single major band which, when subcloned and sequenced, was identical to and no longer than the cDNA sequence. Thus, the human RGS17 RNA variants in brain appear to have the same coding sequence, and variations in RNA size may be due to different 3′-untranslated regions. Gα Specificity of RGS17 Interaction—To demonstrate direct interactions between RGS17 and GαoR179C, in vitro pull-down assays were done using recombinant proteins (Fig. 2)"
https://openalex.org/W2080062813,"The hepatitis E virus causes acute viral hepatitis endemic in much of the developing world and is a serious public health problem. However, due to the lack of an in vitro culture system or a small animal model, its biology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. We have shown earlier that the ORF3 protein (pORF3) of hepatitis E virus activates ERK, a member of the MAPK superfamily. Here we have explored the mechanism of pORF3-mediated ERK activation and demonstrated it to be independent of the Raf/MEK pathway. Using biochemical assays, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and intracellular fluorescence resonance energy transfer we showed that pORF3 binds Pyst1, a prototypic member of the ERK-specific MAPK phosphatase. The binding regions in the two proteins were mapped to the N terminus of pORF3 and a central portion of Pyst1. Expression of pORF3 protected ERK from the inhibitory effects of ectopically expressed Pyst1. This is the first example of a viral protein regulating ERK activation by inhibition of its cognate dual specificity phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1987762537,"Activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is rate-limiting for Na+ (re)absorption across electrically tight epithelia. ENaC is a heteromeric channel comprised of three subunits, α, β, and γ, with each subunit contributing to the functional channel pore. The subunit stoichiometry of ENaC remains uncertain with electrophysiology and biochemical experiments supporting both a tetramer with a 2α:1β:1γ stoichiometry and a higher ordered channel with a 3α:3β:3γ stoichiometry. Here we used an independent biophysical approach based upon fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between differentially fluorophore-tagged ENaC subunits to determine the subunit composition of mouse ENaC functionally reconstituted in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells. We found that when all three subunits were co-expressed, ENaC contained at least two of each type of subunit. Findings showing that ENaC subunits interact with similar subunits in immunoprecipitation studies are consistent with these FRET results. Upon native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, moreover, oligomerized ENaC runs predominantly as a single species with a molecular mass of >600 kDa. Because single ENaC subunits have a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, these results also agree with the FRET results. The current results as a whole, thus, are most consistent with a higher ordered channel possibly with a 3α:3β:3γ stoichiometry.

This family contains several ion channels (e.g. ASIC, BNaC, DEG, DRASIC, ENaC, and FaNaCH) of similar structure that serve diverse physiological functions from modulating mechanosensory transduction and neuronal signaling to control of electrolyte movement across epithelial barriers. Functional ENaC, similar to most other ion channels, is a heteromeric protein complex containing several distinct channel subunits. Four ENaC subunits have been identified, α, β, γ, and δ (1Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 5Canessa C.M. Schild L.

The first three subunits are widely expressed and together form the channel resident to the luminal plasma membrane of epithelial cells capable of electrogenic Na+ (re-)absorption. Consistent with this idea are findings showing that co-expression of only two of these three subunits produces little to no current in heterologous expression systems (1Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D.

Importantly, the stoichiometric relationship between ENaC subunits is uncertain. Each ENaC subunit has a cytosolic NH2 and COOH terminus with two transmembrane domains separated by a single large extracellular loop with all three ENaC subunits, α, β, and γ, contributing the functional pore (1Canessa C.M.

This approach relies on patch clamp electrophysiology to discriminate between channels containing wild-type subunits from those containing mutant subunits with differential sensitivities to channel blockers and cysteine-modifying methanethiosulfonates. Results from these types of experiments support both a 2α:1β:1γ and a 3α:3β:3γ stoichiometry. Results from biochemical experiments using sucrose gradient sedimentation and quantitative analysis of cell surface expression of ENaC subunits, moreover, provide support for both the 2:1:1 and 3:3:3 stoichiometry (9Firsov D.

Results testing functionality of ENaC concatamers supporting a 2:1:1 stoichiometry, similarly, contrast with freeze-fracture electron microscopy results supporting a higher ordered stoichiometry (9Firsov D.

Here we use a biophysical approach distinct from that used previously by others to distinguish between the 2:1:1 and 3:3:3 subunit stoichiometry proposed for ENaC. Our approach was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between ENaC subunits differentially tagged with distinct fluorophores. The current results demonstrate that when all three subunits are co-expressed, ENaC can contain more than one copy of each type of subunit and thus, our findings are more consistent with a higher ordered channel. Plasmids—Full-length mouse α-, β-, and γENaC subunit cDNAs were ligated in-frame behind either enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) into pECFP-C1 or pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) at the XhoI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites. Initially, channel subunit cDNAs were amplified by standard PCR from the respective pCMV-Myc-ENaC plasmids described previously by our laboratory (16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For α-, β-, and γENaC, the upstream and downstream primers were 5′-CGAACTCGAGTTATGCTGGACCACACCAGAGC and 5′-GCTAGAATTCTCAGAGTGCCATGGCCGGAGC; 5′-CGAACTCGAGTTATGCCAGTGAAGAAGTACC and 5′-GCTAGAATTCCTAGATGGCCTCCACCTCACTG; and 5′-CGAACTCGAGTTATGGCGCCTGGAGAGAAG and 5′-GCTAGAATTCTTAGAACTCATTGGTCAACTG, respectively. These primer sets engineered upstream XhoI and downstream EcoRI sites (underlined) into each of the respective subunit cDNAs. The newly generated pECFP-ENaC and pEYFP-ENaC plasmids encode fusion proteins containing the full-length mouse ENaC subunit following an NH2-terminal eCFP or eYFP with expression driven by the CMV promoter. All plasmids were sequenced to ensure proper reading frame, orientation, and sequence. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—For FRET microscopy, COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with vectors encoding tagged ENaC subunits and/or control proteins. Cells were transfected with Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J.

Fluorescence signals were collected with a 510 LSM confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using laser excitation at 458 nm (eCFP) and 514 nm (eYFP) and emission windows of 468.5-505.5 nm (eCFP, HQ 487/37 bandpass, Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT) and 525-575 nm (eYFP, HQ 550/50 bandpass, Chroma Technology). Preceding the emission filters in the light path was a NFT 515 nm dichroic mirror that split the eCFP and eYFP signals to distinct photomultiplier tubes. This system has been described previously (19Centonze V.E. Sun M. Masuda A. Gerritsen H. Herman B. Methods Enzomol. 2003; 36: 542-560Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All fluorescence data were collected with a high-resolution (1.4 numerical aperture) 60× oil-immersion DIC lens. The software controlled 510 LSM confocal microscope enabled timed regional photobleaching with photobleaching performed selectively at 514 nm with a mean reduction of 525-575-nm (eYFP) emissions to <15% in the photobleached region. Images were acquired before and after photobleaching. Percent FRET efficiency between eCFP (donor) and eYFP (acceptor) was quantified at steady state in fixed cells with acceptor photobleaching methods (also called donor dequenching, Ref. 19Centonze V.E. Sun M. Masuda A. Gerritsen H. Herman B. Methods Enzomol. 2003; 36: 542-560Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) using the formula, % FRET efficiency = [(A1 - A0) × (B0/B1)/(A0)] × 100% where A0 and A1 are eCFP emissions in the photobleached region before and after photobleaching, respectively; B0 and B1 are eCFP emissions in a non-bleached region before and after photobleaching, respectively. With this approach, percent FRET efficiency is the percent increase in donor emissions upon dequenching following selective acceptor photobleaching with spurious changes in donor emissions normalized to an internal control. Electrophysiology—Macroscopic ENaC currents were recorded as described previously (16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

In brief, CHO cells were transiently transfected using the Polyfect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions with eCFP- and eYFP-tagged α-, β-, and γENaC cDNA (0.5 μg of each subunit/35-mm dish). Cells were maintained in culture in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with standard antibiotics and 10 μm amiloride. Electrophysiological measurements were made 24-72 h after transfection. Transfected cells were identified by eYFP fluorescence. Internal pipette and extracellular bath solutions were 120 mm CsCl, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 160 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), respectively. Voltage clamp experiments were performed with an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) patch clamp amplifier interfaced with a personal computer running pClamp 9.0 (Axon Instruments). For whole-cell experiments, macroscopic currents were elicited by voltage ramping from a holding potential of 40 to -100 mV over a 500-ms period with ramps delivered every 5 s. Native Gel Electrophoresis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—All NuPAGE electrophoresis products were from Invitrogen. Native molecular weight standards were from Amersham Biosciences. Cells transfected (using Polyfect) with myc-tagged α-, β-, and γENaC were extracted in gentle lysis buffer (see Refs. 16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Samples were prepared in NuPAGE sample buffer without heating and reducing reagents with 100 μg/well loaded onto a 2-12% NuPAGE gel. In some instances, samples were treated with a final concentration of 50 mm dithiothreitol and 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate and heated (100 °C, 5 min.) to denature and reduce sample proteins to disrupt ENaC subunit complexes. Protein was separated by PAGE in NuPAGE running buffer at 30 V for 24 h at 4 °C and then subsequently electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-Myc antibody as described previously (16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine possible interactions among similar ENaC subunits. Immunoprecipitation experiments followed published protocols (16Booth R.E. Medina J.

In brief, cells were co-transfected with Myc- and HA-tagged, as well as fluorophore-tagged ENaC subunits in such a manner that similar subunits contained either a Myc or HA tag and the other two subunits contained an eYFP tag (i.e. Myc-αENaC + HA-αENaC + eYFP-βENaC + eYFP-γENaC). Fluorescence of eYFP was monitored to determine expression levels. Cells were extracted with gentle lysis buffer and 400 μg (in 400 μl) of total cell lysate exposed overnight to anti-HA-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Anti-HA-interacting proteins and their associated proteins were precipitated, separated with SDS-PAGE, and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-Myc antibody (Clontech) to determine whether similar subunits interacted. Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. p ≤ 0.05 was significant with population data analyzed with the appropriate t test. We used, in the current study, a biophysical approach based on FRET among differentially fluorophore-tagged channel subunits to determine ENaC subunit stoichiometry. This method has been used successfully previously by Zheng and colleagues (21Zheng J. Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N.

Our general experimental design and rationale closely followed that of Zheng and colleagues (21Zheng J. Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2002; 36: 891-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer from eCFP to eYFP (A), as well as predicted results from FRET experiments testing the proposed 2:1:1 (B) and the 3:3:3 (C) stoichiometry of ENaC. ENaC subunits fused to eYFP and eCFP are shown as yellow and blue circles (Fig. 1D), respectively. For either a 2α:1β:1γ or a 3α:3β:3γ stoichiometry, co-expression of any eYFP-tagged subunit with a distinct eCFP-tagged second subunit in the presence of the untagged third subunit would result in the formation of a channel complex containing both fluorophores leading to non-radiative fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the fluorophore emitting at a shorter wavelength (eCFP, donor) to that emitting at a longer wavelength (eYFP, acceptor). Similarly, eCFP-αENaC would be expected to FRET with eYFP-αENaC in channel complexes (containing untagged β- and γENaC) of either stoichiometry. Discrimination between these proposed subunit arrangements then arises only from energy transfer between co-expression of two βENaC or two γENaC subunits bearing distinct fluorophores. For a 2:1:1 stoichiometry, co-expression of eCFP-β with eYFP-β in the presence of untagged α- and γENaC would result in the formation of channel complexes containing only one βENaC subunit and, thus, only one fluorophore resulting in no appreciable FRET. A similar prediction is made for co-expression of eCFP-γ with eYFP-γ in the presence of untagged α- and βENaC considering a 2:1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, co-expression of eCFP-β with eYFP-β in the presence of untagged α and γENaC, as well as eCFP-γ with eYFP-γ in the presence of untagged α- and βENaC are predicted at the higher ordered 3:3:3 stoichiometry to produce channels containing both fluorophores resulting in substantial FRET. Fig. 2 shows a montage of confocal fluorescence micrographs of COS-7 cells co-expressing eCFP and eYFP (A, negative control), a concatamer containing these two proteins linked by a six-glycine spacer (CGY), which served as a positive control (B), and eCFP-αENaC plus eYFP-αENaC with untagged β- and γENaC (C). The top panels (Fig. 2) in each group show emissions from eYFP and eCFP, as well as merged images prior to photobleaching eYFP in a controlled region (outlined by the white rectangle). The lower panels (Fig. 2) show eYFP, eCFP, and merged signals in the same cells following photobleaching. Photobleaching eYFP did not affect eCFP emission in cells expressing non-colocalized eCFP and eYFP (Fig. 2A) but increased eCFP emission in bleached regions in cells expressing colocalized eCFP and eYFP in the form of CGY (B). Similar to the positive control and as predicted, substantial energy transfer was observed between eCFP-αENaC and eYFP-αENaC in the presence of untagged β- and γENaC upon photobleaching (Fig. 2C). Summarized in Fig. 3 are FRET results from both COS-7 and CHO cells expressing combinations of control, tagged ENaC, and untagged ENaC subunit cDNAs. The positive control of CGY had significant energy transfer with a percent FRET efficiency of 20 ± 0.9 and 28.7 ± 3.8 for COS-7 and CHO cells, respectively. Because the linker in CGY is a non-cleaveable track of six glycines, these efficiencies represent the maximums possible with the cell types and imaging system used in the current study (19Centonze V.E. Sun M. Masuda A. Gerritsen H. Herman B. Methods Enzomol. 2003; 36: 542-560Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No FRET was observed, as expected, in the negative control of co-expression of eCFP with eYFP. Also as expected, FRET was observed when any tagged subunit was co-expressed with a differently tagged distinct second subunit and an untagged distinct third subunit; and when eCFP-αENaC and eYFP-αENaC were co-expressed with untagged β-and γENaC. All of these combinations resulted in significantly greater FRET compared with a negative control where the respective eCFP-ENaC subunit was replaced with eCFPKCNQ4 (Fig. 3, represented by X). KCNQ4 is a potassium channel subunit not expected to interact with ENaC subunits. These combinations in addition resulted in significantly greater FRET compared with the eCFP plus eYFP negative control in COS-7 cells (not tested in CHO cells). As noted above, co-expression of eCFP-βENaC with eYFP-βENaC plus untagged α- and γENaC, and eCFP-γENaC with eYFP-γENaC plus untagged α- and βENaC, would discriminate between the proposed 2:1:1 and 3:3:3 stoichiometry. In both cell types, we observed significantly greater FRET when eCFP-βENaC was co-expressed with eYFP-βENaC plus untagged α- and γENaC compared with co-expressing eCFP-KCNQ4 in place of eCFP-βENaC. Similarly, we observed significantly greater FRET when eCFP-γENaC was co-expressed with eYFP-γENaC plus untagged α- and βENaC compared with co-expressing eCFPKCNQ4 in place of eCFP-γENaC. To exclude the possibility that our results were unduly influenced by the formation of homomeric channel complexes containing both fluorophores, we co-expressed eCFP-γENaC with eYFP-γENaC in the absence of α- and βENaC. This combination resulted in no appreciable FRET, indicating a low formation frequency for homomeric channels. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that the expression of only a single type of ENaC subunit or any two of the three subunits in contrast to all three subunits together results in few functional channels and that when all three subunits are co-expressed, formation of heteromeric channels containing all three subunits is preferred over homomeric channels and channels containing only two subunits (5Canessa C.M.

Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (see below). Thus, both the current results and those reported previously support the idea that when all three subunits are co-expressed, channels containing all three subunits are preferentially assembled at a fixed stoichiometry. We conclude from our FRET results that ENaC reconstituted in COS-7 and CHO cells contains at least two of each type of channel subunit supporting a higher ordered stoichiometry over a heterotetrameric arrangement. In complement to our FRET studies, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments testing possible subunit interactions. The Fig. 4, top blot shows a typical Western blot containing whole-cell lysate from cells co-expressing Myc-αENaC + HA-αENaC + eYFP-βENaC + eYFP-γENaC, Myc-βENaC + HA-βENaC + eYFP-αENaC + eYFP-γENaC, and Myc-γENaC + HA-γENaC + eYFP-αENaC + eYFP-βENaC. This blot was probed with anti-Myc antibody. The Fig. 4, bottom blot contains the anti-HA-immunoprecipitant from the respective lysates. This blot was probed with anti-Myc antibody. Anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies did not inappropriately recognize Myc- and HA-tagged ENaC subunits, respectively (not shown). Consistent with the FRET results, these biochemical studies demonstrated that α-, β-, and γENaC all have the capacity to interact with similar subunits. Such findings are consistent with a stoichiometry in which the channel contains at least two of each type of subunit. The electrophysiology experiments reported in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table I demonstrate that the tagged ENaC subunits used for FRET analysis form functional channels in CHO cells. Co-expression of eCFP-αENaC with eYFP-βENaC and eYFP-γENaC (Fig. 5A), and eYFP-αENaC with eCFP-βENaC and eCFP-γENaC (B), resulted in robust amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ currents similar to those described previously by these authors for ENaC reconstituted in CHO cells (16Booth R.E.

Physiol. 2004; 286: F1232-F1238Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that currents were formed by homomeric channels or channels containing only two subunits, tagged subunits were expressed in combinations allowing the formation of only homomeric channel complexes and channels containing at most only two types of subunits. As summarized in Table I, very modest amiloride-sensitive currents were observed when eCFP-αENaC was co-expressed with eYFP-αENaC, and no currents were observed for any other homomeric channel complex or any other heteromeric channel complex containing only two types of ENaC subunits. These results support the idea that functional ENaC contains all three channel subunits and that the tagged channel subunits used in the current study form functional channels. In addition, comparison of patch clamp and FRET results where eCFP-γENaC and eYFP-γENaC are co-expressed in the presence and absence of α- and βENaC demonstrate that formation of the heteromeric channel containing all three subunits is preferred over homomeric channels.Table IHeterologous expression of tagged ENaC in CHO cellscDNAObservationsaNumber of cells with amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents versus total number tested.Current densitybAmiloride-sensitive current at −80 mV. pF, picofarad.pA/pFeCFP-α, eYFP-β, eYFP-γ3/3202 ± 89eCFP-α, eYFP-α2/49 ± 4eCFP-β, eYFP-β0/7eCFP-γ, eYFP-γ0/6eCFP-α, eYFP-β0/4eCFP-γ, eYFP-β0/5eCFP-γ, eYFP-γ0/6a Number of cells with amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents versus total number tested.b Amiloride-sensitive current at −80 mV. pF, picofarad. Open table in a new tab Similar to the results obtained from other approaches used to investigate ENaC stoichiometry, interpretation of the current FRET results is simplified if a single major species of channel is present in the cell. Fig. 6 shows a Western blot probed with the anti-Myc antibody of a native gel containing whole-cell lysate from CHO cells transfected with myc-tagged α-, β-, and γENaC. In Fig. 6, the first lane contains a sample protein that was denatured and reduced by the addition of lithium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol. The last three lanes in Fig. 6 contain sample preparations from three distinct transfections with the proteins in these samples not being denatured or reduced. This blot demonstrates that a single ENaC species with a molecular mass >600 kDa is observed in native conditions when all three subunits are co-expressed. This complex is reduced by dithiothreitol and lithium dodecyl sulfate to monomers, which have molecular masses near 90 kDa. This mass for monomers is similar to what we have reported previously for ENaC subunits expressed in CHO cells (16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several laboratories now have investigated the subunit stoichiometry of ENaC. These studies have lead to the proposal of two possible subunit arrangements. Firsov and colleagues (9Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), Dijkink and colleagues (14Dijkink L Hartog A. van Os C.H. Bindes R.J. Pfluegers Arch. 2002; 444: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and Kosari and colleagues (12Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) propose that ENaC is a tetramer with a subunit stoichiometry of 2α:1β:1γ. This is an attractive arrangement for it parallels the stoichiometry of other cation channels, such as Kv and voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels that have a 4-fold internal symmetry (11MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 23Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 24Catterall W.A. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 500-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, for K+ channels, such as Kir, comprised of subunits having only two transmembrane domains, a feature shared with all ENaC subunits, the established stoichiometry is a tetramer (25Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast to this arrangement, Snyder and colleagues (13Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and Eskandari and colleagues (15Eskandari S. Snyder P.M. Kreman M. Zampighi G.A. Welsh M.J. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27281-27286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) propose that for a cation channel, ENaC has a unique stoichiometry resulting in a higher ordered structure with a possible 3α:3β:3γ arrangement. Interestingly, many of the same methods and experimental approaches were used to provide support for both the 2:1:1 and 3:3:3 stoichiometry. Thus, it has become critical to test ENaC subunit stoichiometry with several independent assays. Here we tested between the two previously proposed models of ENaC subunit stoichiometry using a biophysical approach, distinct from that used previously, dependent on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between ENaC subunits differentially tagged with fluorophores. We find that ENaC contains at least two of each type of subunit. Biochemical results demonstrating that oligomerized ENaC has a molecular mass >600 kDa with subunits alone having masses ∼90 kDa and that each ENaC subunit is capable of interacting with similar subunits also support the idea that the fully complexed channel contains more than four subunits. Our FRET and biochemical findings are most consistent with the sucrose gradient and freeze-fracture results of others suggesting a subunit stoichiometry of 3α:3β:3γ (13Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Eskandari S. Snyder P.M. Kreman M. Zampighi G.A. Welsh M.J. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27281-27286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similar to the earlier studies testing ENaC subunit stoichiometry, our experimental approach has several advantages and limitations. The current experiments were performed in fixed cells under steady-state conditions at equilibrium. Thus, our results were not influenced by possible dynamic rearrangement of channel subunits during the experiment. This becomes particularly important considering the recent findings of others suggesting that in the plasma membrane, ENaC stoichiometry and possibly oligomerization is not fixed (26Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another advantage of using FRET is that this method yields binary results with respect to determining protein interaction, and thus, it simplifies the analysis of whether two ENaC subunits interact. Moreover, FRET directly quantifies protein interactions. These two advantages are in contrast to previous studies (9Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 12Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) of ENaC subunit stoichiometry where changes in wild-type and mutant channel activity in response to blockers and modifying reagents were assessed with electro-physiology, and results were subsequently fitted by idealized equations to establish subunit relationships. These earlier electrophysiology studies, moreover, required the assumption that mutant effects are dominant. Such an assumption was not necessary with the current approach. In contrast to these earlier studies, however, the current investigation cannot definitively determine absolute subunit stoichiometry but rather determines relative subunit levels with our results, suggesting that ENaC contains at least two of each type of subunit. The current study, similar to the earlier electrophysiological probing of ENaC subunit stoichiometry, also assumes that single monomers do not readily form homomeric channels. Two lines of evidence from the current study and many findings by others support this contention. Firstly, our patch results (Table I) demonstrate that the expression of single subunits and co-expression of any two of the three subunits do not readily form functional channels; whereas, co-expression of all three subunits results in abundant functional channels. These observations are consistent with similar findings by others (5Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 7McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Fyfe G.K.

A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Secondly, FRET between differentially tagged but similar monomers (e.g. CFP-γENaC and YFP-γENaC) was not observed. Thus, formation of homomeric channels is rare and does not interfere to a significant extent with our results. Another limitation of the approach used in the current study was that it established subunit stoichiometry for the entire cellular pool of ENaC. This is distinct from the earlier electro-physiology studies that investigate stoichiometry for ENaC in the plasma membrane (9Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 12Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, our biochemical results showing that ENaC reconstituted in CHO and COS-7 cells is defined by a single major species that has a molecular mass of >600 kDa provides support for the idea that when all three ENaC subunits are co-expressed they quickly and readily oligomerize into the final channel complex. These data argue that the stoichiometry of the total cellular pool of channels is representative of those in the membrane. In addition, our electrophysiology results indicated that tagged ENaC subunits used for FRET reconstitute functional channels demonstrating that they can oligomerize into channels that are functional at the plasma membrane. Finally, our results similar to those of others (5Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 9Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L.

A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), support the idea that when all three channel subunits are available, ENaC prefers to oligomerize into a heteromeric complex containing each type of subunit. An alternative interpretation of our results that cannot be excluded with the current data set is that tetrameric ENaC cluster and our results reflect inter-rather than intrachannel subunit FRET. We believe this not to be the case, because we see no consistent channel clustering when assaying ENaC reconstituted in CHO cells at the single channel level (16Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M.

Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Hamilton K.L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Frindt G. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F562-F567PubMed Google Scholar), though, Jovov and colleagues (31Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have suggested that ENaC expressed in planar lipid bilayers and Xenopus laevis oocytes may cluster in an actin-dependent manner to form a channel with distinct biophysical properties. One additional possibility that cannot be fully excluded with the current results but that is not consistent with all of the major findings reported in the current study is that ENaC is a tetramer and that we are observing FRET between similar subunits within tetramers containing only two types of subunits. Although the FRET results cannot exclude this possibility, results from electrophysiology and native gels are not fully consistent with such an arrangement. Thus, the current results add to the understanding of possible subunit arrangements in ENaC and are most consistent with a channel complex containing at least two of each type of subunit.

Res. 1994; 318: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the enzymatic activity of RNR is tightly regulated by the binding of nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP) to allosteric sites in the R1 subunit (1Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, the level of the R2 protein is low in the G1 phase of the cell cycle but accumulates and reaches maximal levels during the S phase, followed by degradation when passing through the G2/M phase (3Eriksson S. Graslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B.

Thus, the activity of RNR is additionally controlled by cell cycle-specific availability of the R2 subunit, whereas the R1 protein level remains relatively constant throughout the cell cycle (3Eriksson S. Graslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cells undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, the supply of dNTPs for DNA repair is, in turn, provided by transcriptional activation of the recently identified R2 homologue, p53R2 (7Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 8Nakano K. Balint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA damage causes p53-dependent induction of p53R2 that complexes with R1 to form active RNR in arrested cells (9Guittet O. Hakansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Graslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The discovery of p53R2 by Tanaka et al. (7Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) provides an explanation of how cells with damaged DNA can acquire a supply of dNTPs for DNA repair when the R2 level is repressed during G1 arrest; they proposed two independent pathways that lead to the supply of dNTPs in mammalian cells. One is mediated by the R2 subunit of RNR in maintaining dNTP pools for DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle. The other involves p53R2 to supply dNTPs for DNA repair when DNA damage occurs (7Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 10Yamaguchi T. Matsuda K. Sagiya Y. Iwadate M. Fujino M.A. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8256-8262PubMed Google Scholar). However, with >50% of human cancers containing mutated or deleted p53, it is unclear whether malignant cells that lack inducible p53R2 are capable of supplying sufficient dNTPs through this pathway for DNA repair. Early studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between the enzymatic activity of RNR and the rate of proliferation of transplanted Novikoff carcinomas (11Elford H.L. Freese M. Passamani E. Morris H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5228-5233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Weber G. Oncology. 1980; 37: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, because of its critical role in the de novo synthesis of DNA, RNR is considered to be a potential target for the development of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. At present, hydroxyurea is the only clinically used RNR inhibitor; however, several more potent and specific inhibitors of RNR have been developed and are currently being evaluated clinically (13Cory J.G.

We have shown previously that the RNR inhibitor Triapine, in conjunction with a variety of DNA-damaging agents, produces synergistic inhibition of transplanted L1210 leukemia cells, presumably by inhibiting the ability of cancer cells to repair drug-induced damage to DNA (18Finch R.A. Liu M. Grill S.P. Rose W.C. Loomis R. Vasquez K.M. Cheng Y. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to fully understand the regulation of RNR and its role in DNA repair, especially for cancer cells with mutated p53. In the present study, we have examined the regulation of the R2 and p53R2 subunits of RNR in response to DNA damage in p53(+/+) and p53(–/–) HCT-116 human colon cancer cell lines. Using the technique of RNA interference, we have successfully established p53(–/–) HCT-116 cell lines stably expressing R2-targeted siRNA that causes post-transcriptional down-regulation of R2. This approach allowed an investigation of the role of the R2 subunit in the sensitivity of neoplastic cells to DNA damage and to the inhibition of RNR. The findings strongly suggest that the R2 subunit of RNR can substitute for the function of p53R2 in providing requisite dNTPs for DNA repair in cells lacking functional p53. Cell Lines and Reagents—p53 wild-type, p53(+/+), and p53-deficient, p53(–/–) HCT116 human colon cancer cells were provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University; Baltimore, MD). Cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Goat polyclonal anti-human p53R2, R2, R1, and PIG3 (p53-induced gene 3) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Plasmid Constructs—The empty vector pCMVneo and pCMV-FLAG-p53R2 containing N-terminal FLAG-tagged p53R2 cDNA (8Nakano K. Balint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Karen Vousden (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The plasmid pCMV/Bsd expressing the blasticidin S resistance marker (19Kimura M. Takatsuki A. Yamaguchi I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo expressing the Zeocin resistance marker (20Mulsant P. Gatignol A. Dalens M. Tiraby G. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1988; 14: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were purchased from Invitrogen. pmU6 (21Das G. Henning D. Wright D. Reddy R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) containing the mouse U6 promoter (–315/1) was provided by Dr. Sydney Altman (Yale University; New Haven, CT). The DNA sequences of the mouse U6 promoter alone and the mouse U6 promoter adjacent upstream to R2-targeted sh/siRNA were amplified by PCR using the pmU6 plasmid as a template. The sh/siRNA sequence contains a 19-nucleotide sense sequence of human R2 cDNA (696–714; GenBank™ accession number BC001886) separated by a nine-nucleotide spacer, TTCTAGAGA, from the 19-nucleotide antisense sequence complementary to the sense sequence and followed by five consecutive Ts as the transcriptional terminator. The PCR primers used are the forward (5′-GATCCGACGCCGCCATCTC-3′) and the reverse (5′-AAAAAGAGGCTACCTATGGTGAACTCTCTAGAAGTTCACCATAGGTAGCCTCAAACAAGGCTTTTCTCCAAGGG-3′ or 5′-AAACAAGGCTTTTCTCCAAGGG-3′). Following amplification, the PCR products were subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen). The orientation and sequence of the inserts were confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The fragments were released from the cloning vector by digestion with MluI and NotI. To create the R2 siRNA expression vector pZZeo-R2-siRNA696 or the empty-vector pZZeomU6, the fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1/Zeo from which the CMV promoter was removed by digestion with MluI and NotI. Stable Transfection—p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells were seeded in T25 flasks for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of the empty vector pCMVneo or pCMV-FLAG-p53R2 with 0.5 μg of pCMV/Bsd using the TransFast transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and plated in a medium containing 8 μg/ml blasticidin S. Following selection for 2 weeks, total populations of blasticidin S-resistant cells were pooled and single-cell sorted into 96-well plates with a growth medium containing 8 μg/ml blasticidin S. Sorted single cells were grown under selection for an additional 2 weeks and expanded into stable cell lines. Cells stably expressing FLAG-p53R2 were screened and identified by reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting analyses. For stable silencing of R2, previous generated stable p53(–/–) HCT116 cell lines were transfected with 6 μg of the empty vector pZZeomU6 or pZZeo-R2-siRNA696 as described above. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and plated in a medium containing 50 μg/ml Zeocin. Resistant colonies of R2-silenced cells were individually isolated and expanded into cell lines. The empty vector-transfected cell lines were total populations of resistant colonies. All stable cell lines used in the studies were derived from early passaged cells stored in liquid nitrogen immediately upon verification of their expression status. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% SDS), boiled, and passed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) to shear DNA. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty micrograms of protein were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody in the blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was subsequently washed with TBST, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h, and washed again. The target protein was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, cells were dissolved in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was cleared and incubated with goat polyclonal anti-R1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with protein A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with constant agitation at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were collected, washed, and resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.006% bromphenol blue, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant cleared from the agarose beads was then collected for analysis by Western blotting. Cell Viability Assay—Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 3,000 cells/well in complete McCoy's medium and incubated for 24 h. Each drug was then added at various concentrations to quadruplicate wells in a final volume of 100 μl of medium. After 72 h of incubation, 20 μlof MTS tetrazolium reagent (CellTiter 96 One Solution; Promega) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of soluble MTS tetrazolium formazan produced by viable cells following drug exposure was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. The sensitivity of cells to each drug was expressed as a percentage of the vehicle-treated control. Quantification of dNTP Levels—Cellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were quantified as described by Sherman and Fyfe (22Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and modified by Gao et al. (23Gao W.Y. Johns D.G. Mitsuya H. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 exponentially growing cells were untreated or treated with 20 μm cisplatin or 0.5 μm Triapine, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then extracted with 60% methanol. The extracts were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris, and frozen at –70 °C until analyzed. The following oligonucleotides were used in the procedure: for dCTP determination, 5′-TTTGTTTGTTTGTTTGTTTGGGCGGTGGAGGCGG-3′; for dTTP determination, 5′-TTATTATTATTATTATTAGGCGGTGGAGGCGG-3′; for dGTP determination, 5′-TTTCTTTCTTTCTTTCTTTCGGCGGTGGAGGCGG-3′; for dATP determination, 5′-AAATAAATAAATAAATAAATGGCGGTGGAGGCGG-3′; and a universal primer, 5′-CCGCCTCCACCGCC-3′. The assay reaction mixture contained 0.05 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 μm template primer, and 2.5 μm [3H]dATP (15 Ci/mmol, for dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP determinations) or 2.5 μm [3H]dTTP (15 Ci/mmol for dATP determination). Five microliters of extract from ∼1 × 105 cells was then added to 45 μl of the reaction mix and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Forty microliters of the mixture was applied onto Whatman DE81 paper, which was washed three times with 5% Na2HPO4 (10 min/wash), rinsed with distilled water and then with 95% ethanol, and dried. The radioactivity on the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into DNA was proportional to the concentration of the dNTP being quantified. DNA Damage by Doxorubicin- and Cisplatin-induced p53R2 and R2 Expression in p53(+/+) and p53(–/–) HCT-116 Cells—The induction of p53R2 in response to DNA damage has been shown to depend upon functional wild-type p53 (7Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 8Nakano K. Balint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of p53 on changes in the expression of p53R2 and R2 following DNA damage, protein levels of these subunits in p53(+/+) and p53(–/–) HCT-116 human colon cancer cells were evaluated by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with doxorubicin, a potent DNA-damaging agent, caused a concentration- and time-dependent induction of p53R2 in p53(+/+) but not in p53(–/–) cells. The other p53-inducible protein measured, PIG3 (24Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar), also exhibited a similar response to doxorubicin. The R2 subunit displayed an expression profile distinct from that of p53R2. Thus, exposure to doxorubicin for 48 h resulted in the disappearance of R2 from p53(+/+) cells, presumably by proteolytic degradation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, treatment of p53(–/–) cells with doxorubicin caused a small but steady increase in R2 without undergoing degradation. Treatment of p53(+/+) cells with cisplatin resulted in a pattern of R2 degradation similar to that caused by doxorubicin (Fig. 1C). The apparent disappearance of the R2 protein caused by cisplatin occurred relatively later at 72 h. These results indicate that R2 protein levels become steadily elevated by DNA damage in p53(–/–) cells in which both p53-dependent p53R2 induction and R2 degradation pathways are defective. Sensitivity of p53(+/+) and p53(–/–) HCT-116 Cells to Doxorubicin and Other Chemotherapeutic Agents—The sensitivity of p53(+/+) and p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells to various concentrations of the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin, etoposide, and cisplatin were compared with a measurement of cytotoxicity by the MTS assay. Vincristine, an anti-microtubule agent that induces p53 (25Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Mimnaugh E.G. Trepel J. Neckers L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4623-4626PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sablina A.A. Chumakov P.M. Levine A.J. Kopnin B.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but does not damage DNA, was also included in the study. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, p53(+/+) cells exhibited greater sensitivity to doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide, and vincristine than did p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells. Thus, a lack of p53 function in p53(–/–) cells resulted in a decrease in the sensitivity to both the DNA-damaging and anti-microtubule agents. This finding implies that the increased level of p53R2 measured in response to DNA damage may not be functional in p53(+/+) HCT-116 cells or may not produce sufficient levels of dNTPs for DNA repair. Because a decrease in sensitivity to microtubule inhibition by vincristine was observed, it is also suggested that p53 activation by the agents employed may predominantly initiate apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest that overrides the repair of DNA. Stable Ectopic Expression of p53R2 in p53(–/–) HCT-116 Cells—To gain information on the role of p53R2 in DNA repair and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, it was important to ascertain the impact of other p53-dependent events such as apoptosis on the survival of HCT-116 cells. To accomplish this goal, stable p53(–/–) HCT-116 cell lines transfected with the p53R2 expression vector and selected for ectopic expression of p53R2 were developed. Western blot analyses of an empty vector (henceforth known as “Vector”) and p53R2 expression vector-transfected stable clones are shown in Fig. 3. A pronounced, relatively slow migrating band of FLAG-tagged p53R2 was detected in clones 6, 8, 11, and 18; the identity of this ectopic expression was further confirmed using an anti-FLAG antibody. All clones, including the Vector, exhibited a low basal level of endogenous p53R2. The levels of ectopic p53R2 protein in p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells were comparable with those of the doxorubicin-induced endogenous p53R2 observed in p53(+/+) HCT-116 cells (Fig. 1). Furthermore, ectopic expression of p53R2 did not cause apparent changes in the levels of R2, suggesting that the expression of both proteins is independently regulated in the absence of DNA damage. Suppression of Basal and DNA Damage-induced Levels of R2 in p53(–/–) HCT-116 Cells by Stable Expression of sh/siRNA That Targets the R2 mRNA Sequence–-Initial studies on ectopic p53R2-expressing p53(–/–) HCT-116 cell lines showed that little or no change in RNR activity or sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents occurred (data not shown). We speculated that the contribution of ectopic p53R2 to total RNR activity may be masked by high and non-degradable levels of endogenous R2 in these cells. Therefore, to reduce the levels of R2 in p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells, we designed a mouse U6 promoter-based expression vector transcribing an sh/siRNA specifically directed against the human R2 mRNA transcript. The Vector as well as p53R2-expressing clone 6 and clone 8 cells were stably transfected with either the mouse U6 promoter-only vector or the R2-sh/siRNA expression vector. Ten to fifteen stable transfected clones were established from each Vector, clone 6, and clone 8 cell line and screened for suppression of R2 levels by Western blot analysis. About 65% of all clones showed a >50% reduction in R2 protein levels (data not shown). An R2-silenced clone corresponding to Vector, clone 6, or clone 8, each exhibiting an 80–90% reduction in the R2 protein, was chosen and is shown in Fig. 4A. The knockdown of R2 did not affect ectopic p53R2 levels, and these clones exhibited no apparent differences in growth rate as compared with their counterparts that have normal levels of the R2 subunit. To determine whether differences occurred in the composition of RNR subunits in ectopic p53R2-expressing R2-silenced cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Native protein from Vector, clone 6, and their corresponding R2-silenced clones was immunoprecipitated with an anti-R1 antibody. Co-immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-p53R2 and anti-R2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, p53R2 co-immunoprecipitated with R1 was detected only in clone 6 but not in Vector cells. This finding indicates that ectopically expressed p53R2 in p53(–/–) cells forms RNR with an endogenous R1 subunit. As expected, R2 co-immunoprecipitated with R1 was observed in both Vector and clone 6 cells. Silencing of R2 in Vector and clone 6 cells caused a decrease in the levels of R2 co-immunoprecipitated with R1. This observation is consistent with a decrease in the total level of R2 in R2-silenced cells detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Because DNA damage caused by doxorubicin up-regulated R2 in p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells (Fig. 1), we determined whether stable knockdown of R2 suppressed the induction of R2 produced by treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Vector, clone 6, and clone 8, as well as their corresponding R2-silenced counterparts, were exposed to 20 μm cisplatin, 0.25 μm doxorubicin, or 10 nm vincristine for 24 h, and the expression of R2 protein was measured by Western blot analysis. Fig. 4C demonstrates that treatment with cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not with vincristine, resulted in the induction of R2 in Vector, clone 6, and clone 8 cells. DNA damage by cisplatin and doxorubicin also caused the induction of R2 in all R2-silenced clones, but the induced levels of R2 were markedly less than that occurring in R2 non-silenced cells. Sensitization of p53(–/–) HCT-116 Cells to the DNA-damaging Agent Cisplatin and the RNR Inhibitors Triapine and Hydroxyurea by Knockdown of the R2 Subunit—The effects of R2 knockdown and ectopic p53R2 expression on the sensitivity of p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells to DNA damage and RNR inhibition was evaluated in Vector, clone 6, clone 8, and their corresponding R2-silenced cells. Following exposure to various concentrations of cisplatin, doxorubicin, Triapine, hydroxyurea, and vincristine for 72 h, cytotoxicity was determined by MTS assays. As shown in Fig. 5A, suppression of R2 levels by stable silencing markedly sensitized Vector cells to cisplatin. In contrast, clone 6 and clone 8 cells with suppressed levels of the R2 subunit exhibited only a slight increase in sensitivity to cisplatin. Without the knockdown of R2, clone 6 and clone 8 cells exhibited similar but slightly more resistance to cisplatin than did Vector cells. The profile of sensitivity to doxorubicin was analogous to that of the sensitivity to cisplatin with these cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the sensitivity of p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells to DNA damage caused by cisplatin and doxorubicin is determined by the levels of R2. However, R2 silencing only produced partial sensitization to DNA damage in cells ectopically expressing p53R2. Stable knockdown of R2 in Vector, clone 6, and clone 8 cells also caused a pronounced increase in sensitivity to the RNR inhibitors Triapine and hydroxyurea (Fig. 5, B and C). In this situation, all clones with suppressed levels of R2 exhibited similar enhanced sensitivity to these agents. Thus, ectopic expression of p53R2 in clones 6 and clone 8 cells did not prevent the cytotoxic effects of the RNR inhibitors when the level of R2 is suppressed. These findings demonstrate that the level of R2 critically determines the sensitivity of p53(–/–) HCT-116 cells to the inhibitors of RNR. In addition, ectopic expression of p53R2 does not appear to compensate for the decreased levels of R2 caused by stable knockdown. No significant differences occurred among Vector, clone 6, clone 8, and their corresponding R2-silenced clones in their sensitivity to the anti-microtubule agent vincristine (Fig. 5D). Suppression of DNA Damage-induced Elevation of dNTPs by Stable Expression of R2-targeted siRNA in p53(–/–) HCT-116 Cells—Changes in dNTP pools associated with R2 silencing and ectopic p53R2 expression were quantified in Vector and clone 6 and their corresponding R2-silenced cells treated with cisplatin. The levels of dNTP were determined in cells expos"

Among these are conformations that appear to correspond to different translocation states of the DNA template and RNA-DNA hybrid. Using α-amanitin as a dynamic probe of the RNA polymerase II mechanism, we show that the most highly poised conformation of the elongation complex, which we interpreted previously as the posttranslocated state, is selectively resistant to inhibition with α-amanitin.

For an adult, a lethal dose may be as little as 3 g of the more than ample mushroom cap (6–16 cm diameter), and symptoms do not develop until 8–24 h after ingestion.

After three decades of study, however, the mode of toxin action has not been resolved. Recently, an x-ray structure was published of α-amanitin soaked into crystals of yeast RNAP II, indicating many of the key atomic contacts that contribute to RNAP II inactivation (4Bushnell D.A. Cramer P. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Multiple strong interactions between α-amanitin and RNAP II are found in the “funnel,” the “cleft,” and the key “bridge α-helix” regions of the Rpb1 subunit, which constitute the RNAP II “secondary pore” or “pore 1,” a solventaccessible channel into the RNAP II active site. Contacts to the bridge helix are on the opposite face from the RNAP II active site, indicating that α-amanitin is unlikely to block catalysis directly. Bound α-amanitin partially occludes the pore, which has been presumed to be a channel for NTP substrate loading (4Bushnell D.A. Cramer P. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 6Gnatt A.L.

Contacts of α-amanitin to the bridge helix are intriguing because bending of the bridge α-helix is thought to drive translocation of the RNA-DNA hybrid (6Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A.

Translocation is essential during each bond addition cycle to move the RNA-DNA hybrid away from the space that must be cleared to load the next substrate NTP into the active site. Because α-amanitin binds to RNAP II with a relatively straight conformation of the bridge helix and because of key contacts between the bridge helix and α-amanitin, Kornberg and co-workers (4Bushnell D.A. Cramer P. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) suggested that α-amanitin may block translocation by blocking bridge helix bending. Several reports in the literature, however, indicate that RNAP II may be capable of forming multiple phosphodiester bonds without dissociation of α-amanitin (10Chafin D.R. Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19114-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Rudd M.D. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21549-21558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), so α-amanitin must allow occasional translocation without dissociation from RNAP II. Recently, we developed a method for transient state kinetic analysis of RNAP II elongation stimulated by transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) and hepatitis δ antigen (HDAg) (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q.

After stalling RNAP II briefly by withholding the next substrate NTP, we demonstrated that the EC fractionated into multiple conformational states with distinct elongation kinetics. We and others showed that RNAP II utilizes a branched kinetic mechanism in which the EC partitions between an active synthesis mode and a pausing mode (12Palangat M. Landick R. J. Mol.

The forward synthesis pathway is intricate, involving NTP substrate-induced fit and multiple conformational states, interpreted as distinct translocation states. Notably, our studies strongly suggest that the incoming substrate NTP first pairs with its cognate DNA template base and then induces translocation of the RNA-DNA hybrid, clearing space to seat the incoming dNMP-NTP base pair in the RNAP II active site for chemistry (7Nedialkov Y.A.

HDAg is a viral RNAP II elongation factor encoded by hepatitis δ virus (HDV) (16Lai M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Taylor J.M.

HDV has an unusual covalently closed circular RNA genome of about 1.7 kilobases in length, which forms a compact, mostly double-stranded RNA rod structure. The HDV rod is maintained and transported as a satellite particle of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and co-infection with HDV and HBV is associated with severe and chronic presentations of human HBV infection. For the purposes of this paper, HDAg was used to facilitate the kinetic analysis of RNAP II elongation so that α-amanitin inhibition could be analyzed more easily (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q.

In this work we present the first study in which α-amanitin is added to RNAP II ECs engaged in active RNA synthesis. We employ a “running start” assay in which a large fraction of RNAP II ECs are committed to the active elongation pathway at the time of inhibitor addition (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Hovde S.L.

Because we utilize rapid quench technology, we can monitor inhibition and elongation with millisecond time resolution, improving the quality of the analysis. Strikingly, we find that the most highly poised conformation of RNAP II ECs is selectively resistant to α-amanitin inhibition. Previously, we identified the most highly poised EC as being posttranslocated, and studies with α-amanitin inhibition appear to confirm this identification. These highly poised ECs are capable of binding NTP substrate and adding a single phosphodiester bond, but they become highly sensitive to α-amanitin inhibition in the subsequent bond addition cycle, indicating that they become incapable of progressing through the next translocation step. Cell Culture, Extracts, and Proteins—HeLa cells were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Extracts of HeLa cell nuclei were prepared as described previously (20Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).

Briefly, 32P-labeled C40 (40-nucleotide RNA ending in a 3′-CMP) RNAP II ECs were formed on MagneSphere (Promega, Madison, WI) metal bead-immobilized templates. Initiation was from the adenovirus major late promoter, which was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-biotinylated upstream primer. Biotinylation allowed immobilization on streptavidin-coated beads. Transcription factors were derived from an extract of HeLa nuclei. Initiation and elongation were in transcription buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12% v/v glycerol, 60 mm KCl (unless otherwise specified), 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.003% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma)) containing 8 mm MgCl2. All steps were at 25 °C. The adenovirus major late promoter template has a modified downstream sequence (1ACTCTCTTCCCCTTCTCTTTCCTTCTCTTCCCTCTCCTCC40AAAGGCCTTT50). The purpose of the 39-nucleotide CT-cassette is to synthesize C40 with addition of 300 μm adenylyl(3′→5′)cytidine dinucleotide, 10 μm dATP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP/reaction (800 Ci/mmol), and 20 μm UTP, bypassing the requirement for addition of ATP and GTP. C40 ECs are washed with 1% Sarkosyl and 0.5 m KCl buffer to dissociate initiation, elongation, pausing, and termination factors contributed by the HeLa extract and then are re-equilibrated with transcription buffer containing 8 mm MgCl2 and 20 μm CTP and UTP. A functionally saturating concentration of HDAg (77 pmol/reaction) is then added. Subsequent steps are performed using the Kintek rapid chemical quench-flow (RQF-3) instrument (Kintek Corporation, Austin, TX), which allows reactions to be started and stopped with millisecond precision. Running Start Protocol—The running start protocol has been described previously (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Hovde S.L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Geiger J.H. Yan H. Burton Z.F. J. Biol.

C40 ECs were advanced to A43 by bench top addition of 100 μm (working concentration) ATP for 60 s. The reaction shown in Fig. 1 was done with the Kintek RQF-3 run in pulse-chase mode. A43 ECs were loaded through the left sample port. α-Amanitin (Sigma) was added through the right sample port. 1 mm GTP (working concentration) was added through the quench syringe. The reaction was stopped in the collection tube, which contained 300 μlof0.5 m EDTA. To analyze the data shown in Fig. 1C, all inhibition curves were adjusted to begin at 50% total ECs so that data from different experiments could be compared more easily. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, the RQF-3 was operated in the standard mode. A43 ECs were loaded through the left sample port. GTP and α-amanitin were combined and loaded through the right sample port. 0.5 m EDTA was added through the quench syringe. ECs were collected with a magnetic particle separator and processed by electrophoresis. Gel bands were quantitated using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager.Fig. 2The A43c (posttranslocated) reaction phase is highly resistant to α-amanitin inhibition.A, reaction protocol. αA, α-amanitin.

Upon stalling, the EC was observed to fractionate between multiple functional states. In kinetic analyses, these states were identified as populations of ECs with different rates of elongation and different responses to NTP substrate. Conformational states were shown not to be an artifact of RNAP II purification but rather to reflect distinct conformations of a dynamic enzyme as it progresses between alternate functional modes (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Hovde S.L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Geiger J.H. Yan H. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Zhang C. Yan H. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50101-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One proof of this point was that different collections of elongation factors reallocated the distribution of RNAP II ECs, so treatments after purification determined EC elongation potential. Because the RNAP II EC fractionates into multiple conformational states at a stall point, we reasoned that these states might have different sensitivities to and/or binding affinities for α-amanitin. We therefore developed a reaction protocol in which α-amanitin was added to the stalled EC either at the same time or just before substrate NTPs (Fig. 1). The purpose of this experimental design was to determine the kinetics for establishing inhibition at different α-amanitin concentrations. 32P-Labeled C40 RNAP II ECs were purified on bead-immobilized templates by Sarkosyl and salt washing. To facilitate elongation, a functionally saturating amount of the RNAP II elongation factor HDAg was added. C40 ECs were then advanced to and stalled at A43 for 60 s by addition of 100 μm ATP. During the stall, samples were injected into the rapid quenchflow apparatus. Rapid mixing combined α-amanitin with ECs, and after a variable incubation, reactions were chased for 0.145 s with 1 mm GTP (0.145 s is sufficient for all ECs on the active elongation pathway to complete the G44 bond). ECs that failed to bind α-amanitin or remained active despite binding toxin were extended to G44 or longer products. This experiment supports the existence of three distinct conformations of the RNAP II EC at the A43 stall position (here designated A43a, A43b, and A43c; Fig. 1C) based on their differential sensitivity to α-amanitin. The A43a phase is the most highly sensitive to inhibition. A43a represents about 5% of total ECs and is most easily observed at 1 and 2 μm α-amanitin. The A43b phase EC appears to represent about 30% of total ECs. For the A43b phase, the rate of inhibition increases as the α-amanitin concentration increases (Fig. 1, C and D), showing that the inhibition of A43b ECs is limited by the rate of α-amanitin binding. By contrast, A43c ECs are highly resistant to α-amanitin inhibition, and the rate of their inactivation does not increase between 10 and 50 μm α-amanitin concentration, indicating that an EC conformational change (A43c → A43b) is required for their inhibition. The A43c EC is highly resistant to α-amanitin binding and/or inactivation for G44 synthesis but becomes highly sensitive to inhibition in the subsequent bond transition from G44 → G45. α-Amanitin Fails to Inhibit the Posttranslocated RNAP II EC—To characterize the α-amanitin-resistant A43c EC, we did the experiments shown in Fig. 2, in which increasing α-amanitin concentrations were combined with stalled A43 ECs at the same time as GTP substrate addition. Inhibition of G44 synthesis was observed at both high (500 μm) and low (5 μm) GTP concentrations, and multiple α-amanitin concentrations were tested from 10 μm to1mm. Rates of G44 synthesis were tracked for up to 1 s. As shown previously, in the absence of α-amanitin, rate curves are notably biphasic up to 0.1 s, with a rapid burst phase (A43c) and a slower phase (here designated A43a + A43b) (7Nedialkov Y.A.

Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50101-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using the experimental format of Fig. 2, the A43a and A43b conformational states of the RNAP II EC cannot be distinguished as they were in the experiments shown in Fig. 1. As expected, the amplitudes of the A43c and A43a + A43b phases are dependent on the GTP substrate concentration. Previously, the more highly poised A43c phase was interpreted as being posttranslocated, and the less highly poised and more GTP-dependent A43a + A43b phase was interpreted as being pretranslocated (7Nedialkov Y.A.

We show here that the highly poised A43c reaction phase is resistant to 1 mm α-amanitin, but the A43a + A43b phase is fully sensitive. Because the highly poised A43c phase of the reaction resists 1 mm α-amanitin even at 5 μm GTP (Fig. 2D), we confirm the existence of an A43c EC conformation that is resistant to inhibition. α-Amanitin binds RNAP II with a much higher affinity than NTP substrates (7Nedialkov Y.A.

Therefore, at a 200-fold molar excess of α-amanitin to GTP (1 mmversus 5 μm), α-amanitin binds susceptible ECs before GTP, yet A43c ECs remain resistant to inhibition. From this analysis, it appears certain that the pretranslocated A43a + A43b phase of the EC is highly sensitive to α-amanitin inhibition, and the posttranslocated A43c phase is highly resistant.

Because we have not observed very long elongation times, we do not observe escape from α-amanitin inhibition. In the previously reported experiments, slow elongation in the presence of α-amanitin may have occurred when the EC briefly escaped suppression (i.e. by breaking the α-amanitinbridge helix contact), translocated, and became resistant through a single bond addition cycle before inhibition was restored. α-Amanitin does not affect the apparent affinity of substrate NTPs for RNAP II (10Chafin D.R.

Based on interactions of α-amanitin with the Rpb1 bridge α-helix, they suggested that α-amanitin may block translocation, which may rely on bridge helix bending (4Bushnell D.A. Cramer P.

Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In our kinetic study, their expectations are fully supported. We find that α-amanitin blocks elongation at the translocation step and that once the RNA-DNA hybrid and DNA template translocate forward, the EC becomes fully resistant to inhibition through addition of a single phosphodiester bond but not through subsequent bonds. In Fig. 3, we present a detailed model of RNAP II elongation in the presence and absence of α-amanitin (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Hovde S.L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Geiger J.H. Yan H. Burton Z.F. J.

Furthermore, pyrophosphate release cannot be the only step blocked by α-amanitin. If the pyrophosphate release step were the only step inhibited, A43a, A43b, and A43c would all be expected to advance to G44 before being inhibited. The 60-s delay at A43 is considered sufficient for all stalled ECs to dissociate pyrophosphate (7Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Hovde S.L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Geiger J.H. Yan H. Burton Z.F. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One of the major observations on which our model relied was that at a transcriptional stall point, the EC fractionated into multiple conformations, interpreted as distinct translocation states. Using α-amanitin as a dynamic probe of the RNAP II mechanism, we substantially support our earlier model and observations. We identify three conformational states of the RNAP II EC with different sensitivities to α-amanitin (A43a, A43b, and A43c) (Fig. 1). The kinetic state herein designated A43a was not detected previously because A43a merged with the state here designated A43b (compare Figs. 1 and 2). The A43c EC strongly resists α-amanitin inhibition (Figs. 1 and 2). We conclude that our previous designation of A43c as the posttranslocated EC is correct and that the posttranslocated state is resistant to α-amanitin inactivation (Fig. 3). The RNAP II Secondary Pore as an Allosteric Site Controlling Transcription—The secondary pore of multisubunit RNAPs appears to be a major allosteric site for the regulation of transcription elongation (23Artsimovitch I. Chu C. Lynch A.S. Landick R. Science. 2003; 302: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), pausing, arrest, RNA cleavage, and transcriptional restart. α-Amanitin penetrates the pore (4Bushnell D.A. Cramer P. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) to regulate translocation and to arrest elongation at or before the translocation step. Microcin J25 is an inhibitor of bacterial RNAPs (24Wilson K.A. Kalkum M. Ottesen J. Yuzenkova J. Chait B.T. Landick R. Muir T. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Am. Chem.

Mukhopadhyay, E. Sineva, and R. Ebright, personal communication. Like α-amanitin, Microcin J25 penetrates the secondary pore of its cognate RNAP to inhibit initiation and elongation. Both α-amanitin and Microcin J25 contain cyclic octapeptide structures. α-Amanitin has a 6-hydroxy-Trp4–Cys8 covalent cross-bridge. The C-terminal peptide tail of Microcin J25 (21 amino acids) forms a lariat protoknot through an N-terminal octapeptide covalent ring (Gly1–Glu8) in imitation of the α-amanitin 6-hydroxy-Trp4–Cys8 cross-bridge. α-Amanitin residues hydroxy-Pro2, -Gly5, and -Gly7 and 6-hydroxy-Trp4 appear to correspond to Microcin J25 Pro7, Gly2, Gly4, and Tyr20. Other peptides that penetrate the RNAP pore include the eukaryotic RNA cleavage and restart factors TFIIS/SII (28Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P.

A recent study found that mutations in B-Raf are present in 66% of human melanomas, highlighting the importance of this gene family (4Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S.

Although the three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic structure of Raf-1 has not been solved, a widely accepted model is that that amino-terminal portion of Raf-1 folds over the carboxyl-terminal half to inhibit its kinase activity (8Cutler Jr., R.E.

Inactive Raf-1 is also bound to several heat shock proteins that may prevent the proteasome-mediated degradation of Raf-1 and facilitate its cytoplasmic localization (14Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H.

When bound to GTP, Ras binds to two domains on Raf-1, the Ras-binding domain comprising amino acids 51-131, and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) comprising amino acids 139-184 (19Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K.

Recently, Morrison's group demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates phosphoserine 259 of Raf-1 to release 14-3-3 and promote Ras-GTP binding to the CRD in growth factor-stimulated cells (22Ory S. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1356-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). By binding to Raf-1, Ras also promotes the plasma membrane localization of Raf-1. Therefore, Ras-GTP facilitates Raf-1 translocation and activation. However, Ras-GTP is not sufficient in most cases to fully activate Raf-1. First, several phosphorylation events occur at the plasma membrane, which facilitate activation presumably after Ras-GTP binds to Raf-1 (23Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events include those mediated by p21-activated kinase (PAK) family kinases at serine-338, and Src family kinases at tyrosine 340 and tyrosine 341 (25King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 26Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11221-11226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites are located in the hinge region of Raf-1 that separates the amino-terminal regulatory domain from the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. Phosphorylation events in the hinge region may promote the dissociation of the inhibitory amino-terminal regulatory domain from the kinase domain. A second reason that Ras-GTP may not fully activate Raf-1 is that Ras-GTP binding to Raf-1 is transient. Indeed, Raf-1 remains at the plasma membrane for several minutes after it dissociates from Ras-GTP. Some investigators suggest that Raf-1 binds to lipids in the plasma membrane, such as phosphatidylserine, via its CRD (28Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that Raf-1 interacts with other plasma membrane proteins besides Ras-GTP. Recently, we determined that the putative zinc transporter CDF-1 was involved in Ras-mediated signal transduction by use of an invertebrate genetic screen (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the specific role of CDF-1, and its mammalian homologue ZnT-1, in Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway activation. We found that both CDF-1 and ZnT-1 bind directly to Raf-1 via its regulatory domain, and that CDF proteins are required for Raf-1 activation. We therefore propose that cation diffusion facilitator proteins facilitate Raf-1 translocation and activation. Plasmid Construction—The plasmid pSP64T-Ha-Rasv12 encoding constitutively active Ha-Ras was a gift from Dr. Deborah Morrison (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). The pXen1-GSTR18, pXen1-ZnT-1, and pXen1-CDF-1 plasmids were previously described (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Wu C. Muslin A.J. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding full-length Raf-1, amino acid residues 1-320 of Raf-1 (NRaf), and amino acid residues 321-648 of Raf-1 (constitutively active Raf-1 or vRaf) were subcloned into a Xenopus expression plasmid, pXen1. GST-CDF-1 mutant constructs and GST-ZnT-1 mutant constructs were created by PCR amplification of the corresponding regions from full-length cdf-1 and ZnT-1 DNA templates, respectively. The PCR products were inserted into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences), a bacterial expression vector containing a tac promoter, downstream and in-frame with the GST moiety. Expression and Purification of GST-CDF-1 and GST-ZnT-1 Mutant Fusion Proteins—GST constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3)-competent cells (Stratagene). The transformed cells were spread onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies were picked and grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C in 5 ml of liquid LB media. The following morning, the bacterial cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh liquid LB media and grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1.0 (600 nm). Protein synthesis was induced in the transformed cells by adding isopropyl-1-thio-α-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Transformed cells were routinely harvested 2 h after isopropyl-1-thio-α-d-galactopyranoside induction. Crude bacterial pellets were resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspended cells were disrupted by sonication on ice in short bursts. Cell lysates were given Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and mixed gently for 30 min to aid solubilization of GST fusion proteins. Cell lysates then were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The GST fusion proteins in the supernatant were purified with glutathione beads. The purified samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Xenopus Oocyte Microinjection and Protein Analysis—To prepare RNA for Xenopus oocyte microinjection, linearized plasmid DNA was purified with phenol/chloroform and then used with the SP6 MESSAGE MACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). RNA production was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocytes were surgically removed from mature female Xenopus laevis and defolliculated by incubation in 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma type I) for 3-4 h. Fully grown stage VI oocytes were isolated and allowed to recover at 19 °C in medium containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, 0.41 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 1 g/liter Ficoll 400, and 10 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Within 18 h of isolation, oocytes were injected with water or 30 ng of RNA encoding full-length Raf-1, NRaf, vRaf, CDF-1, ZnT-1, and GST-R18 in various combinations. Some oocytes were injected with 15 ng of RNA encoding constitutively active Ha-Ras (Ha-Rasv12). The injected oocytes were incubated at 19 °C and scored for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) at multiple time points. GVBD was determined by the presence of a white spot on the animal pole of the Xenopus oocytes. To perform Western blot analysis, oocytes were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and lysates were cleared by low speed centrifugation. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Raf-1(C-12) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Raf-1(H-71) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-14-3-3(K-19) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MEK(C-18) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-myc(9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG(M2) antibody (Sigma), anti-Ras clone Ras10 antibody (Upstate), or anti-phospho-MEK1 (Ser-218/222) (Upstate). Bound antibody was visualized with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and color-developing agents or chemiluminescence-developing agents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, agarose-conjugated anti-myc(9E10) antibody and agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG(M2) antibody were used to pull down ZnT-1 and CDF-1, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were washed four to five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described. ERK activity assays were performed with a p44/42 MAP Kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling, Inc., according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, phospho-ERK immunoprecipitates were obtained from oocyte lysates and incubated with recombinant substrate Elk-1 protein, including 200 μm ATP. Kinase reactions were terminated after a 30-min incubation period, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. Raf-1 kinase assays were performed using an Raf-1 Immunoprecipitation Kinase Cascade assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, Raf-1 immunoprecipitates derived from cell lysates were incubated with recombinant substrate MEK1 and ERK2 proteins, including 500 μm ATP and kinase buffer. After 30 min, 4 μl of the supernatant was transferred to the second-stage component mixture of myelin basic protein substrate and [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Kinase reactions were stopped by transferring the reaction mixture onto phosphocellulose paper. The bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotides—Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides directed against mouse ZnT-1 mRNA and standard control morpholino oligonucleotides were designed by Gene Tools, LLC (Philometh, OR). Each oligonucleotide was produced with a 3′-end fluorescein modification. Morpholino oligonucleotides were introduced into NIH/3T3 cells by use of the Special Delivery System with EPEI according to the manufacturer's protocols (Gene Tools, LLC). After EPEI treatment, cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy. Diffuse fluorescence in the cytosol of treated cells indicated successful cytosolic delivery. Statistical Analysis—All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by one-tailed Student t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. CDF Proteins Act between Ras and Raf-1—We previously showed that CDF proteins positively regulate Ras-mediated signaling in both Xenopus oocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The core enzymatic components of the Ras-ERK signaling cascade include Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and ERK. To determine the precise site of action of CDF proteins, we analyzed meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes stimulated by overexpression of CDF proteins with either constitutively active Ras (Ha-Rasv12) or constitutively active Raf-1 (vRaf). Co-injection of ZnT-1 RNA with Ha-Rasv12 RNA increased the percent of oocytes that underwent germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), a marker of meiotic maturation, compared with oocytes injected with Ha-Rasv12 alone. In addition, ZnT-1 potentiated the ability of Ha-Rasv12 to induce ERK phosphorylation and ERK enzymatic activity as measured by in vitro kinase assay with recombinant Elk-1 protein used as a substrate (Fig. 1A). In contrast, ZnT-1 did not synergize with vRaf to promote GVBD in oocytes and did not potentiate vRaf-stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 1B). Assuming that Ha-Rasv12 and vRaf are maximally active at baseline, one model that is consistent with this data is that ZnT-1 acts downstream of, or parallel to, Ras but upstream of Raf. CDF-1 is the structural homologue of ZnT-1 in C. elegans (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We previously showed that ZnT-1 is able to rescue the cdf-1 mutant phenotype, indicating that ZnT-1 is a functional homologue of CDF-1 (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). RNA encoding CDF-1 was co-injected with RNA encoding Ha-Rasv12 or vRaf into Xenopus oocytes. CDF-1 overexpression potentiated the ability of Ha-Rasv12, but not vRaf, to stimulate GVBD and ERK activation. These results demonstrate that CDF proteins have a conserved function to modulate Ras-mediated signaling (Fig. 1, C and D). CDF Proteins Interact with Raf-1 and 14-3-3—ZnT-1 is considered to be a zinc exporter because of its ability to reduce the intracellular zinc concentration of mammalian cells (31Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). ZnT-1 is localized at the plasma membrane and promotes zinc ion efflux from the cytosol (31Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that C. elegans with loss-of-function mutations in the cdf-1 gene are specifically sensitized to zinc toxicity and that overexpression of CDF-1 can rescue zinc ion inhibition of Ras-mediated signaling (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, CDF-1 may also function as a zinc exporter. By inspection of the amino acid sequence of the core members of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway, Raf-1 is a possible target for CDF protein action due to its cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which binds Zn2+ (28Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This zinc-binding region lies in the amino-terminal half of Raf-1 that is involved in the auto-inhibition of protein kinase activity (8Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Point mutations located in the CRD region increase the biological and enzymatic activity of Raf-1 (32Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, UV irradiation induces oxidation of the thiol groups of cysteine residues in the Raf-1 CRD, which leads to the release of zinc ions and Raf-1 protein kinase activation (33Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, CDF proteins may regulate Ras signaling by binding to and activating Raf-1. To evaluate the ability of CDF proteins to bind to Raf-1, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. RNAs encoding ZnT-1 and Raf-1 were co-injected into Xenopus oocytes. Twenty-four hours after the injections, protein lysates were generated and anti-ZnT-1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-Raf-1 immunoblotting, which showed that ZnT-1 binds to Raf-1. Interestingly, ZnT-1 immunoprecipitates also contained Xenopus 14-3-3 (Fig. 2A). In addition, CDF-1 interacted with endogenous Raf-1 and 14-3-3 in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2B). We next examined whether CDF proteins bind to Ras. RNA encoding myc-tagged ZnT-1 or FLAG-tagged CDF-1 was co-injected with RNA encoding Ha-Rasv12 into Xenopus oocytes. Anti-myc or Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-Ras immunoblotting, and this demonstrated that ZnT-1 and CDF-1 do not bind to either Ha-Rasv12 or wild-type Ha-Ras (Fig. 2C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also demonstrated that CDF-1 does not bind to MEK (Fig. 2B). Raf-1 and 14-3-3 are known to form a complex in vivo. Therefore, it is not clear whether the binding of Raf-1 to CDF proteins was direct or indirect via 14-3-3. We injected RNA encoding GST-R18, a peptide inhibitor of 14-3-3 binding to phosphoserine motifs, into Xenopus oocytes and also co-injected the oocytes with RNA encoding FLAG-tagged CDF-1. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were obtained from oocyte lysates and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Raf-1 and anti-14-3-3 primary antibodies. GST-R18 completely eliminated the interaction between CDF-1 and 14-3-3, but affected CDF-1 binding to Raf-1 to a lesser degree (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that 14-3-3 does not mediate the interaction between CDF-1 and Raf-1. CDF Proteins Potentiate Raf-1 Activity—The results described above suggest that CDF proteins positively regulate Ras signaling by binding to Raf-1. This binding may play a role in Raf-1 activation. Injection of oocytes with RNA encoding wild-type Raf-1, in contrast to constitutively active vRaf, did not effectively promote GVBD in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3A). Similarly, injection of oocytes with RNA encoding ZnT-1 did not promote GVBD. However, co-injection of RNA encoding both wild-type Raf-1 and ZnT-1 resulted in a dramatic increase in GVBD (80-90%) (Fig. 3A). In addition, co-injection of ZnT-1 RNA with wild-type Raf-1 RNA also potentiated the effect of wild-type Raf-1 to induce ERK phosphorylation and ERK enzymatic activity as measured by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether ZnT-1 increases the enzymatic activity of Raf-1, Raf-1 in vitro kinase assays were performed with oocytes that were injected with Raf-1 RNA alone or with Raf-1 RNA and ZnT-1 RNA. Raf-1 kinase assays revealed that the enzymatic activity of Raf-1 was significantly elevated by ZnT-1 co-injection with wild-type Raf-1 (Fig. 3B). To determine whether ZnT-1 is required for Raf-1 activation, antisense morpholino oligonucleotides directed against murine ZnT-1 were employed. ZnT-1 morpholino oligonucleotides inhibited ZnT-1 protein synthesis in oocytes injected with RNA encoding ZnT-1 (Fig. 3C). NIH/3T3 cells were treated with control morpholino oligonucleotides or ZnT-1 morpholino oligonucleotides, serum-starved for 24 h, and then stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum for 10 min. ZnT-1 morpholino oligonucleotide treatment did not decrease Raf-1 protein levels in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 3D). Raf-1 kinase assays demonstrated that Raf-1 enzymatic activity was inhibited in ZnT-1 morpholino oligonucleotide-treated cells compared with control morpholino oligonucleotide-treated cells (Fig. 3D). Carboxyl Termini of CDF Proteins Bind to the Regulatory Domain of Raf-1—Raf-1 is highly conserved within three distinct regions designated CR1, CR2, and CR3. CR1 consists of two domains, a Ras-binding domain and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), both of which bind to Ras (1Magnuson N.S. Beck T. Vahidi H. Hahn H. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 3Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CR2, rich in both serine and threonine, contains several phosphorylation sites. CR1 and CR2 are located within the amino-terminal half of Raf-1, and they negatively regulate the kinase activity located in CR3. In addition, the CRD binds zinc, and release of zinc ions from this domain results in Raf-1 activation (33Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the CRD of Raf-1 interacts with CDF proteins. We injected ZnT-1 RNA together with RNA encoding the amino-terminal half of Raf-1 (amino acids 1-320, NRaf) into Xenopus oocytes and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. NRaf was co-precipitated with ZnT-1 immunocomplexes (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, CDF-1 also co-immunoprecipitated with NRaf, indicating that CDF proteins have a conserved function to regulate Ras signaling by binding to the regulatory region of Raf-1 (Fig. 4B). CDF proteins display high conservation within six predicted transmembrane domains and have four intracellular portions, including the amino terminus, two intracellular loops and the carboxyl terminus (34Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The intracellular loops consist of one very small loop, containing about 20 amino acids, and one larger loop that has a cluster of histidine residues between membrane-spanning domains IV and V. This histidine-rich cluster has been proposed to function as a metal-binding domain. Therefore, it is possible that this region binds to Raf-1. However, there are at least two other possible regions in CDF proteins that may interact with Raf-1, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments. To identify the interacting region of CDF proteins, we made GST-CDF-1 mutant constructs encoding the amino-terminal segment, the carboxyl-terminal segment, or the histidine-rich loop of CDF-1. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione beads (Fig. 5B). The beads were incubated with Xenopus oocyte lysates and were washed extensively. The carboxyl-terminal segment of CDF-1 protein, but not the histidine-rich loop, associated with Raf-1 (Fig. 5C). Next, we investigated whether Raf-1 interacts with ZnT-1 in the homologous region. We made GST constructs encoding the histidine-rich loop or carboxyl-terminal segment of ZnT-1. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione beads (Fig. 5D). GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating beads that contained GST-truncated ZnT-1 fusion proteins with oocyte lysates that contained overexpressed Raf-1. By this method, the carboxyl-terminal segment of ZnT-1, but not the histidine-rich loop, bound to Raf-1 (Fig. 5E). The carboxyl-terminal segment of ZnT-1 also bound to Raf-1 derived from HEK293 cell lysates (data not shown). Our results showed that full-length CDF proteins bind to the regulatory region of Raf-1 and that full-length Raf-1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal segment of CDF proteins. To confirm that the carboxyl-terminal segment of CDF proteins could bind directly to the regulatory region of Raf-1, we incubated glutathione beads containing the carboxyl-terminal segment of CDF-1 or ZnT-1 with oocyte lysates that overexpressed NRaf. These experiments confirmed that the carboxyl-terminal segment of ZnT-1 and CDF-1, but not the histidine-rich loop, associated with NRaf (Fig. 5, F and G). Zinc Ions Inhibit Raf-1 Binding to ZnT-1—The results described above show that CDF proteins bind to the amino-terminal half of Raf-1 and potentiate Raf-1 activity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that increasing the concentration of intracellular zinc ions inhibits Ras-mediated signaling in Xenopus oocytes and in C. elegans (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that increased intracellular zinc concentration blocks the ability of CDF proteins to bind to Raf-1. To test this hypothesis, oocytes were injected with RNA encoding either ZnT-1 or Raf-1. ZnT-1 immunoprecipitates from injected oocyte lysates were incubated with 150 mm ZnSO4 or CoSO4, and then Raf-1-containing oocyte lysate was added to the immunoprecipitates. Addition of zinc but not cobalt to ZnT-1 blocked its ability to bind to Raf-1 in vitro (Fig. 6). Extracellular Zinc Blocks ZnT-1-mediated Raf-1 Activation—ZnT-1 is localized at the plasma membrane and promotes zinc efflux from the cytosol (31Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In the experiments described above, oocytes that have a total intracellular zinc concentration of ∼1 mm (35Nomizu T. Falchuk K.H. Vallee B.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 36: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were bathed in a solution lacking added zinc, resulting in a significant cytosolic-to-extracellular fluid gradient. This gradient may promote ZnT-1-mediated zinc efflux from cells. To determine whether zinc efflux is an important aspect of ZnT-1-mediated Raf-1 activation, we performed experiments where the gradient of Zn2+ between the cytosol and the extracellular solution was reduced. Oocytes were injected with Raf-1 RNA alone or with Raf-1 RNA and ZnT-1 RNA. Oocytes expressing Raf-1 and ZnT-1 were incubated with the oocyte bathing solution in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ZnSO4. Adding Zn2+ to the oocyte bathing solution blocked the ability of ZnT-1 to promote Raf-1 enzymatic activity as measured by in vitro kinase assay with recombinant MEK-1 protein used as a substrate (Fig. 7). Adding Zn2+ to the bathing solution did not affect the protein levels of ZnT-1 or Raf-1 (Fig. 7). The recent determination that activating mutant forms of BRaf are found in the majority of malignant melanomas illustrates the importance of Raf family members in human physiology and disease (4Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A.

Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8328) Google Scholar). Activation of Raf proteins is a complex, multistep process that is incompletely understood, despite intense investigation for more than two decades (1Magnuson N.S. Beck T. Vahidi H. Hahn H. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 3Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this work, we focused on the role of CDF proteins in Raf-1 activation. We previously identified mutations in CDF-1 that suppressed the activated Ras phenotype in a C. elegans genetic screen (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CDF-1 is a homologue of ZnT-1, a zinc transporter that facilitates the export of Zn2+ out of mammalian cells. In our previous work, we demonstrated that overexpression of CDF-1 or ZnT-1 in Xenopus oocytes promoted ERK MAPK activation and meiotic maturation (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that elevated zinc concentration suppressed ERK MAPK activation in Xenopus oocytes (29Bruinsma J.J. Jirakulaporn T. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that increased dietary zinc was lethal in C. elegans that lacked cdf-1 but that zinc did not harm wild-type worms. Our working model based on our initial work was that CDF proteins promoted ERK activation by lowering cytosolic zinc concentrations, although we did not identify the specific target of zinc. In the current work, we analyzed the role of CDF proteins in Ras-ERK signaling by use of Xenopus oocytes and cultured mammalian cells. We demonstrated that CDF proteins could potentiate Ha-RasV12- and wild-type Raf-1-mediated GVBD in oocytes but could not enhance vRaf-mediated GVBD. One model, in which CDF proteins act downstream of Ras but upstream of Raf-1, explains these results. Although we previously hypothesized that CDF proteins activated Ras signaling by lowering intracellular zinc concentrations, an alternative hypothesis was that CDF proteins directly interacted with a component of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade to modify the binding partner's activity. To evaluate this second hypothesis, we tested whether CDF proteins could bind to Ras signaling proteins. Surprisingly, we found that CDF proteins bound to Raf-1 and 14-3-3 but did not bind to Ras or MEK. CDF proteins interacted via their carboxyl-terminal intracellular segments with the amino-terminal half of Raf-1 that regulates kinase activation. Interestingly, we found that addition of zinc to ZnT-1 protein blocked its ability to bind to Raf-1 in vitro. Therefore, it is possible that CDF proteins lower the intracellular zinc concentration, which promotes CDF binding to Raf-1. To test whether the interaction between CDF proteins and Raf-1 was functional, we evaluated Raf-1 kinase activity in cells with increased or decreased CDF protein levels. Overexpression of ZnT-1 in oocytes potentiated Raf-1 activity. Reduction in ZnT-1 protein levels in cultured fibroblasts by use of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, blocked serum-induced Raf-1 activation. Therefore, Raf-1 activity is dependent on ZnT-1 function. However, our results do not distinguish between the possibilities that ZnT-1 regulates Raf-1 activity directly by binding to the amino-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1 or indirectly by lowering intracellular zinc levels. Cytosolic free zinc levels in mammalian cells are likely to be miniscule, because the overwhelming amount of zinc is protein-bound in cells. A recent study in E. coli showed that the concentration of free zinc in bacterial cells was only in the femto-molar range, but the concentration of total zinc was in the millimolar range (36Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The tiny amount of free cytosolic zinc implies that CDF proteins may function as zinc exporters by first removing zinc bound to intracellular carrier proteins. One hypothesis that explains CDF protein-mediated Raf-1 activation is that, after CDF proteins bind to Raf-1, they remove Zn2+ from the Raf-1 CRD and the unbound CRD facilitates the dissociation of the amino-terminal half of Raf-1 from the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. Indeed, mutations in the CRD that putatively block Zn2+ binding result in increased Raf-1 kinase activity (32Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, UV irradiation causes the cysteine residues of the Raf-1 CRD to become modified so that Zn2+ is released and Raf-1 kinase activity is stimulated (33Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additional work is required to determine whether CDF proteins can remove Zn2+ directly from Raf-1. We thank Kerry Kornfeld and Greg Longmore for carefully reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2044016592,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood neoplasm which heterogeneous behavior can be explained by differential regulation of apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) selectively induces rapid apoptosis in most tumor cells and thus represents a promising anticancer agent. We have reported silencing of caspase-8 expression in highly malignant NB cells as a possible mechanism of resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To explore the particular contribution of caspase-8 in such resistance, retroviral-mediated stable caspase-8 expression was induced in the IGR-N91 cells. As a result, sensitivity to TRAIL was fully restored in the caspase-8-complemented cells. TRAIL-induced cell death could be further enhanced by cotreatment of IGR-N91-C8 and SH-EP cells with cycloheximide or subtoxic concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs in a caspase-dependent manner. Sensitization to TRAIL involved enhanced death receptor DR5 expression, activation of Bid and the complete caspases cascade. Interestingly, combined treatments also enhanced the cleavage-mediated inactivation of antiapoptotic molecules, XIAP, Bcl-xL and RIP. Our results show that restoration of active caspase-8 expression in a caspase-8-deficient NB cell line is necessary and sufficient to fully restore TRAIL sensitivity. Moreover, the synergistic effect of drugs and TRAIL results from activation of the caspase cascade via a mitochondrial pathway-mediated amplification loop and from the inactivation of apoptosis inhibitors."

This depends upon the trafficking and processing of gp100 (also known as Pmel17 and the silver protein), a protein of great interest, because it elicits immune responses in melanoma patients but in which specific function(s) remains elusive. In this study, we have used biochemical and immunochemical approaches to more critically assess the synthesis, processing, glycosylation, and trafficking of gp100. We now report that gp100 is processed and sorted in a manner distinct from other melanosomal proteins (such as tyrosinase, Tyrp1 and Dct) and is predominantly delivered directly to immature melanosomes following its rapid processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi. Following its arrival, gp100 is cleaved at the amino and at the carboxyl termini in a series of specific steps that result in the reorganization of immature melanosomes to the fibrillar mature melanosomes.

Melanosomes are proving to be rich resources for several major lines of scientific research. First, because they have such distinctive and readily identifiable structural characteristics, they are ideal models for studying mechanisms involved in the biogenesis of subcellular organelles (1Kushimoto T.

Second, because a number of melanosome-specific proteins are localized in those organelles, the processing and trafficking of those proteins via cellular sorting pathways are other fruitful areas of active research (6Raposo G.

Third, a number of inherited human pigmentary diseases, such as oculocutaneous albinism, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and Griscelli syndrome, involve aberrant processing and/or sorting of proteins to melanosomes or, as in the case of Griscelli syndrome, abnormal movement of melanosomes within melanocytes (9Huizing M.

Finally, all six known melanosomal proteins serve as specific targets of the immune system and are involved in immune responses to malignant melanoma, vitiligo, and other pigment-related diseases (12Touloukian C.

Our group has been involved in several aspects of such research, and one recent project has begun to unveil the proteome of early melanosomes (15Basrur V. Yang F. Kushimoto T. Higashimoto Y.

The transition from the earliest vesicular form, termed a Stage I melanosome, to the fibrillar Stage II melanosome is dependent upon the trafficking and processing of gp100 (also known as Pmel17 and the silver protein) (1Kushimoto T.

An early study by our group (21Kobayashi T. Urabe K. Orlow S.J. Higashi K. Imokawa G. Kwon B.S. Potterf S.B. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29198-29205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shows that, in mouse melanocytes, gp100 is rapidly sorted to Stage I melanosomes without being processed from the trans-Golgi network through the classical endosomal pathway, but the specific steps involved in that process and whether that route is similarly taken by gp100 in human melanocytes have remained unknown.To that end, we have now characterized the processing, glycosylation, and trafficking of the melanosomal protein gp100 in human melanocytes. Taken together, the results showed that gp100 is processed and sorted in a manner distinct from other melanosomal proteins and is predominantly delivered directly to Stage I melanosomes following its processing in the ER and cis-Golgi. Following its delivery there, gp100 was cleaved both at the amino and at the carboxyl termini in a series of specific steps that resulted in the transition of Stage I melanosomes to mature Stage II melanosomes, whereupon melanosomal enzymes were delivered to the organelles and pigment was synthesized.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Antibodies Used—MNT-1 pigmented human melanoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) as described previously (1Kushimoto T.

SK-MEL-28 amelanotic human melanoma cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.8 μg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.The monoclonal antibodies HMB45, HMB50, HMB55, and NKI/beteb, which recognize different domains of gp100 (22Adema G.J. de Boer A.J.

Cancer. 1996; 73: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were purchased from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA). αPEP7h, αPEP1h, and αPEP13h are rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the carboxylterminal regions of human tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1), and gp100, respectively (24Abramowitz J. Chavin W. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1978; 261: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PEP13h is a synthetic peptide (CPIGENSPLLSGQQV-CO2H), which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of human gp100 (residues 647–661). αmSiN is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against peptide mSiN (LEGSRNQDWLGVPR-CO2H), which corresponds to the amino-terminal region of the murine gp100 sequence (residues 24–37) and which cross-reacts with human gp100 because it differs from the mouse sequence by only 1 of the last 10 residues.Antibodies to the organelle markers Bip, EEA1, and GM130 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (whole antibody) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences.Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Cell extracts were prepared using the M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce), and protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The cell extracts were mixed with 2× with Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), supplemented with 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 10 min. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (8–16% Tris-glycine gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were blocked in 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the appropriate first antibodies diluted (as noted in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 5) in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. After five washes with TBS-T, the blots were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse whole antibodies (1:10,000) (Amersham Biosciences) in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. After five further washes with TBS-T, the immunoreactivities of the antibodies were detected using an ECL+ Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Bench-Mark prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen) was used to establish the molecular weight curve for the Western blotting.Fig. 2Immunoabsorption of gp100 by monoclonal antibodies. Extracts of MNT-1 melanoma cells were immunoabsorbed by HMB45 (at 1:1000), HMB50 (at 1:1000), HMB55 (at 1:1000), or NKI/beteb (at 1:1000) or by normal IgG as a control (at 1:1000) as listed across the top of the figure. Proteins that were not absorbed (A) or were immunoabsorbed (B) on those columns were then separated by SDS-PAGE, as detailed for Fig. 1. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, antigens were detected by αPEP13h (at 1:5000), αmSiN (at 1:1250), αPEP1h (at 1:1000), or control IgG (at 1:1000), as noted across the bottom of the figure. Symbols are as defined for Fig. 1. The 26-kDa nonspecific minor band represents the small chain of IgG that elutes from the column in most cases; in some lanes the 26-kDa band derived from gp100 is also seen at that position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Melanosomal protein stability. MNT-1 melanoma cells were cultured in the presence of cycloheximide for various times as noted, and the treated cells were then solubilized and analyzed by Western blot.

After continuous mixing for 2 h at 4 °C, 35 μl of protein G-Sepharose suspended in M-PER was added and was subjected to further mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, and the supernatants were kept as the unbound fraction. The pellets were then washed six times with 800 μl of M-PER. Finally, the absorbed proteins were eluted with 45 μl of Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer with 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Each supernatant (20 μg of protein in 20 μl) was separated using 8–16% Tris-glycine SDS gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (αPEP13h, αmSiN, αPEP1h, and normal rabbit serum as a control) were used to detect gp100 precipitated with mouse monoclonal antibodies against gp100 as detailed in the legend to Fig. 3. The detection method was the same as described above.Fig. 3Pulse-chase metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of gp100. MNT-1 melanoma cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and were then chased for various periods of time (hours), as noted above each lane. Solubilized extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies (all at 1:1000), separated by SDS-PAGE as detailed for Fig. 1, and visualized by autoradiography. Symbols are as defined for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as follows. MNT-1 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes using complete medium (1Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Prior to labeling, the cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were labeled for 30 min with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine mixture (Redivue Promix, Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Following the labeling period, the isotope-supplemented medium was removed, and complete medium containing 1 mm unlabeled methionine was added. After suitable chase periods (as detailed in the legend to Fig. 3), the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized by adding 1 ml of M-PER with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The 35S-labeled cell lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and then incubated with 15 μlof rabbit polyclonal antibody (αPEP7h, αPEP13h, αmSiN, or normal rabbit serum as a control) or 15 μl of mouse monoclonal antibody (HMB45, HMB50, HMB55, or NKI/beteb at the dilutions noted in the figure legends) for 2 h at 4 °C with mixing. The immune complexes were separated by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow for 2 h at 4 °C and were further washed twice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% deoxycholic acid, 1.0% Triton X-100 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture), twice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 2 m NaCl, and then twice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were separated on 8–16% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After the electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed in a storage phosphor screen and then scanned with a STORM PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with the ImageQuant program.Glycosidase Digestions—Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and peptide: N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). MNT-1 cell lysates (5 μg) extracted with M-PER were subjected to each glycosidase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were digested with 1250 units of Endo H or of PNGaseF for 3 h at 37 °C. After the digestion reaction, 1 μg of each cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoreactive bands were detected by Western blotting using antibodies as indicated in the legend to Fig, 5.Confocal Immunohistochemistry—For confocal immunohistochemistry, cells were plated in 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) 24 or 48 h before each experiment and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature (for GM130 and HMB45) or with 100% methanol for 15 min at 4 °C (for Bip and EEA1). The cells were then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum and 5% normal horse serum for 1 h at room temperature as a blocking step. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum and 5% normal horse serum and a mixture of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C at the dilutions noted in the legend to Fig. 6. This was followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies, i.e. goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Texas Red (dilution, 1:100, Vector, Burlingame, CA) or horse anti-mouse labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (dilution, 1:100, Vector). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector). All preparations were examined with a confocal microscope (model LSM510, Zeiss) equipped with helium-neon, argon-krypton, and UV laser sources. Controls included sections stained as detailed above but omitting the first antibody.Fig. 6Subcellular localization of melanosomal proteins in melanoma cells. MNT-1 (top row) and SK-MEL-28 (bottom row) melanoma cells were fixed for immunohistochemistry and stained with αPEP13h (at 1:20) and detected by Texas Red (red) as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The cells were also stained with markers of endoplasmic reticulum (Bip, at 1:10), Golgi (GM130, at 1:10), early endosomes (EEA1, at 1:40), and Stage II melanosomes (HMB45, at 1:10) detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate (green). Yellow indicates colocalization of the signals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RESULTSExpression of gp100 in Pigmented and in Unpigmented Melanoma Cells—Based on its predicted amino acid sequence, gp100 is initially translated as a native protein of ∼70 kDa; it contains a signal sequence at its amino terminus and thus is expected to be immediately taken up into the ER. gp100 has five potential N-glycosylation sites (at positions 81, 106, 111, 321, and 568), and because of its importance as a melanoma-specific antigen, a number of monoclonal antibodies have been generated in mice that recognize it at various epitopes, namely HMB45, HMB50, HMB55, and NKI/beteb (26Adema G.J. de Boer A.J. Hullenaar R.V. Benijn M. Ruiter D.J. Vogel A.M. Figdor C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1579-1585PubMed Google Scholar), although the specific epitopes recognized by those monoclonals have not been adequately defined. As additional probes to study its synthesis and processing, we have produced antibodies in rabbits against peptides that correspond to the amino and carboxyl termini of gp100; these antibodies are termed αmSiN (21Kobayashi T. Urabe K. Orlow S.J. Higashi K. Imokawa G. Kwon B.S. Potterf S.B. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29198-29205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and αPEP13h (27Virador V. Matsunaga N. Matsunaga J. Valencia J. Oldham R.J. Kameyama K. Peck G.L. Ferrans V.J. Vieira W.D. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Hearing V.J. Pigment Cell Res. 2001; 14: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), respectively. We were initially interested in characterizing the expression, processing, and subcellular distribution of gp100 in several pigmented and unpigmented human melanoma cell lines and at the same time in mapping the various epitopes of gp100 recognized by those different monoclonal antibodies.We initially compared the expression profile of gp100 in a pigmented melanoma cell line, MNT-1, and in a number of amelanotic melanoma cell lines, including SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 1). SP1 keratinocytes were used as a negative control. αPEP13h recognized two major specific bands (100 kDa and 26 kDa) in MNT-1 cells, indicating that the carboxyl terminus of gp100 is present in those two bands. αPEP13h also detected a minor band at ∼70 kDa. αmSiN reacted specifically with the full-length 100-kDa protein band and also with 45-, 30-, 26-, and 10-kDa fragments, which contain the amino terminus of the protein (the 65-kDa fragment is nonspecific because it is also recognized in SP1 keratinocytes). Thus, both αPEP13h and αmSiN recognize the full-length 100-kDa form of gp100 in MNT-1 cells, and both antibodies also detect 26-kDa fragments, showing that gp100 is cleaved at a point about 26 kDa from its amino and its carboxyl termini. Interestingly, SK-MEL-28 amelanotic melanoma cells also express gp100, although their processing and PAGE banding patterns are quite distinct from those in MNT-1 cells (e.g. only faint traces of the 26-kDa bands were seen in those cells). Several other amelanotic melanoma cell lines did not express levels of gp100 detectable by Western blot (data not shown).In contrast, the monoclonal antibody HMB45 reacted only with a low molecular weight heterogeneous fragment of gp100 that has an approximate size of 34–38 kDa. MNT-1 cells reacted positively with HMB45 as did SK-MEL-28 cells at a reduced level, but reactivity with HMB45 was completely negative in SP1 keratinocytes (and in the other amelanotic melanoma cell lines tested). HMB50, HMB55, and NKI/beteb do not work well in the Western blot format, although they function well in immunohistochemistry and in immunoprecipitation formats, as discussed below.For comparison, we also examined the expression of other melanosomal proteins in those same cell lines. Tyrosinase (Fig. 1), TYRP1, and MART1 (not shown) were strongly positive in the highly pigmented MNT-1 cells, as reported previously (1Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and DCT was faintly positive in all melanoma cell lines tested (data not shown). The expression of tyrosinase and MART1 was positive in the amelanotic SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, but tyrosinase levels in those cells are much reduced and are only partially glycosylated, as recently detailed (28Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).To further determine the epitope map and reactivity patterns of the various antibodies to gp100, we performed immunodepletion studies in which extracts of MNT-1 cells were purified over immunoaffinity columns containing HMB45, HMB50, HMB55, or NKI/beteb (or IgG as a control). The flow-through (unabsorbed) and the absorbed fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and were subsequently reacted in Western blots with αPEP13h (which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of gp100), αmSiN, αPEP1h, or control IgG. HMB45 has been reported previously not to work well in immunoprecipitation protocols (22Adema G.J. de Boer A.J. Vogel A.M. Loenen W.A.M. Figdor C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that was indeed confirmed in this study, because all gp100 detectable by αPEP13h or by HMB45 was found in the flow-through (unabsorbed) fraction of the HMB45-treated sample and in the control IgG as well (Fig. 2A). gp100 was significantly absorbed by HMB50, HMB55, and NKI/beteb, as shown by the reduced levels of gp100 present in the flow-through fraction unabsorbed by those antibodies.αPEP13h readily detected both the full-length 100-kDa and the 26-kDa fragment of gp100 in samples absorbed by HMB50, HMB5"

Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy together with sucrose gradient fractionation show co-localization of Kidins220 and lipid raft-associated proteins. In addition, cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl-β-cyclodextrin dramatically alters Kidins220 localization and detergent solubility. By studying the putative involvement of lipid rafts in PKD activation and signaling we have found that active PKD partitions in lipid raft fractions after sucrose gradient centrifugation and that green fluorescent protein-PKD translocates to lipid raft microdomains at the plasma membrane after phorbol ester treatment. Strikingly, lipid rafts disruption by methyl-β-cyclodextrin delays green fluorescent protein-PKD translocation, as determined by live cell confocal microscopy, and activates PKD, increasing Kidins220 phosphorylation on Ser919 by a mechanism involving PKCϵ and the small soluble tyrosine kinase Src.

Its primary amino acid sequence contains several structural and functional domains and diverse motifs that may link this protein to membranes, cytoskeleton, and different signaling pathways. The N terminus bears 11 ankyrin repeats that are likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions specially with the cytoskeleton (3Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biol.

Although this translocation process has been well documented for PKD, very little is known regarding its plasma membrane microdomain distribution. In eukaryotic cells, the plasma membrane structure and composition are not homogeneous and present dynamic structures termed lipid rafts that are rich in low density lipids, such as cholesterol and sphingolipids (42Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 43Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Caveolae represent a sub-population of lipid rafts characteristically containing the scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (44Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 45Anderson R.G.W. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 46van Deurs B. Roepstorff K. Hommelgaard A.M. Sandvig K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 92-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All lipid rafts including caveolae typically partition into low buoyant density detergentresistant membranes that float during sucrose gradient centrifugation (47Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). The lipid rafts contribute to keep surface molecules on specific locations of the cell membrane, concentrating a number of signaling molecules, including transmembrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptors as well as intracellular signaling intermediates, while excluding many others (44Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 45Anderson R.G.W. Jacobson K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Rafts are believed to function as platforms specialized for signaling where, for example, kinases and their substrates could be in close proximity, facilitating signal transduction events to occur rapidly upon the appropriate signal (49Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Kidins220, which is predominantly expressed in neuroendocrine and neural tissues, is found concentrated in certain plasma membrane subdomains reminiscent of lipid rafts in PC12 cells (1Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J.P. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we report that Kidins220 is present in lipid rafts in brain and cells of nervous origin such as PC12 cells and primary neurons and that PKD translocates to these membrane microdomains after phorbol ester stimulation. Importantly, in cells where lipid rafts have been disrupted, PKD translocation is delayed, indicating that lipid microdomains are sites facilitating the recruitment of PKD to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, lipid raft integrity is important for keeping PKD activity at low levels since cholesterol depletion induces a significant increase on PKD autophosphorylation and Kidins220 phosphorylation by molecular mechanisms that involve PKCϵ and the small tyrosine kinase Src. Collectively, this study integrates spatial and temporal data on PKD activation, translocation, and signaling to its substrate Kidins220 and defines the importance of lipid rafts in all these events. Materials—Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCDX), filipin, poly-l-lysine, and laminin were from Sigma. GF I (GF 109203X or bisindolylmaleimide I) and PP2 were both purchased from Calbiochem. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal rabbit antisera against Kidins220 and phospho-Kidins220-Ser919 were prepared as described before (1Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J.P. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J.

Anti-Kidins220 monoclonal antibody was purified from supernatants of a hybridoma provided by the Cancer Research UK monoclonal antibody service. This hybridoma was obtained using as antigen a glutathione S-transferase-C terminus fusion protein of Kidins220 (comprising the last cytoplasmic C-terminal sequence of Kidins220, from threonine 1423 to leucine 1763). Phosphospecific antibodies recognizing Ser916 and Ser748 (20Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

The mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-Thy-1 and antisynaptotagmin I were purchased from AbCam (Cambridge, UK) and Calbiochem, respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKD/PKCμ, PKCϵ, Src, and caveolin-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal antibody against PKD/PKCμ used for immunoprecipitation and the phosphospecific antibody recognizing PKD-Ser744/Ser748 (21Waldron R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotech Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the phosphospecific polyclonal antibody recognizing PKD/PKCμ phospho-Tyr463 (23Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. A. Toker and Dr. P. Storz (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Texas Red- and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies as well as Texas Red-cholera toxin B were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies and ECL were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were from standard suppliers or as indicated in the text. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary dissociated E19 rat cortical primary cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortices of 19-day-old fetal Wistar rats as described (50Brewer G. Cotman C. Brain Res. 1989; 494: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, meninges were removed from the embryonic brains, and cortices were dissected. Tissue was resuspended in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, 0.6% glucose, 16 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were counted and seeded on laminin (4 μg/ml)- and poly-lysine (10 μg/ml)-covered glasses in 35-mm dishes at a final concentration of 5 × 105 and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were used after 2–8 days in culture, as indicated in the text. Under these conditions >95% of the cells in culture were neurons as assessed by immunostaining with polyclonal antibodies against the neuronal-specific enolase and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (not shown). PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 7.5% horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When required, cells were treated with NGF (75 ng/ml) for 2 days, GF I (3.5 μm), or PP2 (50 μm) for 30 min, MCDX (15 mm) or filipin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h, or PDBu (200 nm) for different times as specified in the text. For transfection, cells were seeded at 50–60% confluence on poly-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips. Cells were transfected in serum-free medium 24 h after plating by using 1 μg of DNA and 2.5 μl of LipofectAMINE2000® reagent (Invitrogen) per 35-mm dish according to the manufacturer specifications and, 24 h later cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. The cDNA containing wild-type GFP-PKD and a translocation-deficient mutant GFP-PKD-P287G have been previously described (38Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Preparation of Synaptosomes from Rat Brain—Synaptosomal fractions were obtained from P15 Wistar rats by differential centrifugation of brain homogenates according to Gray and Whittaker (51Gray E. Whittaker V. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Whole brains were placed in 40 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 supplemented with sucrose (0.32 m) and homogenized in a Potter homogenizer in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm in a SS34 rotor for 5 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at 11,000 rpm in a JA20 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The crude synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose and loaded onto a Ficoll gradient (4 ml of 13%, 1 ml of 9%, and 4 ml of 5% Ficoll prepared in 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 22,500 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 35 min at 4 °C. Bands at the interface between 5 and 9% Ficoll were isolated, diluted in sodium buffer (10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C and maximal speed for 12 min. The synaptosomal fractions were stored in the presence of protease inhibitors at a protein concentration of 1.5–2.0 mg/ml in sodium buffer. Isolation of Lipid Rafts—Lipid rafts were isolated running sucrose gradients as described (52Herreros J. Ng T. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2947-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, proliferating PC12 cells (seeded at 15 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) or 10 × 106 primary E19 rat cortical neurons cultured for 8 days were used. Cells were put in serum-free medium and pretreated or not for 1 h at 37 °C with 15 mm MCDX. Trypan blue staining showed that MCDX treatment did not affect cell viability. Synaptosomal preparations were resuspended in sodium buffer and treated or not for 1 h at 37 °C with 15 mm MCDX and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C and maximal speed for 30 min. Cells or synaptosome pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 1 or 0.25% Triton X-100 (depending on the protein subjected to study, as specified in the text) solubilization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 or 0.25% TritonX-100) plus inhibitors and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. Sucrose concentration of the lysates was adjusted to 41% before they were overlaid with 8.5 ml of 35% sucrose and 2.5 ml of 16% sucrose prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. For lipid rafts isolation, tubes were ultracentrifuged (35,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor, 18 h, 4 °C), and 10 fractions were collected from each gradient (from the top to the bottom, fractions 1–10), precipitated with 6.5% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, washed with 80% cold acetone, dissolved, and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—PC12 and 8-day rat primary cortical neurons were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C, and lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. PKD was immunoprecipitated as described previously (1Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J.P. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, total cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or different fractions of cells or synaptosomes were boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer (200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 10% CH3OH) to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% lowfat milk powder and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the different primary antibodies in blocking solution. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase as before, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. In Vivo Cell Imaging, Immunofluorescence, and Confocal Microscopy—For live cell imaging cells were seeded on bottom glass 35-mm dishes coated with poly-lysine (MatTek Corp.) and placed inside a chamber at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere on an inverted confocal microscope. For immunofluorescence cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 1 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C followed by methanol for 5 min at -20 °C. After blocking (1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min) cells were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was detected with the suitable fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody before mounting in slides with Mowiol 4–88 (Harco). Before fixation and visualization some cells were preincubated with Texas Red-conjugated cholera-toxin B (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, which binds to the ganglioside type 1 (GM1) on the cell surface. All confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 inverted confocal laser microscope with a 63× Plan-Apochromatic oil immersion objective and were normalized for each color separately. GFP fluorescence was excited with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm. Confocal images presented are single sections of a series or two-dimensional maximal projections of a z-series through the cell depth, as specified in the text and figure legends. Images were processed for presentation with Leica Confocal Software Lite version and Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc, CA). Kidins220 Extensively Localizes at Lipid Rafts in Rat PC12 Cells and Primary Cultures of Cortical Neurons—Kidins220 is an integral membrane protein that was originally identified in PC12 cells, where it presents an intense discontinuous punctate staining at the plasma membrane and is concentrated at the tip of extending neurites in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (1Iglesias T.

Because Kidins220 is enriched in brain and in the cells of nervous origin (1Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J.P. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to investigate the cellular distribution of Kidins220 in E19 rat primary cortical neurons in culture and compare it to the one first observed in PC12 cells. Using anti-Kidins220 antibodies we examined Kidins220 localization by immunofluorescence in both cell types. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunostaining of cortical primary neurons revealed the presence of Kidins220 in the cell body and in the neuronal extensions, where it concentrated at the tip and showed a very similar punctate pattern to the one observed in NGF-treated PC12 cells, brighter in certain subdomains of the plasma membrane (see the arrows in Fig. 1A). Some plasma membrane components, including various GPI-anchored proteins, transmembrane proteins, and signaling molecules, together with cholesterol and other sphingolipids accumulate in microdomains of the plasma membrane that are resistant to non-ionic detergent solubilization, known as detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains or lipid rafts (44Harder T.

https://openalex.org/W1982224515,"The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CDC34 (UBC3) is linked to cell cycle progression in diverse cell types; however, its role in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis is unclear. Here, we show that CDC34 is highly expressed in patient MM cells and MM cell lines versus normal cells. Blocking CDC34 using a dominant-negative strategy enhances the anti-MM activity of Bortezomib/Proteasome inhibitor PS-341, dexamethasone (Dex) and 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2). The expression of wild-type CDC34 reduces Dex-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. Moreover, inhibition of CDC34 enzymatic activity abrogates interleukin-6-induced protection against Dex-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings provide evidence that (1) CDC34 expression is associated with growth and survival of MM cells and (2) blocking CDC34 activity not only enhances anti-MM activity of Bortezomib and 2ME2 but also overcomes IL-6-triggered Dex-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1987049707,"Although initially described as a cytosolic scaffolding protein, YAP (Yes-associated protein of 65 kDa) is known to associate with multiple transcription factors in the nucleus. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we show that YAP interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U (hnRNP U), an RNA- and DNA-binding protein enriched in the nuclear matrix that also plays a role in the regulation of gene expression. hnRNP U interacts specifically with the proline-rich amino terminus of YAP, a region of YAP that is not found in the related protein TAZ. Although hnRNP U and YAP localize to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, YAP does not translocate to the nucleus in an hnRNP U-dependent manner. Furthermore, hnRNP U and YAP only interact in the nucleus, suggesting that the association between the two proteins is regulated. Co-expression of hnRNP U attenuates the ability of YAP to increase the activity of a p73-driven Bax-luciferase reporter plasmid. In contrast, hnRNP U has no effect when co-expressed with a truncated YAP protein lacking the hnRNP U-binding site. Because YAP is distinguished from the homologue TAZ by its proline-rich amino terminus, the YAP-hnRNP U interaction may uniquely regulate the nuclear function(s) of YAP. The YAP-hnRNP U interaction provides another mechanism of YAP transcriptional regulation.

Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 2Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, transcription factors may associate with a large number of protein co-factors that either enhance or repress transcriptional activity in a cell type-specific context (4Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 5Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These associations function in part to localize transcription factors to specific protein complexes and can recruit proteins of the basal transcription machinery. In addition, specific protein interactions can modulate the localization of transcription factors in the nucleus or cytoplasm and play an important role in the integration of signal transduction cues. One protein recently shown to function as a modulator of multiple transcription factors in a variety of cell types is YAP (Yes-associated protein of 65 kDa). YAP is a modular adaptor protein with multiple protein interaction domains that was originally isolated based on its ability to bind the SH3 domain of the Src family kinase c-Yes (6Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its SH3-binding motif, YAP contains a proline-rich amino terminus, a 14-3-3-binding site, one (YAP1) or two (YAP2) WW domains (hereafter, YAP will refer to YAP1), a coiled-coil, and a PDZ interaction motif at the extreme COOH terminus (7Komuro A.

Although initially thought to play a role in the anchoring and or targeting of c-Yes to specific subcellular compartments, many studies suggest that YAP plays a role in the regulation of gene expression through its ability to associate with a broad array of transcription factors (7Komuro A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These interactions typically involve either of the two YAP WW domains that associate directly with PPxY motifs within the transcription factors, but other mechanisms of interaction also occur (7Komuro A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In a two-hybrid screen, YAP was found to associate with PEBP2α (polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2), a transcription factor important for hematopoiesis and osteogenesis (14Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 15Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). In vivo, YAP enhanced the transcriptional activity of PEBP2α, and this enhancement required an association of the YAP WW domain with the PPxY motif of the transcription factor. Likewise, overexpression of YAP increased the transcriptional activity of the TEAD/TEF family of transcription factors and endogenous YAP co-purified with overexpressed TEAD-2 in a cell culture model system (12Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The long forms of p73, homologues of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, also interact with YAP via its WW domain (10Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 13Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15164-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Like p53, p73 proteins can induce several anti-proliferative effects, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation (16Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Melino G. Wang J.Y.

Melino G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying p73 protein stability are distinct from p53; the two proteins differentially regulate gene expression (20Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fontemaggi G. Kela I. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Krishnamurthy J. Strano S. Sacchi A. Givol D. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43359-43368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and have distinct binding partners (22Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sasaki Y. Mita H. Toyota M. Ishida S. Morimoto I. Yamashita T. Tanaka T. Imai K. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8145-8152PubMed Google Scholar). Co-expression of YAP enhanced transcription of Bax and mdm2 by p73α and p73β but had no effect on p53-mediated gene transcription (13Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15164-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although YAP can modulate the activity of multiple transcription factors, several studies suggest that it localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm. For example, in airway epithelial cells, YAP associates via its PDZ interaction motif with EBP50 (ezrin/radixin/moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa), a scaffolding protein localized predominantly to the apical membrane (8Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). YAP also associates with cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins (10Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) involved in multiple cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis (for reviews see Refs. 24Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar and 25Takahashi Y. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binds phosphorylated serine or threonine residues on target proteins, often sequestering the protein or maintaining it in an inactive state (26Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 27Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In the case of YAP, binding by 14-3-3 sequesters YAP in the cytoplasm and prevents it from entering the nucleus (10Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3-binding site on YAP is also a phosphorylation site for Akt; phosphorylation by Akt attenuates p73-mediated transcription by YAP in U2OS cells (10Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). YAP interacts with multiple proteins in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and is an adaptor protein with many potential functions in vivo. Many of these functions are likely shared by a paralogue of YAP called TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif). The two human proteins are ∼45% identical and share many functional sequence domains and motifs (28Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). TAZ also binds 14-3-3 and was originally identified in a screen for novel 14-3-3-binding proteins (28Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In addition, TAZ and YAP both bind E3KARP (NHE3kinase Aregulatory protein), a closely related member of the EBP50 family (29Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the predicted ligand-binding sequence of the TAZ WW domain is similar to that of the YAP WW domain, and TAZ also functions to enhance the transcriptional activity of PEBP2α in vivo (28Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Thus the two proteins likely share many overlapping functions. Although the two proteins differ in their ability to bind c-Yes (28Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), another difference between YAP and TAZ is that YAP contains a proline-rich amino terminus that is not found in TAZ. To identify protein interactions in this region, we used fusion proteins made to the first 57 amino acid sequence of human YAP in biochemical screens to identify novel YAP-associated proteins. We find that the proline-rich amino terminus of YAP associates with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP U, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; CTF, COOH-terminal fragment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP U, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; CTF, COOH-terminal fragment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein. a protein that is enriched in the nuclear matrix and has been shown to regulate gene transcription (30Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 31Eggert H. Schulz M. Fackelmayer F.O. Renkawitz R. Eggert M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 1984; 4: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). hnRNP U binds conserved AT-rich regions within the genome called scaffold attachment regions, which allow chromatin to attach to the nuclear matrix and form ∼5–200-kb loops (34Jackson D.A. Dickinson P. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Indeed, hnRNP U was identified independently as a protein that was capable of binding these scaffold attachment region elements and named scaffold attachment factor A (35von Kries J.P. Buck F. Stratling W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interaction of YAP and hnRNP U expands the association of YAP with nuclear proteins beyond those that function as transcription factors and provides an alternate mechanism whereby YAP may modulate gene expression in cells. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—The cells were maintained as described previously (8Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J.

Antibodies and Reagents—YAP antisera were generated in rabbits using GST-tagged human YAP(274–454) as immunogen. Recombinant fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction of bacterial lysates on glutathione agarose beads, and the purified protein was injected into two New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Princeton, NJ). Serum (NC252) was further purified on DEAE ion exchange and GST-YAP(274–454) affinity columns and used for Western blotting (1:1000), immunofluorescence (1:500), and immunoprecipitation (2 μg). The anti-hnRNP U monoclonal antibody 3G6 was a gift from Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania) and used at 1:20000 dilution. All other antisera were obtained from commercial sources. The pGL3-Bax luciferase construct was a gift from Dr. Giovanni Blandino from the Regina Elena Cancer Institute (Rome, Italy). A β-actin-LacZ plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under control of human β-actin promoter was a gift from Dr. Keith Yamamoto (University of San Francisco), and the triple-tandem GFP (3XGFP) vector was a gift from Dr. Yuri Lazebnik (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). cDNAs encoding full-length human YAP and full-length human hnRNP U were generated by PCR and cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pCMV.HA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmids containing the amino terminus (amino acids 1–57) and WW1 domain (amino acids 162–217) of human YAP fused to GST were generated by PCR and cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pGEX.5X2 (Amersham Biosciences). cDNAs encoding fragments of YAP for expression in mammalian cells were generated by PCR and cloned into the BamHI site of the 3XGFP plasmid. The sequences of all plasmids were verified at the University of North Carolina sequencing facility. Affinity Purification of YAP-interacting Proteins and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—The expression of GST, GST-YAP(1–57), and GST-YAP(162–217) fusion proteins was induced for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C in terrific broth. The proteins were harvested by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg of leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml benzamidine. The soluble fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and initial pull-down assays were performed using 20 μg of purified fusion protein. The cell lysates were prepared from a single 100-mm dish of 16HBE14o- cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h in serum-free and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and the lysates were diluted 1:5 in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The assays were performed as described previously (8Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37Mohler P.J. Kultgen P.L. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 383-394PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins bound to GST, GST-YAP(1–57), and GST-YAP(162–217) were compared by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Amersham Biosciences) or PhosphorImager analysis. For mass spectrometric analysis, 100 μg of GST and GST-YAP(1–57) were used in pull-down assays as described above except that the cell lysate was prepared from 30 × 100-mm dishes of 16HBE14o-cells. After extensive washing, the bound fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized with 0.01% colloidal Coomassie in 10% acetic acid. The visible bands were excised, and the samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Instruments Co., Bremen, Germany) and Nano-ESI-MS/MS on an API QSTAR-Pulsar (QSTAR, Applied Biosystems Div., Perkin-Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA) as described (38Kast J. Parker C.E. van der Drift K. Dial J.M. Milgram S.L. Wilm M. Howell M. Borchers C.H. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 2003; 17: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, HeLa cells were transfected for 18 h with plasmid vectors encoding HA-YAP. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged 1000 × g for 4 min. Cytosol was extracted with cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 75 s. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and washed three times in cytoplasmic extraction buffer without detergent. Nuclear proteins were extracted for immunoprecipitation using nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min. Total nuclear proteins were extracted by resus-pending nuclei in RIPA buffer for 10 min. Then nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were diluted 1:5 in binding buffer, and 2 μg of affinity-purified YAP antisera was added to each fraction and tumbled 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were collected on protein A beads, washed, and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Luciferase Assays—The cells were transfected with pGL3-Bax luciferase and Lac-Z reporter plasmids either alone or with plasmids encoding HA-YAP and/or HA-hnRNP U as noted in the figure legends. Empty pCMV-HA vector was transfected to normalize the amount of DNA used in each sample, and β-galactosidase enzyme assays (Promega, Madison, WI) were performed to normalize transfection efficiencies across samples. The cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 18 h post-transfection, and the lysates were analyzed using a Molecular Devices luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. YAP Associates with hnRNPU in Vitro—At the amino acid level human YAP shares 45% sequence identity and 57% homology with its paralogue TAZ. One obvious difference at the level of primary structure is a proline-rich amino terminus found only in YAP (Fig. 1A). To identify proteins that associate with YAP via this unique region, we immobilized 20 μg of GST, GST-YAP(1–57), or GST YAP(162–217) on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated the fusion proteins with cell lysates prepared from 16HBE14o-cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. A unique 120-kDa phosphoprotein bound specifically to GST-YAP(1–57) but not to GST alone or GST-YAP(162–217) (Fig. 1B). We also analyzed proteins bound to GST or GST-YAP(1–57) by silver staining (Fig. 1C). The 120-kDa protein bound to GST-YAP(1–57) but not to GST alone, and the interaction was abolished when the affinity matrix was washed in buffers containing 500 mm NaCl to disrupt ionic interactions (Fig. 1C, arrow). Using MALDI-TOF and electrospray tandem MS/MS, we identified the interacting protein as hnRNP U (also known as scaffold attachment factor A). To confirm the mass spectrometry analysis, we performed identical pull-down assays using GST or GST-YAP(1–57) and analyzed the bound fractions using a monoclonal antibody specific for hnRNP U (33Dreyfuss G. Choi Y.D. Adam S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As predicted by the mass spectrometry analysis, hnRNP U specifically bound the affinity resin containing the GST-YAP(1–57) fusion protein but did not associate with GST alone (Fig. 1D). To determine whether an indirect association of YAP and hnRNP U is mediated by nucleic acids, we repeated the same experiments in the presence of RNase and DNase but found that GST-YAP(1–57) still bound hnRNP U under these conditions (not shown). Thus we conclude that nucleic acids do not indirectly mediate the association of YAP and hnRNP U. YAP and hnRNP U Co-localize in the Nucleus—For YAP and hnRNP U to interact in vivo, they must co-localize, at least in part, to the same subcellular compartment. Although YAP has been described as a transcriptional co-activator based on its ability to associate directly with multiple transcription factors in vitro (11Ferrigno O. Lallemand F. Verrecchia F.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), the localization of endogenous YAP has not been extensively studied. In polarized epithelial cells, YAP localizes primarily to the apical membrane, and no protein was detected in the nucleus (8Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, the localization of YAP was studied by overexpression of the epitope-tagged protein with conflicting results (12Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 14Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and the localization of the endogenous protein has never been studied. Therefore we tested whether endogenous YAP localized to the nucleus, where it could potentially interact with hnRNP U. HeLa cells were stained with antibodies directed against YAP and hnRNP U and the distribution of each protein studied by confocal microscopy. A significant fraction of the endogenous YAP protein was found in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane; however, we also detected endogenous YAP in the nucleus of HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). As expected we also found significant amounts of hnRNP U in the nucleus of HeLa cells; both YAP and hnRNP U were distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, as well as concentrated in speckled foci (Fig. 2A). Although far less hnRNP U was detected in the cytoplasm of the cells, we consistently observed a pool of the protein diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). We used subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis to confirm these results and to determine the ratio of cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP. Equal ratios of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the purity of the fractions was assessed by Western blot analysis of the cytoplasmic protein IκB (39Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 40Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Consistent with our localization studies, YAP was found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with ∼5-20% of the endogenous protein present in the nucleus based on densitometric analysis of multiple preparations. We were also able to confirm our finding that some hnRNP U resides in the cytoplasm, although the majority of the protein clearly fractionated with the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2C). YAP Interacts with hnRNP U in Vivo—Because we detected an interaction between YAP and hnRNP U in vitro and the two proteins co-localize in cells, we next asked whether the two proteins interacted in vivo. Furthermore, because both proteins were found in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, we asked whether the interaction of YAP and hnRNP U occurred in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, or in both subcellular compartments. Cells expressing HA-tagged full-length YAP were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and the soluble protein in each fraction was incubated with affinity-purified YAP antibodies or a nonimmune IgG control. After extensive washing the bound fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis with HA antibodies and with antibodies directed against hnRNP U. Importantly, the distribution of HA-YAP was indistinguishable"

Here we provide evidence for the existence of alternative vertebrate transcripts encoding different U2AF35 isoforms. Three mRNA isoforms (termed U2AF35a–c) were produced by alternative splicing of the human U2AF1 gene. U2AF35c contains a premature stop codon that targets the resulting mRNA to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. U2AF35b differs from the previously described U2AF35a isoform in 7 amino acids located at the atypical RNA Recognition Motif involved in dimerization with U2AF65. Biochemical experiments indicate that isoform U2AF35b, which has been highly conserved from fish to man, maintains the ability to interact with U2AF65, stimulates U2AF65 binding to a pre-mRNA, and promotes U2AF splicing activity in vitro. Real time, quantitative PCR analysis indicates that U2AF35a is the most abundant isoform expressed in murine tissues, although the ratio between U2AF35a and U2AF35b varies from 10-fold in the brain to 20-fold in skeletal muscle. We propose that post-transcriptional regulation of U2AF1 gene expression may provide a mechanism by which the relative cellular concentration and availability of U2AF35 protein isoforms are modulated, thus contributing to the finely tuned control of splicing events in different tissues.

In higher eukaryotes, most protein-coding genes contain sequences that are spliced from the nascent transcripts (pre-mRNAs) in the nucleus. Intron excision is carried out by an assembly of small nuclear RNAs and proteins that are collectively recruited to pre-mRNAs forming the spliceosome (reviewed in Ref. 1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Although introns are excised with a high degree of precision, for many pre-mRNAs there is flexibility in the choice of alternative splice sites, often in response to tissue-specific, physiologically or developmentally regulated states. Alternative splicing produces multiple mRNAs encoding distinct proteins, thus expanding the coding capacity of genes and contributing to the proteomic complexity of higher organisms (2Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 3Brett D. Pospisil H. Valcarcel J. Reich J. Bork P. Nat.

Moreover, alternative splicing may contribute to regulate protein expression by generating premature termination codons that target the transcript to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (5Lewis B.P. Green R.E. Brenner S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In metazoans, pre-mRNA sequences implicated in splicing are only weakly conserved. Multiple, relatively weak protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving these sequences and additional regulatory sequence elements, which can positively or negatively affect spliceosome assembly at nearby splice sites, constitute the basis to control alternative splicing (for recent reviews see Refs. 4Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 6Graveley B.R. Cell. 2002; 109: 409-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, and 7Caceres J.F. Kornblihtt A.R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 186-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Proteins that bind to pre-mRNA and affect splicing regulation include SR proteins, hnRNPs, 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RRM, RNA recognition motif; NMD, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; UTR, untranslated region; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdML, adenovirus major late.1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RRM, RNA recognition motif; NMD, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; UTR, untranslated region; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdML, adenovirus major late. and tissue- or developmental stage-specific factors. Individual SR proteins interact only weakly with enhancer elements, but their binding to pre-mRNA is highly cooperative and can lead to recognition of distinct RNA sequence motifs, thus contributing to the selection of regulated splice sites. A distinct role is played by hnRNP proteins, which in general antagonize the stimulatory activity of SR proteins, and cell type-specific proteins, which may either inhibit or promote splicing. Thus, control of alternative splicing is achieved through the combinatorial interplay of both regulatory sequence signals and trans-acting protein factors (4Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 8Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 2002; 6: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The spliceosome is a multicomponent RNA-protein machine containing five uracil-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs) and many non-snRNP protein splicing factors. In the late 1990s ∼100 splicing factors were identified (10Burge C.B. Tuschl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar), and since then the number has nearly doubled (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Initiation of spliceosome recruitment to a pre-mRNA involves recognition of the 5′ splice site by the U1 snRNP, whereas the U2 snRNP associates with the 3′ region of the intron. The establishment of a stable interaction between U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA requires an auxiliary factor, U2AF (11Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) consists of two subunits, U2AF65 and U2AF35, that interact to form a stable heterodimer (12Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). U2AF65 binds directly to the polypyrimidine tract of pre-mRNA and is essential for splicing (13Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). U2AF35 recognizes the conserved 3′ splice site dinucleotide AG (14Merendino L. Guth S. Bilbao D. Martinez C. Valcarcel J. Nature. 1999; 402: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 15Zorio D.A. Blumenthal T. Nature. 1999; 402: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and is required for splicing of a subset of primary transcripts, the so-called AG-dependent pre-mRNAs (17Guth S. Martinez C. Gaur R.K. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8263-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Human U2AF35 is 240 residues long, with an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM) involved in dimerization with U2AF65 (18Kielkopf C.L. Rodionova N.A. Green M.R. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, the protein contains a C-terminal arginine/serine (RS)-rich domain interrupted by glycines (19Zhang M. Zamore P.D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A.I. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8769-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The RS region of U2AF35 has been shown to establish protein-protein interactions with splicing factors of the SR family, and it was proposed that SR proteins bound to purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers facilitate recruitment of U2AF65 to the polypyrimidine tract via bridging interactions mediated by U2AF35 (20Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21Graveley B.R. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 22Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. RNA (New York). 2001; 7: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other results, however, argue that the RS domain-mediated interactions with SR proteins bound to the exonic splicing enhancers is dispensable for the function of U2AF35 in AG-dependent pre-mRNA splicing (23Guth S. Tange T.O. Kellenberger E. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7673-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although interaction of U2AF35 with the 3′ splice site AG can stabilize U2AF65 binding, not all the activities of U2AF35 correlate with increased cross-linking of U2AF65 to the polypyrimidine tract, suggesting an additional, yet unknown function for U2AF35 in pre-mRNA splicing (23Guth S. Tange T.O. Kellenberger E. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7673-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this work we show that primary transcripts encoding U2AF35 splicing factor in higher vertebrates can be alternatively spliced and polyadenylated. Alternative splicing of U2AF35 pre-mRNAs may either introduce a premature stop codon that targets the resulting mRNA to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or alter 7 amino acid residues within the RRM domain. This alteration gives rise to a protein isoform that maintains the ability to bind U2AF65 and stimulates splicing activity in vitro. Most interestingly, the two U2AF35 protein isoforms have been under high selective pressure during evolution, suggesting that they play specific functions in vertebrate organisms. Our results further show that the relative abundance of mRNAs encoding each U2AF35 isoform differs between cell types, arguing that expression of the U2AF1 gene is controlled in a tissue-specific manner. Isolation and Characterization of Chicken U2AF1 cDNA— Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed to regions of U2AF35 cDNA conserved among Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The forward PCR primer (5′-AAGATHGGIGCITGYCGICAYGC-3′) was designed from amino acids 23 to 30 of human U2AF35. The reverse PCR primer (5′-TCRTAYTGICGRCAIGCYTC-3′) was designed to be complementary to the region encoding from amino acids 152 to 160. PCR was carried out with a pool of random chicken embryo cDNA molecules as template. A Biometra® UNO II thermocycler (Germany) was used, and the conditions for amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a time increment of 1 s per cycle, and finally 72 °C for 30 min. The PCR product was gel-purified using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into pBluescript II KS (+/–) by “TA cloning” (24Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). This 392-bp chicken U2AF35 cDNA fragment (PCR35) was random prime-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-it® II Random Primer Labeling kit (Stratagene®) and used to screen a chicken embryo cDNA library constructed in λZAP II (Stratagene®). Approximately 1.5 × 106 plaques were screened, and five positive plaques were isolated. cDNA inserts in pBluescript II KS phagemid were excised in vivo using the ExAssist/SOLR System (Stratagene®), purified, analyzed by restriction digest, and completely sequenced. Cloning of Chicken U2AF1 Gene—The chicken U2AF35 cDNA fragment PCR35 was random prime labeled and used to screen a DT40 cell line genomic library constructed in LambdaGEM®-11 (Promega), using standard procedures (25Kaiser K. Murray N.E. Whittaker P.A. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. I. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 37-82Google Scholar). From 1.2 × 106 plaques, six positive clones were isolated. Phage DNAs were purified and analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blotting (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39, 9.31-7.52, 9.59Google Scholar). Genomic fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II KS, and an 18-kb region covering the entire chicken U2AF1 gene was sequenced. Sequencing—Cycle sequencing of plasmid DNA was performed with the AmpliTaqFS Dye Primer Core kit (Applied Biosystems), using 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 pmol of each standard forward and reverse primers labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate or CY5. An MJ Research (Waltham, MA) PT-200 cycler was used for 35 cycles (97 °C, 15 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 30 s). Reactions were loaded “off-gel” on 72-clone porous-membrane combs, applied to 60-cm long polyacrylamide gels (4.5% Hydrolink Long Ranger gel solution, FMC BioProducts), and analyzed on the ARAKIS sequencing system with array detectors, developed at EMBL (27Erfle H. Ventzki R. Voss H. Rechmann S. Benes V. Stegemann J. Ansorge W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2229-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Raw sequencing data were evaluated and analyzed, and the consensus sequence was assembled by using the software packages (Lane Tracker and Gene Skipper) developed at EMBL. Remaining sequencing gaps were covered by primer walking (28Voss H. Wiemann S. Grothues D. Sensen C. Zimmermann J. Schwager C. Stegemann J. Erfle H. Rupp T. Ansorge W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 714-721PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—DT40 cells (ATCC CRL-2111) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. HeLa cells (ECACC 93021013) were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from either DT40 cells or chicken embryos using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A) RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Biosciences), electrophoresed on an agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred to an Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39, 9.31-7.52, 9.59Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out with the following probes: (a) chicken U2AF35 cDNA fragment PCR35; (b) a 1175-bp XbaI/XbaI (2403–3578) fragment obtained by restriction digest of pBluescript-chU2AF35III (a class III clone); additionally, a probe complementary to chicken β-actin was used as an internal control. Probes were gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Pre-hybridization (30 min) and hybridization (1 h) were carried out at 68 °C in ExpressHyb Solution (Clontech). Following hybridization, washing was performed in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS (three times 10 min at room temperature), and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS (two times at 50 °C). Filters were exposed to a Kodak Biomax-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.), with intensifying screens, at –70 °C. Autoradiograms were analyzed using the software package ONE-Dscan™, version 1.0 (Scanalytics, a Division of CSPI). NMD Inhibition and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA interference of Upf1 was carried out as described previously (29Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 91-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, for a typical siRNA transfection, 24-well dishes were seeded with 105 cells prior to transfection. The following day (day 2) 120 pmol of siRNA duplex was transfected using 3 μl of LipofectAMINE® 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (30Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On day 3 cells were trypsinized and split to a well of a 6-well plate. On day 4 cells were retransfected with siRNA duplex as on day 2, and finally, cells were harvested on day 6. mRNA targets for gene specific knockdown were UPF1: AAGAUGCAGUUCCGCUCCAUU (31Mendell J.T. ap Rhys C.M. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 298: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and control C2: AAGGUCCGGCUCCCCCAAAUG (30Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Gene silencing was monitored by immunoblotting. Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). Reverse transcriptase reactions were primed with oligo(dT) by using Superscript II RT enzyme (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was amplified with primers BothFor, 5′-GCACAATAAACCGACGTTTAGCCAG-3′, and BothRev, 5′-TGGATCGGCTGTCCATTAAACCAAC-3′ (exons 2–4, Fig. 4). The amplification products were digested with HinfI, separated by gel electrophoresis, and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length human U2AF35a cDNA was used to screen a Uni-ZAP®XR Human Fetal Spleen λ cDNA library (Stratagene®). Positive clones were analyzed by restriction digestion with HinfI and sequenced in order to isolate U2AF35b cDNA clones. U2AF35b cDNA was subsequently cloned into NcoI/KpnI sites of pFastBac™ HT plasmid, and recombinant baculoviruses were generated by using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). His6-tagged U2AF35a and U2AF35b proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected cells as described previously (32Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 100 mm KCl buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). U2AF65 and U2AF65Δ35 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (33Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The plasmids used for protein expression were described previously (13Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 34Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 100 mm KCl buffer D. Protein concentrations were estimated by comparing dilutions of the preparations to serial dilutions of a bovine serum albumin standard in SDS-containing denaturing gels. Construction and Expression of GFP Fusion Proteins—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs were obtained by restriction digestion and subcloning into the appropriate pEGFP-C vector (Clontech). GFP-U2AF35a was described previously (35Gama-Carvalho M. Carvalho M.P. Kehlenbach A. Valcarcel J. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GFP-U2AF35b was constructed by digestion of pBS-U2AF35b with BglII followed by fill-in and PstI digestion. The insert was then cloned into PstI/SmaI sites of pEGFP-C3. HeLa cells were transfected and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described previously (35Gama-Carvalho M. Carvalho M.P. Kehlenbach A. Valcarcel J. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays—GST pull-down assays were carried out using 1 μg of GST-U2AF65 or GST-U2AF65Δ35 fusion proteins immobilized on 10 μl of glutathione S-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubating with 5 μl of a standard [35S]methionine-labeled rabbit reticulocyte RNase-A-treated lysate reaction (TnT T7 kit; Promega). Incubation was carried out in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the beads, proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-loading dye, electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, 0.5 μg of GST-U2AF65 or GST-U2AF65Δ35 was incubated with 0.5 μg of His-U2AF35a or His-U2AF35b in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, on ice, for 15 min. Then 10 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) was added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole and resuspended in 15 μl of SDS-loading dye. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed by Western blotting with anti-U2AF65 monoclonal antibody MC3 (36Gama-Carvalho M. Krauss R.D. Chiang L. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and anti-U2AF35 polyclonal serum. Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). UV Cross-linking—U15CAG oligo RNA was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). RNA-protein binding reactions were assembled in buffer D, with 2 mg/ml tRNA, 0.5 μm purified GST-U2AF65, and His-tagged U2AF35a or U2AF35b, and ∼50,000 cpm 32P-labeled RNA in a final volume of 20 μl. After a 15-min incubation on ice, samples were UV cross-linked (Stratalinker; 254 nm, 0.6 J, 4-cm distance to light source) and then treated with RNase A (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were mixed with SDS-loading dye, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed and dried, and cross-linked proteins were detected by autoradiography. In Vitro Splicing Assays—HeLa nuclear extract was prepared as described by Dignam et al. (37Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) and depleted of U2AF exactly as described (38Valcarcel J. Martinez C. Green M.R. Richter J.D. mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, New York1997: 31-53Crossref Google Scholar) by passing the extract over an oligo(dT)-cellulose column at 1 m KCl. The column flow-through of this procedure yielded the depleted nuclear extract (odTΔNE). Transcription templates were generated by PCR using plasmids harboring the sequence of AdML (39Watakabe A.

Full-length substrates were transcribed in the presence of a CAP analogue (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, New England Biolabs) and [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) as described (17Guth S. Martinez C. Gaur R.K. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8263-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the transcripts were gel-purified, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in water. Splicing reactions and splicing complementation assays were performed as described previously (17Guth S. Martinez C. Gaur R.K. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8263-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spliced products were resolved on 13% denaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris/borate/EDTA buffer (TBE) and analyzed by autoradiography. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from a variety of murine tissues (brain, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle) using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics). The concentration of RNA was determined by spectrophotometry, and RNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Only samples yielding distinct 28 S and 18 S bands and A260/A280 ratios between 1.8 and 2.1 were further used. Production of cDNA was carried out using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). TaqMan® Minor Groove Binder probes and primers (Table I) were designed by using the computer software Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer and probe concentrations were optimized for each amplicon using Mouse Universal RNA (Invitrogen) as a template. The values obtained for each set of primers and probe are listed in Table I. For 18 S quantification we used a pre-developed assay (D64333760, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All reactions were performed in the ABI7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative expression of each gene in murine tissues was calculated using a derivative of the 2(–ΔΔC(t)) method, as described (41Schmittgen T.D. Teske S. Vessela R.L. True L.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To validate the use of the 2–ΔCt method, serial dilutions of cDNA prepared from Mouse Universal RNA were amplified by real time PCR using gene-specific primers and fluorogenic probes for U2AF35a, U2AF35b, U2AF65, and 18 S rRNA. All the analyzed transcripts exhibited high linearity amplification plots (r2 > 0.98) (data not shown). The slopes of the Ct versus the log RNA quantity were –3.36, –3.27, –3.28, and –3.27 for U2AF35a, U2AF35b, U2AF65, and 18 S rRNA, respectively. The similarity of these slopes clearly shows that the PCR efficiencies for these genes are similar. Also when doing ΔCt plots versus log RNA quantities for each pair of genes, the slope was approximately equal to 0, further confirming that the expression of each of these genes can be directly compared with one another.Table ISequence of primers and TaqMan® MGB probes used in the quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCRGenePrimers and probes sequencesConcentration in reactionAmplicon sizenmbpU2AF35aForward, 5′-TAGCCAGACCATTGCCTCTT-3′900Reverse, 5′-CGCAAACCGTCAGCAGACT3′90072Probe, FAM-5′-AACATTTACCGTAACCCT3′-MGB150U2AF35bForward, 5′-TCCCCAAAACAGTGCACAGA3′900Reverse, 5′-TCATCATAGTGCTCCTGCATCTC3′90078Probe, FAM-5′-GGCTCACACTGTGCTG3′-MGB150U2AF65Forward, 5′-ACATCACCCCAATGCAGTACAA3′300Reverse, 5′-AGGGCAGTGGCTGGAATCT3′30061Probe, FAM-5′-ACCCGCAGCTTGCATG3′-MGB200 Open table in a new tab Sequence Analysis—BLAST searches (42Altschul S.F.

We report the isolation and characterization of an additional AGS protein (AGS4) from a human prostate leiomyosarcoma cDNA library. AGS4 is identical to G18.1b, which is encoded by a gene within the major histocompatibility class III region of chromosome 6. The activity of AGS4 in the yeast-based functional screen was selective for Gi2/Gi3 and independent of guanine-nucleotide exchange by Giα. RNA blots indicated enrichment of AGS4/G18.1b mRNA in heart, placenta, lung, and liver. Immunocytochemistry with AGS4/G18.1b-specific antisera indicated a predominant nonhomogeneous, extranuclear distribution within the cell following expression in COS7 or Chinese hamster ovary cells. AGS4/G18.1b contains three G-protein regulatory motifs downstream of an amino terminus domain with multiple prolines. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-AGS4/G18.1b fusion proteins interacted with purified Giα, and peptides derived from each of the G-protein regulatory motifs inhibited guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding to purified Giα1. AGS4/G18.1b was also complexed with Giα3 in COS7 cell lysates following cell transfection. However, AGS4/G18.1b did not alter the generation of inositol phosphates in COS7 cells cotransfected with the Gβγ-regulated effector phospholipase C-β2. These data suggest either that an additional signal is required to position AGS4/G18.1b in the proper cellular location where it can access heterotrimer and promote subunit dissociation or that AGS4 serves as an alternative binding partner for Giα independent of Gβγ participating in G-protein signaling events that are independent of classical G-protein-coupled receptors at the cell surface.

Although heterotrimeric G-proteins are transducers for signals recognized by the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GPR, G-protein regulatory; AGS, activators of G-protein signaling; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PLC, Phospholipase C.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GPR, G-protein regulatory; AGS, activators of G-protein signaling; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PLC, Phospholipase C. at the plasma membrane, several observations suggest that the G-protein subunits serve a broader role in cellular function. For example, the activation state of G-protein is influenced by accessory proteins or signal regulators distinct from GPCRs, whereas other accessory proteins may serve as alternative binding partners for G-protein subunits independent of heterotrimer formation (1Blumer J.B. Lanier S.M. Receptors Channels. 2003; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, G-protein subunits and such accessory proteins may be located in intracellular domains as well as at the plasma membrane (2Stow J.L de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L.

To further extend these concepts and to potentially identify additional post-receptor regulators of G-protein signaling, we used the yeast-based system to screen a human prostate leiomyosarcoma cDNA library. This study reports on the characterization of AGS4, which was one of the cDNAs isolated in the screen. AGS4 is identical to G18.1b, which is encoded by a gene within the major histocompatibility complex class III region of chromosome 6. The activity of AGS4 in the yeast-based functional screen was selective for Gi2/Gi3 and independent of guanine nucleotide exchange by Giα2.

Despite clear differences in key residues within the GPR consensus motif, protein interaction studies with a GST-AGS4/G18.1b fusion protein indicated direct binding of Giα1, and peptides derived from the GPR motifs inhibited GTPγS binding to purified Giα1. These data provide further structural insight regarding the binding pocket for the GPR motif on Giα. AGS4/G18.1b did not alter the generation of inositol phosphates in COS7 cells cotransfected with the Gβγ-regulated effector phospholipase C-β2. These data suggest either that an additional signal is required to position AGS4/G18.1b in the proper cellular location where it can access heterotrimer and promote subunit dissociation or that AGS4 serves as an alternative binding partner for Giα independent of Gβγ participating in G-protein signaling events that are independent of classical G-protein-coupled receptors at the cell surface.

Human MTN and human immune system MTN blots were purchased from Clontech. Giα1 and Goα were purified from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant virus and kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Graber (West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV). GPR peptides were synthesized and purified by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX), and peptides were mass-verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The amino terminus of the peptides was acetylated, and the carboxyl terminus was amidated. Giα3 and Gsα antisera were a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Gettys (Pennington Biomedical Research Institute).

Cloning and Expression of AGS4/G18.1b Constructs—A human fetal lung AGS4/G18.1b cDNA (ATCC 162838R) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pTOPO and subsequently pGEX4T for expression as a GST fusion protein. The subcloned cDNA exhibited two nucleotide differences from the GenBank™ coding region sequence for G18.1b (G-41 instead of A; G-63 instead of A). The Gly-41 difference resulted in a change in the encoded amino acid from Gln-14 to Arg. It is not clear whether these nucleotide differences represent a polymorphism in the human population. Preliminary studies indicated that both Gln-14 and Arg-14 variants behaved similarly in the yeast-based functional screen. An amino terminus fragment (Met-1-Ser-56) and a carboxyl terminus segment (Leu-57-Cys-160) of AGS4/G18.1b were generated as GST fusion proteins by polymerase chain reaction using AGS4/G18.1b cDNA as the template. GST fusion proteins were generated, purified, and eluted for protein interaction studies as described previously (10Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

AGS4/G18.1b Antisera—Antipeptide antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with two synthetic peptides (P1, Cys-Pro-6-Ser-28; P2, Cys-116-Leu-135). Peptides were synthesized by the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) peptide synthesis facility, and rabbits were immunized through the LSUHSC antibody production facility. Each antisera was characterized by analysis of varying amounts of GST-AGS4/G18.1b fusion proteins and/or extracts from COS7 cells transfected with pcDNA3::AGS4/G18.1b to determine optimal conditions for immunoblotting. The P1 antisera exhibited the highest specificity and titer and was affinity-purified by AminoLink Plus immobilization kit obtained from Pierce and was used in subsequent experiments. Purified antibodies (A280 = 1.04) were used at dilutions of 1:500 or 1:50 for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Multiple series of experiments (different fixation procedures, incubation times, and amounts of antibody) were performed to determine the optimal conditions for signal detection by immunocytochemistry and to verify the specificity of observed signals. No immunofluorescent signal was detected in control cells transfected with the pcDNA3 control vector or in the absence of primary antibody. Each field of cells evaluated by microscopy contained both transfected and nontransfected cells, providing additional internal controls for observed signals. Images were generated and evaluated as described previously (5Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

For GTPγS binding assays, purified Giα (100 nm) was preincubated with varying amounts of the GPR peptides for 20 min at 24 °C. Binding assays (duplicate determinations) were initiated by the addition of 0.5 μm GTPγS (4.0 × 104 dpm/pmol), and incubations (total volume = 50 μl) continued for 30 min at 24 °C. Both preincubation and GTPγS binding assays were conducted in binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm adenosine triphosphate, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then processed as described previously (11Peterson Y.K.

Cell membrane pellets were washed three times with intervening homogenization in membrane buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and pelleting at 100,000 × g. Coimmunoprecipitation, cell transfections, and measurements of inositol phosphates were performed as described (10Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

All purified G-proteins used in these studies were isolated in the GDP-bound form, and G-protein interaction assays contained an additional 10 μm GDP. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. As part of a broad strategy to identify post-receptor regulators of G-protein signaling, we used a yeast-based functional screen designed to rapidly screen cDNA libraries for such a bioactivity. The functional screen (6Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The yeast strain was further modified by replacing the yeast Gα subunit Gpa1 with human Giα3 and rendering growth dependent upon activation of the pheromone response pathway. This yeast strain was used to screen a human prostate leiomyosarcoma cDNA library in a galactose-inducible vector pYES2 for entities that promoted growth in galactose-specific manner. cDNAs isolated in this screen that required the presence of Gβγ for activity were termed activators of G-protein signaling (AGS) as described previously for AGS1-3 (6Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

This study reports the identification and characterization of AGS4 and indicates that the yeast-based system may be used to identify disease-specific signal regulators that target various entities within the signal transduction cascade. The selectivity of AGS4 for different G-proteins was first determined by evaluating the activity of the cDNA in yeast expressing Giα3, Gsα, or Gα16 in place of Gpa1. AGS4 effectively promoted growth in the Giα3 genetic background but did not activate Gsα or Gα16 (Fig. 1A). Epistasis analysis indicated that the bioactivity of AGS4 required the presence of Gβγ (Fig. 1B), and as there were no changes in the amount of Gα or Gβγ upon expression of AGS4, this protein effectively behaved as a receptor-independent activator of G-proteins. AGS4 expression also promoted growth in a yeast strain expressing Giα2, and this activation was not antagonized by overexpression of RGS4, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Giα (Fig. 1B). Activity was also observed in a strain expressing Giα2-G204A, a mutant Giα2 that is deficient in exchanging GDP for GTP (6Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S.

Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that the activation of G-protein signaling is occurring in the absence of nucleotide exchange and suggest that AGS4 is influencing subunit interactions in a manner that increases the availability of Gβγ for activation of the MAP kinase cascade and promotion of growth. AGS4 may actively promote dissociation of Gα and Gβγ, as reported for a consensus GPR peptide (18Ghosh M. Peterson Y.K. Lanier S.M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34747-34750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or it may impede the reassociation of GαGDP with Gβγ within the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle (1Blumer J.B. Lanier S.M. Receptors Channels. 2003; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of AGS4 indicated that it was identical to G18.1b (NM_ 022107;BC018724). AGS4/G18.1b consists of 160 amino acids (molecular weight, 17,864) (Fig. 2A) and is encoded by a gene (8 exons) within the major histocompatibility complex class III region (chromosome 6, open reading frame 9). The major histocompatibility complex class III region contains genes that encode proteins of diverse function and is of particular interest in terms of disease susceptibility. The related protein in mouse (AAH21942; BC021942) exhibits 88% sequence identity with its human counterpart. Blastp searches did not reveal any obvious candidate orthologs in C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, or Drosophila melanogaster. Although initially AGS4/G18.1b was a “predicted” protein based upon genome sequence, both the identification of AGS4/G18.1b expressed sequence tags and subsequent RNA blots (Fig. 2B) indicate that it is indeed generated as a transcript. AGS4/G18.1b mRNA (∼1.4 kb) was expressed in heart, placenta, lung, and liver. An immune system RNA blot indicated expression of AGS4/G18.1b in spleen, lymph node, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow. Immunoblotting of COS7 cells transfected with AGS4/G18.1b cDNAs indicated that the protein was primarily found in the 100,000 × g supernatant (Fig. 3A). Immunocytochemistry in COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary AGS4/G18.1b transfectants indicated a nonhomogeneous distribution often enriched around the nucleus or adjacent to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). A faint signal is also seen in the nucleus. These data suggest a regulated localization of AGS4/G18.1b within the cell. AGS4/G18.1b was also identified by mass spectrometry (22Nebl T.

The fragment of AGS4/G18.1b in the latter immunoprecipitates was actually phosphorylated at Ser-59, which is just upstream of the first GPR motif and analogous to the site of phosphorylation in RGS14 upstream of the GPR motif, where it was suggested to influence the affinity of the interaction of the GPR motif with G-protein (24Hollinger S. Ramineni S. Hepler J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additional sites of phosphorylation may occur within the GPR motif itself, influencing the interaction with G-protein and providing a regulatory mechanism for signal input or subcellular location (25Blumer J.B.

Each of these proteins (Rap1GAPII, LGN, RGS12, RGS14, PCP2, and G18.1b) contained at least one GPR motif. Three core GPR motifs are present at the carboxyl-terminal region of AGS4/G18.1b (GPR-I Thr-62-Arg-81, GPR-II Arg-104-Arg-123, GPR-III Gln-133-Arg-152). Four GPR motifs are found in AGS3 and LGN, where at least for AGS3, it appears that each of the four GPR motifs can simultaneously bind GiαGDP free of Gβγ (10Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P.

The functionality of the AGS4/G18.1b GPR motifs is not defined, nor is it known whether they exhibit selectivity for different G-proteins. The GPR domains in AGS4/G18.1b exhibit some nonconservative substitutions in amino acids when compared with a consensus GPR peptide, which may influence the interaction with Gα subunits. To address these issues, we evaluated the interaction of AGS4/G18.1b with G-proteins by two experimental strategies. The first approach involved the generation of GST-AGS4/G18.1b fusion proteins and protein interaction studies. The second approach involved the synthesis of peptides corresponding to each of the GPR motifs and the characterization of their ability to interact with G-proteins. Protein interaction studies with purified Gα subunits indicated that GSTAGS4/G18.1b exhibited a preference for Giα versus Goα (Fig. 4B). AGS3-GPR (Pro-463-Ser-650), which contains four individua"

Although this is usually accomplished by inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis, we reasoned that this might be more effectively achieved by activation of polyamine catabolism at the level of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT); a strategy first validated in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. We now examine the possibility that, due to unique aspects of polyamine homeostasis in the prostate gland, tumor cells derived from it may be particularly sensitive to activated polyamine catabolism. Thus, SSAT was conditionally overexpressed in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells via a tetracycline-regulatable (Tet-off) system. Tetracycline removal resulted in a rapid ∼10-fold increase in SSAT mRNA and an increase of ∼20-fold in enzyme activity. SSAT products N1-acetylspermidine, N1-acetylspermine, and N1,N12-diacetylspermine accumulated intracellularly and extracellularly. SSAT induction also led to a growth inhibition that was not accompanied by polyamine pool depletion as it was in MCF-7 cells. Rather, intracellular spermidine and spermine pools were maintained at or above control levels by a robust compensatory increase in ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities. This, in turn, gave rise to a high rate of metabolic flux through both the biosynthetic and catabolic arms of polyamine metabolism. Treatment with the biosynthesis inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine during tetracycline removal interrupted flux and prevented growth inhibition. Thus, flux-induced growth inhibition appears to derive from overaccumulation of metabolic products and/or from depletion of metabolic precursors. Metabolic effects that were not excluded as possible contributing factors include high levels of putrescine and acetylated polyamines, a 50% reduction in S-adenosylmethionine, and a 45% decline in the SSAT cofactor acetyl-CoA. Overall, the study demonstrates that activation of polyamine catabolism in LNCaP cells elicits a compensatory increase in polyamine biosynthesis and downstream metabolic events that culminate in growth inhibition.

Cell growth is dependent on a sustained supply of polyamines, which is typically met by the integrated contributions of biosynthesis, catabolism, uptake, and export, each of which is sensitively regulated by effector molecules that, in turn, are controlled by intracellular polyamine pools (1Porter C.W.

Neoplastic cell growth is associated with elevated polyamine biosynthetic activity, even when the surrounding normal tissue itself is rapidly proliferating, such as the intestinal mucosa (2Porter C.W. Herrera-Ornelas L. Pera P. Petrelli N.F. Mittelman A. Cancer. 1987; 60: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Kramer D.L. Nishioka K.

Med. 2003; 7: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, the rationale for targeting polyamines in antitumor strategies relates to their critical role in supporting neoplastic cell growth and to the overexpression of biosynthetic enzymes in tumor versus normal tissues (3Kramer D.L. Nishioka K. Critical Roles of Polyamines in Cancer: Basic Mechanisms and Clinical Approaches. R. G. Landes Co., New York1996: 151-189Google Scholar, 5Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell Mol.

The biology and metabolism of polyamines in the prostate is distinctly different from that of other tissues. In addition to synthesizing these molecules for epithelial cell replacement, the gland produces massive quantities of spermine (Spm) for export into reproductive fluids (7Harrison G.A. Biochem. J. 1931; 25: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mann T. The Biochemistry of Semen and of the Male Reproductive Tract. John Wiley, New York1964: 193-200Google Scholar, 9Pegg A.E.

Med. 1979; 22: 421-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The only major tissue that synthesizes polyamines for export, the prostate, and presumably tumors derived from it, may be dependent on novel and therapeutically exploitable homeostatic mechanisms. For example, we have observed that, in contrast to other cell lines, two of three prostate carcinoma lines failed to regulate polyamine transport in response to polyamine analogues or inhibitors (11Mi Z. Kramer D.L. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Bernacki R. Porter C.W. Prostate. 1998; 34: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Very recently, Rhodes et al. (12Rhodes D.R. Barrette T.R. Rubin M.A. Ghosh D. Chinnaiyan A.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4427-4433PubMed Google Scholar) performed a meta-analysis of four independent microarray datasets comparing gene expression profiles of benign versus malignant patient prostate samples (12Rhodes D.R. Barrette T.R. Rubin M.A. Ghosh D. Chinnaiyan A.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4427-4433PubMed Google Scholar). Their study showed that polyamine biosynthesis was the most consistently and significantly affected metabolic, signaling, or apoptotic pathway. More particularly, the study revealed a synchronous network of genes contributing to polyamine biosynthesis was up-regulated while genes detracting from polyamine biosynthesis were down-regulated. In support of these findings, clinical studies by Bettuzzi et al. (13Bettuzzi S. Davalli P. Astancolle S. Carani C. Madeo B. Tampieri A. Corti A. Saverio B. Pierpaola D. Serenella A. Cesare C. Bruno M. Auro T. Arnaldo C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 28-34PubMed Google Scholar) indicate a significant increase in transcripts of the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, ODC and SAMDC, in human prostatic cancer relative to benign hyperplasia. In recognition of the unique physiology of the prostate gland, Heston and collaborators (14Heston W.D. Watanabe K.A. Pankiewicz K.W. Covey D.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1849-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Heston W.D. Cancer Surv. 1991; 11: 217-238PubMed Google Scholar) were among the first to propose that targeting polyamine biosynthesis may be particularly effective against prostate cancer. Most of these efforts have made use of known inhibitors of ODC or SAMDC (16Mamont P.S. Duchesne M.C. Grove J. Bey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 17Regenass U. Mett H. Stanek J. Mueller M. Kramer D. Porter C.W.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5125-5133PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the ODC inhibitor, α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) effectively suppressed development of prostate cancer in the TRAMP mouse model. As an alternative approach to the use of enzyme inhibition, we propose that disruption of polyamine homeostasis at the level of polyamine catabolism may have unique therapeutic potential against prostate carcinoma. It has been demonstrated, for example, that polyamine analogues such as N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) down-regulate polyamine biosynthesis at the level of ODC and SAMDC and, at the same time, potently (i.e. >200-fold) up-regulate polyamine catabolism at the level of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) (1Porter C.W.

Several lines of evidence support the idea that analogue induction of SSAT and hence, activation of polyamine catabolism, is a critical determinant of DENSPM drug action. For example, DENSPM growth inhibition among tumor cell lines correlates with the extent to which SSAT is induced (23Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Casero Jr., R.A. Ervin S.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Bergeron R.J.

The studies cited above relate to SSAT induction in the context of analogue treatment, but they do not address what happens when SSAT is selectively induced in cells. In an earlier report (31Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

On the basis of rationale suggesting that prostate carcinoma may react differently to perturbations in polyamine homeostasis, we investigated the consequences of conditional SSAT overexpression in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells.

Cell Culture—LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells engineered to constitutively express the tetracycline-repressible transactivator (tTA) (33Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), designated LNGK9 (34Gschwend J.E. Fair W.R. Powell C.T. Prostate. 1997; 33: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% Tet-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 units/ml (Invitrogen), and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B at 37 °C in the presence of humidified 5% CO2. Aminoguanidine (at 1 mm) was routinely included in the media as an inhibitor of copper-dependent bovine serum amino oxidases to prevent conversion of extracellular polyamines to toxic products. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted electronically (Coulter Model ZM, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Transfections—LNGK9 cells expressing the tTA were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm culture dishes in the absence of hygromycin B and Tet. The following day, fresh media were replaced and cells were cotransfected with the tTA-responsive pTRE-SSAT plasmid (31Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Janne J. Porter C.W. J.

Stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml antibiotic G418, 150 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 1 μg/ml Tet. Healthy G418-resistant clones were selected and tested for SSAT mRNA by Northern blot analysis in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml Tet. With the Tet-off system, SSAT transcription is induced in the absence of Tet (–Tet) but not in its presence (+Tet). A Tet concentration of 1 μg/ml was found to fully and consistently suppress SSAT gene expression during routine cell culture passage. Clones that expressed low basal level of SSAT mRNA under +Tet conditions and high induced levels of SSAT mRNA under –Tet conditions were selected for further study. Clones were maintained continuously under 1 μg/ml +Tet until experiments were initiated. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was carried out as described by Fogel-Petrovic et al. (35Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and its concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry. RNA samples (5 μg/lane) were separated on 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to a Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was cross-linked in a Stratalinker™ 1800, hybridized to [32P]dCTP random-labeled cDNA probes (Stratagene) for detection of SSAT mRNA (36Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Pegg A.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and exposed for autoradiography. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal was used as a loading control. Polyamine Enzymes and Polyamine Pools—SSAT, ODC, and SAMDC activities were assayed as described previously (27Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar, 37Porter C.W. Cavanaugh Jr., P.F. Stolowich N. Ganis B. Kelly E. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2050-2057PubMed Google Scholar). Polyamine enzyme activities were expressed as picomoles of AcSpd generated per minute/mg of protein for SSAT and as nanomoles of CO2/h/mg of protein for ODC and SAMDC. Intracellular polyamines, including acetylated derivatives of spermidine (Spd) and Spm were extracted from cell pellets with 0.6 n perchloric acid, dansylated, measured by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described by Kramer et al. (38Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and expressed as picomoles/106 cells. Extracellular polyamines and acetylated polyamines were extracted from media as described by Kramer et al. (39Kramer D. Stanek J. Diegelman P. Regenass U. Schneider P. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), containing fetal bovine serum, Tet, and l-glutamine but not G418 or hygromycin B. A total of 50 μl of dansylated sample was injected for HPLC, and data were collected and analyzed as noted above. Extracellular polyamine pools were expressed as nanomoles/equivalent volume (ml)/106 cells. S-Adenosylmethionine and Metabolite Pools—Intracellular SAM and its metabolites, dcSAM and MTA, were extracted from cell pellets with 0.6 n perchloric acid and measured by HPLC according to chromatographic conditions reported by Yarlett and Bacchi (40Yarlett N. Bacchi C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Kramer et al. (38Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (50 μl) were eluted from a C18 column (40 °C) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with a linear gradient starting with solvent A (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 8 mm octane sulfonic acid, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2% acetonitrile) at 80% and solvent B (0.15 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm octane sulfonic acid, 26% acetonitrile) at 20%. Over the course of 30 min, the gradient increased to 100% solvent B for 10 min. Effluent was monitored with a Waters 2487 dual wavelength UV detector, and data were processed using instrumentation described for polyamine pool analysis and expressed as picomoles/106 cells. Measurement of Acetyl-CoA—High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) separation and quantitation of acetyl-CoA in biological samples followed the method of Liu et al. (32Liu G. Chen J. Che P. Ma Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed and processed by using a solid-phase extraction. Extracts were then analyzed on a Beckman P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis system equipped with a photodiode array detector and an uncoated fused silica CE column of 75-μm inner diameter and 60 cm in length with 50 cm from inlet to the detection window (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). Electrophoretic conditions were according to Liu et al. (32Liu G. Chen J. Che P. Ma Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the capillary was preconditioned with 1 m NaOH and Milli-Q water for 10 min each at 20 p.s.i. and then equilibrated with 100 mm NaH2PO4 running buffer containing 0.1% β-cyclodextrin (pH 6.0) for 10 min. After each run, the capillary was rinsed with 1 m NaOH, Milli-Q water, and running buffer for 2 min each. The injection was done hydrodynamically at a pressure of 0.5 p.s.i. for 10 s. Injection volume was calculated using CE Expert Lite software from Beckman. Separation voltage was 15 kV at a constant capillary temperature of 15 °C. To establish the standard calibration curves, solutions containing the acetyl-CoA and the internal standard (isobutyryl-CoA, 41 nmol) were prepared at concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 nmol. Standards were processed as described above for cell lysates and resuspended in 10 μl of water. The detector response was (r > 0.99) for all acetyl-CoA species over the above concentration range. Coenzyme As were monitored with a photodiode array detector at the maximum absorbance wavelength (253.5 nm). Data were collected and processed by using Beckman P/ACE 32 Karat software version 4.0. Cellular acetyl-CoA levels were expressed as nanomoles/106 cells. Derivation of Transfected Cells—Cells transfected with the human SSAT cDNA were selected in neomycin and grown as clones in the presence of 1 μg/ml Tet. Of the 100 SSAT/LNGK9 clones screened (data not shown), those most sensitive to Tet regulation were selected according to the differential expression between SSAT mRNA in +Tet (SSAT-off) versus mRNA in –Tet (SSAT-on) (Fig. 1). Based on these criteria, clone 53 was selected for further study, because it displayed low SSAT mRNA in +Tet and an 8-fold increase in total SSAT mRNA (exogenous and endogenous) under –Tet conditions for 48 h. Nearly identical responses were also obtained with several other clones. Transfected human SSAT cDNA (∼1.5 kb) was distinguishable from the smaller endogenous transcript (∼1.3 kb) by differences in polyadenylation, which became apparent during enzyme induction (35Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exogenous 1.5-kb transcript levels increased with Tet removal, the endogenous 1.3-kb transcript levels remained at basal levels, indicating that the presence or absence of the antibiotic did not affect endogenous gene expression. Tet-regulated expression of SSAT mRNA and activity was characterized from 0 to 144 h in clone 53 (Fig. 2). Following Tet removal, SSAT mRNA increased significantly by 6 h and plateaued by 24 h at levels ranging between 10- and 20-fold greater than the 0-h sample. Induction of mRNA was closely paralleled by increases in SSAT activity, which reached a maximum of ∼20-fold by 24 h (see Figs. 2 and 4).Fig. 2Time-dependent increases in SSAT mRNA and activity in SSAT/LNGK9 clone 53 following Tet removal. Tet was removed for the indicated time, and cells were harvested for total RNA isolation and SSAT enzyme activity. An amount of 5 μg of total RNA was loaded onto each Northern blot lane. Note that following removal of 1 μg/ml Tet, both SSAT mRNA and activity increased rapidly before reaching a plateau between 24 and 48 h. For quantitation, SSAT mRNA bands were scanned fluorometrically, normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal, and expressed as -fold increase (Fold ↑) relative to +Tet at 0 h (lane 1). As expressed by -fold increase, SSAT activity increased in parallel to SSAT mRNA. This blot is representative of findings from three separate experiments. hnRNA, heteronuclear RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Time-dependent effects of conditional SSAT overexpression on polyamine biosynthetic enzyme activities. Tet was removed from SSAT/LNGK9-clone 53 cells for the indicated time after which cells were harvested for polyamine enzyme activities for SSAT, ODC, and SAMDC. Following Tet removal, both SSAT activity (▪) increased sharply to a maximum of ∼20-fold (A), and ODC activity (▪) increased sharply to ∼10-fold (B) at 48 h before undergoing a steady decline. By contrast, SAMDC activity (•) increased steadily over the course of 144 h to a maximum of ∼18-fold that of basal levels (C). Enzyme activities of SSAT/LNGK9-clone 53 cells grown continuously in the presence of Tet remained relatively unchanged from 0 h (data not shown). Data represents mean values ± S.E., where n is 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of SSAT Overexpression on Cell Growth and Polyamine Metabolism—As shown in Fig. 3, SSAT overexpression caused significant inhibition of cell growth at ∼2 days following Tet removal, which was sustained through the 6-day experiment. Growth inhibition appeared to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic, because there was no obvious decline in cell number as would be expected with apoptosis and because addition of Tet at 96 h resulted in a rapid resumption of cell growth (Fig. 3). The time-dependent effects of Tet removal on enzyme activities and polyamine pools are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. SSAT increased steadily to 22-fold by 48 h before declining slowly from 48 to 144 h (Figs. 2 and 4). This steady decrease in SSAT activity and mRNA may be due to a homeostatic adjustment of gene expression and/or to a time-dependent selection of cells that express lower levels of SSAT. Consistent with the observed rise in enzyme activity, acetylated polyamines increased under –Tet conditions (Fig. 5). Intracellular AcSpd increased remarkably from undetectable levels (<10 pmol/106 cells) to 10,420 pmol/106 cells by 48 h. Other SSAT products, AcSpm and DiAcSpm, which are rarely seen in cells (31Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Putrescine (Put) pools also rose remarkably due presumably to back-conversion of Put from Spd via AcSpd (Fig. 5) and to forward synthesis due to increased ODC activity (described below). Despite the massive accumulation of acetylated polyamines, intracellular levels of Spd and Spm failed to decrease. In fact, the levels of Put, Spd, and Spm increased s"
https://openalex.org/W1988656758,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that mediates cell stress signaling initiated by diverse stimuli, such as H2O2 and TNFα. Owing to its critical role in promoting apoptosis, ASK1 activity is highly controlled in cells. Phosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr-845 has been correlated with its activation, while phosphorylation at Ser-967 negatively controls its death promoting activity. Here, we report the identification of a novel phosphorylation site at Ser-1034 in the C-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1. Mutating Ser-1034 to an unphosphorylatable Ala led to increased catalytic activity of ASK1 and enhanced proapoptotic function of ASK1. Thus, the proapoptotic function of ASK1 is suppressed in part by phosphorylation at its C-terminal regulatory domain, which may couple upstream survival kinases to the death regulatory machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2056296053,"CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), a transcriptional regulator, plays important roles in epigenetics and development. In the present study, we report that overexpression of CTCF in transgenic mice during embryonic development suppresses Pax6 gene expression. This effect causes defects in ocular development that result in microophthalmia. In eye-derived cells transfected with a tetracycline turn-on CTCF system, up-regulation of CTCF expression significantly suppressed Pax6 expression. In contrast, the knockdown of CTCF mRNA resulted in the down-regulation of CTCF protein expression, which in turn enhanced the Pax6 expression. CTCF controls Pax6 transcription by interacting with a repressor element located in the 5′-flanking region upstream of the Pax6 P0 promoter. This interaction suppressed Pax6 gene transcription by blocking the effect of an ectoderm enhancer located 3.5 kb upstream from the P0 promoter. We also found an 80-bp sequence in a region -1.2 kbp upstream from the P0 promoter that contained multiple CTCF binding sites and interacted with nuclear proteins obtained from eye-derived cells forming electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes with CTCF. We conclude that a novel function of CTCF is to regulate Pax6 transcription by binding to the repressor element, which in turn blocks the effect of the ectoderm enhancer resulting in the inhibition of P0 promoter activity.

CTCF is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger (ZF) phosphoprotein. It binds to target sequences with its DNA-binding domain that contains 11 ZFs (1Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C.

As a ZF transcription factor, CTCF shows no significant similarities to any previously found ZF protein. In humans, the CTCF gene is localized at chromosome 16q22.1, one of the smallest regions that overlaps with a common deletion region in breast and prostate cancers (2Filippova G.N. Lindblom A.

In mammalian and avian species, the CTCF protein is expressed in a wide range of adult tissues and cell lines (1Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E.

In various cell types, the CTCF protein is encoded by a 4.1-kb mRNA with a long open reading frame (21.8 kb) and is predicted to be a 728-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 82,000. However, the protein that appears in nuclear extracts shows a band of 130 kDa in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

In addition, CTCF functions as an insulator, mediating the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and H19 genes (7Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Expressions of IGF2 and H19 are only imprinted from the paternal and maternal alleles, respectively. CTCF plays a key role in controlling the imprinted expression of IGF2 and H19 through a DNA methylation-sensitive mechanism (7Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G.

Yoon A. Michelson A.M. Maas R.L. Development. 1999; 126: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulation of the Pax6 transcription is still largely unknown. In particular, little has been described regarding tissue-specific and time-dependent differences in the control of this process during embryonic development and in mature cells.In the present study, we report on an important function of CTCF in regulating the Pax6 transcription in eye development. Increases in CTCF expression effectively suppressed the Pax6 transcription and protein expression in mouse embryos, resulting in underdevelopment of the eye. We have isolated a 4.2-kbp DNA fragment in the 5′-flanking region of the Pax6 gene upstream of the P0 promoter in mouse genomic DNA. The reporter fuses with the DNA fragment, and a serial deletion mutant connects to a LacZ reporter gene. Using the reporter system, P0 promoter activity was analyzed in eye-derived cells. CTCF controls Pax6 transcription through its interaction with the repressor element in the Pax6 gene to affect the ectoderm enhancer and P0 promoter activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—Four cell types, including human retinoblastoma (Rb), rabbit corneal epithelial (RCE), rat myeloid leukemia FDC-P1, and human myeloid leukemia ML-1 cells (27Kang S.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3678-3685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were employed in the present study to test promoter activity. Rb cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). RCE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml insulin. FDC-P1 cells were cultured in phenol red-free 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. ML-1 cells were cultured in 1640 medium with 7.5% fetal bovine serum. All cultured cells were incubated in an incubator supplied with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and RCE cells were passed by digestion using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA.CTCF-transgenic Mice and Embryo Section Preparation—Fertilized eggs from donor mice were injected with a MulI/NotI fragment (∼3.1 kb) containing the CMV promoter region and cDNA encoding full-length CTCF using a microdispenser. CTCF-injected eggs were cultured in vitro for 2 days and then transplanted into the ovarian duct of maternal recipients. They were sacrificed 7, 11, and 14 days after transplantation, and the embryos were collected from the uterus. Harvested embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in preparation for histological examinations. Tissue sections were obtained from paraffin-fixed embryo blocks as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Embryonic tissue samples were dehydrated by serial incubations in 50, 70, 85, 95, and 100% ethanol (30 min at each concentration). After a 10-min incubation of the tissues in xylene, embryos were transferred into tubes that contained xylene/paraffin (50:50) at 60 °C and were kept at room temperature overnight. For paraffin impregnation, mouse embryos were incubated in paraffin at 60 °C for 1 h. Finally, embryonic tissue samples were individually embedded in wax blocks that were cut into 6-μm-thick sections.Reporter Gene Constructs and Expression—A 4.2-kbp DNA fragment upstream of the Pax6 P0 promoter was cloned by PCR using the high fidelity Taq (Platinum® high fidelity, Invitrogen), and mouse genomic DNA was used as a template. The 4.2-kbp DNA fragment was subcloned into a β-galactosidase-Basic vector (Clontech, Redwood, CA). The vector is promoterless and contains the reporter gene LacZ. All of the 5′-end deletion mutants of the 4.2-kbp DNA fragment were individually subcloned into the β-galactosidase-Basic vector. These constructs were designed as P4.2, P3.5, P2.3, and P1.2, respectively. Each of the reporter constructs was individually introduced into target cells by electroporation. Briefly, 107 cells/ml were washed twice and resuspended in PBS. Cells were mixed with 5 μg of the reporter DNA and transferred into a 0.4-cm-gap cuvette (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed in a 300-V electric field with a time constant of 0.5 ms.Tetracycline-inducible Expression of CTCF in RCE Cells—A 2.5-kbp cDNA fragment encoding full-length human CTCF was cloned from mRNA isolated from Rb cells using reverse transcription-PCR and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The CTCF cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA4/To/A expression vector (Invitrogen) for tetracycline-inducible expression experiments. Both constructs of pcDNA4/To/A-CTCF and pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) were co-introduced into RCE cells by electroporation. The stably transfected cells were established by cloning the cells from a single colony and by double selection cultures in the presence of Zeocin and blasticidin. Control cells co-transfected with blank vector pcDNA4/To/A and pcDNA6/TR were also established. The stably transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 10% serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 2 μg/ml blasticidin, and 50 μg/ml Zeocin. For induction expression experiments, 2 μg/ml tetracycline was applied into the culture medium 24 h prior to experiments.Analysis of β-Galactosidase Activity—Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and suspended in an ice-cold lysate buffer containing 100 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw and precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were kept at -80 °C until the analysis of β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was tested by a luminescent β-galactosidase system utilizing a chemiluminescent substrate named Galacton-Star (Clontech). Chemiluminescent signals were detected by exposure of x-ray film or by using a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). To normalize LacZ activity, an internal control vector pBRL-TK (0.2 μg/transfection) from Invitrogen was introduced into RCE or Rb cells together with the Pax6 P0 reporter and mutants. Luciferase activity (for internal controls) was measured using an assay kit supplied by Invitrogen. Reporter activity was normalized by taking a ratio of measured β-galactosidase activity over luciferase activity obtained from the internal control vector (β-galactosidase activity/luciferase activity).Northern Analysis of CTCF—The total RNA from cells was extracted using a guanidium thiocyanate procedure (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar, 31Li T. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32668-32676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were collected for each sample. After rinsing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were immediately lysed with 1 ml of guanidium solution (5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The lysate was extracted three times with 50:50 phenol/chloroform. Finally, the RNAs were placed in ethanol and spun down by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. RNA (20 μg) from each sample was loaded in 1% agarose gel denatured with 2.2 m formaldehyde. The fractionated RNAs were then transferred onto a nylon membrane for later hybridization procedures with α-32P-labeled probes and visualized by the exposure of x-ray films at -80 °C overnight.Western Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—For Western analysis, 5 × 105 cells were harvested in a 0.5-ml lysate buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na-orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Samples were denatured by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and then boiled for 5 min. Samples were fractionated by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then incubated with primary antibodies (1:4000) and secondary anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For immunostaining experiments, tissue sections were made to be membrane-permeable for 30 min in PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), blocked for 1 h with 10% normal horse serum in PBS-T at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, anti-Pax6 (Covance, Princeton, NJ), at 1:100-1:200 dilution in PBS-T. After rinsing three times with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab) was applied for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were washed and mounted in Vectashields (Vector Labs). Analysis was then performed with an Olympus epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Fluoview with a ×40 objective lens).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells (5 × 107) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and suspended in ice-cold cell homogenization buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9. The intact nuclei released from cells were collected and then suspended in 1 ml of nuclear suspension buffer containing 400 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9. Nuclear proteins were extracted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min and transferred into a new tube for storage at -80 °C. A 32P-labeled DNA probe (80 bp) that contained five CTCF binding sites was synthesized by PCR and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition, a mutant probe was made by replacing five CCCTC repeats (putative CTCF interaction sites) in the 80-bp probe with five CGATC sequences, respectively. For each gel shift assay, 10 μg of nuclear extracts (10 μl) were incubated with 30 fm32P-labeled DNA probe (1 μl), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (1 μl), 20% Ficoll 400 (5 μl), and 3 μl of H2O. Competitive reactions were conducted by adding 1 pm non-labeled DNA probe into each sample. The reactions were carried out through incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. DNA-protein complexes were displayed by electrophoresis on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried with a vacuum gel drier and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. For the supershift assay, DNA-protein complexes were further incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C with the anti-CTCF antibody and other control antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSWe studied the functional correlation between CTCF and Pax6 expression by introducing a CTCF transgene in the early developmental stages of the mouse embryo. The effect of overexpression of CTCF in eye development was observed in transgenic mice. Control mice were only injected with the CMV promoter. Embryos were collected at stages E11 and E14. We found that there were significant defects in eye development in CTCF-overexpressed mouse embryos. Injected mice had underdeveloped eyes (Fig. 1A). In transgenic mice with small eye defects, the lens size was also markedly reduced and deformed. Eye sections of CTCF-transgenic mice were compared with the controls. The eyecup of CTCF-transgenic mice did not fully develop (Fig. 1B). In addition, there were reduced populations of cells in the retina, lens, and cornea in transgenic mice. Mouse embryos analyzed in our experiments were collected at stages E11 and E14. There were a total of 81 CTCF-transgenic mouse embryos found with the small eye phenotype. These results suggest that there is a correlation between CTCF function and eye development.Levels of exogenous CTCF DNA in mouse embryonic tissues were determined by PCR using specific primers according to the promoter region sequence of the CMV-CTCF construct. Genomic DNA templates were individually isolated from 26 transgenic mice and 26 control mice. We found a single band of exogenous CMV-CTCF DNA with an expected molecular size of 0.4 kbp detected in 24 of 26 transgenic mice but not in the control mice (Fig. 2A). Expressions of the CTCF protein in transgenic and control mice were detected with immunostaining using a specific anti-CTCF antibody (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence activity of the CTCF protein was markedly increased in the eye obtained from the E14 transgenic mouse embryo compared with the control eye. Because Pax6 is crucial for eye development, further analysis was done to probe for endogenous Pax6 expressions in the eye of the E14 mouse embryo by immunostaining using the anti-Pax6 antibody. There was evidence for immunoreactive staining of Pax6 in the lens and corneal epithelial cells in control mice. In contrast, endogenous Pax6 expression was markedly diminished in the eye of CTCF-transgenic mice (Fig. 2C). Overexpression of CTCF in mouse embryos resulted in decreases in endogenous Pax6 expression, suggesting that the Pax6 gene expression may be a downstream event from CTCF. These results demonstrate that an increase in CTCF expression in transgenic mice suppresses the Pax6 gene expression, resulting in defective eye development.Fig. 2CTCF and endogenous Pax6 expressions in mouse embryonic tissues.A, detection of CMV-CTCF transgene in mouse embryos by PCR. Two primers used in the PCR reaction were designed according to the sequence in the CMV promoter region 0.4 kbp upstream from the starting codon of CTCF cDNA. B, expression of CTCF proteins in control and CTCF-transgenic mouse eyes. CTCF proteins were detected using anti-CTCF antibody in the control and transgenic mouse cornea and lens using immunostaining. Pictures were taken under a Nikon fluorescent microscope with a ×40 objective. C, endogenous Pax6 expression in control and CTCF-transgenic mice. Expression of Pax6 was detected in the cornea (C), lens (L), and retina (R) in control and CTCF-transgenic mice by a specific anti-Pax6 antibody. Arrows indicate the Pax6 protein detected by the specific anti-Pax6 antibody in an enlarged scale. By using a Nikon microscope, images were taken by a digital camera (×10 objective).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of CTCF on Pax6 expression was also studied in eye-derived RCE cells. CTCF cDNA was subcloned into a TREx system (the construct is named as pcDNA4/To-CTCF DP), and the sequence was confirmed with DNA sequencing using a T7 primer. Gene and protein expressions of CTCF in RCE cells were detected by Northern and Western analyses using the cloned cDNA probe and a specific antibody, respectively. A stable RCE cell line co-transfected with pcDNA4/To-CTCF and pcDNA6/TR was established by double selections with Zeocin (50 μg/ml) and blasticidin (2 μg/ml). After the induction of tetracycline, CTCF mRNA levels were markedly increased, whereas the Pax6 protein expression was suppressed in this cell line (Fig. 3A). RCE cells transfected with the pcDNA4/To vector and pcDNA6/TR served as controls. Statistical analysis indicated that there was a significant increase in the CTCF mRNA expression, whereas the Pax6 protein expression fell upon induction of RCE cells with tetracycline (Fig. 3B; n = 3, p < 0.01). In addition, CTCF protein levels were detected with Western analysis using a CTCF-specific antibody confirming the increase in the CTCF protein expression in the tetracycline-induced and CTCF-transfected cells (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Effect of tetracycline-induced CTCF overexpression on Pax6 protein expression.A, tetracycline (Tet)-induced overexpression of CTCF resulted in suppression of Pax6 protein expression. The effect of CTCF on the Pax6 expression was examined in RCE cells. RCE cells were stably co-transfected with a tetracycline-inducible pcDNA4/To/A-CTCF construct and pcDNA6/TR or pcDNA4 control vector. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. B, statistical significance of increase in CTCF mRNA expression correlated to the down-regulation of the Pax6 protein expression. These experiments were repeated in three independent trials, and the statistical analysis demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.01). C, detection of tetracycline-induced CTCF protein expression in cotransfected cells by Western analysis. RCE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 2 μg/ml blasticidin and 50 μg/ml Zeocin. To induce CTCF expression, tetracycline (2 μg/ml) was applied into the culture medium 24 h prior to experiments. β-Actin protein was detected using the specific antibody as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further prove that CTCF regulates Pax6 expression, we knocked down endogen"
https://openalex.org/W1992004495,"Overexpression of the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a common molecular feature in subsets of sex-steroid-related tumors including endometrium and breast carcinomas that are associated with poor prognosis. Pharmacological inhibition of tumor-associated FAS hyperactivity is under investigation as a chemotherapeutic target. We examined the effects of the mycotoxin cerulenin (a covalent FAS inactivator), and the novel small compound C75 (a slow-binding FAS inhibitor) on estradiol (E2)- and tamoxifen (TAM)-stimulated ER-driven molecular responses in Ishikawa cells, an in vitro model of well-differentiated human endometrial carcinoma. We evaluated the effects of FAS inhibition on E2- and TAM-induced estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activity by using transient cotransfection assays with an estrogen-response element reporter construct (ERE-Luciferase). Antiestrogenic effects of cerulenin and C75 were observed by dose-dependent inhibition of E2-stimulated ERE-dependent transcription, whereas FAS inhibitors did not significantly increase the levels of ERE transcriptional activity in the absence of E2. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of FAS activity completely abolished TAM-stimulated ERE activity. To address the reliability of transient transfection assays, the effects of FAS inhibitors on E2-inducible gene products were evaluated. FAS blockade induced a dose-dependent decrease in E2-inducible alkaline phosphatase activity. E2-stimulated accumulation of progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2/neu oncogene was abolished in the presence of FAS blockers. FAS inhibition also resulted in a marked downregulation of E2-stimulated ERα expression, and noticeably impaired E2-induced ERα nuclear accumulation. A dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation and cell viability was observed after FAS blockade. A Cell Death ELISA, detecting DNA fragmentation, demonstrated that FAS inhibitors stimulated apoptosis of Ishikawa cells. The analysis of critical E2- and TAM-related cell cycle proteins revealed an increase of both the expression and the nuclear accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27Kip1 following FAS inhibition. To rule out non-FAS cerulenin- and C75-related effects, we finally monitored ER signaling after silencing of FAS gene expression using the highly sequence-specific mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi). The concentrations of E2 and TAM inducing half-maximal ERE activity (EC50) dramatically increased (>100 times) in FAS RNAi-transfected Ishikawa cells. Moreover, depletion of FAS by RNAi also caused loss of ERα expression, downregulation of PR, and accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27Kip1 in E2-stimulated Ishikawa cells. If chemically stable FAS inhibitors or cell-selective vector systems able to deliver RNAi targeting FAS gene demonstrate systemic anticancer effects in vivo, our results render FAS as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of endometrial carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2142496621,"A common mechanism by which the tumor suppressor p53 accumulates in the nucleus following cellular stress is through the attenuation of its interaction with MDM2, a protein involved in the nuclear export and degradation of p53. This is accomplished by induced modifications of p53, MDM2 or both. We have previously found that the kinase and mRNA synthesis inhibitor DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) induces the nuclear accumulation of p53 without concomitant phosphorylation of the ser15 site of p53, which is thought to be a modification important for the attenuation of p53–MDM2 interaction. It has been proposed that the mechanism by which p53 accumulates following blockage of transcription involves the downregulation of MDM2 expression. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and found that after DRB treatment, p53 accumulated despite the fact that MDM2 levels remained high in human cells. Furthermore, over expression of MDM2 did not prevent the accumulation of p53 following DRB treatment. In, addition, p53 accumulating in the nucleus after DRB treatment was able to interact with MDM2 and was ubiquitylated. These findings suggest that blockage of transcription induce the nuclear accumulation of p53 without breaking the p53–MDM2 regulation loop."

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 175-183Google Scholar), and it has been an attractive model for studying protein structures and dynamics. Recently PYP gained further attention as the structural prototype for the PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) and LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage) domains of a large class of receptor proteins (2Pellequer J.-L.

Photoexcitation of PYPdark triggers a photocycle that involves two major intermediate states denoted PYPL (also called I1 or pR) and PYPM (also called I2 or pB) (7Meyer T.E. Yakali E.

Fennema H.P.M. Gijen J. Koomen G.-J. Verhoeven J.W. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31949-31956Google Scholar, 10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar), it is still not clear what structural factors promote the protonation reaction. To address this issue, we have performed resonance Raman (RR) investigations of PYPL and report a novel finding for two conformations in the active site of this intermediate state. The two conformations are in a pH-dependent equilibrium with pKa ∼6, and a normal coordinate analysis based on the density functional theory (DFT) indicates that the low pH conformation lacks a hydrogen bond between Glu46 and the phenolic O1 (Fig. 1). We propose that the newly found low pH form is an active conformation for the protonation reaction during the PYPL → PYPM process, whereas the high pH form is a direct photointermediate from PYPdark. Sample Preparations—Expression of wild-type (WT) and Glu46 → Gln (E46Q) mutant apoproteins from Escherichia coli, chromophore reconstitution, and protein purification were performed as described previously (11Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 876-880Google Scholar). PYP in buffered D2O (90% D2O/10% H2O) was prepared by proper dilution of a concentrated protein into D2O, and then the sample was incubated overnight at room temperature before the measurements. The 13C-labeled 4-hydroxycinnamic acids were synthesized as described previously (12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). 13C-Labeled PYPs were prepared by reconstitution of apoprotein with 4-hydroxycinnamic anhydride whose carbonyl carbon atom (C9) or ring carbon atoms (C1–C6) were labeled with 13C. These labeled samples are denoted as 13C=O and 13C6-ring isotopomers, respectively. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—RR spectra were obtained as described previously (6El-Mashtoly S.F. Unno M.

A., Inc.) removed the excitation light, and a Spex 500M spectrometer dispersed the scattered light. Samples were excited with the 413.1 nm line available from a krypton ion laser (BeamLok 2065, Spectra-Physics Lasers, Inc.). The measurements were made on samples contained in a quartz spinning cell (10-mm diameter, 800 rpm), and a transit time of the sample in the beam was ∼200 μs. We performed the measurement of PYPdark with a low laser power (0.24 mW), while the higher laser power (2.9 mW) was used for PYPL. The lifetimes of the photocycle intermediates preceding the PYPL are shorter than that of the PYPL more than 50-fold (15Ujj L. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Atkinson G.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 406-412Google Scholar), so that their populations are negligible under the present experimental conditions. RR spectra of PYPL were obtained by subtracting a fraction of the normalized low power spectrum from the normalized high power one such that the sharp ν11 mode (1631 cm–1) of PYPdark disappeared without introducing spurious derivative band shapes or negative peaks. Note that a higher laser power (8.9 mW) was used to measure the high power spectrum in our previous work (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar). We have found, however, that the spectrum of PYPL exhibits laser power dependence, e.g. the frequency of ν25 (see below) was affected by a high laser power, possibly due to a formation of a photoproduct of PYPL. Thus we used lower laser powers in the present study. DFT Calculations—The optimized geometry and the harmonic vibrational frequency were calculated via Gaussian98 program (16Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W.

The hybrid functional B3LYP and the 6-31G** basis set were used for the DFT calculations. The calculated frequencies were scaled using a factor 0.9613. For some cases, we used the Onsager reaction field method (17Onsager L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1936; 58: 1486-1493Google Scholar) to take into account the dielectric constant in protein. Effects of pH on the Resonance Raman Spectra of PYPL—Fig. 2 depicts the transient RR spectra of WT PYPL with a 200-μs time resolution at pH 8.1–4.5 (traces a–e). The RR spectrum at neutral pH (trace b) is in agreement with that reported previously (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S.

Tokunaga, and S. Yamauchi, manuscript in preparation. Fig. 2 also demonstrates significant changes in the spectrum as a function of pH. Above pH 7.0 (traces a and b), a carbonyl C=O stretching vibration ν11 and a coupled C=C stretching mode ν13 are characterized by a peak at 1672 cm–1 with a shoulder of ∼1655 cm–1 and a peak at 1553 cm–1 with a shoulder of ∼1575 cm–1, respectively. Lowering pH increases the intensity of the shoulders, and both ν11 and ν13 bands become unresolved doublets at pH 4.5. Similarly, a coupled C=C stretching mode ν14 at 1530 cm–1 and a C=C stretching/C–H rocking mode ν17 at 1441 cm–1 are upshifted by ∼10 cm–1 upon lowering pH (Table I). We note that the RR spectrum of PYPdark exhibits little changes in the examined pH region (see supplemental Fig. 1S). In Fig. 2, we also find significant effects of Glu46 → Gln (E46Q) mutation on the spectrum of PYPL (trace f). Similar to the case of lowering pH, E46Q mutation causes an increase in intensity around 1655 (ν11) and 1576 cm–1 (ν13) as well as an upshift of ν14 and ν17.Table IObserved and calculated vibrational frequency (cm–1) of PYPL and its modelsνobsaExperimentally observed values.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A shows the ν11 region of the RR spectra of PYPL at pH 7.4, whose chromophore is unlabeled or labeled with 13Catthe carbonyl carbon atom, as well as the results of peak-fitting. The 12C/13C isotope substitution downshifts the whole doublet by ∼35 cm–1, demonstrating that both components originate from the ν11 mode. This observation implies that there are two conformations where the ν11 frequency is different. Here we denote the high and low pH conformations as PYP hL and PYP lL, respectively. In Fig. 3B, the integrated intensities of the ν11 band for PYP lL are plotted relative to that for PYP hL by changing pH and fitted to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (19Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990Google Scholar) with pKa = 6.0 ± 0.4. We also plot analogous relative intensities for ν13 in the figure. The latter plot is fitted with pKa = 6.4 ± 0.2. The reasonable agreement of the two pKa values indicates that the observed spectral changes are due to a pH-dependent equilibrium between two species, PYPLh and PYPL1. To examine the chromophore structure for these conformations, we have performed further investigations as described below. Protonation State of Chromophore—The deuteration effects on the ν33 band around 720 cm–1 and the ν32 + 2γ12 doublet around 850 cm–1 act as markers for the protonation state of the chromophore (6El-Mashtoly S.F. Unno M. Kumauchi M. Hamada N. Fujiwara K. Sasaki J. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2279-2287Google Scholar, 12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). These Raman bands are examined in Fig. 4A, which displays the 600–950 cm–1 region of the RR spectra of WT PYPL at pH 7.4 and those of the E46Q mutant at pH 6.5. These samples contain mainly PYPLh and PYPL1, respectively. For comparison, the figure also illustrates the spectra of WT PYPM (12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). The ν33 mode is observed at ∼720 cm–1 for the protonated chromophore in PYPM,dark and PYPM (traces f–h) (6El-Mashtoly S.F. Unno M. Kumauchi M. Hamada N. Fujiwara K. Sasaki J. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2279-2287Google Scholar, 12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). Because this mode includes O1-C1 and C4-C7 stretching coordinates such as Y13 of tyrosine (20Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1981: 113-175Google Scholar), it exhibits ∼3 and ∼10 cm–1 downshifts upon deuterium substitution of the hydroxyl group (trace f → g) and 13C6-ring labeling (trace f → h), respectively. The ν32 + 2γ12 doublet is observed as a broad Raman band at ∼840 cm–1 for PYPM,dark and PYPM (6El-Mashtoly S.F. Unno M. Kumauchi M. Hamada N. Fujiwara K. Sasaki J. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2279-2287Google Scholar, 12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). This doublet arises from the Fermi resonance between the ring-breathing vibration ν32 and the overtone of an out-of-plane ring-bending vibration γ12. Because of the removal of the Fermi resonance, the band shape of the doublet significantly changes upon deuteration of the phenolic OH group (trace f → g) or 13C6-ring substitution (trace f → h). In the case of WT PYPL at pH 7.4, we assign a band at 737 cm–1 and a broad feature around 840 cm–1 to ν33 and the ν32 + 2γ12 doublet, respectively, on the basis of their –11 and –22 cm–113C6-ring shifts (trace a → c). In contrast to PYPM,dark and PYPM, the deuterium substitution of exchangeable protons little affect these Raman bands for WT PYPL at pH 7.4 (trace a → b). Analogous experimental data for the E46Q mutant (trace d → e) do not exhibit any significant H/D isotope substitution effects in the 600–950 cm–1 region nor do WT PYP at pH 5.5 (not shown). This demonstrates that the chromophore is deprotonated for the PYP hL and PYP lL species. We can therefore exclude a possibility that the low pH component observed here is the other intermediate such as PYPM or its preceding intermediate (21Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Google Scholar), whose chromophore is protonated (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar, 12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar, 13Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 4233-4234Google Scholar, 18Pan D. Philip A. Hoff W.D. Mathies R.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2374-2382Google Scholar). In addition, the extinction coefficient of these blue-shifted intermediates at the 413.1 nm excitation is essentially zero (8Hoff W.D. Stokkum I.H.M. van Ramesdonk H.J. van Brederode M.E. Brouwer A.M. Fitch J.C. Meyer T.E. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1691-1705Google Scholar, 22Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1180-1191Google Scholar), so their contribution to the RR spectra will be negligible. We comment on the other Raman bands that are sensitive to the protonation state of the chromophore. Previous Raman studies on PYP and a chromophore model (4Kim M. Mathies R.A. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12669-12672Google Scholar, 6El-Mashtoly S.F. Unno M. Kumauchi M. Hamada N. Fujiwara K. Sasaki J. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2279-2287Google Scholar, 10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar) have shown that the protonation state of the chromophore affects the frequency of the ν25 and ν14/ν13 modes. However, these modes are also sensitive to different factors such as trans/cis isomerization of the chromophore (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar) or the dielectric constant in the vicinity of the chromophore (6El-Mashtoly S.F. Unno M. Kumauchi M. Hamada N. Fujiwara K. Sasaki J. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2279-2287Google Scholar). Thus the deuteration effects on ν33 and the ν32 + 2γ12 doublet are more reliable to determine the protonation state of the phenolic OH group. Another possible marker for the chromophore protonation is the combined C1-O1 stretching and HC7 = C8H bending modes ν22 and ν23 near 1250–1300 cm–1 (12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). Although these modes were recently used to characterize the chromophore structure in PYPL (18Pan D. Philip A. Hoff W.D. Mathies R.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2374-2382Google Scholar), a strong overlap with the nearby Raman bands complicates the interpretation of the data. We will discuss the details of the assignments in this region elsewhere.2 Isomerization State of Chromophore—Fig. 4B shows the 900–1150 cm–1 region of the RR spectra of WT PYPL. The spectra of natural abundance (trace i) and 13C=O-labeled (trace j) PYPs at pH 7.4 and their difference spectrum (trace k) confirm a previous result (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar) that the C8-C9 stretching mode ν29 appears as a Raman band near 1000 cm–1. The figure also demonstrates the data for WT PYP at pH 5.5 (traces l–n). The ν29 frequency is sensitive to trans/cis isomerization around the C7=C8 bond (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar, 12Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 2837-2845Google Scholar). The trans configuration exhibits the ν29 band at ∼1050 cm–1, whereas ν29 for the cis form is 990–1000 cm–1. As can be seen in the figure, lowering pH does not affect the ν29 frequency, indicating a cis configuration chromophore both for PYP hL and PYP lL. Structural Models for PYP hL and PYP lL—As discussed above, the results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that both PYP hL and PYP lL contain the deprotonated cis-chromophore. This implies that the two conformations differ in chromophore-protein interactions. To discuss the observed differences, we have performed normal coordinate calculations based on DFT. For these calculations, deprotonated cis-4-hydroxycinnamyl methyl thiolester was employed as a chromophore model. In addition, methanol and acetic acid were included to mimic the hydrogen bonds of the phenolic O1 with Tyr42 and Glu46, respectively. These components were arranged on the basis of the crystal structure of a cryotrapped intermediate preceding PYPL (23Genick U. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Canestrelli I.L. Getzoff E.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Google Scholar) and subsequently optimized to yield the structure illustrated in supplemental Fig. 2S and Table 1S (model 1). This model has been shown to be a good model for the active site of PYP hL (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar), and the calculated frequencies are summarized in Table I. We used the following optimized structures as models for PYP lL (supplemental Fig. 2S and Table 1S). Models 2 and 3 contain only one hydrogen bond with Tyr42 and Glu46, respectively. The two hydrogen bonds are removed in model 4, whereas model 5 considers an additional hydrogen bond at the carbonyl O2 with water. Model 6 is similar to model 1, but the rest of the protein is treated by continuum electrostatics with ϵ = 20. As can be seen in Table I, model 2 explains the main features for PYP lL, i.e. the removal of a hydrogen bond with Glu46 shifts ν11 and ν13 by –9 and +12 cm–1, respectively. Furthermore, the observed upshifts of ν14 and ν17 by ∼10 cm–1 are consistent with the calculations. In contrast, the other models failed to reproduce the difference between PYP hL and PYP lL, suggesting that model 2 is a plausible active site structure of PYP lL. The observation that the RR spectrum of E46Q PYP is similar to that of WT PYP lL (Fig. 2) supports an importance of the hydrogen bond between the phenolic O1 and Glu46. Note that model 4, where the hydrogen bond with Glu46 is also missing, explains some features of PYP lL, but the predicted effect of removing the two hydrogen bonds is significantly larger compared with the observed difference between PYP hL and PYP lL. Here we should discuss a titratable group that regulates the equilibrium between PYP hL and PYP lL with pKa ∼6. One of the possible candidates is Glu46 because of an importance of its hydrogen bond with the phenolic O1 of the chromophore. This explanation implies that the carboxyl group of Glu46 is protonated in PYP lL, whereas it is deprotonated in PYP hL. This idea, however, is unlikely, because previous Fourier transform infrared studies (21Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Google Scholar, 24Imamoto Y. Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Bojkova N. Yoshihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12905-12908Google Scholar, 25Brudler R. Rammelsberg R. Woo T.T. Getzoff E.D. Gerwert K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 265-270Google Scholar) showed that Glu46 is protonated at pH 7, where PYP hL is a dominant fraction. Another possible residue is His3 or His108, because the pKa of the imidazole group in aqueous solution is about 6 (19Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990Google Scholar). However, it seems that these residues are situated in positions far a bit from the active site. For example, the α carbon of His3 and His108 is located more than 10 Å from the carboxyl group of Glu46 (3Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Google Scholar). Further experiments of PYP mutants are needed to identify a residue that controls the equilibrium between the two conformations. The PYPL → PYPM process involves the protonation of the phenolic O1 of the chromophore (9Kroon A.R. Hoff W.D. Fennema H.P.M. Gijen J. Koomen G.-J. Verhoeven J.W. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. J.

Hoff W.D. Mathies R.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2374-2382Google Scholar). In this study, we suggest that the absence or weakening of the hydrogen bond between the phenolic O1 and Glu46 in PYP lL. Because previous studies using site-directed mutagenesis showed that the removal of a hydrogen bond at the phenolic O1 favors a protonation of the chromophore (5Devanathan S. Brudler R. Hessling B.

Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2279-2287Google Scholar), the formation of PYP lL potentially promotes the protonation process. In fact, both lowering pH and E46Q mutation increase the fraction of PYP lL and accelerate the PYPL → PYPM transition by a factor of 3–6-fold (26Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Google Scholar). In addition, although the actual PYPL → PYPM transition exhibits a complex pH dependence (22Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1180-1191Google Scholar), this process was characterized by a pKa around 6 (26Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Google Scholar). These results suggest that the photoexcitation of PYPdark initially produce PYP hL (10Unno M. Kumauchi M. Sasaki J. Tokunaga F. Yamauchi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5668-5674Google Scholar), and the low pH form PYP lL could be an active structure for the PYPL → PYPM process. To examine this idea, further studies using time-resolved RR studies of WT and some PYP mutants are currently in progress. We are grateful to R. Nakamura (Osaka University) for helpful discussion and K. Yoshihara (Suntory Institute for Bioorganic Research) for assistance in preparing the 13C-labeled compounds.

The Fc receptor γ (FcR-γ) chain is a ubiquitous immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing dimeric subunit, γ2, which in humans associates with both the activating members of the leukocyte receptor cluster, including the IgA receptor FcαRI, and the classical Fc receptors, including the IgE receptor FcϵRI. This study identifies a new site in the transmembrane region of FcR-γ that affects receptor assembly and surface expression with FcαRI but not with FcϵRI. The wild type complex, FcαRI-γ2WT, remains robustly associated in both Brij-96 and Thesit detergent conditions. However, mutation of either Tyr25 or Cys26 of FcR-γ, near the interface of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, resulted in impaired FcR-γ association with FcαRI. This association was disrupted in the presence of the detergent Brij-96 but was preserved in milder conditions using the detergent Thesit. Ligand-mediated cross-linking of the FcαRI-γ2Y25F mutant receptor resulted in diminished signal transduction, including an abnormal calcium response, compared with the FcαRI-γ2WT receptor. Furthermore, the FcαRI-γ2Y25F mutant receptor was expressed at the cell surface at ∼10% of that of the wild type, whereas the surface expression of FcϵRI-γ2Y25F was not significantly different from the wild type. In contrast, although the FcαRI-γ2C26S mutant was also less stably associated, it was not reduced in surface expression or function. Thus, these TM residues of FcR-γ are important for association with FcαRI and probably other activating LRC members but not with the classical FcR, FcϵRI.

FcR-γ is the most widespread of such signal transduction subunits, being present on macrophages, monocytes, NK cells, platelets, eosinophils, mast cells, and some T cells. It associates with a number of immunoreceptors, including the IgA receptor FcαRI in humans (5Enyedy E.J. Nambiar M.P. Liossis S.N. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C.

FcαRI not associated with FcR-γ can bind, endocytose, and recycle IgA (14Launay P. Patry C. Lehuen A. Pasquier B. Blank U. Monteiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7216-7225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Some control of association can occur, since assembly of FcαRI with FcR-γ does not occur in colostral neutrophils although FcR-γ is present (15Honorio-Franca A.C. Launay P. Carneiro-Sampaio M.M. Monteiro R.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar). FcR-γ also associates with the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI and the IgG receptors FcγRI and FcγRIIIa (16Takai T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 580-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FcR-γ associates with the collagen receptor gpVI on platelets and, in humans, the activating leukocyte Ig-like receptors, which like FcαRI are members of the leukocyte receptor cluster (LRC) encoded at chromosome 19q13.4 (17Borges L.

In mice, a small family of LRC homologues, the paired Ig-like receptors, also associate with FcR-γ (20Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp.

The FcR-γ subunit is a disulfide-linked homodimer, γ2, with each chain consisting of five extracellular residues, a putative 21-residue transmembrane region (residues 6–26), and a cytoplasmic domain of 42 residues, containing an immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif essential for cell activation. A potentially charged transmembrane aspartic residue, Asp11, is required for dimerization and is also important in the interaction with ligand binding receptor subunits. FcαRI (6Pfefferkorn L.C.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar) each contain a transmembrane arginine residue essential for interaction with FcR-γ. Other FcR-γ residues besides Asp11 are likely to be important in the assembly of FcR-γ in immunoreceptors. In this study, we have focused on residues at the interface of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Thus, we have investigated FcR-γ residues Tyr25 and Cys26 just prior to the stop transfer sequence R27L28K29. This paper addresses whether mutant FcR-γ, altered in transmembrane residue Tyr25 or Cys26, signals normally in association with FcαRI (CD89) as a ligand binding subunit. Mutation of either residue impaired assembly of FcR-γ with FcαRI, but only the FcαRI-γ2Y25 mutant receptor was functionally defective, exhibiting reduced surface expression and signal transduction. Neither the Y25F nor C26S FcR-γ mutants appeared to be impaired in expression with FcϵRI, indicating that the role of these residues in receptor assembly is possibly restricted to interaction with activating LRC receptors. Antibodies—The FcR-γ peptide CLKHEKPPQ coupled to ovalbumin using a maleimide kit (Pierce) was used to produce a polyclonal rabbit anti-FcR γ as described (25Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K.

PE-conjugated A59 was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). HRP-conjugated mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma. Construction and Mutagenesis of Receptor Expression Constructs—Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were all from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) except for PCR applications, which used the polymerase Pwo (Roche Applied Science). Human FcR-γ chain was amplified from cDNA prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) and PCR with the oligonucleotides HT79 TCGGATCCACCATGATTCCAGCAGTGGTC and HT80 TTCTCGAGCTACTGTGGTGGTTTC and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pMXI (29Nolan G.P. Shatzman A.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mutations Y25F and C26S were introduced by splice overlap extension using standard molecular biology techniques. The plasmid pMXpuro was constructed by exchanging the EGFP sequence in pMXI with the puromycin gene of pAPEX3p (30Evans M.J. Hartman S.L. Wolff D.W. Rollins S.A. Squinto S.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PCR was used to amplify the FcαRI (31Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp.

The construct encoding FcR-γ FLAG-tagged at the mature N terminus was a gift from Dr. L. Lanier (35Wu J. Cherwinski H. Spies T. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Exp.

Transduction of IIa1.6 Cells for IgA Receptor Expression—Human FcR-γ wild type (WT) and mutant cDNAs in pMXI-EGFP were transfected into the packaging line Phoenix (29Nolan G.P. Shatzman A.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.uib.no/mbi/nolan/NL-phoenix.html). Recombinant virus was used to infect the murine B cell line IIa1.6 lacking endogenous Fc receptors (37Jones B. Tite J.P. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). The transduced cells were selected for FcR-γ expression, using flow cytometry to sort for EGFP expression. Subsequent infection with recombinant retrovirus expressing the FcαRI or FcϵRI cDNA in pMXpuro provided the ligand binding subunit for the receptor. After selection in puromycin, FcαRI-expressing cells were sorted using PE-conjugated anti-FcαRI mAb A59 (Pharmingen) (27Monteiro R.C. Cooper M.D. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1764-1770PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of FcR-γ surface expression, IIa1.6 cells expressing FcαRI were transduced with retrovirus expressing the FLAG-tagged WT FcR-γ or the Y25F or C26S mutants. FACS Analysis of Cells Expressing Fc Receptors—Cells expressing FcR-γ and FcαRI were incubated with a 1:25 dilution of PE-conjugated mAb A59 (Pharmingen) for 40 min on ice and washed with PBS (20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). FcϵRI expression was measured by IgE binding. Briefly, cells were incubated with mouse IgE myeloma TIB142 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) supernatant for 40 min, on ice, washed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of 0.5 mg/ml biotin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig followed by 1:200 of 0.5 mg/ml PE-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen). The surface expression of FLAG-tagged FcR-γ subunits was measured by sequential incubation of cells with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (25 μg/ml), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG1 (10 μg/ml), and PE-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen). Immunoprecipitation of the IgA Receptor—Gamma Bind G Sepharose™ (Amersham Biosciences) (20 μl) was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 2 μl of A59 ascites for each immunoprecipitation. IIa1.6 cells (1 × 107 cells/immunoprecipitation), unlabeled or surface-biotinylated for 40 min on ice in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexonate, Pierce), were collected by centrifugation and lysed for 10 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Brij-96 or 0.05% Thesit (synonyms: polidocanol or polyexyethylene 9 lauryl ether; Sigma). Cell lysis with Thesit can preserve easily disrupted membrane protein interactions, including the detection of oligomers of the BCR (38Schamel W.W. Reth M. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Schamel W.W. Reth M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The concentration of Thesit was titered to optimize recovery of intact IgA receptor complexes. The minimum concentration of Thesit that yielded more than 50% recovery of FcαRI from the cells was 0.05% (data not shown). In addition, lysis buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), and one mini-complete protease tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to an aliquot of A59-loaded Gamma Bind G Sepharose and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Analysis of samples used SDS-PAGE and semidry transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to established procedures (40Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 10.2-10.8Google Scholar). Immunodetection of biotinylated receptor was performed using streptavidin/HRP (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:10,000 in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl containing 1% bovine serum albumin (CSL, Melbourne, Australia) for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Detection of total FcR-γ chain used rabbit anti-FcR-γ chain followed by anti-rabbit Ig/HRP (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), both at 1:10,000 dilution, and ECL reagents. Likewise, detection of total FcαRI used goat anti-FcαRI (41van Zandbergen G. Westerhuis R. Mohamad N.K. van De Winkel J.G. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5806-5812PubMed Google Scholar), followed by anti-goat Ig/HRP (Dako), both at a 1:10,000 dilution, and ECL reagents. Semiquantitative analysis of immunoblots used Scion Image for Windows Version beta 4.0.2, with uncalibrated OD (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Since the FcR-γ chain has only five extracellular amino acid residues, biotinylation was only possible through the N-terminal amino group, and longer exposures were required to detect labeled FcR-γ than were required for detection of the FcαRI. Detection of Phosphorylation following Stimulation of Cells via the IgA Receptor—Transduced IIa1.6 cells were incubated with serum IgA (CSL) at a final concentration of 12 μg/ml for 1 h on ice and warmed to 37 °C for 1 min prior to the addition of a 1:50 dilution of sheep Fab′2 anti-human IgA (Silenus, Melbourne, Australia) to initiate cross-linking of the IgA receptor. Control activation of the cells used 2 μl of 150 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) to cross-link the endogenous BCR. Cells (1 × 106; 50 μl) were lysed in an equal volume of 0.5% Brij-96 in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4 containing one mini-complete protease tablet (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min on ice. The cleared lysate was analyzed by Western immunoblot as described above using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 conjugated with HRP. Analysis of Syk phosphorylation used 1 × 107 cells with the stimulation, lysis, immunoprecipitation (2 μl of rabbit anti-Syk), and Western analysis (10% reducing SDS-PAGE) as described above. To detect total Syk Western blots were probed with the rabbit anti-Syk antiserum (1:2000 dilution), and phosphorylated Syk was detected using 4G10-HRP. One-way analysis of variance using a Dunnet multiple comparison test was used to compare the levels of Syk phosphorylation in the mutant cells to WT cells and used the program GraphPad Instat® (GaphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Calcium Measurements in IgA Receptor-expressing Cells—Transduced IIa1.6 cells were incubated in measurement buffer (20 mm HEPES, 138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.2 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and to each ml was added 2 μl of 2 mm Fura2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 2 μl of 25% (w/v) pluronic acid (Molecular Probes) in Me2SO for 20–30 min at 37 °C with shaking. Fura2-loaded cells (106)in 100-μl aliquots were incubated with serum IgA (CSL) at a final concentration of 16 μg/ml for 10 min at 37 °C in a well of a black 96-well plate (NUNC, Naperville, IL). Excitation was at 340/380 nm, and emission (510 nm) was recorded on a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia) at 1.5-s intervals. At 20 s, injection of 100 μl of a 1:25 dilution of sheep anti-human IgA (Silenus, Melbourne, Australia) initiated cross-linking of the IgA receptor, or injection of goat F(ab)′2 anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, Cochranville, PA) initiated cross-linking of the BCR. Cytosolic free Ca2+ was calculated using a Kd value of 224 nm for Ca2+ and Fura2 as described (42Moonga B.S. Li S. Iqbal J. Davidson R. Shankar V.S. Bevis P.J. Inzerillo A. Abe E. Huang C.L. Zaidi M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F921-F932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of variance using a Dunnet multiple comparison test was used to compare the mutant data sets to WT for the times with peak [Ca2+]i concentration after stimulation. WT and Mutant FcR-γ Remain Associated with FcαRI under Mild Lysis Conditions—Recombinant retrovirus infection of IIa1.6 cells generated cells expressing FcαRI and FcR-γ chain, WT or the Y25F or the C26S mutant. FACS analysis showed that the FACS-selected pools of transduced cells were matched for FcαRI expression (Fig. 1, F–H) and for expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1, B–D). EGFP expression is linked to FcR-γ expression, since both are translated from the same bicistronic mRNA containing an internal ribosome entry site. The cell surface proteins of the WT (FcαRI-γ2) and mutant (FcαRI-γ2Y25F and FcαRI-γ2C26S) receptor-expressing cell lines were labeled with biotin, the cells were lysed, using 0.05% Thesit to minimize disruption of the receptor complexes, and the FcαRI was immunoprecipitated using mAb A59. Western blotting confirmed the expression of equivalent levels of FcαRI (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, probing with polyclonal anti-FcR-γ antiserum indicated similar association of both WT and mutant FcR-γ chains, since they all co-immunoprecipitated with FcαRI in the Thesit lysates (Fig. 2, B and C). The size of the proteins (∼18–25 kDa) indicated that both mutants were expressed as covalent dimers, γ2, at similar levels to the wild type protein and that neither Tyr25 nor Cys26 is required for dimerization of the FcR-γ, an indicator of the structural integrity of the FcR-γ chain (Fig. 2B). Thus, both the FcR-γ Y25F and C26S mutants associate with FcαRI, and this interaction is preserved during lysis in 0.05% Thesit and immunoprecipitation with A59.Fig. 2Mutant FcR-γ chains are dimers and remain associated with FcαRI in the mild detergent Thesit. Cells were surface-labeled with biotin, lysates were prepared with 0.05% Thesit, and immunoprecipitations were performed with the anti-FcαRI mAb A59. Nonreducing (A and B) and reducing (C) SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblot detection with streptavidin-conjugated HRP (A) or rabbit polyclonal anti-FcR-γ antibodies (B and C) were as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FcR-γ Y25F Has Lesser Expression at the Cell Surface—Next, the surface biotinylation, cell lysis with 0.05% Thesit, and immunoprecipitation procedures were used to measure the expression of the FcR-γ chains. As seen previously, probing with streptavidin-conjugated HRP detected equivalent amounts of FcαRI at ∼65–75 kDa in each cell line (Fig. 3A). Also, equivalent amounts of cell surface-labeled WT and C26S mutant FcR-γ chain were associated with FcαRI (Fig. 3B, nonreducing conditions; Fig. 3C, reducing conditions). In marked contrast, less biotin-labeled FcR-γ Y25F was co-immunoprecipitated with FcαRI (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 3), indicating low surface expression of Y25F FcR-γ or a qualitatively altered receptor that is less well labeled with biotin at the FcR-γ chain N terminus. Semiquantitative analysis of blots showed that the biotinylated FcR-γ Y25F was immunoprecipitated at 14 ± 4% (n = 4) of the level of the WT FcR-γ. Hence, most of the FcαRI-γ2Y25F detected with anti-FcR-γ antiserum (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 3), may be located inside the cell or is resistant to labeling. This was confirmed by direct immunoprecipitation of the FcR-γ chains (Fig. 3, D–F). Probing with anti-FcR-γ antiserum showed, as previously, that total expression of Y25F FcR-γ was only slightly less than the WT and C26S (Fig. 3F), yet detection with streptavidin confirmed that little γ2Y25F was biotin-labeled (Fig. 3E, lane 3). The possibility that altered availability of the FcR-γ N terminus for biotin labeling was responsible for the apparent low surface expression of the FcR-γ Y25F mutant was addressed by transducing IIa1.6 cells expressing FcαRI with FcR-γ subunits with a FLAG tag epitope at the N termini. The expression of EGFP from the bicistronic constructs was equivalent (WT MFI = 193; Y25F MFI = 198; C26S, MFI = 215), indicating the matched expression of mRNAs for FcR-γ in the WT, Y25F, and C26S cell lines (Fig. 3, G–I, insets). FACS analysis with anti-FLAG antibody confirmed that the surface expression of the FcR-γ Y25F mutant (MFI = 13.1 and background MFI = 8.4) (Fig. 3H) was considerably less than that of the WT subunit (MFI = 60.3). The surface staining of the FcR-γ C26S mutant subunit (MFI = 34.4) (Fig. 3I) lay between the levels of the WT and Y25F mutant subunits. Hence, although it is formally possible that altered structure of the FcαRI-γ2Y25F receptor is responsible for a lower biotinylation or binding of anti-FLAG antibody, these two independent approaches indicate that it is most likely that there is impaired surface expression of the Y25F mutant subunit. FcR-γ Y25F and FcR-γ C26S Association with FcαRI Is Aberrant—It is notable that immunoprecipitation with anti-FcR-γ antiserum co-precipitated FcαRI only in association with WT FcR-γ and not with either the Y25F or C26S mutant (Fig. 3D). Thus, the interaction of both mutants with FcαRI is not as robust as the WT interaction and is detected with the A59 immunoprecipitation but not with the anti-FcR-γ immunoprecipitation. The strength of association of the FcαRI and FcR-γ mutants was further examined by lysis in a different detergent condition, 0.5% Brij-96 (Fig. 4). Again, immunoprecipitation of FcαRI with the mAb A59 demonstrated that the receptor, at ∼65–75 kDa, was expressed in equal amounts on the WT and mutant cells (Fig. 4A). Developing the blot further to detect biotin-labeled FcR-γ found that whereas the WT FcR-γ was co-immunoprecipitated, neither Y25F nor C26S mutants could be detected (Fig. 4). Thus, the C26S interaction, while preserved in 0.05% Thesit (Figs. 2 and 3), is disrupted in 0.5% Brij-96. Reprobing this blot with anti-FcR-γ showed that the largely intracellular association of Y25F mutant FcR-γ detected in the Thesit lysate (Fig. 2, B and C) was, like the C26S FcR-γ interaction, not preserved under the Brij-96 lysis conditions (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Thus, under these harsher detergent conditions, the complexes between Y25F FcR-γ and FcαRI and that between C26S FcR-γ and FcαRI are not preserved, which is in sharp contrast to the WT complex, which is readily detected (Fig. 4C, lane 1). This demonstrates that these residues, Tyr25 and Cys26, at the end of the TM region contribute to the interaction of FcR-γ with FcαRI. Y25F Mutant FcR-γ Is Deficient in Transducing IgA-mediated Phosphorylation—Since both mutant FcR-γ subunits had less robust association with FcαRI and the Y25F mutant had reduced surface expression, the efficacy of these mutant receptor complexes in signal transduction was tested. Cells were treated with different stimuli, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5). Cross-linking of the B cell receptor in the WT and two mutant FcR-γ chain cell lines gave similar patterns and levels of induction of phosphoproteins, indicating that the signaling machinery of the transduced cell pools are intact (Fig. 5D). Treatment with anti-IgA reagent in the absence of IgA failed to stimulate the IgA receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 5E). When cells were incubated with human serum IgA and then cross-linked with Fab′2 anti-human IgA, the cells expressing FcαRI-γ2WT induced phosphoproteins, which peaked at ∼2 min poststimulation and then progressively declined at 4 and 7 min (Fig. 5A). Similar kinetics, pattern, and intensity of phosphoprotein induction were observed for the cells expressing the FcαRI-γ2C26S mutant receptor (Fig. 5C). There were minor differences at ∼28 and >150 kDa between the WT and C26S pattern of induced phosphoproteins. The cells expressing FcαRI-γ2Y25F receptor showed reduced intensity of induced phosphoproteins across the 7-min time course (Fig. 5B). Whereas the Y25F cell line showed lower intensity of phosphoproteins, the pattern and kinetics of the major bands detected was identical to the WT, suggesting the same program of signaling events was occurring but at reduced efficiency. An important kinase involved early in the FcR signal transduction pathway is Syk. If the diminished phosphorylation of cellular substrates occurring after the stimulation of the cells expressing FcαRI-γ2Y25F is due to defective activity of this mutant receptor, then diminished activation of Syk would be predicted. Cells were treated with IgA and cross-linked, the Syk kinase was immunoprecipitated from lysates, and phosphorylated Syk was detected using the mAb 4G10 (Fig. 5F). Without"

RNA polymerase III transcribes genes encoding small, untranslated RNAs including tRNA, 5 S rRNA, and U6 small nuclear RNA genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III are governed by promoter elements comprised of A and C boxes (type 1) or A and B boxes (type 2) that are located downstream of the transcription initiation site. Two transcription factors (TF), 1The abbreviations used are: TF, transcription factor; aa, amino acid(s); Hs, Homo sapiens; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; PCA/B/C/D, phosphocellulose fraction A, B, C, or D; PE, parietal endoderm; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; rHsBdp1-(1–846), recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846).1The abbreviations used are: TF, transcription factor; aa, amino acid(s); Hs, Homo sapiens; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; PCA/B/C/D, phosphocellulose fraction A, B, C, or D; PE, parietal endoderm; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; rHsBdp1-(1–846), recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846). TFIIIB and TFIIIC, are necessary and sufficient for the transcription of type 2 genes (tRNA), whereas transcription of the type 1 5 S rRNA gene requires, in addition, TFIIIA. S. cerevisiae (Sc) TFIIIC is a stable complex of six polypeptides, whereas ScTFIIIB consists of a less stable association of three components, namely the ScTBP, ScBrf1, and ScBdp1 proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Paule M.R.

In addition to the intragenic type1 and type 2 promoters similar to those found in yeast, there exist promoters (type 3, found in U6 and 7SK RNA genes) that are located entirely 5′ of the transcription initiation site. Primary promoter recognition of type 3 promoters is achieved by PBP/PTF/SNAPc, whereas type 2 or type 1 promoters are primarily recognized by TFIIIC2 alone or by TFIIIC2 and TFIIIA, respectively (for review, see Refs. 1Paule M.R.

Human TFIIIC fractions can be chromatographically separated into two distinct activities, TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 (6Yoshinaga S.K. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3585-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Dean N. Berk A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9895-9907Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), that are both required for transcription of type 1 and type 2 genes. TFIIIC2 is a stable complex of five subunits and seems to represent the functional homologue of yeast TFIIIC. Human TFIIIC1 is less well defined. It is essential not only for the transcription of type 1 and type 2 genes but also for that of type 3 genes and, thus, for all known human genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (6Yoshinaga S.K. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3585-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Yoon J.-B. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TFIIIC1 is not an assembly factor for TFIIIBβ (defined below) but is required for the recruitment and initiation of RNA polymerase III (10Kober I. Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Weser S. Riemann J. Seifart K.H. Meissner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Also identified are two other activities, TFIIIC1-like and TFIIIC1′, that are functionally similar to TFIIIC1 but are chromatographically distinct (9Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Oettel S. Kober I. Seifart K.H.

Thomae R. Seifart K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7148-7156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Human TFIIIB has also been chromatographically separated into two functionally distinct activities. HsTFIIIBα is active in the transcription of type 3 genes, whereas HsTFIIIBβ is specific for the transcription of type 1 and 2 genes (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Like ScTFIIIB, HsTFIIIBβ is minimally comprised of a stable HsTBP-HsBrf1 complex that associates reversibly with a human homologue (HsBdp1) of ScBdp1 (16Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HsTFIIIBα activity does not reflect a highly stable complex of proteins but rather a loose association of HsTBP, HsBrf2, and HsBdp1 that can be assembled on a U6 promoter in a stepwise fashion in vitro (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26831-26838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two forms of HsBdp1 were shown to be active in the transcription of U6/7SK and VAI genes in vitro. HsBdp1(1–846) is comprised of the N-terminal 846 amino acids (TFIIIB150) (17Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (NCBI accession number AAG09268), whereas HsBdp1-(1–1388) consists of the N-terminal 1388 amino acids (hB″) (19Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) of full-length HsBdp1. A third form of HsBdp1, the “transcription factor-like nuclear regulator,” which represents full-length HsBdp1-(1–2254), has been described (22Kelter A.-R. Herchenbach J. Wirth B. Genomics. 2000; 70: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but this protein was not analyzed for HsBdp1 activity. In this paper and for reasons of clarity and simplicity, we denote the three reported forms of HsBdp1 according to the number of amino acids (indicated within parentheses) contained within each form, as shown above. All three proteins are translation products of the same gene, and both HsBdp1-(1–846) and HsBdp1-(1–1388) likely represent splicing variants of full-length HsBdp1-(1–2254). Interestingly, Northern blot analyses have revealed several HsBdp1 transcripts, ranging in size from 1.6 to 9.5 kb and showing tissue-specific expression levels (22Kelter A.-R. Herchenbach J. Wirth B. Genomics. 2000; 70: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), that might arise from differential splicing.According to amino acid (aa) sequence features, three parts of the HsBdp1 protein can be distinguished. The N-terminal part (aa 1–822) contains a region that shows sequence homology with ScBdp1. The central part (aa 823–1327) contains nine repeats of a 55-aa motif. The C terminus (aa 1328–2254) displays sequence motifs that also are found in topoisomerase II and elongation factor 1β.Here we report that HsBdp1-(1–2254) is an integral component of human TFIIIC1 activity. We demonstrate that a 250kDa protein, recognized in Western blots by anti-HsBdp1 antibodies, co-eluted with TFIIIC1 activity over several purification steps. This protein was identified by MALDI-TOF as HsBdp1-(1–2254). In addition and importantly, we show that anti-HsBdp1 antibodies depleted TFIIIC1 activity from a partially purified fraction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of HsBdp1-(1–846), expressed in a baculovirus-based system and purified to homogeneity, to functionally replace TFIIIC1 in reconstituted in vitro transcription assays with partially purified components. Finally, we show that recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846) was also able to reconstitute transcription by RNA polymerase III in cytoplasmic extracts that were prepared from differentiated F9 mouse fibroblast cells and lack TFIIIC1 activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The plasmid pUVAI contains a single copy of the adenoviral VAI gene inserted into pUC 18 (23Schneider H.R. Waldschmidt R. Jahn D. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5003-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846)—Recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846) was expressed in a baculoviral system as described for Brf1 (16Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of Bdp1-(1–846), whole cell extracts prepared from Sf21 cells were dialyzed against Buffer B containing 300 mm KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with M2-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with Buffer B containing 300 mm KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, bound proteins were eluted from beads by incubating at 4 °C for 60 min with Buffer B containing 60 mm KCl and 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide.Buffers—Buffer A contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All protein fractions, except that containing RNA polymerase III, were dialyzed against Buffer B containing 60 mm KCl (see below). After dialysis, the total protein concentration of each fraction was determined by colorimetric protein assay (Bio-Rad).Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extract (HEK S100) and Purification of Transcription Factors—Cytoplasmic extract from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK S100) was prepared as described (24Weil P.A. Segall J. Ng S.Y. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6163-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S100 extract was dialyzed against Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and subsequently subjected to chromatography over phosphocellulose (Whatman P11), generating fractions PCA, PCB, PCC, and PCD (25Jahn D. Wingender E. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PCB, PCC, and PCD fractions were subsequently dialyzed against Buffer B (60 mm KCl). All further purification steps were conducted in Buffer B.PCB Fraction—The TFIIIB contained in fraction PCB was separated by chromatography on EMD DEAE Fractogel (Merck) into fractions containing TFIIIBα, TFIIIBβ, and RNA polymerase III as described previously (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TFIIIBβ was further purified by chromatography over MonoQ (11Weser S. Riemann J. Seifart K.H. Meissner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which also separated TFIIIBβ (elution from 280 to 300 mm KCl) from TFIIIC1′ (elution from 200 to 250 mm KCl). TFIIIBβ activity co-eluted with HsTBP and HsBrf1 on MonoQ but was separated from any protein showing cross-reactivity with anti-HsBdp1 antibodies (data not shown). The TFIIIBβ-containing MonoQ fractions typically contained 0.4 mg/ml protein.The EMD DEAE Fractogel fraction containing RNA polymerase III activity was further purified by chromatography over single-stranded DNA cellulose as described (18Teichmann M. Dieci G. Huet J Rüth J. Sentenac A. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4708-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and diluted with glycerol to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) glycerol. The protein concentration was 0.1 mg/ml.PCC Fraction—TFIIIC1-like (TFIIIC0), TFIIIC1, and TFIIIC2 were purified by chromatography over phosphocellulose and MonoQ as described (9Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A typical protein concentration of TFIIIC2 activity-containing fractions eluting from MonoQ was 0.2 mg/ml. For further purification of TFIIIC1, 4 mg of the MonoQ fraction (0.4 mg/ml) was loaded onto a 1-ml MonoS column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 30-ml linear salt gradient from 200 to 600 mm KCl. MonoS fractions containing TFIIIC1low or TFIIIC1high activities were diluted with Buffer B to a final concentration of 100 mm KCl and loaded onto a 0.7 ml MiniQ column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 100 to 300 mm KCl. Respective peak fractions were then loaded onto a 150-ml High Prep Superdex 200 XK 10/70 column (Amersham Biosciences) and developed with Buffer B containing 200 mm KCl.Alternatively, after chromatography on MonoS and before chromatography on MiniQ, an additional purification step on MiniS (Amersham Biosciences) was included. In this case, MonoS fractions with TFIIIC1low or TFIIIC1high activity were diluted to 300 mm KCl with Buffer B and applied to MiniS. Bound proteins were eluted with a 30-ml linear salt gradient from 300 to 600 mm KCl.TFIIIC1-like was similarly purified over MonoS and Superdex 200 under identical conditions. The TFIIIC10like fraction used in Fig. 6 was derived from MonoQ and further purified by EMD-SO–3 Fractogel (Invitrogen) as described (14Meissner W. Thomae R. Seifart K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7148-7156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).F9 Cells—F9 cell culture, extract preparation, and chromatography were performed as described (14Meissner W. Thomae R. Seifart K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7148-7156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription assays were reconstituted either with fractions containing 2 μg of TFIIIBβ, 50 ng of RNA polymerase III, and 1 μg of TFIIIC2 or with 30 μg of F9 parietal endoderm (PE) cytoplasmic extract.Transcription reactions (60–90 μl) contained 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA, 600 μm each ATP, CTP, and UTP, 30 μm GTP, 3 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (Hartmann), and 15 units of RNase block ribonuclease inhibitor (Eppendorf) in Buffer B containing 60 mm KCl. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, RNA was purified and subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing 7 m urea and 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were analyzed by autoradiography and a Fuji FLA-3000 BioImaging analyzer.SDS-Gel Electrophoresis and Preparation for MALDI-TOF Analysis—Purified fractions containing TFIIIC1 activity were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. TFIIIC1 activity-containing fractions eluted from Superdex 200 were concentrated over Strataclean resin beads (Stratagene) as described (26Weser S. Bachmann M. Seifart K.H. Meissner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3935-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All other fractions were loaded directly onto gels. Staining of the gels was performed using Simply Blue™ Safe Stain (Invitrogen). MALDI-TOF analysis was performed at the Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie (ZMBH), Zentrale Einheit Biomolekulare Chemie in Heidelberg.Antibodies—Antibodies were purified as described (26Weser S. Bachmann M. Seifart K.H. Meissner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3935-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Anti-HsBdp1 antibody was raised against aa 211–357 of HsBdp1, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Anti-HsTBP (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and anti-HsBrf1 antibodies (16Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were as described. 125I-labeled secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Western Blot—SDS-PAGE and blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were carried out as described (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the following modification, i.e. the secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was 125I-labeled. Immunocomplexes were detected by autoradiography or with a Fuji FLA-3000 BioImaging analyzer. Antibody solutions were preblocked by preincubation of the HsBdp1 antiserum for 2 h at room temperature with a 5–10-fold excess of recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846).Immunodepletion—Immunodepletions were performed using 1-ml HiTrap Protein G columns (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were loaded with 0.7 mg of either preimmune serum (mock) or anti-HsBdp1 antiserum. Coupling with dimethylpimelimidate was as described (18Teichmann M. Dieci G. Huet J Rüth J. Sentenac A. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4708-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 0.7 ml (140 μg) of a MonoQ TFIIIC1 fraction was loaded onto each column and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins eluting with the flow-through from each column were collected and subsequently tested for their TFIIIC1 activity in reconstituted transcription in vitro.PESTfind analysis—The analysis of possible PEST sequences was performed using the PESTfind program at the EMBnet Austria (27Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 28Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification of TFIIIC1 for MALDI-TOF Analysis—The polypeptide composition of human transcription factor TFIIIC1 has not yet been resolved. In an attempt to identify the proteins required for the reconstitution of TFIIIC1 activity, we established a purification scheme (Fig. 1A) that allows the preparation of highly purified protein samples with TFIIIC1 activity. After phosphocellulose and MonoQ chromatography (6Yoshinaga S.K. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3585-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we subjected TFIIIC1-containing fractions to chromatography over MonoS. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient from 200 to 600 mm KCl. Interestingly, TFIIIC1 activity was split into two distinct peaks upon chromatography over MonoS (Fig. 1B). The first peak eluted at 340 mm KCl (fraction 11), and the second peak at eluted 400 mm KCl (fractions 16 and 17). This separation of both activities was reproduced with more than five independent TFIIIC1 preparations. We therefore designated the activity eluting with 340 mm KCl as TFIIIC1low (low ionic strength) and that eluting with 400 mm KCl as TFIIIC1high (high ionic strength). Neither activity could be converted into the other upon the rechromatography of each activity on MonoS or MiniS columns, suggesting that they represent two unique and different forms of human TFIIIC1-activity (data not shown).Fig. 1Separation of TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high activities by chromatography over MonoS.A, purification scheme for TFIIIC1 activities. B, in vitro transcription activity (VAI gene) of individual fractions eluted from MonoS (5 μl each) and assayed with TFIIIBβ, TFIIIC2, and RNA polymerase III (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lane + (10 μl of MonoQ TFIIIC1) and lane – (no TFIIIC1) served as positive and negative controls, respectively. C, Western blot with anti-HsBdp1 antibodies of fractions eluted from MonoS. 200 μl of each fraction were loaded onto an 8% SDS gel. Migration positions of molecular mass standard proteins are indicated on the right. D, Western blot of recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846) (lanes 1–3 and 7–9) and a MonoQ TFIIIC1 fraction (lanes 4–6 and 10–12) with anti-HsBdp1-(1–846) antiserum (lanes 1, 4, and 7–12) and anti-TFIIIB″ antibodies (lanes 2 and 5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Lanes 3 and 6 show the controls with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase alone. The antibody solutions used in lanes 8 and 11 and lanes 9 and 12 were preblocked with 5- and 10-fold excesses of recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846) respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Western blot analysis of MonoS fractions with anti-HsBdp1-antibodies revealed co-elution of TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high activities with a doublet of ∼220–250 kDa proteins that probably correspond to full-length HsBdp1-(1–2254) (Fig. 1C). Proteins that migrated with the approximate sizes of 210, 110, 85, and 65 kDa were recognized by anti-HsBdp1 antibodies but did not co-elute with TFIIIC1 activity from MonoS (Fig. 1C). The Western blot in Fig. 1D shows the specificity of our anti-HsBdp1 antiserum (lanes 1 and 4) as compared with the commercially available anti-(Hs)TFIIIB″ T-20 antiserum (lanes 2 and 5) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Both antisera detect the baculovirally expressed HsBdp1-(1–846) protein (lanes 1 and 2) and the 220–250-kDa forms of HsBdp1 (lanes 4 and 5), whereas the controls without a specific first antibody were negative (lanes 3 and 6). Furthermore, reactivity with the 220–250-kDa bands was prevented by preblocking the anti-HsBdp1 antiserum with increasing amounts of affinity-purified recombinant HsBdp1-(1–846) (lanes 10–12).We further purified each activity, TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high, over two additional resins, MiniQ and Superdex 200 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, both forms of TFIIIC1 eluted at 220 mm KCl from MiniQ (Fig. 2A). As evidenced by Western blots with anti-HsBdp1 antibodies, both peaks of TFIIIC1 activity showed strict co-elution with the same 220–250 kDa protein doublet (Fig. 2B) that co-eluted with these activities after MonoS chromatography (Fig. 1C). Likewise, both TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high activities showed a similar elution profile close to the void volume on Superdex 200 columns, indicating that both reside in large protein complexes (see “Discussion). In this case, TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high active fractions again showed precise co-elution with the 220–250-kDa protein doublet that reacts with anti-HsBdp1 antibodies in Western blots (data not shown). TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high active fractions were then concentrated (see “Experimental Procedures”) and loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Superdex 200 fraction that contained TFIIIC1low activity showed a large number of contaminating polypeptides, thus precluding an informative MALDI-TOF analysis of TFIIIC1low. In contrast, the Sephadex 200 fraction with TFIIIC1high activity exhibited a higher degree of purity, thus allowing identification of an ∼250-kDa protein that appeared to correspond to one of the anti-HsBdpl reactive proteins that co-eluted with TFIIIC1 activity (Figs. 1C and 2B). Subsequent MALDI-TOF analysis revealed probable identity (score 110; protein scores >61 are significant; p < 0.05) of this protein with the 250-kDa form of HsBdp1 (transcription factor-like nuclear regulator) (22Kelter A.-R. Herchenbach J. Wirth B. Genomics. 2000; 70: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Fig. 2220- and 250-kDa proteins that are recognized by anti-HsBdp1 antibodies co-elute with TFIIIC1 activity from MiniQ.A, TFIIIC1low and TFIIIC1high active fractions eluted from MonoS were further purified over MiniS (data not shown) and, subsequently, over MiniQ. Transcription of the VAI gene was reconstituted with TFIIIBβ, TFIIIC2, RNA polymerase III, and individual fractions eluted from MiniQ (5 μl each) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lane + contained 10 μl MonoQ TFIIIC1 and served as a positive control. Lane – contained no TFIIIC1 and served as negative control.

TFIIIC1-containing MonoQ fractions were subjected to chromatography over HiTrap protein G columns to which either anti-HsBdp1 antibodies or preimmune antibodies (mock) had been coupled.The flow-through fractions of these columns were tested for TFIIIC1 activity in a reconstituted transcription assay with the VAI gene. As shown in Fig. 3A, the flow-through of the column with coupled preimmune antibodies contained a level of TFIIIC1 activity comparable with that observed in the input fraction (compare lane 2 with lanes 3–9). In contrast, the flowthrough from the column containing coupled anti-HsBdp1 antibodies showed almost no activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 10–16). A Western blot of the corresponding input and flow-through fractions revealed that the 220–250-kDa HsBdp1-(1–2254) doublet was nearly completely depleted by the anti-HsBdp1 column (Fig. 3B, lane 3) but left at the input level by the preimmune column (lane 2). These results suggest that HsBdp1-(1–2254) is an integral and essential component of TFIIIC1 activity.Fig. 3Anti-HsBdp1 antibodies deplete TFIIIC1 activity from an active MonoQ fraction. A, in vitro transcription of the VAI gene was reconstituted with TFIIIBβ, TFIIIC2, and RNA polymerase III (see “Experimental Procedures”). 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 μl of a preimmune serum (mock)-depleted (lanes 3–9) or an anti-HsBdp1 antibody-depleted (lanes 10–16) MonoQ fraction were analyzed. Lane 1, negative control without TFIIIC1. Lane 2, positive control with 10 μl of a TFIIIC1 activity-containing MonoQ fraction.
