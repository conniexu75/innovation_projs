https://openalex.org/W2133362776,The C-terminal CAAX motif of the yeast mating factors is modified by proteolysis to remove the three terminal amino acids (-AAX) leaving a C-terminal cysteine residue that is polyisoprenylated and carboxyl-methylated. Here we show that all ras proteins are polyisoprenylated on their C-terminal cysteine (Cys186). Mutational analysis shows palmitoylation does not take place on Cys186 as previously thought but on cysteine residues contained in the hypervariable domain of some ras proteins. The major expressed form of c-K-ras (exon 4B) does not have a cysteine residue immediately upstream of Cys186 and is not palmitoylated. Polyisoprenylated but nonpalmitoylated H-ras proteins are biologically active and associate weakly with cell membranes. Palmitoylation increases the avidity of this binding and enhances their transforming activity. Polyisoprenylation is essential for biological activity as inhibiting the biosynthesis of polyisoprenoids abolishes membrane association of p21ras.
https://openalex.org/W1981234599,"Phencyclidine (PCP), a dissociative anesthetic and widely abused psychotomimetic drug, and MK-801, a potent PCP receptor ligand, have neuroprotective properties stemming from their ability to antagonize the excitotoxic actions of endogenous excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate. There is growing interest in the potential application of these compounds in the treatment of neurological disorders. However, there is an apparent neurotoxic effect of PCP and related agents (MK-801, tiletamine, and ketamine), which has heretofore been overlooked: these drugs induce acute pathomorphological changes in specific populations of brain neurons when administered subcutaneously to adult rats in relatively low doses. These findings raise new questions regarding the safety of these agents in the clinical management of neurodegenerative diseases and reinforce concerns about the potential risks associated with illicit use of PCP."
https://openalex.org/W145796029,"The depletion of an inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool has been proposed to be the signal for Ca2+ entry in agonist-activated cells. Consistent with this idea, thapsigargin, which releases intracellular Ca2+ without inositol phosphate formation, has been reported to activate Ca2+ entry in certain cells. We now report the effects of thapsigargin on Ca2+ entry in parotid acinar cells. In fura-2-loaded parotid acinar cells, thapsigargin caused a sustained elevation of [Ca2+], but did not increase inositol phosphate formation. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the increase in [Ca2+], was transient, suggesting that thapsigargin activates both the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, pretreatment with methacholine, an agonist believed to mobilize Ca2+ through the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inhibited but did not completely block the response to thapsigargin; likewise, pretreatment with thapsigargin inhibited the response to methacholine. In permeabilized cells, thapsigargin gradually released Ca2+, whereas inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate caused a rapid and transient discharge of Ca2+. The simultaneous addition of thapsigargin with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate evoked a maximum Ca2+ release similar to that for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate alone, but the reuptake seen with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate alone was abolished. In intact cells, methacholine and thapsigargin together produced a greater initial release of Ca2+ than either alone, but they were not additive in the sustained phase of Ca2+ mobilization. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms for activation of Ca2+ entry by thapsigargin and methacholine are the same and are consistent with the idea that entry is initiated by the depletion of the intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool. The results also indicate that, in contrast to previously proposed models, Ca2+ entry into agonist-activated cells occurs directly across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm rather than through a cycle of uptake and release by the intracellular Ca2+ pool."
https://openalex.org/W2056037336,"The yeast KAR2 gene was isolated by complementation of a mutation that blocks nuclear fusion. The predicted KAR2 protein sequence is most homologous to mammalian BiP/GRP78 and has several structural features in common with it: a functional secretory signal sequence, a yeast endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (HDEL) at the carboxyl terminus, and the absence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Moreover KAR2 is regulated like BiP/GRP78: the level of mRNA is increased by drug treatments and mutations that cause accumulation of secretory precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, unlike BiP/GRP78, KAR2 is also regulated by heat shock. Deletion of the KAR2 gene generated a recessive lethal mutation, showing that BiP/GRP78 function is required for cell viability."

https://openalex.org/W2125253481,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells contains a 78 kd protein (BiP) that is believed to assist in the folding of secretory and transmembrane proteins. We have used a cDNA encoding mouse BiP to isolate the homologous gene from S. cerevisiae, which encodes a sequence of 682 amino acids, 431 of which are identical to mouse BiP. Like its mammalian counterpart, yeast BiP is encoded by an HSP70-like gene whose transcription is stimulated by the presence of unfolded polypeptides in the ER. The gene encoding yeast BiP is essential for cell growth and, unexpectedly, is identical to the recently cloned KAR2 gene. Expression of mammalian BiP in S. cerevisiae can complement a mutant allele of KAR2 that is temperature sensitive for growth and nonconditionally defective for karyogamy. These results suggest that deficiencies in BiP may cause generalized failure of protein folding in the ER, leading to pleiotropic effects on cellular metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2087015690,"A prominent feature of diabetes mellitus is the inability of insulin to appropriately increase the transport of glucose into target tissues. The contributions of different glucose transport proteins to insulin resistance in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes was evaluated. A glucose transporter messenger RNA and its cognate protein that are exclusively expressed in muscle and adipose tissue were specifically depleted in diabetic animals, and these effects were reversed after insulin therapy; a different glucose transporter and its messenger RNA that exhibit a less restricted tissue distribution were not specifically modulated in this way. Depletion of the muscle- and adipose-specific glucose transporter species correlates with and may account for the major portion of cellular insulin resistance in diabetes in these animals."

https://openalex.org/W2156075398,"Recombinant DNA clones containing large pieces of DNA are useful in the study of large genetic units, but these are difficult to make in most bacterial cloning vectors. A strategy is described that uses general and site-specific recombination to construct large pieces of eukaryotic DNA from smaller cloned segments. The large clones are propagated on F factor-based plasmids in Escherichia coli. They can be easily modified to introduce mutations or rearrangements. These techniques were applied to the construction of large DNA segments from the bithorax complex of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1486601410,"The pig edema disease toxin has been shown by a tlc glycolipid binding assay to bind specifically to globotetraosylceramide (Gb4, GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcCer.). Binding was reduced for globotriosylceramide (Gb3, Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcCer) and more markedly for the Forssman antigen (GalNAcα1–3GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcCer). Paragloboside, blood group A glycolipids, glycolipids terminating in Gal NAcβ1–4Gal-, and glycolipids in which globoside was present as an internal sequence did not bind the toxin. Isogloboside (GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcCer) was efficiently recognized. This toxin is genetically related to the verotoxin (or Shiga-like) family of toxins for which Gb3 has been shown to be the receptor. The difference in susceptibility of cell lines to the cytotoxicity of the pig edema disease toxin and the Shiga and Shiga-like toxins is consistent with the difference in receptor glycolipid binding."
https://openalex.org/W1536585049,"We have investigated the stimulation of phospholipase D activity by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor agonist [D-Ala6, des-Gly10]GnRH N-ethylamide (GnRH-A) in preovulatory, cultured granulosa cells. GnRH-A stimulated up to 10-fold accumulation of phosphatidylethanol, produced by phospholipase D phosphatidyl transferase activity when ethanol acts as the phosphatidyl group acceptor. The effect of GnRH-A was concentration dependent (EC50 = 1 nM) and was inhibited by a specific GnRH receptor antagonist. Low GnRH-A concentrations (less than 10 nM) stimulated also accumulation of phosphatidic acid, but at higher concentrations this response was attenuated. Propranolol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, increased both basal and GnRH-A-stimulated production of phosphatidic acid. A protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 100 nM), increased up to 30-fold phosphatidylethanol levels. The effects of supramaximal concentrations of GnRH-A (50 nM) and TPA (1 microM) on the accumulation of phosphatidylethanol were additive, suggesting that the two agents may not act via the same mechanism. This is supported by the fact that 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, inhibited the effect of TPA 50%, but not that of GnRH-A. However, 24 h pretreatment with TPA abolished cellular response to subsequent treatment with either TPA or GnRH-A. The stimulatory action of GnRH on steroidogenesis could be mimicked by elevating endogenous phosphatidic acid levels in granulosa cells. Exogenous phospholipase D (from Streptomyces chromofuscus, 10 IU/ml) significantly increased (2.7-fold) progesterone production by the cells; under the same conditions, GnRH-A and FSH stimulated progesterone production 3- and 2.6-fold, respectively. Similarly, propranolol stimulated progesterone production 2.2-fold. These results suggest that, in granulosa cells, GnRH receptors are coupled to a phospholipase D whose activation may participate in transducing the GnRH signal for accelerated steroidogenesis. Phospholipase D activity can be independently regulated also by protein kinase C. The possible interrelationships between phospholipase D and other phospholipases which may be activated by GnRH in these ovarian cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589868601,"The large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli contains redox-active cysteine residues. In separate experiments, five conserved and 2 nonconserved cysteine residues were substituted with alanines by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The activities of the mutant proteins were determined in the presence of three different reductants: thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, or dithiothreitol. The results indicate two different classes of redox-active cysteines in ribonucleotide reductase: 1) C-terminal Cys-754 and Cys-759 responsible for the interaction with thioredoxin and glutaredoxin; and 2) Cys-225 and Cys-439 located at the nucleotide-binding site. Our classification of redox-active cysteines differs from the location of the active site cysteines in E. coli ribonucleotide reductase suggested previously (Lin, A.-N. I., Ashley, G. W., and Stubbe, J. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 6905-6909)."
https://openalex.org/W2018432619,"The steady-state translational activation of the GCN4 mRNA is based upon an increase in the rate of ribosome initiation at the protein coding AUG following translation of the 5′ most proximal open reading frame located in its untranslated region. Such an increase is effected when the cellular amount of the GCN2 protein kinase is increased or when the function of the GCD1 gene product is defective. Here, we report conditions that result in a dramatic transient increase in the rate of GCN4 protein synthesis, which also requires the prior translation of the 5′ most proximal open reading frame but is independent of the GCN2 protein. This activation of GCN4 mRNA translation coincides with a decrease in the rate of total cellular protein synthesis. We also observed low rates of protein synthesis in the gcd1 strain and in strains that overexpress the GCN2 protein kinase. The process in protein synthesis that is affected is formation of 43S preinitiation complexes. These results reveal the existence of a coupling between this process in translational initiation and the mechanism that activates translation of GCN4 mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1570240002,"Liposomes associated with gangliosides and loaded with the human insulin gene were incubated with HVJ (Sendai virus) and red blood cell membranes containing non-histone chromosomal protein, high mobility group 1 (HMG-1), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form vesicle complexes. These vesicle complexes were then injected into the portal vein of adult rats. The insulin gene co-introduced with HMG-1 was transported into the nuclei of liver cells much more efficiently than the gene co-introduced with BSA. Moreover, the amount of transcript of the insulin gene co-introduced with HMG-1 was more than 10 times greater than that of the gene co-introduced with BSA. Similar amounts of DNA and RNA of human insulin were found in the liver within 7 days after injection of the gene, and then the amounts of both decreased rapidly. The level of human insulin in rat serum gradually increased to a maximum (20-30 microunits/ml) after 7 or 8 days and then decreased rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1593302714,"The translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) is involved in the recognition of the cap structure at the 5' end of eukaryotic mRNA and facilitates ribosome binding. Subsequently, additional initiation factors mediate ribosomal scanning of mRNA and initiator AUG recognition (Shatkin, A. J. (1985) Cell 40, 223-224; Rhoads, R. E. (1988) Trends Biochem. Sci. 13, 52-56; Edery, I., Pelletier, J., and Sonenberg, N. (1987) in Translational Regulation of Gene Expression (Ilan, J., ed) pp. 335-366, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York). We show here that initiation factor 4E is functionally conserved between the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammals. Although the amino acid identity of the factors from both species is limited to only 33%, mouse eIF-4E can substitute for yeast eIF-4E in vivo without major effects on cell viability, growth, and mating. This finding provides a starting point for new experimental strategies to investigate the structure-function relationship of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-4E."
https://openalex.org/W1568951356,"Transfer of plasmid RP4 during bacterial conjugation requires the plasmid-encoded TraJ protein, which binds to the transfer origin (Furste, J. P., Pansegrau, W., Ziegelin, G., Kroger, M., and Lanka, E. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 1771–1775). As indicated by traJ mutants, the TraJ protein is a constituent of the relaxosome, the initiation complex of transfer DNA replication. The traJ gene maps adjacent to the transfer origin (oriT). The structural gene consists of a 372-base pair sequence encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids (13,282 Da). TraJ was purified from an Escherichia coli strain overproducing the protein. DNA footprinting experiments involving DNase I demonstrated that the purified protein binds to the right arm of a 19-base pair inverted repeat within oriT. Hydroxyl radical footprints of the DNA-protein complex revealed that TraJ protein is bound to only one side of the DNA helix."
https://openalex.org/W2083471962,"Phagocytosis of group A streptococci requires type-specific antibodies directed against the variable determinants of the bacterial surface M protein molecule. As a step toward developing a broadly protective anti-streptococcal vaccine, a vaccinia virus (VV) recombinant was constructed that expresses the conserved region of the structural gene encoding the M6 molecule (VV:M6'). Mice immunized intranasally with the VV:M6' virus showed markedly reduced pharyngeal colonization by streptococci after intranasal and oral challenge with these bacteria. M protein-specific serum immunoglobulin G was significantly elevated in vaccinated animals and absent in controls. A similar approach may prove useful for the identification of protective determinants present on other bacterial and viral pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1597274086,"Biological responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) depend on the ligand-stimulated protein tyrosine kinase activity of its receptor. To further characterize the enzymatic activity of the EGF receptor, the baculovirus expression system was used to express the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF receptor. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells infected with recombinant baculovirus correctly expressed an active tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF receptor as demonstrated by 35S metabolic labeling, immunoblotting with anti-EGF receptor and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and autophosphorylation analysis. The kinase domain (Mr 66,000) was purified to near homogeneity using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody column, providing 0.5 mg of kinase domain/liter of Sf9 cells (23% yield). The purified kinase domain exhibited a strong preference for Mn2+ compared to Mg2+. The specific activity of the kinase domain was low compared to purified, EGF-activated EGF receptor. However, the addition of sphingosine or ammonium sulfate greatly increased the activity of the kinase domain to equal or exceed the activity of ligand-activated holo EGF receptor. These results indicate that the addition of sphingosine or ammonium sulfate to the purified kinase domain can mimic the effect of EGF to induce a conformation of the holo EGF receptor which is optimal for tyrosine kinase activity. Deletion of the ligand binding domain, analogous to that which occurs in erb B, is not sufficient to fully activate the kinase, implying that EGF causes conformational changes additional to removal of an inhibitory constraint."
https://openalex.org/W1639281802,"Yeast and mammalian RAS gene products are GTP-binding proteins that are posttranslationally localized to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This localization is accomplished by the addition of a lipid moiety to a conserved cysteine residue close to the carboxyl terminus. In a previous report we showed that the mammalia Ha-ras protein is also modified posttranslationally by methyl esterification. Here we show that the yeast RAS2 protein is posttranslationally modified by methyl esterification at or near the carboxyl terminus. We also present evidence indicating that the methyl ester is linked to the conserved cysteine residue, implying that RAS2 protein is cleaved to expose this cysteine as the carboxyl-terminal residue. This maturation pathway may be shared by a family of proteins that are initially synthesized as soluble proteins and must become membrane-localized to function."
https://openalex.org/W2032804294,"The growth of human mammary cells may be regulated by a balance between growth stimulatory and growth inhibitory pathways. Polypeptides of 47 and 65 kilodaltons (mammastatin) were isolated from conditioned medium of normal human mammary cells. Monoclonal antibodies against mammastatin were generated that blocked its activity and were used for purification and further characterization of the protein. Mammastatin inhibited the growth of 5 transformed human mammary cell lines, but had no effect on the growth of 11 transformed human cell lines derived from nonmammary tissues. Mammastatin appeared to be a heat-labile protein distinct from transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). By immunoperoxidase staining it was detected in cultured normal human mammary cells, but was decreased in transformed mammary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1492568021,We find that the N-linked Man8GlcNAc2- core oligosaccharide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mnn mutant mannoproteins is enlarged by the addition of the outer chain to the α1→3-linked mannose in the side chain that is attached to the β1→4-linked mannose rather than by addition to the terminal α1→6-linked mannose. This conclusion is derived from structural studies on a phosphorylated oligosaccharide fraction and from mass spectral fragment analysis of neutral core oligosaccharides.
https://openalex.org/W2136609029,"Rabbits challenged with viable Staphylococcus aureus exhibit marked time-dependent changes in sleep patterns. To examine the generality of this observation, we monitored sleep patterns for 24 h before and for 48 h after intravenous inoculation of rabbits with Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, or Candida albicans. All three agents produced complex time-dependent changes in sleep. Inoculation with S. pyogenes or C. albicans increased the time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) during h 4-20 after challenge. Electroencephalographic delta wave amplitudes (DWA) increased during h 4-8 after injection, but decreased during h 24-38 after inoculation. Altered sleep patterns were not observed when similar doses of heat-killed organisms were administered. In contrast, inoculation with E. coli produced a large increase in both SWS time and DWA for the first 2-4 h after inoculation. DWA then decreased from 6 to 32 h after inoculation. Similar effects occurred when heat-killed E. coli were administered. Rapid eye movement sleep was reduced by all three agents. These data demonstrate that altered sleep patterns occur in response to infectious challenge in rabbits, and that these changes are related to the type of infectious organism involved."

https://openalex.org/W1525462137,"Abstract Ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) and mutants Gln25----Lys, Glu58----Ala, and the double mutant were prepared from a chemically synthesized gene, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The wild-type RNase T1 prepared from the cloned gene was identical in every functional and physical property examined to RNase T1 prepared from Aspergillus oryzae. Urea and thermal unfolding experiments show that Gln25----Lys is 0.9 kcal/mol more stable and Glu58----Ala is 0.8 kcal/mol less stable than wild-type RNase T1. In the double mutant, these contributions cancel and the stability does not differ significantly from that of wild-type RNase T1. For the double mutant, the dependence of delta G on urea concentration is significantly greater than for wild-type RNase T1 or the single mutants. This suggests that the double mutant unfolds more completely in urea than the other proteins. The activity of Gln25----Lys is identical with that of wild-type RNase T1. The activities of Glu58----Ala and the double mutant are 7% of wild-type when GpC hydrolysis is measured (due to a 35-fold decrease in kcat), and 37% of wild-type when RNA hydrolysis is measured. Thus, Glu58 is important, but not essential to the activity of RNase T1."

https://openalex.org/W1512555874,"We have studied the growth on acetate, the metabolism of acetate enzymes, and respiration of a series of citrate synthase mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results confirmed and extended our previous observation that cytosolic citrate synthase is not necessary for growth on acetate. Deletion of mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS1) protein resulted in changes in metabolites, decrease in the amounts of pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, reduced mitochondrial respiration of citrate and isocitrate, and an inability to grow on acetate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed two separate CS1 proteins with mutations in the enzyme's active site. The mitochondria of cells carrying either site-directed mutagenized CS1 contained the inactive citrate synthase protein. With one mutant in which His313 was replaced with a glycine (CS1/H313G), growth on acetate was restored, and mitochondrial respiration of citrate and isocitrate increased toward parental levels as did the levels of several enzymes. With the other mutant CS1 in which Asp414 was replaced with a glycine (CS1/D414G), no growth on acetate or changes in other parameters was observed. We propose that the characteristics of the strain carrying the CS1 with a H313G mutation result from the formation of an intact Krebs cycle complex by the inactive but structurally unchanged H313G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1577031554,"Abstract Insulin increases the rate of overall protein synthesis in many cells and tissues, while inducing the preferential expression of individual proteins. To identify and characterize such proteins, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing more than 10(6) human insulin receptors per cell (HIR 3.5; Whittaker, J., Okamoto, A. K., Thys, R., Bell, G. I., Steiner, D. F., and Hofmann, C. A. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 5237-5241) were treated with insulin in the presence of [35S]methionine, and labeled proteins were separated using ultra-high resolution (giant) two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Overall protein synthesis was enhanced as much as 3-fold by insulin treatment; the synthesis of approximately 1% of the 2,500 proteins visible on the gel autoradiographs was further selectively increased. By using immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and comigration assays, we identified one of the rapidly induced proteins (Mr 96,000; pI 6.8) as eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2), a major component of the protein translation apparatus. Insulin induced the synthesis of EF-2 within 20 min of treatment, with a half-maximal dose of 10(-11) M. It was synthesized as a precursor form that was processed to a more basic mature species within 30 min. Long term treatment with insulin led to accumulation of EF-2 within the cell and prevented the substantial decrease in EF-2 concentration that occurred during serum deprivation. Finally, we found that insulin induction of EF-2 occurred normally in the presence of the RNA-transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D. Thus, insulin rapidly induced the synthesis of EF-2 predominantly or exclusively at the level of mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W1588946648,"The synthetic decapeptide NH2-Cys-Val-Gly-Ala-Val-Ser-Asp-Val-Lys-Ala-COOH (designated MBct10), which corresponds to the carboxyl terminus of the melibiose carrier of Escherichia coli, was synthesized and used to raise antibodies in a rabbit. Anti-MBct10 antibodies recognizes the normal melibiose carrier but not a truncated carrier lacking 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. Thus the antibodies are specific for the carboxyl terminus of the carrier and not for other domains of the protein. When right-side-out and inside-out membrane vesicles were probed with anti-MBct10 serum, only the inside-out vesicles bound antibody. The carboxyl terminus of the melibiose carrier protein is therefore exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. The co-localization of both NH2- and carboxyl termini to the cytoplasmic surface dictates that the protein cross the membrane an even number of times. These data together with hydrophobicity analysis support a topological model for the melibiose carrier with 10 or 12 transmembrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W1539260806,"Abstract We have tried to characterize thyroglobulin (Tg) degradation products in purified pig thyroid lysosomes to determine whether the release of thyroid hormone residues from Tg involves a random proteolytic attack or discrete and selective cleavage reactions. The intralysosomal soluble protein fraction was prepared by osmotic pressure-dependent lysis of lysosomes purified by isopycnic centrifugation on Percoll gradients. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed the presence of a fraction of Tg (5-10% of total lysosomal protein) with the same molecular weight as that of the intact Tg subunit. This high molecular weight Tg was the only intralysosomal species detected by Western blot using antipig Tg antibodies. In nondenaturing conditions, lysosomal Tg (LTg) identified by radioimmunoassay was in the form of a dimer with a sedimentation coefficient lower than that of either iodinated Tg (colloid Tg) or noniodinated Tg (microsomal Tg). LTg had a lower iodine content than colloid Tg:9-12 versus 39-42 iodine atoms/molecule. Pronase hydrolysates of LTg did not contain any 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine or 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine residues detectable by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; iodine present in LTg was in the form of iodotyrosines. Under reducing conditions, LTg almost completely disappeared and gave rise to various polypeptides of smaller size. These results suggest that Tg transferred to lysosomes is subjected to selective proteolytic cleavage reaction(s) that release thyroid hormone residues. This early step would lead to the formation of hormone-depleted Tg molecules that are cleaved at discrete sites, the resulting polypeptides remaining bound through disulfide bonds to yield Tg molecules with an apparently normal size and a slightly altered structure."
https://openalex.org/W1597277223,"Total cell mannoprotein was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180 mutants that have defects in elongation of the outer chain attached to the N-linked core oligosaccharides (mnn7, mnn8, mnn9, and mnn10) (Ballou, L., Cohen, R. E., and Ballou, C. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5986-5991). Comparison of the oligosaccharides released by endoglucosaminidase H digestion confirmed that the mnn9 mutation eliminates all but two mannoses of the outer chain, whereas the mnn8 and mnn10 strains produce outer chains of variable but similar lengths. The isolate designated mnn7 was found to be allelic with mnn8. Haploid mutants of the type mnn8 mnn9 or mnn9 mnn10 had the mnn9 phenotype, which established that the mnn9 defect is dominant and presumably acts at a processing step prior to the steps affected by mnn8 and mnn10. Analysis of the mnn1 mnn2 mnn10 oligosaccharides revealed that the heterogeneous outer chain contained 6-16 alpha 1----6-linked mannose units and each was terminated by a single alpha 1----2-linked mannose unit, whereas the core lacked one such unit that was present in the mnn9 oligosaccharide. The results are consistent with and support the hypothesis (Gopal, P. K., and Ballou, C. E. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 8824-8828) that addition of such a side-chain mannose unit is associated with termination of outer chain elongation in these mutants and may serve as a stop signal that regulates outer chain synthesis in the parent wild-type strain."
https://openalex.org/W1585341765,"Abstract A novel mixed micelle assay for the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase of Escherichia coli was developed using the nonionic detergent octaethylenegly-coldodecyl ether. The assay permitted investigation of the phospholipid dependence of enzyme activity at phospholipid/detergent ratios of 5:1 (w/w) to 2:1 depending on the phospholipid employed. The higher ratio yielded maximal activity when E. coli phospholipids were used; the lower ratio was observed with cardiolipin(E. coli). Phosphatidylglycerol(E. coli) and phosphatidylethanolamine(E. coli) also restored enzyme activity. Activation by phosphatidylethanolamine(E. coli) was pH-dependent and relatively inefficient. The synthetic, disaturated (1,2-palmitoyl)phosphatidylglycerol reconstituted only 25% of the total enzyme activity as that observed with the monounsaturated (1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl) species. Full activation of enzyme was achieved with (1,2-dioleoyl)phosphatidylglycerol. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid were unable to reconstitute enzyme activity. Chromatographic sizing of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, following reconstitution in cardiolipin(E. coli)/octaethyleneglycoldodecyl ether mixed micelles, suggested that the monomeric form of the enzyme was active."

The effect of introducing prfB mutations into mutant strains containing altered trp leader regions that influence basal level transcription readthrough was also determined. Our findings support a model for basal level control of trp operon expression in which ribosome release from the leader peptide stop codon, formation of alternative transcript secondary structures, and the position of the transcribing RNA polymerase regulate expression."

We have employed site-directed mutagenesis techniques to either delete residues within this domain or substitute a charged amino acid for one of these residues to determine the important properties of the internal signal. The deletion analysis showed that a very small apolar domain, residues 70-76, is essential for assembly, whereas residues that flank it are dispensable for its function. However, point mutations with charged amino acid residues within the polar sequence (residues 77-82) slow or abolish leader peptidase membrane assembly. Thus, a polar region, Arg-Ser-Phe-Ile-Tyr-Glu, is important for the signal peptide function of leader peptidase, unlike other signals identified thus far."
https://openalex.org/W1600823271,Abstract The nucleotide sequence corresponding to codons for the 17-amino acid residues in the presumed targeting presequence for yeast mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was removed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the isolated gene (MDH1). Integrative transformation was used to insert the leaderless gene (mdhl-) into the MDH1 chromosomal locus of a strain containing a disrupted MDH1 gene. Expression of the mature form of malate dehydrogenase as a primary translation product was verified by demonstrating that the mature form is synthesized in mdhl- cells at the same rate as the precursor form in MDH1 cells in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and by comparison of in vitro translation products of RNAs from mdhl- and MDH1 cells. Expression of mdhl- restores total cellular malate dehydrogenase activity to levels comparable to those in wild type cells and reverses the phenotype associated with strains containing MDH1 disruptions by restoring wild type rates of growth in media containing acetate as a carbon source. Immunochemical analyses and enzyme assays show comparable levels of malate dehydrogenase in the matrix fractions from mitochondria isolated from mdhl- and MDH1 cells and give no evidence for accumulation of the mature enzyme in the cytosol of mdhl- cells. These results indicate that the presequence for malate dehydrogenase is not essential for efficient mitochondrial localization or function in yeast.

https://openalex.org/W1577353277,"Acetylation is the most frequently occurring chemical modification of the alpha-NH2 group of eukaryotic proteins and is catalyzed by an N alpha-acetyltransferase. Recently, a eukaryotic N alpha-acetyltransferase was purified to homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its substrate specificity was partially characterized (Lee, F.-J. S., Lin L.-W., and Smith, J. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14948-14955). This article describes the cloning from a yeast lambda gt11 cDNA library and sequencing of a full length cDNA encoding yeast N alpha-acetyltransferase. DNA blot hybridizations of genomic and chromosomal DNA reveal that the gene (so-called AAA1, amino-terminal, alpha-amino, acetyltransferase) is present as a single copy located on chromosome IV. The use of this cDNA will allow the molecular details of the role of N alpha-acetylation in the sorting and degradation of eukaryotic proteins to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1511866466,"The melibiose carrier of Escherichia coli is predicted to possess a short NH2 terminus, 11 transmembrane segments joined by short hydrophilic regions, and a 40-residue hydrophilic carboxyl terminus of unknown function. This paper describes truncations of the carboxyl terminus at eight locations using site-specific mutagenesis to introduce stop codons. Measurement of sugar transport and cation-coupling characteristics indicate that the carboxyl tail plays no direct role in substrate recognition or energy transduction. Thirty-six amino acids could be removed from the hydrophilic carboxyl domain without the loss of sugar specificity, facilitated diffusion, uphill transport, H+-coupling or Na+-coupling characteristics. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the sugar/cation binding site is formed by the interaction of the transmembrane helices 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 and does not involve the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. When truncations were made within the hydrophobic domain of transmembrane helix 11 (truncations of 41 or more residues), the carrier was no longer found in the membrane. This suggests that the carboxyl terminus may be involved in the membrane insertion process, stabilization of the carrier within the membrane following insertion, or protection of the inserted carrier from proteolytic scavenging. A new plasmid that expresses the temperature-resistant isoform of the melibiose carrier under inducible control of a tac promoter, designated pKKMB, is also described."
https://openalex.org/W1533812154,"Abstract Escherichia coli pyruvate oxidase is a membrane-associated flavoprotein dehydrogenase which is greatly activated by lipids and detergents. The carboxyl-terminal region of the protein has been shown to play a critical role in the interaction with lipids. We report mutations generated by chemical and oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the poxB gene which result in enzymes defective in lipid activation. Nine mutants were isolated which encode enzymes with point mutations in the carboxyl-terminal segment of the protein. Two mutant lesions introduced termination codons giving enzymes lacking the last nine or three amino acids of the protein which were unable to interact with detergents in vitro and were unable to function in vivo. Of the missense mutants isolated, two were most informative. One was the substitution of Glu-564 with proline in the PoxB16 oxidase. This residue lies in the center of a putative lipid-binding amphipathic alpha-helix (Arg-558 to Thr-568) located close to the carboxyl terminus. Strains producing the PoxB16 oxidase were devoid of oxidase activity in vivo, the enzymes could not be activated by Triton X-100, and were activated poorly by phospholipids in vitro. These results indicated that the PoxB16 oxidase lacked normal lipid-binding ability. Another mutant oxidase (PoxB15) in which proline was substituted for Asp-560 at the beginning of the amphipathic alpha-helix had normal oxidase activity. These findings indicate that the amphipathic alpha-helix structure plays an essential role in the activation and lipid-binding properties of the enzyme. The second informative missense mutation was the substitution of the carboxyl-terminal arginine with glycine. This enzyme showed normal activation in vitro by phospholipids and some detergents, and somewhat reduced activity in vivo. This mutant enzyme appeared to dissociate from detergent vesicles more readily than does the normal enzyme. A model for the membrane interaction of the carboxyl terminus based on the properties of these mutant proteins is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1538688290,"Abstract Using isolated chromaffin granule ghosts from bovine adrenal medullae, we have studied the kinetics of dopamine beta-monooxygenase (D beta M) activity as it is linked to dopamine transport. Measurements of the initial rates of transport and of transport-linked norepinephrine formation suggested that enzyme activity may be partially rate-limiting in the coupled carrier/enzyme system. This was confirmed by (i) measurements of initial rates of norepinephrine formation using deuterated substrate, which gave isotope effects greater than 2.0, and (ii) kinetic measurements using ghosts pulsed with varying concentrations of labeled dopamine, which indicated substantial substrate accumulation in the vesicle interior as a function of time. Initial rates of product formation, when combined with approximations of internal substrate concentrations, allowed estimates of Kcat and Km for intravesicular D beta M. Activation by external reductant was apparent in both initial rate parameters and the measurements of transients. Under conditions of optimal D beta M activity, the enzyme rate parameters (kcat = 0.31 nmol/s.mg and Km = 2 mM) indicated partial rate limitation compared to dopamine transport (kcat = 0.38 nmol/s.mg and Km = 32 microM). Compartmental analysis of the time curves, performed using numerical nonlinear least squares methods, gave least squares estimates of rate constants for a simple carrier mechanism and kcat values for D beta M which were consistent with estimates from initial rates."
https://openalex.org/W1587621662,"The core structure of retroviruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), consists of proteins that are initially synthesized as polyprotein precursors and then processed by a virally encoded protease yielding the mature core polypeptides. To obtain sufficient quantities of the purified HIV core precursor p55 for detailed studies, a segment of HIV DNA encoding the full length core precursor polyprotein p55 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a plasmid containing a constitutive galactose promoter. The expression of this DNA produced a protein with an estimated molecular size of 55,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE); this protein was immunoreactive to anti-HIV p24 antisera. Following cell lysis, freezing, and thawing, the expressed protein was an insoluble aggregate that served as the starting material for the purification process. Solubilization of the insoluble p55 with guanidine HCl followed by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography resulted in a preparation of p55 that was greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE, immunoreactive to anti-HIV core protein antibodies, and completely soluble in aqueous solution. The expressed p55 appeared to be myristoylated as evidenced by the incorporation of radiolabel following incubation of recombinant yeast cells with [3H]myristic acid; in addition the amino terminus of the final purified protein was blocked. Proteolytic digestion of purified p55 with synthetic HIV protease yielded the predicted amino- and carboxyl-terminal products; these were confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis. In contrast, digestion of purified p55 by the protease derived from the avian myeloblastosis virus resulted in fragments that were different in size from those produced by the HIV protease. The availability of the purified, full length water-soluble HIV core precursor will be useful in identifying agents that inhibit its processing by the HIV protease."
https://openalex.org/W1554828690,"Abstract The synthesis of coliphage N4 middle RNAs requires the activity of three phage-coded proteins, P7, P4, and P17, of molecular weights 40,000, 30,000, and 15,000, respectively. P4 and P7 constitute a heterodimeric RNA polymerase, N4 RNA polymerase II, which cannot transcribe or bind to native N4 DNA. Denatured templates are transcribed but without specificity. We present the development of an in vitro transcription system, composed of purified N4 RNA polymerase II and solubilized P17, which accurately utilizes in vivo sites of transcription initiation. Possible mechanisms for P17 action are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575798687,"Abstract The replication initiator protein (gene II protein (gpII] of bacteriophage f1 is a multifunctional protein that plays central roles in initiation and termination of phage DNA replication. It introduces a nick at a specific site on the (+)-strand of supercoiled replicative form DNA. The 3'-hydroxyl end of the nick serves as the primer for (+)-strand rolling-circle replication. Upon completion of a round of synthesis, gpII cleaves and circulaizes the displaced single strand. When Mn2+ is included in the buffer instead of Mg2+, gpII cleaves both strands. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of the Mn2+-dependent double-strand cleavage activity of gpII. This reaction, unlike nicking in the presence of Mg2+, does not require superhelicity. The reaction proceeds in two kinetic steps: first nicking of the (+)-strand, and then cleavage of the (-)-strand. The nucleotide sequence requirement for nicking is reduced compared to that in the presence of Mg2+. The product of the double-strand cleavage has an unusual structure. The left end is a telomere-like hairpin since the (+)- and (-)-strands are joined, as demonstrated by base sequencing. The right end has a onebase 3'-overhang. This reaction probably reflects the cleavage-joining activity of gpII in the termination event."

Relayed spin-echo difference spectroscopy (RESED) was used to reveal subspectra of the phosphorylated residues. In this way the attachment position of the phosphate group could be established. The structures of the phosphorylated compounds turned out to be (Formula: see text) and (Formula: see text) RESED spectroscopy has proved to be a suitable method in analyzing low amounts of phosphorylated oligosaccharides.
https://openalex.org/W1532588608,"The unassembled (soluble) and assembled (particulate) pools of clathrin in murine lymphocytes have been separated by centrifugation, and specifically quantified by immunoblotting of cellular extracts with an anticlathrin heavy chain monoclonal antibody. In resting spleen lymphocytes only 25-30% of the total cellular clathrin was found to be present in an assembled form. Upon activation of lymphocytes with B or T cell mitogens (lipopolysaccharide or concanavalin A), the levels of assembled clathrin increased to 60% of the total. These changes in the levels of assembled clathrin were not due to an increase in total cellular clathrin concentration following lymphocyte activation, but rather to changes in the steady state ratio of assembled to unassembled clathrin. The increase in assembled clathrin preceded the expression of transferrin receptors, as measured by the cell surface binding of an antitransferrin receptor monoclonal antibody, and maximal DNA synthesis, indicating that clathrin assembly occurs early after lymphocyte activation and precedes cell division. Immunofluorescence analysis of activated lymphocytes with an anti-clathrin heavy chain monoclonal antibody revealed a punctuate staining pattern characteristic of coated pits and vesicles. Activated B lymphocytes displayed particularly prominent staining in the perinuclear region compared to T cells, suggesting that clathrin assembly may be important for B cell functions such as immunoglobulin synthesis or secretion. These results suggest that in lymphocytes, clathrin assembly is a dynamic process that is triggered by mitogenic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1562689821,"Abstract To further investigate insulin's role in regulating the turnover of insulin receptor during down-regulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the relationship between the cellular distribution and turnover of unoccupied, noncovalently occupied, and covalently occupied receptor was examined. At steady-state 12% of the unoccupied receptors and 46% of covalently occupied receptors are intracellular. The apparent first-order rate constant (Kapp) for turnover of the total pool of covalently occupied receptors (0.16 h-1) is 3.8-fold higher than that for unoccupied receptors (0.042 h-1). When unlabeled insulin is added, identical values for both Kapp (0.10 h-1) and distribution (26% internal) are measured for noncovalently and covalently occupied receptors. The rate constant (Kdeg), describing the relative sensitivity of internalized receptor to degradation, is identical (0.36-0.41 h-1) for unoccupied, noncovalently occupied, and permanently occupied pools of internal receptor. Mechanisms for down-regulation postulating: (a) an occupancy-dependent alteration in the conformation of internal receptor increasing receptor sensitivity to internal proteases, (b) a preferential sorting of internal occupied receptor to degradative pathways, or (c) induction of intracellular proteases by insulin, would all reflect a substantial change in Kdeg for occupied receptor and thus are unlikely mechanisms by which insulin increases the rate of receptor turnover. The turnover of insulin receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is regulated primarily by its intracellular concentration and not by the state of occupancy of internalized receptor."
