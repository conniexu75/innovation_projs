https://openalex.org/W4210396544,"Tooth enamel, renowned for its high stiffness, hardness, and viscoelasticity, is an ideal model for designing biomimetic materials, but accurate replication of complex hierarchical organization of high-performance biomaterials in scalable abiological composites is challenging. We engineered an enamel analog with the essential hierarchical structure at multiple scales through assembly of amorphous intergranular phase (AIP)-coated hydroxyapatite nanowires intertwined with polyvinyl alcohol. The nanocomposite simultaneously exhibited high stiffness, hardness, strength, viscoelasticity, and toughness, exceeding the properties of enamel and previously manufactured bulk enamel-inspired materials. The presence of AIP, polymer confinement, and strong interfacial adhesion are all needed for high mechanical performance. This multiscale design is suitable for scalable production of high-performance materials."
https://openalex.org/W4210718579,"Past studies offer contradictory claims for the role of genome organization in the regulation of gene activity. Here, we show through high-resolution chromosome conformation analysis that the Drosophila genome is organized by two independent classes of regulatory sequences, tethering elements and insulators. Quantitative live imaging and targeted genome editing demonstrate that this two-tiered organization is critical for the precise temporal dynamics of Hox gene transcription during development. Tethering elements mediate long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and foster fast activation kinetics. Conversely, the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) prevent spurious interactions with enhancers and silencers located in neighboring TADs. These two levels of genome organization operate independently of one another to ensure precision of transcriptional dynamics and the reliability of complex patterning processes."

Herein, we report an approach to aliphatic carbon–hydrogen bond diversification using radical chain transfer featuring an easily prepared O -alkenylhydroxamate reagent, which upon mild heating facilitates a range of challenging or previously undeveloped aliphatic carbon–hydrogen bond functionalizations of small molecules and polyolefins. This broad reaction platform enabled the functionalization of postconsumer polyolefins in infrastructure used to process plastic waste. Furthermore, the chemoselective placement of ionic functionality onto a branched polyolefin using carbon–hydrogen bond functionalization upcycled the material from a thermoplastic into a tough elastomer with the tensile properties of high-value polyolefin ionomers."
https://openalex.org/W4210530467,"Reconfigurable devices offer the ability to program electronic circuits on demand. In this work, we demonstrated on-demand creation of artificial neurons, synapses, and memory capacitors in post-fabricated perovskite NdNiO3 devices that can be simply reconfigured for a specific purpose by single-shot electric pulses. The sensitivity of electronic properties of perovskite nickelates to the local distribution of hydrogen ions enabled these results. With experimental data from our memory capacitors, simulation results of a reservoir computing framework showed excellent performance for tasks such as digit recognition and classification of electrocardiogram heartbeat activity. Using our reconfigurable artificial neurons and synapses, simulated dynamic networks outperformed static networks for incremental learning scenarios. The ability to fashion the building blocks of brain-inspired computers on demand opens up new directions in adaptive networks."

This retrospective study examines if, and to what degree, a relationship exists between pre-infection serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level and disease severity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2.The records of individuals admitted between April 7th, 2020 and February 4th, 2021 to the Galilee Medical Center (GMC) in Nahariya, Israel, with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) were searched for historical 25(OH)D levels measured 14 to 730 days prior to the positive PCR test.Patients admitted to GMC with COVID-19 were categorized according to disease severity and level of 25(OH)D. An association between pre-infection 25(OH)D levels, divided between four categories (deficient, insufficient, adequate, and high-normal), and COVID-19 severity was ascertained utilizing a multivariable regression analysis. To isolate the possible influence of the sinusoidal pattern of seasonal 25(OH)D changes throughout the year, a cosinor model was used.Of 1176 patients admitted, 253 had records of a 25(OH)D level prior to COVID-19 infection. A lower vitamin D status was more common in patients with the severe or critical disease (<20 ng/mL [87.4%]) than in individuals with mild or moderate disease (<20 ng/mL [34.3%] p < 0.001). Patients with vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) were 14 times more likely to have severe or critical disease than patients with 25(OH)D ≥40 ng/mL (odds ratio [OR], 14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 51; p < 0.001).Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D was associated with increased disease severity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4221083848,"We discovered a highly virulent variant of subtype-B HIV-1 in the Netherlands. One hundred nine individuals with this variant had a 0.54 to 0.74 log 10 increase (i.e., a ~3.5-fold to 5.5-fold increase) in viral load compared with, and exhibited CD4 cell decline twice as fast as, 6604 individuals with other subtype-B strains. Without treatment, advanced HIV—CD4 cell counts below 350 cells per cubic millimeter, with long-term clinical consequences—is expected to be reached, on average, 9 months after diagnosis for individuals in their thirties with this variant. Age, sex, suspected mode of transmission, and place of birth for the aforementioned 109 individuals were typical for HIV-positive people in the Netherlands, which suggests that the increased virulence is attributable to the viral strain. Genetic sequence analysis suggests that this variant arose in the 1990s from de novo mutation, not recombination, with increased transmissibility and an unfamiliar molecular mechanism of virulence."
https://openalex.org/W4210700388,"Understanding how excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs are integrated by neurons requires monitoring their subthreshold behavior. We probed the subthreshold dynamics using optogenetic depolarizing pulses in hippocampal neuronal assemblies in freely moving mice. Excitability decreased during sharp-wave ripples coupled with increased I. In contrast to this ""negative gain,"" optogenetic probing showed increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable place fields in initially non-place cells. Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave ripples in the home cage predicted spatial overlap and sequences of place fields of both place cells and unmasked preexisting place fields of non-place cells during track running. Thus, indirect probing of subthreshold dynamics in neuronal populations permits the disclosing of preexisting assemblies and modes of neuronal operations."

https://openalex.org/W4226041466,"Modestly increased expression of transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) gene have been reported in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other neuromuscular diseases. However, whether this modest elevation triggers neurodegeneration is not known. Although high levels of TDP-43 overexpression have been modeled in mice and shown to cause early death, models with low-level overexpression that mimic the human condition have not been established. In this study, transgenic mice overexpressing wild type TDP-43 at less than 60% above the endogenous CNS levels were constructed, and their phenotypes analyzed by a variety of techniques, including biochemical, molecular, histological, behavioral techniques and electromyography. The TDP-43 transgene was expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the cortex and predominantly in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord. The mice developed a reproducible progressive weakness ending in paralysis in mid-life. Detailed analysis showed ~30% loss of large pyramidal neurons in the layer V motor cortex; in the spinal cord, severe demyelination was accompanied by oligodendrocyte injury, protein aggregation, astrogliosis and microgliosis, and elevation of neuroinflammation. Surprisingly, there was no loss of lower motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord despite the complete paralysis of the hindlimbs. However, denervation was detected at the neuromuscular junction. These results demonstrate that low-level TDP-43 overexpression can cause diverse aspects of ALS, including late-onset and progressive motor dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that persistent modest elevations in TDP-43 expression can lead to ALS and other neurological disorders involving TDP-43 proteinopathy. Because of the predictable and progressive clinical paralytic phenotype, this transgenic mouse model will be useful in preclinical trial of therapeutics targeting neurological disorders associated with elevated levels of TDP-43."
https://openalex.org/W4225865038,"Frequent applications of synthetic insecticides might cause environmental pollution due to the high residue. In addition, increasing insecticide resistance in many insect pests requires novel pest control methods. Nanotechnology could be a promising field of modern agriculture, and is receiving considerable attention in the development of novel nano-agrochemicals, such as nanoinsectticides and nanofertilizers. This study assessed the effects of the lethal and sublethal concentrations of chlorantraniliprole, thiocyclam, and their nano-forms on the development, reproductive activity, oxidative stress enzyme activity, and DNA changes in the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon , at the molecular level. The results revealed that A . ipsilon larvae were more susceptible to the nano-forms than the regular forms of both nano chlorine and sulfur within the chlorantraniliprole and thiocyclam insecticides, respectively, with higher toxicities than the regular forms (ca. 3.86, and ca.2.06-fold, respectively). Significant differences in biological parameters, including developmental time and reproductive activity (fecundity and hatchability percent) were also observed. Correspondingly, increases in oxidative stress enzyme activities were observed, as were mutagenic effects on the genomic DNA of A . ipsilon after application of the LC 50 of the nano-forms of both insecticides compared to the control. These promising results could represent a crucial step toward developing efficient nanoinsecticides for sustainable control of A . ipsilon ."
https://openalex.org/W4210447118,"Long-acting injectable (LAI) antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a novel HIV treatment option for people with HIV. The first LAI ART regimen for HIV treatment received regulatory approval in the United States in January 2021. In February 2020, we collected qualitative data from 18 consumers and 23 clinical and non-clinical stakeholders to catalog anticipated individual-consumer, healthcare system, and structural levels barriers and facilitators to LAI ART implementation in Los Angeles County, California. Thematic analysis was guided by the CFIR implementation science model. CFIR constructs of intervention characteristics, individual characteristics, outer and inner setting, intervention characteristics, and implementation process emerged in analysis. Under intervention characteristics, anticipated facilitators included the relative advantage of LAI ART over pills for adherence and reduced treatment management burden and related anxiety; anticipated barriers included non-adherence to injection appointments, concerns of developing HIV resistance, discomfort with injection and cost. Anticipated facilitators based on individual characteristics included overall acceptability based on knowledge and positive beliefs about LAI ART. Participant noted several characteristics of the outer setting that could negatively impact implementation, such as medical mistrust, external policies, and LAI ART eligibility (i.e., to be virally suppressed prior to initiation). Participants were optimistic about the potential to decrease stigma but expressed that provider willingness for adoption could be hindered by challenges in organizational inner setting related to payment authorizations, increased staffing needs, medication procurement and storage, and provider and healthcare system readiness. Results from this pre-implementation study may inform rollout and scale-up of LAI ART in Los Angeles County."
https://openalex.org/W4210476912,"Second sound attenuation, a distinctive dissipative hydrodynamic phenomenon in a superfluid, is crucial for understanding superfluidity and elucidating critical phenomena. Here, we report the observation of second sound attenuation in a homogeneous Fermi gas of lithium-6 atoms at unitarity by performing Bragg spectroscopy with high energy resolution in the long-wavelength limit. We successfully obtained the temperature dependence of second sound diffusivity [Formula: see text] and thermal conductivity κ. Furthermore, we observed a sudden rise-a precursor of critical divergence-in both [Formula: see text] and κ at a temperature of about 0.95 superfluid transition temperature [Formula: see text]. This suggests that the unitary Fermi gas has a much larger critical region than does liquid helium. Our results pave the way for determining the universal critical scaling functions near quantum criticality."
https://openalex.org/W4210610780,"The mammalian blastocyst consists of three distinct cell types: epiblast, trophoblast (TB), and primitive endoderm (PrE). Although embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) retain the functional properties of epiblast and TB, respectively, stem cells that fully recapitulate the developmental potential of PrE have not been established. Here, we report derivation of primitive endoderm stem cells (PrESCs) in mice. PrESCs recapitulate properties of embryonic day 4.5 founder PrE, are efficiently incorporated into PrE upon blastocyst injection, generate functionally competent PrE-derived tissues, and support fetal development of PrE-depleted blastocysts in chimeras. Furthermore, PrESCs can establish interactions with ESCs and TSCs and generate descendants with yolk sac-like structures in utero. Establishment of PrESCs will enable the elucidation of the mechanisms for PrE specification and subsequent pre- and postimplantation development."
https://openalex.org/W4210595239,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has a severe impact on all aspects of patient care. Among the numerous biomarkers of potential validity for diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19 are biomarkers at the interface of iron metabolism and inflammation.The follow-up study included 54 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with a moderate and severe/critical form of the disease. Iron deficiency specific biomarkers such as iron, ferritin, transferrin receptor, hepcidin, and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) as well as relevant markers of inflammation were evaluated twice: in the first five days when the patient was admitted to the hospital and during five to 15 days; and their validity to diagnose iron deficiency was further assessed. The regression and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to evaluate the prognosis and determine the probability for predicting the severity of the disease in the first five days of COVID-19.Based on hemoglobin values, anemia was observed in 21 of 54 patients. Of all iron deficiency anemia-related markers, only ZnPP was significantly elevated (P<0.001) in the anemic group. When patients were grouped according to the severity of disease, slight differences in hemoglobin or other anemia-related parameters could be observed. However, the levels of ZnPP were significantly increased in the severely ill group of patients. The ratio of ZnPP to lymphocyte count (ZnPP/L) had a discrimination power stronger than the neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio (N/L) to determine disease severity. Additionally, only two markers were independently associated with the severity of COVID-19 in logistic regression analysis; D-dimer (OR (5.606)(95% CI 1.019-30.867)) and ZnPP/L ratio (OR (74.313) (95% CI 1.081-5108.103)).For the first time ZnPP in COVID-19 patients were reported in this study. Among all iron-related markers tested, ZnPP was the only one that was associated with anemia as based on hemoglobin. The increase in ZnPP might indicate that the underlying cause of anemia in COVID-19 patients is not only due to the inflammation but also of nutritional origin. Additionally, the ZnPP/L ratio might be a valid prognostic marker for the severity of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4210451262,"COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the global economy and affected millions of people’s work and personal lives across the world. The purpose of the present study was to better understand how individuals’ work and personal goals have been affected by the pandemic and how they have adapted to these changes. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews ( n = 48) and surveyed participants ( n = 200) weekly for 5 weeks. Both methods revealed similar themes regarding the adaptation and pursuit of goals (social support, handling unpredictable situations, logistics, solving problems creatively, goal postponement, and no changes). Survey responses also showed that most individuals experienced their goals as more difficult (79%; 13% easier; 9% no change) and found that many had had to adapt or postpone their work and personal goals, often due to logistical difficulties. Businesses and governments should do more to help individuals adapt their goals to the new circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W4225722753,"Introduction Globally, stunting is a significant public health concern and it is very critical in Ethiopia. This research aims to determine the prevalence of stunting and its correlates among children in the pastoral community. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dubti District, Afar Region, North East Ethiopia from 2–31 January 2018. A total of 554 children were recruited using a multi-stage sampling technique and participated in this study. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors linked to stunting. The significance of the associations was determined at a p-value &lt; 0.05 and the adjusted odds ratio at 95% CI was calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations. Results The prevalence of stunting was 39.5% (95% CI: 35.4–43.5%). The odds of stunting were increased, so does the age of the child increased as compared to 6–11 months of children. Initiating breastfeeding after 1 hour after birth (AOR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.22, 3.23), not exclusively breastfeeding for at least 6 months (AOR = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.49, 4.42), poor dietary diversity (AOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.62), and using unprotected water for drinking (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.94) were significant factors. Conclusion Among children aged 6–59 months, the level of stunting in the pastoral community was significantly high. The study found that stunting was associated with multiple nutritional and non-nutritional factors. To tackle stunting, inter-sectoral cooperation is needed by enhancing the clean water supply of the community, optimal breastfeeding practice, food diversity, and economic status."
https://openalex.org/W4225808705,"Population immunity (herd immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 derives from two sources: vaccinations or cases of infection with the virus. Infections can be diagnosed as COVID-19 and registered, or they can be asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, or even full-blown but undiagnosed and unregistered when patients recovered at home. Estimation of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is difficult and remains a subject of speculations. Here we present a population screening for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in Polish citizens (N = 501) who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were collected in Wrocław (Lower Silesia) on 15th and 22nd May 2021. Sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 22) or from vaccinated citizens (N = 14) served as positive controls. Sera were tested with Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG and IgA (quantitative) that contain specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens: NCP, RBD, Spike S2, E, ACE2, PLPro protein, and antigens for exclusion cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV 229E Np, HCoV NL63 Np. Within the investigated population of healthy individuals who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found that 35.5% (178 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 52.3% (262 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA; 21.2% of the investigated population developed virus-specific IgG or IgA while being asymptomatic. Anti-RBD IgG, which represents virus-neutralizing potential, was found in 25.6% of individuals (128 out of 501). These patients, though positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cannot be identified in the public health system as convalescents due to undiagnosed infections, and they are considered unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Their contribution to population immunity against COVID-19 should however be considered in predictions and modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the majority of the investigated population still lacked anti-RBD IgG protection (74.4%); thus vaccination against COVID-19 is still of the most importance for controlling the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210311258,"Agriculture is a very important sector of the economy that has a great influence on rural areas. Almost sixty years of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union (EU) may impose a question on the impact of this policy on job creation and economic growth in rural areas. By analyzing key indicators, one should note that although there are still many problems to tackle, the CAP has been successful to some extend in increasing employment rate and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as well as decreasing poverty rate in the EU rural areas. There are also more and more households connected to the next-generation broadband network and there is still a significant number of bed places in the EU rural areas. Although, the situation in specific EU Member States and their rural regions may be different, the overall performance of the EU is satisfactory and shows positive prognostics for the current EU financial perspective of 2021-2027. This paper also provides an empirical approach which checks whether there is a connection between the employment rate and the rural development measured in GDP per capita based on the data from the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the period of 2000-2020. This research confirms that when increasing the level of rural employment, the economic growth rises in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W4210467439,"Early rehabilitation is indicated in critically ill adults to counter functional complications. However, the physiological response to rehabilitation is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the cardiorespiratory response to rehabilitation and to investigate the effect of explanatory variables on physiological changes during rehabilitation and recovery.In a prospectively planned, secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary, mixed intensive care unit (ICU), we analysed the 716 physiotherapy-led, pragmatic rehabilitation sessions (including exercise, cycling and mobilisation). Participants were previously functionally independent, mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults (n = 108). Physiological data (2-minute medians) were collected with standard ICU monitoring and indirect calorimetry, and their medians calculated for baseline (30min before), training (during physiotherapy) and recovery (15min after). We visualised physiological trajectories and investigated explanatory variables on their estimated effect with mixed-effects models.This study found a large range of variation within and across participants' sessions with clinically relevant variations (>10%) occurring in more than 1 out of 4 sessions in mean arterial pressure, minute ventilation (MV) and oxygen consumption (VO2), although early rehabilitation did not generally affect physiological values from baseline to training or recovery. Active patient participation increased MV (mean difference 0.7l/min [0.4-1.0, p<0.001]) and VO2 (23ml/min [95%CI: 13-34, p<0.001]) during training when compared to passive participation. Similarly, session type 'mobilisation' increased heart rate (6.6bpm [2.1-11.2, p = 0.006]) during recovery when compared to 'exercise'. Other modifiable explanatory variables included session duration, mobilisation level and daily medication, while non-modifiable variables were age, gender, body mass index and the daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.A large range of variation during rehabilitation and recovery mirrors the heterogenous interventions and patient reactions. This warrants close monitoring and individual tailoring, whereby the best option to stimulate a cardiorespiratory response seems to be active patient participation, shorter session durations and mobilisation.German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) identification number: DRKS00004347, registered on 10 September 2012."
https://openalex.org/W4210268680,"Despite the low prevalence of help-seeking behavior among victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) in India, quantitative evidence on risk factors, is limited. We use a previously validated exploratory approach, to examine correlates of help-seeking from anyone (e.g. family, friends, police, doctor etc.), as well as help-seeking from any formal sources.We used data from a nationally-representative health survey conducted in 2015-16 in India, and included all variables in the dataset (~6000 variables) as independent variables. Two machine learning (ML) models were used- L-1, and L-2 regularized logistic regression models. The results from these models were qualitatively coded by researchers to identify broad themes associated with help-seeking behavior. This process of implementing ML models followed by qualitative coding was repeated until pre-specified criteria were met.Identified themes associated with help-seeking behavior included experience of injury from violence, husband's controlling behavior, husband's consumption of alcohol, and being currently separated from husband. Themes related to women's access to social and economic resources, such as women's employment, and receipt of maternal and reproductive health services were also noted to be related factors. We observed similarity in correlates for seeking help from anyone, vs from formal sources, with a greater focus on women being separated for help-seeking from formal sources.Findings highlight the need for community programs to reach out to women trapped in abusive relationships, as well as the importance of women's social and economic connectedness; future work should consider holistic interventions that integrate IPV screening and support services with women's health related services."
https://openalex.org/W4210440269,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and has received considerable research attention, including using neuroimaging biomarkers to classify patients and/or predict disease progression. Generalized linear models, e.g., logistic regression, can be used as classifiers, but since the spatial measurements are correlated and often outnumber subjects, penalized and/or Bayesian models will be identifiable, while classical models often will not. Many useful models, e.g., the elastic net and spike-and-slab lasso, perform automatic variable selection, which removes extraneous predictors and reduces model variance, but neither model exploits spatial information in selecting variables. Spatial information can be incorporated into variable selection by placing intrinsic autoregressive priors on the logit probabilities of inclusion within a spike-and-slab elastic net framework. We demonstrate the ability of this framework to improve classification performance by using cortical thickness and tau-PET images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to classify subjects as cognitively normal or having dementia, and by using a simulation study to examine model performance using finer resolution images."
https://openalex.org/W4210462706,"China has stepped into an era of aging society, where the impending considerable economic burden attributed to high prevalence of dementia in the elderly appears to be one of the most important health and social issues to deal with for the country. However, population-based quantification and projections for the economic burden of dementia in China are lacking for further health action and policy making.To estimate and predict the costs of managing dementia in the elderly population aged 60 and above from 2010 to 2050 in China.Data were collected from a six-province study (n = 7072) and other multiple sources for calculation of the economic burden of dementia. With the convincing data from published studies, we quantified and projected the costs attributed to dementia in China from 2010 to 2050.The national cost of dementia in 2010 was estimated to be US$22.8 billion by the opportunity cost method and US$26.4 billion by the proxy method. In 2050, the costs would increase to US$372.3 billion by the opportunity cost method and US$430.6 billion by the proxy method, consuming 0.53% and 0.61% of China's total GDP, respectively. A series of sensitivity analyses showed that the changes in the proportions of informal caregiving led to the most robust changes in the total burden of care for dementia in China.Dementia represents an enormous burden on China's population health and economy. Due to the changes in policies and population structure, policymakers should give priority to dementia care."
https://openalex.org/W4210660422,"Burkholderia pseudomallei-a causative agent of melioidosis that is endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia-is a Gram-negative bacterium transmitted to humans via inhalation, inoculation through skin abrasions, and ingestion. Melioidosis causes a range of clinical presentations including skin infection, pneumonia, and septicemia. Despite skin infection being one of the clinical symptoms of melioidosis, the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei in skin fibroblasts has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated B. pseudomallei pathogenesis in the HFF-1 human skin fibroblasts. On the basis of co-culture assays between different B. pseudomallei clinical strains and the HFF-1 human skin fibroblasts, we found that all B. pseudomallei strains have the ability to mediate invasion, intracellular replication, and multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) formation. Furthermore, all strains showed a significant increase in cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts, which coincides with the augmented expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2. Using B. pseudomallei mutants, we showed that the B. pseudomallei Bsa type III secretion system (T3SS) contributes to skin fibroblast pathogenesis, but O-polysaccharide, capsular polysaccharide, and short-chain dehydrogenase metabolism do not play a role in this process. Taken together, our findings reveal a probable connection for the Bsa T3SS in B. pseudomallei infection of skin fibroblasts, and this may be linked to the pathogenesis of cutaneous melioidosis."
https://openalex.org/W4210686308,"Since they were first introduced to the United States more than 50 years ago, invasive carp have rapidly colonized rivers of the Mississippi River Basin, with detrimental effects on native aquatic species. Their continued range expansion, and potential for subsequent invasion of the Great Lakes, has led to increased concern for the susceptibility of as-yet uncompromised lotic and lentic systems in the central United States. Because invasive carp eggs and larvae must drift in the river current for the first several days following spawning, numerical drift modeling has emerged as a useful technique for determining whether certain river systems and reaches have the potential to support suspension-to-hatching survival of invasive carp eggs, a critical first step in recruitment. Here we use one such numerical modeling approach, the Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg), to estimate bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) egg hatching success and larval retention in a 47.8-kilometer (km) reach of the multi-thread St. Croix River, Minnesota and Wisconsin, United States. We explore three approaches for obtaining the hydraulic data required by FluEgg, parameterizing the model with either (a) field hydraulic data collected within the main channel during a high-flow event, or hydraulic data output from a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model with both (b) steady, and (c) unsteady flows. We find that the three approaches, along with the range of water temperatures and discharge used in simulations, produce vastly different predictions of streamwise transport and in-river egg hatching probability (0% for field data, 0 to 96% for steady-state hydraulic modeling, and 1.8 to 65% for unsteady modeling). However, all FluEgg simulations, regardless of the source of hydraulic data, predicted that no larvae reach the gas bladder inflation stage within the study reach where nursery habitat is abundant. Overall, these results indicate that the lower St. Croix River is suitable for invasive carp spawning and egg suspension until hatching for a range of discharge and water temperatures. These results highlight the role of complex channel hydraulics and morphology, particularly multi-thread reaches, and their inclusion in ecohydraulic-suitability modeling to determine susceptibility of river systems for invasive carp reproduction. Our work also emphasizes the scientific value of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models that can capture the spatial heterogeneity of flow fields in geomorphically complex rivers. This work may help to guide management efforts based on the targeted monitoring and control and improve invasive carp egg and larvae sampling efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4210253153,"Meta-analyses typically quantify heterogeneity of results, thus providing information about the consistency of the investigated effect across studies. Numerous heterogeneity estimators have been devised. Past evaluations of their performance typically presumed lack of bias in the set of studies being meta-analysed, which is often unrealistic. The present study used computer simulations to evaluate five heterogeneity estimators under a range of research conditions broadly representative of meta-analyses in psychology, with the aim to assess the impact of biases in sets of primary studies on estimates of both mean effect size and heterogeneity in meta-analyses of continuous outcome measures. To this end, six orthogonal design factors were manipulated: Strength of publication bias; 1-tailed vs. 2-tailed publication bias; prevalence of p-hacking; true heterogeneity of the effect studied; true average size of the studied effect; and number of studies per meta-analysis. Our results showed that biases in sets of primary studies caused much greater problems for the estimation of effect size than for the estimation of heterogeneity. For the latter, estimation bias remained small or moderate under most circumstances. Effect size estimations remained virtually unaffected by the choice of heterogeneity estimator. For heterogeneity estimates, however, relevant differences emerged. For unbiased primary studies, the REML estimator and (to a lesser extent) the Paule-Mandel performed well in terms of bias and variance. In biased sets of primary studies however, the Paule-Mandel estimator performed poorly, whereas the DerSimonian-Laird estimator and (to a slightly lesser extent) the REML estimator performed well. The complexity of results notwithstanding, we suggest that the REML estimator remains a good choice for meta-analyses of continuous outcome measures across varied circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W4210539805,"While amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA is a common method for studying microbial community, it has been difficult to identify genera and species using next-generation sequencers to examine some regions (e.g., V3-V4 of 16S rRNA) because of the short read lengths. However, the advent of third-generation sequencers has made it possible to analyze the full length of the 16S rRNA gene, which allowed for species level identification at low cost. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the identification with a third-generation sequencer, MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, using nine indigenous bacteria that can pose problems with food poisoning and opportunistic infections as an example. We demonstrated that Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus hirae could be identified at the species level with an accuracy of 96.4% to 97.5%. We also demonstrated that the absolute counts of various bacteria could be determined by spiking the sample with a bacterium as an internal standard. Then, we tested whether this convenient bacterial identification method could evaluate the antibiotic sensitivities of multiple bacteria simultaneously. In order to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility, a mock community, an artificial mixture of the nine bacterial strains, was prepared and cultured in the presence of the antibiotics ofloxacin or chloramphenicol, and the 16S rRNAs were analyzed by using Nanopore sequencer. We confirmed that antibiotic-induced cell count reductions could be measured simultaneously by quantifying the abundances of various bacteria in the mock community before and after culture. It was thus shown that the antibiotic sensitivities of multiple bacteria could be evaluated simultaneously, with distinction made between bactericidal action and bacteriostatic action. This methodology would allow rapid evaluation of antibiotic activity spectrum at the species level containing a wide variety of bacteria, such as biofilm bacteria and gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4210686662,"Although company ownership (local vs. foreign) has been used as a contingency variable that differentiates companies’ environmental activities and performance, the current understanding of these differences is fragmented. None of the previous studies examined the relationships between company ownership and a complex set of organizational practices which promote employees’ pro-environmental behaviors. The article fills the gap in previous research by analyzing the extent to which a total of 37 organizational practices are used. These practices are divided into technical (20 are related to environmental management) and “soft” (17 are related to HRM policies). For this study, both literature studies and a survey covering 199 companies located in Poland were used. In the theoretical part, the paper presents various typologies of factors that enhance employees’ green behavior, with the focus on organizational practices. There is also a review of studies on environmental sustainability which used company ownership as a variable. The results of the empirical research show that–although in foreign companies environmental issues are increasingly perceived as important or very important–many of the practices which are treated as crucial for developing employees’ eco-friendly behaviors are rarely used in both local and foreign companies. Moreover, company ownership was important in the context of using 88% of the “soft” practices and 50% of the technical practices discussed in the article. The article provides implications for policy and practice, as well as directions for further research."
https://openalex.org/W4210311840,"We developed the DriverFuse package to integrate orthogonal data types such as Structural Variants (SV) and Copy Number Variations (CNV) to characterize fusion genes in cancer datasets. A fusion gene is reported as a driver or passenger fusion gene, based on mapping SV and CNV profiles. DriverFuse generates a fusion plot of fusion genes with their mapping SV, CNV profile, domain architecture and classification of its role in cancer. The analysis facilitates discrimination of driver fusions from passenger fusions. To demonstrate the utility of DriverFuse, we analyzed two datasets, one each for CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) for lung cancer and HCC1395BL for breast cancer. The analysis validates the driver fusion genes that are already reported for the datasets. Thus, DriverFuse is a valuable tool for studying the driver fusion genes in cancers, enabling the identification of recurrent complex rearrangements that provide intuitive insights into disease driver events."
https://openalex.org/W4210318047,"Hormonal fluctuations, such as the perinatal period, may increase susceptibility of women to depression, which in turn exert a negative impact on child's neurodevelopment, becoming a risk factor in development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, the use of antidepressants during this critical period presents a serious health concern for both the mother and the child, due to the consequences of treatment in terms of the reliability and safety for the proper neurodevelopment of the organism being not well known. Atypical antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, that targets both serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the central nervous system (CNS), represent a novel focus of research due to its unique pharmacological profile. The aim of this work was to study the effects of maternal depression and/or perinatal antidepressant mirtazapine treatment on the neurobehavioral development of the offspring. Pre-gestationally chronically stressed or non-stressed Wistar rat dams were treated with either mirtazapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle during pregnancy and lactation followed by analysis of offspring's behavior at juvenile and adolescent age. We found mirtazapine induced significant alterations of nursing behavior. In offspring, pregestational stress (PS) had an anxiogenic effect on adolescent males (p≤0.05) and increased their active behavior in forced swim test (p≤0.01). Interaction between pregestational stress and mirtazapine treatment variously induced anxiolytic changes of juvenile (p≤0.05) and adolescent (p≤0.05) females and impairment of spatial memory (p≤0.01) in adolescent females as well. Hippocampal density of synaptophysin, pre-synaptic protein marker, was decreased mainly by mirtazapine treatment. In conclusion, our results show mirtazapine induced significant alterations in maternal behavior and several sex- and age-dependent changes in neurobehavioral development of offspring caused by both prenatal mirtazapine treatment and/or chronic pregestational stress."
https://openalex.org/W4210341291,"International travel can expose travelers to a number of health risks. Pretravel consultation (PC) helps mitigate risk and prepare travelers for health concerns that might arise. The assessment of risk, mitigation strategies, and relevance of pretravel advice is dependent on how closely travelers adhere to their planned travel itinerary and activities. We determined the proportion of returned travelers whose completed travel experiences differed from their stated travel itineraries, and identified discrepancies that significantly altered the traveler's health risk and would have required alternative counseling during their PC.We conducted a prospective cohort study at the SickKids' Family Travel Clinic between October 2014 and November 2015. Returned travelers who completed a post-travel survey were included. Pretravel consultation assessments and post-trip surveys were compared to identify discrepant trip experiences.A total of 389 travelers presented to the clinic for a PC during the study period and 302 (77.6%) were enrolled. Post-travel surveys were received from 119 (39.4%) participants, representing 101 unique itineraries. The median participant age was 36.3 years (IQR 26.6-47.5) and there were 73 female travelers (61%). Most participants (n = 87,73%) were healthy as well as Canadian born (n = 84, 71%). A quarter of travelers were visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (n = 30, 25.2%). The vast majority of returned travelers (n = 109, 92%) reported discrepant trip experiences involving trip duration, countries visited, accommodations, environmental surroundings and/or activities. Almost two thirds of these individuals (n = 68, 62%) would have required alternative pretravel counseling. We did not identify any demographic or planned trip characteristics that predicted discrepant trip experiences requiring alternative pretravel counseling.The majority of travelers reported discrepant trip experiences and the discrepancies often affected health risk. Therefore, clinicians should consider providing broader counselling during the PC as discrepancies from planned travel are common."
https://openalex.org/W4210396902,"Whether fluid overload is associated with vascular stiffness parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that interdialytic fluid accumulation increases vascular stiffness parameters, which improves with intradialytic ultrafiltration.Fluid overload and vascular stiffness parameters were assessed in 39 HD patients (20 with and 19 without fluid overload) and compared to 26 healthy controls. Fluid status was assessed 15 minutes before the mid-week HD session by bio-impedance spectroscopy. Following this, ambulatory pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) were measured for 24 hours before another mid-week HD session and then for 5 hours starting 30 minutes before and ending 30 minutes after the session.HD patients had significant fluid overload compared to healthy controls (2.0±2.4 vs. -0.2±0.6 L; P<0.001) and baseline PWV was higher (10.3±1.7 vs. 8.8±1.4 m/s; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between PWV and AIx in fluid overloaded and non-fluid overloaded HD patients prior to, or during the HD session. AIx of non-fluid overloaded HD patients improved after the HD session (P = 0.04). Average 24-hour AIx was higher in fluid overloaded HD patients (P<0.001).Inter- and intradialytic changes in fluid volume were only weakly related to vascular stiffness parameters in HD patients. Although there was a modest reduction in AIx in non-fluid overloaded HD patients after the dialysis session, fluid removal did not improve vascular stiffness parameters during the HD session. We speculate that the effect of fluid overload correction on vascular stiffness parameters requires long-term adjustments in the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W4210443790,"The dynamic of HIV-viral load (VL) remains poorly investigated in HIV/HCV patients under direct acting antivirals (DAAs).We retrospectively evaluated HIV-VL at baseline (BL) during and up to 24 weeks post-DAAs in a cohort of 305 HIV-1/HCV patients, on ART and with no HIV virological failure (VF) in the 6 months before treatment with DAAs; during the period of observation VF was defined as confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL; virological blips (VB, transient, not confirmed, VL ≥50 copies/mL). Stepwise Cox regression models were fitted to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of VF.Fifteen VF occurred in 13 patients over 187 person-years of follow-up (PYFU): incidence rate (IR) of 8.0 per 100-PYFU (95% CI = 4.0-12.1); 29 VBs were detected in 26 patients over 184 PYFU: IR = 15.8 per 100-PYFU (95% CI = 10.0-21.5). The most prominent factor associated with VF was the presence of BL HIV residual viremia (RV = HIV-RNA detectable but not precisely quantifiable) [aHR = 12.26 (95% CI = 3.74-40.17), P<0.0001]. Other factors were ≥1 VBs in the 6 months before DAAs [aHR = 6.95 (95% CI = 1.77-27.37) P = 0.006] number of ART regimens failed before DAAs initiation [aHR (per more regimen) = 1.22 (95% CI = 1.04-1.42), P = 0.012] and age [aHR (per year older) = 1.16 (95% CI = 1.04-1.29), P = 0.010].Our findings underline the importance for close monitoring HIV-VL in selected patients.

https://openalex.org/W4210501695,"The formation of an efficient market depends on the competition between different investment strategies, which accelerates all available information into asset prices. By incorporating market impact and two kinds of investment strategies into an agent-based model, we have investigated the coevolutionary mechanism of different investment strategies and the role of market impact in shaping a competitive advantage in financial markets. The coevolution of history-dependent strategies and reference point strategies depends on the levels of market impact and risk tolerance. For low market impact and low risk tolerance, the majority-win effect makes the trend-following strategies become dominant strategies. For high market impact and low risk tolerance, the minority-win effect makes the trend-rejecting strategies coupled with trend-following strategies become dominant strategies. The coupled effects of price fluctuations and strategy distributions have been investigated in depth. A U-shape distribution of history-dependent strategies is beneficial for a stable price, which is destroyed by the existence of reference point strategies with low risk tolerance. A δ-like distribution of history-dependent strategies leads to a large price fluctuation, which is suppressed by the existence of reference point strategies with high risk tolerance. The strategies that earn more in an inefficient market lose more in an efficient market. Such a result gives us another explanation for the principle of risk-profit equilibrium in financial markets: high return in an inefficient market should be coupled with high risk in an efficient market, low return in an inefficient market should be coupled with low risk in an efficient market."

There are fragmented and inconsistent findings on preventive practices for sexually transmitted infections. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis protocol aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of preventive practices of sexually transmitted infections and identify its determinants among young people in Ethiopia. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) will be used to develop the review protocol. Online databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google, and Google Scholar will be used to search published and unpublished studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument will be used to assess the quality of the study. Statistical heterogeneity will be checked using the Cochran Q test and I 2 statistics. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression will be performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity. The statistical analysis will be performed using STATA version 14 software. A random-effects model will be performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and identify determinants of preventive practices of sexually transmitted infections. Discussion Young people have a high unmet need for sexual and reproductive health services and poor preventive practices toward sexually transmitted infections. Although there are studies on preventive practices for sexually transmitted infections, there is no study finding on the pooled prevalence of preventive practices for sexually transmitted infections and its determinants among young people in Ethiopia. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will help to develop appropriate strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4210519377,"This study assesses the practices and views of Scottish dairy farmers relating to pasture-based and indoor systems. There are the debates about the environmental, economic and animal welfare implications of these systems. Indoor dairy farming is a contentious practice among the public. While this controversy is sometimes represented as a lack of public understanding, there is a need for more research on farmers' views to facilitate discussion in the industry. A survey was posted to 909 dairy farmers in Scotland with questions about their grazing practices and attitudes to grazing and indoor systems. 254 surveys were completed, online and in paper form. There was a 26% response rate to the paper version of the survey. The results showed that 19% of respondents housed some or all the cows all year-round. 68% agreed or strongly agreed that cows should graze for part of the year and 51% agreed or strongly agreed that welfare was better if cows grazed for part of the year. These views coexisted with the view that management was more important than the type of system for determining profitability or welfare outcomes (83% and 82% strongly agree or agree respectively). Respondents whose system involved grazing and respondents who had spent longer in farming were moderately more likely to agree that cows should have access to pasture, and slightly less likely to agree that management was more important than system for determining welfare outcomes. The results indicate that the picture is more complicated than the public rejecting indoor dairy farming and those in the industry accepting it. The results showed that a majority preference for cows to graze co-existed with the view that management was more important than system. In terms of industry and policy recommendations, the research suggests that measures should be taken to safeguard farmers' ability to graze through for instance research and advisory support on grazing; ensuring different systems are not penalised in the development of dairy sector environmental measures and recommendations; and potentially supply chains that financially rewards farmers for grazing."
https://openalex.org/W4210591216,"Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with depressed mood demonstrate poor cardiovascular behavioral risk profiles and elevated risk for recurrent ACS and mortality. Behavioral Activation (BA) offers an intervention framework for an integrated treatment targeting both depression and critical health behaviors post-ACS. Behavioral Activation for Health and Depression (BA-HD) was developed and pilot tested in a multiphase iterative process.First, an initial treatment manual was conceptualized based on the team's prior work, as well as the extant literature. Second, qualitative interviews were conducted with target patients and target providers on the proposed BA-HD treatment rationale, content, and structure. Framework matrix analyses were used to summarize and aggregate responses. Third, an expert panel was convened to elicit additional manual refinements. Finally, patients with post-ACS depression and health behavior non-adherence were recruited to complete an open pilot trial to evaluate acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ], exit interview) and treatment engagement (number of sessions attended; treatment completion was considered completion of 8 out of 10 possible sessions).The initial BA-HD treatment manual expanded an existing treatment manual for post-ACS BA-based mood management and smoking cessation to target four health behaviors relevant to post-ACS patients (e.g., smoking cessation, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet). After the initial conceptualization, ten post-ACS patients and eight cardiac rehabilitation professionals completed qualitative interviews. Patients endorsed bi-directional interactions between mood and health behaviors post-ACS. Both patients and providers expressed general support of the proposed treatment rationale and values-guided, collaborative goal-setting approach. Patients, providers, and experts provided feedback that shaped the iterative manual development. After the BA-HD manual was finalized, eight participants were enrolled in a single-arm pilot trial. The mean CSQ score was 30.57 ± 2.23, indicating high satisfaction. Seven out of eight (88%) completed treatment. Pre- to post treatment improvements in depressed mood and health behaviors were promising.BA-HD treatment is an acceptable approach to target both mood and health behaviors in post-ACS patients with depression. A future larger, controlled trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the BA-HD treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04158219."
https://openalex.org/W4210620678,"Background The variations in ABO blood groups are reported to be associated with multiple disorders, including ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to investigate the distribution of ABO blood groups in UC patients and explore its impact on disease severity. Methods We retrospectively collected 129 UC patients diagnosed at our hospital between January 2000 and November 2019. Clinical characteristics, ABO blood groups, and operation rates were analyzed. Results The mean diagnostic age of patients was 38.97 years. Males accounted for the majority of all patients (62.8%). Of 129 patients, 43 (33.3%) were blood type O, 41 (31.8%) were blood type A, 38 (29.5%) were blood type B, and 7 (5.4%) were blood type AB. Although our patients had higher ratio of blood type A comparing our general population, there was no statistically significant association of ABO blood types distribution between these two groups (p = 0.1906). In the subgroup analysis, there were no significant difference of disease locations and operation rates between different ABO blood groups. Furthermore, blood type A patients had higher serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels compared to blood type O patients (13.31 g/dL vs. 12.30 g/dL, p = 0.0347). Blood type A patients had lower serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels compared to blood type O patients (12.46 mm/hour vs. 21.5 mm/hour, p = 0.0288). Blood type O had higher serum ESR levels compared to non-O groups (p = 0.0228). In the ABO blood groups and mean diagnostic age (≤ 40 years or &gt; 40 years), there were no statistically significant difference between these two age groups, p = 0.5515. Conclusions Our results showed ABO blood groups are not associated with UC in spite of a higher ratio of blood type A in our patients. Blood type O patients had higher serum ESR levels; however, blood type A patients had higher Hb levels."
https://openalex.org/W4210737413,"On the basis of numerous fluid simulation experiences, researchers have discovered that many common operations can be abstracted to form a general fluid simulation framework. These operations include the discretization of equations and variables, the computation of the coefficients, the assembly of the linear or nonlinear systems, the solving of the systems, etc. Furthermore, all of the operations can be attributed to the operations ""in the field"", which is an abstract concept derived from the equations and variables. Thus, fluid simulations can be performed under a field-based general framework. Moreover, in response to the urgent need for large-scale fluid simulations, parallelism is integrated into the framework. Due to the convenience of the field operations, parallelization of the framework can be realized on both the OpenMP and MPI levels. In other words, because of the newly defined ""fields"", a series of operations in fluid simulations can be simplified and unified. However, very few studies have noted this advantage, and therefore, this work attempts to fill the void. With the help of a field-based general framework, it is anticipated that the parallel codes of fluid simulations can be generated easily and quickly. As an application of the general framework, a parallel 3D simulator for matrix acidization called Masor is developed. The simulation results are regarded as physically reasonable by many studies, which verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the general framework. In addition, it is noteworthy that the parallel performance of Masor is decided by a solver."
https://openalex.org/W4210741820,"Background To identify magnetic resonance (MR) angiography derived predictors of progressive dilatation and surgery of the aortic root in Marfan syndrome. Material and methods We retrospectively included 111 patients (32.7±16.5 years, range: 7–75 years) with a total of 446 MR angiographies. Aortic diameter growth rates of the entire thoracic aorta and Z-scores were estimated from annual diameter measurements. Aortic root shape was subdivided into three different types: (T0) normal; (T1) localized dilatation; (T2) generalized aortic root dilatation. Aortic diameter, Z-score, age, and aortic root shape at baseline were tested as predictors of aortic root dilatation using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results The highest aortic growth rate was observed at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva. Higher aortic root diameters and Z-scores at baseline predicted an increased growth of the aortic root (p = 0.003 and p&lt;0.001). Young age (&lt;30 years) was a predictor for the increase of Z-scores when compared to patients ≥30 years (p = 0.019). 25/111 patients (22.5%) had a T0 aortic root shape, 59/111 patients (53.2%) had a T1 aortic root shape, and 27/111 patients (24.3%) had a T2 aortic root shape. Aortic root shape did not predict further aortic growth (p&gt;0.05). However, significantly more patients undergoing surgery had a generalized aortic dilatation (19/28, 76.9%) than a localized aortic root dilatation (9/28, 32.1%) (p = 0.001). Conclusion Larger baseline aortic root diameter and Z-score as well as young age predict solely progressive aortic root dilatation in Marfan patients. MR angiography derived type of aortic root shape does not predict aortic growth, but patients with generalized aortic root dilatation are referred more frequently for aortic surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4225755181,"Phytoplankton assemblages are essential for understanding the quality of primary production in marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the development of a methodology for monitoring marine phytoplankton assemblages using an in situ multi-wavelength excitation fluorometer (MEX). The MEX recorded the fluorescence excited with nine light-emitting diodes, temperature, and sensor depth. We prepared reference datasets comprising MEX fluorescence and plant pigment-based phytoplankton assemblages of nine chemotaxonomy groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, chlorophytes, haptophytes type 3, haptophytes type 4, prasinophytes, cyanophytes, and prochlorophytes). Conversions from the MEX fluorescence to the phytoplankton assemblages were conducted with two processes. First, target MEX fluorescence was decomposed using a linear inverse model for calculating coefficients. Second, pigment-based chemotaxonomy of the target MEX fluorescence was reconstructed using the coefficients and the chemotaxonomy assemblages of the reference data. Cross-validation analyses indicated good estimation of the proportion of diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, cyanophytes, and prochlorophytes with MEX, and when chlorophytes, haptophytes and prasinophytes were summarized as other eukaryotes, the positive correlation was seen between proportions estimated with MEX and pigments as same as other five chemotaxonomy groups. Repeated MEX observations were conducted in the Kuroshio, the Sea of Japan, the Oyashio, and the Okhotsk Sea. The water-column integrated biomass indicated that the diatoms were an important primary producer in the Oyashio and the Okhotsk Sea, while eukaryotes were important in the Sea of Japan and prochlorophytes were important in the Kuroshio. Our method with the MEX will be a powerful tool to understand and estimate the chemotaxonomy-level assemblages and biomass in the ocean."

Methods The gene expression profiles of GSE132305, GSE89749, and GSE45001 were obtained respectively from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The DEGs were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of cholangiocarcinoma and normal tissues. GO, KEGG analysis and PPI network analyses were performed. LibDock, ADME and toxicity prediction, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify potential inhibitors of MYC. Moreover, in vitro, MTT assay, colony-forming assay, the scratch assay and Western blotting were performed to verify the therapeutic effect of Dhea and 2–14,15-Eg. Results PPI network analysis showed that ALB, MYC, APOB, IGF1 and KNG1 were hub genes, of which MYC was mainly studied in this study. A battery of computer-aided virtual techniques showed that Dhea and 2–14,15-Eg have lower rodent carcinogenicity, Ames mutagenicity, developmental toxicity potential, and high tolerance to cytochrome P4502D6, as well as could exist stably in natural circumstances. In vitro assays showed that Dhea and 2–14,15-Eg inhibited cholangiocarcinoma cellular viability, proliferation, and migration inhibiting expression of MYC. Conclusion This study suggested that Dhea and 2–14,15-Eg were novel potential inhibitors of MYC targeting, as well as are a promising drug in dealing with cholangiocarcinoma and have a perspective application."

In VQA, it is important to understand the alignment between visual concepts and linguistic semantics. In this paper, we proposed a Pre-training Model Based on Parallel Cross-Modality Fusion Layer (P-PCFL) to learn the fine-grained relationship between vision and language. The P-PCFL model is composed of three Encoders: Object Encoder, Language Encoder, and Parallel Cross-Modality Fusion Encoder, with Transformer as the core. We use four different Pre-training missions, namely, Cross-Modality Mask Language Modeling, Cross-Modality Mask Region Modeling, Image-Text Matching, and Image-Text Q&amp;A, to pre-train the P-PCFL model and improve its reasoning and universality, which help to learn the relationship between Intra-modality and Inter-modality. Experimental results on the platform of Visual Question Answering dataset VQA v2.0 show that the Pre-trained P-PCFL model has a good effect after fine-tuning the parameters. In addition, we also conduct ablation experiments and provide some results of Attention visualization to verify the effectiveness of P-PCFL model."

The objectives were to examine whether a trial comparing humidified O2 to standard O2 in children is feasible, and specifically to obtain data on recruitment, tolerability and outcome measure stability.Heated humidified, cold humidified and standard O2 treatments were compared for children (2-16 years) with acute severe asthma in a multi-centre, open, parallel, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Multiple outcomes were assessed.Of 258 children screened, 66 were randomised (heated humidified O2 n = 25; cold humidified O2 n = 21; standard O2 n = 20). Median (IQR) length of stay (hours) in hospital was 37.9 (29.1), 52 (35.4) and 49.1 (29.7) for standard, heated humidified and cold humidified respectively and time (hours) on O2 was 15.9 (9.4), 13.6 (14.9) and 13.1 (14.9) for the three groups respectively. The mean (standard deviation) time (hours) taken to step down nebulised to inhaled treatment was 5.6 (14.3), 35.1 (28.2) and 32.7 (20.1). Asthma Severity Score decreased in all three groups similarly, although missing data prevented complete analysis. Humidified O2 was least well tolerated with eight participants discontinuing their randomised treatment early. An important barrier to recruitment was research nurse availability.Although, the results of this pilot study should not be extrapolated beyond the study sample and inferential conclusions should not be drawn from the results, this is the first RCT to compare humidified and standard O2 therapy in acute severe asthmatics of any age. These findings and accompanying screening data show that a large RCT of O2 therapy is feasible. However, challenges associated with randomisation and data collection should be addressed in any future trial design."
https://openalex.org/W4210421021,"Background Little is known about youth-led approaches to addressing HIV-related outcomes among adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV. In response, Project YES! hired and trained youth living with HIV as peer mentors (YPMs) in four HIV clinics in Ndola, Zambia to hold meetings with 276 15-24-year-olds living with HIV. Within this randomized controlled trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted to explore YPMs’ implementing experiences. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with the eight YPMs (50% female) ages 21–26 years. YPMs were asked about their experiences working with clients, their feedback on program components, and what the experience meant to them personally and professionally. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was performed. Results YPMs connected with AYA clients by discussing shared struggles, modeling positive health behaviors, and establishing judgement-free environments. YPMs experienced powerful personal transformations in HIV-related health behaviors, conceptions of self, and plans for the future. Many expressed now seeing themselves as community leaders–“ambassadors”, “game changers”–and “not just alone in this world.” They described newfound commitments to reaching personal and professional goals. YPMs were adamant that Project YES! should expand so other HIV-positive AYA might benefit. Conclusion Well-trained and compensated YPMs who are integrated into HIV clinics can support AYA in unique and important ways due to their shared experiences. The transformational experience of becoming YPMs empowers youth to see themselves as role models and leaders. Future programs should engage youth living with HIV as partners in efforts to end the HIV epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210529384,"Hypothermia is a common adverse event during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), affecting multiple organ systems and increasing risk of poor health outcomes among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing CRRT. TheraMax blood warmers are the next generation of extracorporeal blood warmers which reduce risk of hypothermia during CRRT. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the potential health economic impacts of avoiding CRRT-induced hypothermia by using the novel TherMax blood warming device. This study compares health care costs associated with use of the new TherMax blood warmer unit integrated with the PrisMax system compared to CRRT with a standalone blood warming device to avoid hypothermia in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). An economic model was developed in which relevant health states for each intervention were normothermia, hypothermia, discharge, and death. Clinical inputs and costs were obtained from a combination of retrospective chart review and publicly available summary estimates. The proportion of AKI patients treated with CRRT who became hypothermic (&lt;36°C) during CRRT treatment was 34.5% in the TherMax group compared to 71.9% in the ‘standalone warmer’ group. Given the 78.7-year average life expectancy in the US and the assumed average patient age at discharge/death of 65.4 years, the total life-years gained by avoiding mortality related to hypothermia was 9.0 in the TherMax group compared to 8.0 in the ‘standalone warmer’ group. Cost per life-year gained was $8,615 in the TherMax group versus $10,115 in the ‘standalone warmer’ group for a difference of -$1,501 favoring TherMax. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was negative, indicating superior cost-effectiveness for TherMax versus ‘standalone warmer’. The TherMax blood warming device used with the PrisMax system is associated with lower risk of hypothermia, which our model indicates leads to lower costs, lower risk of mortality due to hypothermia, and superior cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4210536443,"Background In-hospital care of chronic patients is based on their characteristics and risk levels. Adjusted morbidity groups (AMG) is a population stratification tool which is currently being used in Primary Care but not in Hospitals. The objectives of this study were to describe the use of hospital services by chronic patients according to their risk levels assigned by AMG and to analyze influencing variables. Material and methods In this cross-sectional study, patients aged ≥18 years from a healthcare service area classified as chronically ill by the AMG classification system who used their referral hospital services from June 2015 to June 2016 were included. Predisposing and needs factors were collected. Univariate, bivariate and multiple linear regressions were performed. Results Of the 9,443 chronic patients identified (52.1% of the population in the selected area), 4,143 (43.9%) used hospital care services. Their mean age was 62.1 years (standard deviation (SD) = 18.4); 61.8% were female; 9% were high risk; 30% were medium risk, and 61% were low risk. The mean number of hospital service contacts was 5.0 (SD = 6.2), with 3.8 (SD = 4.3) visits to outpatient clinic, 0.7 (SD = 1.2) visits to emergency departments, 0.3 (SD = 2.8) visits to day hospital, and 0.2 (SD = 0.5) hospitalizations. The factors associated with greater service use were predisposing factors such as age (coefficient B (CB) = 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01–0.05) and Spanish origin (CB = 3.9; 95% CI = 3.2–4.6). Among the needs factors were palliative care (CB = 4.8; 95% CI = 2.8–6.7), primary caregiver status (CB = 2.3; 95% CI = 0.7–3.9), a high risk level (CB = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.1–3.6), multimorbidity (CB = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.4–1.3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (CB = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.8–2.3), depression (CB = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.3–1.3), active cancer (CB = 4.4, 95% CI = 3.7–5.1), and polymedication (CB = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.5–1.7). Conclusions The use of hospital services by chronic patients was high and increased with the risk level assigned by the AMG. The most frequent type of contact was outpatient consultation. Use was increased with predisposing factors such as age and geographic origin and by needs factors such as multimorbidity, risk level and severe diseases requiring follow-up, home care, and palliative care."
https://openalex.org/W4210544788,"This research presents a framework to enable computer-automated observation and monitoring of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in a zoo environment. The resulting approach enables detailed persistent monitoring of the animals that is not possible using manual annotation methods. Fixed overhead cameras were used to opportunistically collect ∼100 hours of observations, recorded over multiple days, including time both during and outside of formal training sessions, to demonstrate the viability of the framework. Animal locations were estimated using convolutional neural network (CNN) object detectors and Kalman filter post-processing. The resulting animal tracks were used to quantify habitat use and animal kinematics. Additionally, Kolmogorov-Smirnov analyses of the swimming kinematics were used in high-level behavioral mode classification. The object detectors achieved a minimum Average Precision of 0.76, and the post-processed results yielded 1.24 × 107 estimated dolphin locations. Animal kinematic diversity was found to be lowest in the morning and peaked immediately before noon. Regions of the zoo habitat displaying the highest activity levels correlated to locations associated with animal care specialists, conspecifics, or enrichment. The work presented here demonstrates that CNN object detection is viable for large-scale marine mammal tracking, and results from the proposed framework will enable future research that will offer new insights into dolphin behavior, biomechanics, and how environmental context affects movement and activity."
https://openalex.org/W4210548327,"The Dilleniaceae is known to produce nectarless flowers pollinated by bees, but the fact that bats ingest Dillenia biflora pollen led us to question pollination assumptions for these trees. We aimed to identify the pollinators of D . biflora , check for nectar presence, and investigate potential for cleistogamy and global prevalence of this pollination system. We examined aspects of the pollination of D . biflora on two Fijian islands using video recordings, direct observations, hand pollination, measurements (flowers, bite marks, nectar), and monitoring. The flowers, receptive for one night, contained copious nectar and had permanently closed globose corollas that required removal by bats for pollination. All the 101 flowers that retained their corolla died and did not produce seeds by cleistogamy. The bat Notopteris macdonaldi was well adapted to corolla removal. Keeping corollas closed until bats manipulate the nectar-rich flowers is a beneficial strategy in high-rainfall environments with many flower parasites. We propose to name a pollination system reliant exclusively on bats “chiropteropisteusis.” From clues in the literature, other species in the geographical range of Dillenia are probably chiropteropisunous. Chiropteropisteusis should be investigated in the Old-World range of Dillenia , many species of which are threatened. The remarkable “fall” of the entire corolla observed by an earlier botanist for several species in the genus is most likely attributable to bats. This discovery has important implications for the conservation of bat-dependent trees and their associated fauna, particularly considering the high level of threat faced by flying-foxes globally."

https://openalex.org/W4226425740,"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a serious public health problem. In previous work, two models of an intensive care unit (ICU) showed that differing population structures had markedly different rates of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission. One explanation for this difference is the models having differing long-term equilbrium dynamics, resulting from different basic reproductive numbers, R0. We find in this system however that this is not the case, and that both models had the same value for R0. Instead, short-term, transient dynamics, characterizing a series of small, self-limiting outbreaks caused by pathogen reintroduction were responsible for the differences. These results show the importance of these short-term factors for disease systems where reintroduction events are frequent, even if they are below the epidemic threshold. Further, we examine how subtle changes in how a hospital is organized-or how a model assumes a hospital is organized-in terms of the admission of new patients may impact transmission rates. This has implications for both novel pathogens introduced into ICUs, such as Ebola, MERS or COVID-19, as well as existing healthcare-associated infections such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae."
