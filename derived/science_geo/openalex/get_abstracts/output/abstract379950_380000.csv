https://openalex.org/W2044545697,"Background Current clinical therapy of non-small cell lung cancer depends on histo-pathological classification. This approach poorly predicts clinical outcome for individual patients. Gene expression profiling holds promise to improve clinical stratification, thus paving the way for individualized therapy. Methodology and Principal Findings A genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed on a cohort of 91 patients. We used 91 tumor- and 65 adjacent normal lung tissue samples. We defined sets of predictor genes (probe sets) with the expression profiles. The power of predictor genes was evaluated using an independent cohort of 96 non-small cell lung cancer- and 6 normal lung samples. We identified a tumor signature of 5 genes that aggregates the 156 tumor and normal samples into the expected groups. We also identified a histology signature of 75 genes, which classifies the samples in the major histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Correlation analysis identified 17 genes which showed the best association with post-surgery survival time. This signature was used for stratification of all patients in two risk groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that the two groups display a significant difference in post-surgery survival time (p = 5.6E-6). The performance of the signatures was validated using a patient cohort of similar size (Duke University, n = 96). Compared to previously published prognostic signatures for NSCLC, the 17 gene signature performed well on these two cohorts. Conclusions The gene signatures identified are promising tools for histo-pathological classification of non-small cell lung cancer, and may improve the prediction of clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2031202094,"In this study, we aim to determine cellular mechanisms linking nutrient metabolism to the regulation of inflammation and insulin resistance. The nutrient sensors AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SIRT1 show striking similarities in nutrient sensing and regulation of metabolic pathways. We find that the expression, activity, and signaling of the major isoform α1AMPK in adipose tissue and macrophages are substantially down-regulated by inflammatory stimuli and in nutrient-rich conditions, such as exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), free fatty acids (FFAs), and diet-induced obesity. Activating AMPK signaling in macrophages by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β4-ribofuranoside or constitutively active α1AMPK (CA-α1) significantly inhibits; although inhibiting α1AMPK by short hairpin RNA knock-down or dominant-negative α1AMPK (DN-α1) increases LPS- and FFA-induced tumor necrosis factor α expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays show that activation of AMPK by CA-α1 in macrophages significantly inhibits LPS- or FFA-induced NF-κB signaling. More importantly, in a macrophage-adipocyte co-culture system, we find that inactivation of macrophage AMPK signaling inhibits adipocyte insulin signaling and glucose uptake. Activation of AMPK by CA-α1 increases the SIRT1 activator NAD+ content and SIRT1 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, α1AMPK activation mimics the effect of SIRT1 on deacetylating NF-κB, and the full capacity of AMPK to deacetylate NF-κB and inhibit its signaling requires SIRT1. In conclusion, AMPK negatively regulates lipid-induced inflammation, which acts through SIRT1, thereby contributing to the protection against obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Our study defines a novel role for AMPK in bridging the signaling between nutrient metabolism and inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2041447340,"In July 2009, French public health authorities embarked in a mass vaccination campaign against A/H1N1 2009 pandemic-influenza. We explored the attitudes and behaviors of the general population toward pandemic vaccination.We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 2,253 French representative adults aged 18 to 64 from November 17 to 25, 2009 (completion rate: 93.8%). The main outcome was the acceptability of A/H1N1 vaccination as defined by previous receipt or intention to get vaccinated (""Yes, certainly"", ""Yes, probably""). Overall 17.0% (CI 95%, 15.5% to 18.7%) of respondents accepted A/H1N1 vaccination. Independent factors associated with acceptability included: male sex (p = .0001); older age (p = .002); highest or lowest level of education (p = .016); non-clerical occupation (p = .011); having only one child (p = .008); and having received seasonal flu vaccination in prior 3 years (p<.0001). Acceptability was also significantly higher among pregnant women (37.9%) and other at risk groups with chronic diseases (34.8%) (p = .002). Only 35.5% of respondents perceived A/H1N1 influenza illness as a severe disease and 12.7% had experienced A/H1N1 cases in their close relationships with higher acceptability (p<.0001 and p = .006, respectively). In comparison to 26.0% respondents who did not consult their primary care physician, acceptability was significantly higher among 8.0% respondents who were formally advised to get vaccinated, and lower among 63.7% respondents who were not advised to get vaccinated (respectively: 15.8%, 59.5% and 11.7%- p<.0001). Among respondents who refused vaccination, 71.2% expressed concerns about vaccine safety.Our survey occurred one week before the peak of the pandemic in France. We found that alarming public health messages aiming at increasing the perception of risk severity were counteracted by daily personal experience which did not confirm the threat, while vaccine safety was a major issue. This dissonance may have been amplified by having not involved primary care physicians in the mass vaccination campaign."
https://openalex.org/W2015717700,"Background The present study sought to further investigate the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of a representative omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with a focus on assessing the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis as an important mechanism for its anticancer actions. Methodology/Principal Findings In vitro studies showed that DHA strongly reduces the viability and DNA synthesis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in culture, and also promotes cell death via apoptosis. Mechanistically, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of caspase 8 contribute critically to the induction of apoptotic cell death. Co-presence of antioxidants or selective inhibition or knockdown of caspase 8 each effectively abrogates the cytotoxic effect of DHA. Using athymic nude mice as an in vivo model, we found that feeding animals the 5% fish oil-supplemented diet for 6 weeks significantly reduces the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vivo through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation as well as promotion of cell death. Using 3-nitrotyrosine as a parameter, we confirmed that the fish oil-supplemented diet significantly increases oxidative stress in tumor cells in vivo. Analysis of fatty acid content in plasma and tissues showed that feeding animals a 5% fish oil diet increases the levels of DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid in both normal and tumorous mammary tissues by 329% and 300%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance DHA can strongly induce apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The induction of apoptosis in these cells is selectively mediated via caspase 8 activation. These observations call for further studies to assess the effectiveness of fish oil as a dietary supplement in the prevention and treatment of human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2070723051,"Background High-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a direct and non-invasive measure of cortical excitability and connectivity in humans and may be employed to track over time pathological alterations, plastic changes and therapy-induced modifications in cortical circuits. However, the diagnostic/monitoring applications of this technique would be limited to the extent that TMS-evoked potentials are either stereotypical (non-sensitive) or random (non-repeatable) responses. Here, we used controlled changes in the stimulation parameters (site, intensity, and angle of stimulation) and repeated longitudinal measurements (same day and one week apart) to evaluate the sensitivity and repeatability of TMS/hd-EEG potentials. Methodology/Principal Findings In 10 volunteers, we performed 92 single-subject comparisons to evaluate the similarities/differences between pairs of TMS-evoked potentials recorded in the same/different stimulation conditions. For each pairwise comparison, we used non-parametric statistics to calculate a Divergence Index (DI), i.e., the percentage of samples that differed significantly, considering all scalp locations and the entire post-stimulus period. A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that it was possible to find an optimal DI threshold of 1.67%, yielding 96.7% overall accuracy of TMS/hd-EEG in detecting whether a change in the perturbation parameters occurred or not. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that the EEG responses to TMS essentially reflect deterministic properties of the stimulated neuronal circuits as opposed to stereotypical responses or uncontrolled variability. To the extent that TMS-evoked potentials are sensitive to changes and repeatable over time, they may be employed to detect longitudinal changes in the state of cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1972614762,"Background EEG studies of working memory (WM) have demonstrated load dependent frequency band modulations. FMRI studies have localized load modulated activity to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Recently, an EEG-fMRI study found that low frequency band (theta and alpha) activity negatively correlated with the BOLD signal during the retention phase of a WM task. However, the coupling of higher (beta and gamma) frequencies with the BOLD signal during WM is unknown. Methodology In 16 healthy adult subjects, we first investigated EEG-BOLD signal correlations for theta (5–7 Hz), alpha1 (8–10), alpha2 (10–12 Hz), beta1 (13–20), beta2 (20–30 Hz), and gamma (30–40 Hz) during the retention period of a WM task with set size 2 and 5. Secondly, we investigated whether load sensitive brain regions are characterised by effects that relate frequency bands to BOLD signals effects. Principal Findings We found negative theta-BOLD signal correlations in the MPFC, PPC, and cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). For alpha1 positive correlations with the BOLD signal were found in ACC, MPFC, and PCC; negative correlations were observed in DLPFC, PPC, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Negative alpha2-BOLD signal correlations were observed in parieto-occipital regions. Beta1-BOLD signal correlations were positive in ACC and negative in precentral and superior temporal gyrus. Beta2 and gamma showed only positive correlations with BOLD, e.g., in DLPFC, MPFC (gamma) and IFG (beta2/gamma). The load analysis revealed that theta and—with one exception—beta and gamma demonstrated exclusively positive load effects, while alpha1 showed only negative effects. Conclusions We conclude that the directions of EEG-BOLD signal correlations vary across brain regions and EEG frequency bands. In addition, some brain regions show both load sensitive BOLD and frequency band effects. Our data indicate that lower as well as higher frequency brain oscillations are linked to neurovascular processes during WM."
https://openalex.org/W2077965927,"While it is accepted that a majority of invasive breast cancer progresses from a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) precursor stage, very little is known about the factors that promote survival of DCIS neoplastic cells within the hypoxic, nutrient deprived intraductal microenvironment.We examined the hypothesis that fresh human DCIS lesions contain pre-existing carcinoma precursor cells. We characterized these cells by full genome molecular cytogenetics (Illumina HumanCytoSNP profile), and signal pathway profiling (Reverse Phase Protein Microarray, 59 endpoints), and demonstrated that autophagy is required for survival and anchorage independent growth of the cytogenetically abnormal tumorigenic DCIS cells. Ex vivo organoid culture of fresh human DCIS lesions, without enzymatic treatment or sorting, induced the emergence of neoplastic epithelial cells exhibiting the following characteristics: a) spontaneous generation of hundreds of spheroids and duct-like 3-D structures in culture within 2-4 weeks; b) tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice; c) cytogenetically abnormal (copy number loss or gain in chromosomes including 1, 5, 6, 8, 13, 17) compared to the normal karyotype of the non-neoplastic cells in the source patient's breast tissue; d) in vitro migration and invasion of autologous breast stroma; and e) up-regulation of signal pathways linked to, and components of, cellular autophagy. Multiple autophagy markers were present in the patient's original DCIS lesion and the mouse xenograft. We tested whether autophagy was necessary for survival of cytogenetically abnormal DCIS cells. The lysosomotropic inhibitor (chloroquine phosphate) of autophagy completely suppressed the generation of DCIS spheroids/3-D structures, suppressed ex vivo invasion of autologous stroma, induced apoptosis, suppressed autophagy associated proteins including Atg5, AKT/PI3 Kinase and mTOR, eliminated cytogenetically abnormal spheroid forming cells from the organ culture, and abrogated xenograft tumor formation.Cytogenetically abnormal spheroid forming, tumorigenic, and invasive neoplastic epithelial cells pre-exist in human DCIS and require cellular autophagy for survival."
https://openalex.org/W1971756175,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and pancreatic β-cell loss. Here, we demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, combined with interferon-γ, induces the expression of the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only activator PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) in β-cells. Transcriptional activation of PUMA is regulated by nuclear factor-κB and endoplasmic reticulum stress but is independent of p53. PUMA activation leads to mitochondrial Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 cleavage resulting in β-cell demise. The antiapoptotic Bcl-XL protein is localized mainly at the mitochondria of the β-cells and antagonizes PUMA action, but Bcl-XL is inactivated by the BH3-only sensitizer DP5/Hrk in cytokine-exposed β-cells. Moreover, a pharmacological mimic of the BH3-only sensitizer Bad, which inhibits Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, induces PUMA-dependent β-cell death and potentiates cytokine-induced apoptosis. Our data support a hierarchical activation of BH3-only proteins controlling the intrinsic pathway of β-cell apoptosis in the context of inflammation and type 1 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2071783872,"Background The V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120 was identified as the “principal neutralizing domain” of HIV-1, but has been considered too variable to serve as a neutralizing antibody (Ab) target. Structural and immunochemical data suggest, however, that V3 contains conserved elements which explain its role in binding to virus co-receptors despite its sequence variability. Despite this evidence of V3 conservation, the ability of anti-V3 Abs to neutralize a significant proportion of HIV-1 isolates from different subtypes (clades) has remained controversial. Methods HIV-1 neutralization experiments were conducted in two independent laboratories to test human anti-V3 monoclonal Abs (mAbs) against pseudoviruses (psVs) expressing Envs of diverse HIV-1 subtypes from subjects with acute and chronic infections. Neutralization was defined by 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50), and was statistically assessed based on the area under the neutralization titration curves (AUC). Results Using AUC analyses, statistically significant neutralization was observed by ≥1 anti-V3 mAbs against 56/98 (57%) psVs expressing Envs of diverse subtypes, including subtypes A, AG, B, C and D. Even when the 10 Tier 1 psVs tested were excluded from the analysis, significant neutralization was detected by ≥1 anti-V3 mAbs against 46/88 (52%) psVs from diverse HIV-1 subtypes. Furthermore, 9/24 (37.5%) Tier 2 viruses from the clade B and C standard reference panels were neutralized by ≥1 anti-V3 mAbs. Each anti-V3 mAb tested was able to neutralize 28–42% of the psVs tested. By IC50 criteria, 40/98 (41%) psVs were neutralized by ≥1 anti-V3 mAbs. Conclusions Using standard and new statistical methods of data analysis, 6/7 anti-V3 human mAbs displayed cross-clade neutralizing activity and revealed that a significant proportion of viruses can be neutralized by anti-V3 Abs. The new statistical method for analysis of neutralization data provides many advantages to previously used analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2003395398,"During the development of the sympathetic nervous system, the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) has a dual function: promoting survival together with TrkA in response to NGF, but inducing cell death upon binding pro or mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Apoptotic signaling through p75NTR requires activation of the stress kinase, JNK. However, the receptor also undergoes regulated proteolysis, first by a metalloprotease, and then by gamma-secretase, in response to pro-apoptotic ligands and this is necessary for receptor mediated neuronal death (Kenchappa, R. S., Zampieri, N., Chao, M. V., Barker, P. A., Teng, H. K., Hempstead, B. L., and Carter, B. D. (2006) Neuron 50, 219-232). Hence, the relationship between JNK activation and receptor proteolysis remains to be defined. Here, we report that JNK3 activation is necessary for p75NTR cleavage; however, following release of the intracellular domain, there is a secondary activation of JNK3 that is cleavage dependent. Receptor proteolysis and apoptosis were prevented in sympathetic neurons from jnk3(-/-) mice, while activation of JNK by ectopic expression of MEKK1 induced p75NTR cleavage and cell death. Proteolysis of the receptor was not detected until 6 h after BDNF treatment, suggesting that JNK3 promotes cleavage through a transcriptional mechanism. In support of this hypothesis, BDNF up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)/ADAM17 mRNA and protein in wild-type, but not jnk3(-/-) sympathetic neurons. Down-regulation of TACE by RNA interference blocked BDNF-induced p75NTR cleavage and apoptosis, indicating that this metalloprotease is responsible for the initial processing of the receptor. Together, these results demonstrate that p75NTR-mediated activation of JNK3 is required for up-regulation of TACE, which promotes receptor proteolysis, leading to prolonged activation of JNK3 and subsequent apoptosis in sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2029130415,"Background Plant invasions are causing habitat degradation in Galapagos. Problems are concentrated on the four inhabited islands. Plants introduced to rural areas in the humid highlands and urban areas on the arid coast act as foci for invasion of the surrounding Galapagos National Park. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present results of the most comprehensive inventory to date of alien vascular plants in the inhabited areas of Galapagos. The survey was conducted between 2002 and 2007, in 6031 properties (97% of the total) on Floreana, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz Islands. In total 754 alien vascular plant taxa were recorded, representing 468 genera in 123 families. Dicotyledons represented 554 taxa, monocotyledons 183, there were 7 gymnosperms and 10 pteridophytes. Almost half (363) of the taxa were herbaceous. The most represented families were Fabaceae (sensu lato), Asteraceae and Poaceae. The three most recorded species in the humid rural areas were Psidium guajava, Passiflora edulis and Bryophyllum pinnatum, and in the dry urban areas, Aloe vera, Portulaca oleracea and Carica papaya. In total, 264 (35%) taxa were recorded as naturalized. The most common use for taxa was ornamental (52%). Conclusions/Significance This extensive survey has increased the known alien vascular flora of Galapagos by 257 species, giving a ratio of alien to native taxa of 1.57∶1. It provides a crucial baseline for plant invasion management in the archipelago and contributes data for meta analyses of invasion processes worldwide. A repeat of the survey in the future would act as an effective early detection tool to help avoid further invasion of the Galapagos National Park."
https://openalex.org/W1977166248,"We here report the development of two peptide scaffolds designed for periodontal ligament fibroblasts. The scaffolds consist of one of the pure self-assembling peptide scaffolds RADA16 through direct coupling to short biologically active motifs. The motifs are 2-unit RGD binding sequence PRG (PRGDSGYRGDS) and laminin cell adhesion motif PDS (PDSGR). RGD and laminin have been previously shown to promote specific biological activities including periodontal ligament fibroblasts adhesion, proliferation and protein production. Compared to the pure RADA16 peptide scaffold, we here show that these designer peptide scaffolds significantly promote human periodontal ligament fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate into the scaffolds (for approximately 300 microm/two weeks). Moreover these peptide scaffolds significantly stimulated periodontal ligament fibroblasts to produce extracellular matrix proteins without using extra additional growth factors. Immunofluorescent images clearly demonstrated that the peptide scaffolds were almost completely covered with type I and type III collagens which were main protein components of periodontal ligament. Our results suggest that these designer self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffolds may be useful for promoting wound healing and especially periodontal ligament tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1972249602,"Insulin and other hormones control target cells through a network of signal-mediating molecules. Such networks are extremely complex due to multiple feedback loops in combination with redundancy, shared signal mediators, and cross-talk between signal pathways. We present a novel framework that integrates experimental work and mathematical modeling to quantitatively characterize the role and relation between co-existing submechanisms in complex signaling networks. The approach is independent of knowing or uniquely estimating model parameters because it only relies on (i) rejections and (ii) core predictions (uniquely identified properties in unidentifiable models). The power of our approach is demonstrated through numerous iterations between experiments, model-based data analyses, and theoretical predictions to characterize the relative role of co-existing feedbacks governing insulin signaling. We examined phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 and endocytosis of the receptor in response to various different experimental perturbations in primary human adipocytes. The analysis revealed that receptor endocytosis is necessary for two identified feedback mechanisms involving mass and information transfer, respectively. Experimental findings indicate that interfering with the feedback may substantially increase overall signaling strength, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Because the central observations are present in other signaling networks, our results may indicate a general mechanism in hormonal control.

Because the central observations are present in other signaling networks, our results may indicate a general mechanism in hormonal control. Hormonal control of target cells involves signal transduction from ligand-activated receptors to control of rate-limiting enzymes or proteins that affect key steps in metabolism or other processes within the cell. The signal transduction is carried out by a network of interacting signal mediators. A high degree of complexity is due to the presence of feedback and feed-forward loops, both negative and positive, and the fact that the importance of different interactions changes over time and according to intracellular location. This, in combination with redundancy, shared signal mediators, shared signal paths, and ample cross-talk between signals, leads to a complexity that poses new challenges to progress in dissecting and understanding cellular control. Many diseases, such as cancer and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, arise from malfunctioning in signaling networks. Insulin controls target cells through binding to its receptor at the cell surface (1Taniguchi C.M. Emanuelli B. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The receptor can then transduce the insulin signal into the cell and to its various effectuating systems, such as glucose uptake and antilipolysis. Foremost of the directly downstream signal-mediating proteins are members of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family, in particular IRS1, which is rapidly phosphorylated at specific tyrosine residues by the activated receptor. The IR and IRS1 are in adipocytes co-localized to caveolae invaginations of the plasma membrane (2Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H.

Commun. 2007; 363: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). IR is rapidly endocytosed in response to insulin stimulation of adipocytes, and it appears that the phosphorylated receptor is internalized into the endosomal compartment (6Fagerholm S. Ortegren U. Karlsson M. Ruishalme I. Strålfors P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

In accordance with the known properties of caveolae, very little IR is internalized in the absence of insulin stimulation (6Fagerholm S. Ortegren U. Karlsson M. Ruishalme I. Strålfors P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The function of internalization is not clear, and suggestions implying both positive and negative effects have been proposed: down-regulation of the insulin response by receptor degradation, clearance of insulin from the circulation by insulin digestion, and internalization as part of the insulin signal transduction. insulin receptor insulin receptor substrate-1 ordinary differential equation. Insulin signaling and the role of internalization illustrate a general limitation in our understanding of signaling systems; the central skeleton has often been established, but the quantitative importance of states and subprocesses remains undetermined. For instance, although a signaling intermediate (a specific state of a protein or a protein complex) has been established as mediating the signal transduction, it is typically not known how quickly it is formed and eliminated or how its absolute concentration varies over time. It is also typically not known how important a particular state or subprocess is for the overall signal transduction process. These limitations have remained because, except in special cases, we can neither measure nor perturb such detailed states and subprocesses individually but only indirectly through perturbations and measurements of lumped states. The processes are also so intertwined that conclusions about the details of the processes cannot be obtained by biochemical reasoning. Mathematical modeling emerges as a potent tool for data analysis and for dissection of such complex processes. However, the study of biological signaling systems poses new challenges also for mathematical modeling. The complexity of the underlying processes implies that the hypotheses the mathematical models seek to capture involve many parameters, whose values typically depend on cell type, experimental conditions, etc. For this reason, the individual parameter values usually remain underdetermined (i.e. guessed or non-uniquely estimated). This is an important problem because, if not accounted for, it implies that also the conclusions and predictions from the model will be non-unique and sometimes even arbitrarily unreliable. We here report a comprehensive integrated experimental/mathematical modeling study that presents a framework to circumvent the problem of undetermined parameter values. We used numerous iterations between experiments, model-based data analysis, and theoretical predictions to characterize the early phase of insulin signaling in primary human adipocytes. We show that an internalization-mediated feedback mechanism is a necessary component in producing an observed signal overshoot. These new mechanistic insights demonstrate that an integrated mathematical-experimental approach is a powerful analysis tool, which has the potential to overcome some of the hurdles to progress posed by the inherent complexity of signaling networks.

Membranes were incubated with antibodies and detected using ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG as secondary antibody, evaluated by chemiluminescence imaging (Las 1000, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), and normalized against the amount of actin in each sample. An intracellular membrane fraction of adipocytes, preincubated with or without 100 nm insulin for 10 min, was prepared by homogenization as described (10Ortegren U. Yin L. Ost A. Karlsson H. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3381-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove fat, nuclei, and cell debris. Plasma membrane and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation of the 1000 × g supernatant at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 75 min to pellet intracellular membranes. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 1 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Control and insulin-stimulated whole cell lysates and the intracellular membrane fractions were compared using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for the IR. Models are formulated using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the following notation, dx/dt=f(x,p)(Eq. 1) y=g(x,p)(Eq. 2) where x represents the states (here corresponding to concentrations or amounts of the specific protein modifications); p represents kinetic constants or scaling parameters; y contains the measurement signals; and f and g are smooth well behaved nonlinear functions. All models analyzed in this work are presented as interaction graphs in supplemental Fig. S1. These interaction graphs exactly describe the dynamic part of the ODE (the function f(x,p)), if the reaction rates are given, according to the standard summation of rates, which is briefly summarized in Ref. 12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and in the supplemental material. The reaction rates are described by mass action kinetics, possibly modified by multiplication with the concentration of the protein kinase. The output function, g(x,p), corresponds to normalizations and unknown scaling factors between the concentrations or amounts and the measured signals. These normalizations are described in the figure legends. (All models, simulations, and optimizations are fully described along with all used Matlab scripts in the supplemental material). All models are denoted M followed by an italic letter specifying the corresponding hypothesis (d, m, f, i, or if). A final letter (a, b, c, or d) specifies the specific model structure, which becomes a model if the model structure is associated with a set of parameter values. A key aspect of our approach is that it is not centered around specific parameter values that need to be known or estimated, but around data and model structures, which implicitly determine the entire set of acceptable parameters. The characterization of this set requires non-standard optimization algorithms, which do not return a single (ideally global) optimum but return sets of parameters giving a cost lower than a certain threshold. We are then looking for model properties that are shared among all of these parameter values. The optimization algorithms should therefore ideally return widely spread acceptable parameters. Because no such optimization algorithms are readily available, we modified a simulated annealing approach, which was implemented in the Systems Biology Toolbox for MATLAB, to fit our purposes. This annealing approach is normally combined with a nonlinear simplex, which is searching locally and downhill for low temperatures, but potentially also uphill for higher temperatures. Here the term “temperature” describes how much the search algorithm may proceed to parameters with higher cost function values. The temperature is lowered in discrete steps, and for each new temperature in the standard implementation, a single new simplex is initiated at the best parameter found so far. The key modification in our modified algorithm is to restart several new simplexes, which lie far away from each other according to a certain distance measure. This distance measure is basically the Euclidian distance, using a standard modification that takes the dimensionality of the optimization problem into account. Then all parameters evaluated during the optimization and with a cost below the given threshold are saved and analyzed using simulations and manual inspections. We are particularly interested in model properties that are shared among all acceptable parameter sets, which we denote core predictions. Previous analysis on test problems with analytically known cost functions showed that this new algorithm appears to be a robust and well functioning approach for the 5–25 dimensional problems that we encounter (11Pettersson T. Global Optimization Models for Estimation of Descriptive Models. Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden2008Google Scholar). 5G. Cedersund, manuscript in preparation. Note that this approach gives an improved spread of the parameters without modifying the cost function. More technical details concerning the optimization and the new algorithm are given in the supplemental material, and the implemented algorithm is provided along with the optimization scripts. The entire approach is outlined in Fig. 3 and is further described under “Results and Discussion.” The core prediction analysis is used to identify experiments that (if the core predictions are not fulfilled) should reject the model, but the actual rejection is done using classical optimization and hypothesis testing methods. Once a core prediction has been measured experimentally, the model giving the prediction is optimized to the expanded data set, and tested using a χ2 test (13Cedersund G. Roll J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 903-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our choices for the modeling were based on a number of assumptions. We used ODEs because we do not have data with a high spatial resolution, and the natural assumption is to consider the cells as well mixed. Further, we modeled the internalization of IR and IRS1 as independent processes and restricted the possibilities for insulin binding and dissociation to avoid combinatorial explosion. We assumed that the noise can be approximated by purely measurement noise, that it is normally distributed, and that the S.E. value can be approximated by repeats of the same experiment. To better understand the role of internalization and other mechanisms that govern the initial phase of insulin signaling, we (12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) examined the phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 in human primary adipocytes. We found a transient overshoot in the steady-state phosphorylation of both IR and IRS1; the phosphorylation reached a peak within 2 min of the addition of insulin, followed by a lower quasi-steady-state phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A–C). In Ref. 12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, we analyzed what conclusions can be drawn from this overshoot observation alone. That the overshoot appeared already in the phosphorylation of the IR implies that we should look for mechanisms that negatively affect the phosphorylation of IR directly but with a time delay. In Ref. 12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, we rejected a large number of model structures and identified two fundamentally different acceptable model structures, which could not be rejected or distinguished from those data. In this work, we further characterize the system using an iterative experimental/theoretical modeling approach. We start by introducing two new non-rejectable hypotheses, giving a total of four fundamentally different mechanisms that can generate the observed overshoot (Fig. 2): (i) insulin degradation (i.e. decreased phosphorylation because the concentration of insulin in the medium is being reduced (Md)); (ii) competitive inhibition and other interaction schemes at the plasma membrane alone (Mm); (iii) negative feedback signals from downstream intermediates (Mf); (iv) down-regulation through internalization and dephosphorylation of IR (Mi).FIGURE 2Outlines of the four main hypotheses for explanation of overshoot behavior. Shown are insulin degradation (Md), complicated interactions at the plasma membrane (Mm), feedbacks from downstream intermediates (Mf), and internalization of IR (Mi).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These hypotheses are negative feedbacks but of a fundamentally different character: some (e.g. iv) involve transfer of molecules, and some (e.g. iii) involve transfer of information. They include the assumption that non-stated mechanisms are not present in such a way that they might cause the overshoot. For instance, the degradation hypothesis might include internalization but not the crucial dephosphorylated internalized state that leads to an overshoot from the internalization itself (12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). We examine various detailed variations of these hypotheses, and details are added only as they are needed to explain additional experimental data sets (all models and Matlab scripts are available as downloadable simulation and optimization files; see “Materials and Methods”). The different versions of a hypothesis are implemented through different model structures and referred to as, for example, Mda or Mdb, which correspond to the first and second version of the degradation hypothesis, etc. (see “Materials and Methods”). In hypothesis Md, insulin is degraded so that the concentration of insulin is declining in the medium (e.g. by insulin binding to IR followed by lysosomal degradation or by insulin-degrading enzymes at the cell surface) (Fig. 2). This hypothesis can indeed produce an overshoot behavior (Fig. 1, B and C). We will now show why this hypothesis is rejected anyway and in the process introduce the two main steps of our analysis: (i) hypothesis testing based on experimental data and (ii) experimental testing of uniquely identified core predictions (Fig. 3). The first Md model we tested, Mda (supplemental Fig. S1), includes only insulin degradation through lysosomal degradation. Mda includes internalization, but it does not include the crucial state that has been dephosphorylated but not yet recycled to the plasma membrane. This model structure does not produce an overshoot due to the internalization itself (i.e. if insulin is a fixed parameter) (12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, when insulin is considered as a limited pool in an extracellular volume reasonably different from the intracellular volume, the model can produce an overshoot (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). This model structure is accepted, and we proceed to phase II, core prediction analysis. Despite different ways and widely different parameters for producing the overshoot with this model structure, all of them exhibit the peak of IR phosphorylation (but not of IRS1 phosphorylation) earlier than 0.1 min (supplemental Fig. S2A and Table 1). We refer to that type of uniquely identified properties as core predictions. This concept, which has been introduced by us (13Cedersund G. Roll J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 903-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), relieves us from the limitation of interpreting results for one particular set of parameter values. The problem with analysis at a single parameter point is that parameter values usually are more or less guessed or non-uniquely estimated from the experimental data; this leads to similarly guessed or non-uniquely estimated model predictions. In practice, we identify the uniquely identified core predictions by first approximating the entire space of acceptable parameters (i.e. all parameters that yield cost functions that are statistically indistinguishable from the best value). Importantly, our optimization method is designed to especially search for acceptable parameters that lie far away from each other in a Euclidian fashion without adding an extra modification to the cost function (see “Materials and Methods” and supplemental material). We then analyze the model behavior over this entire set of parameters, and model properties that are shared among all acceptable parameters are considered as core predictions (Fig. 3).TABLE 1Spread of parameters for model MdcParameter nameMaximum foundMinimum foundMaximum boundaryMinimum boundaryk1590.385e51e−5km17.3e41e−55e51e−5k26.2e56.2e25e51e−5k33.6e54.9e35e51e−5km3761e−55e51e−5k45.8e51e−55e51e−5k55e51.8e35e51e−5k670.215e51e−1km6112.215e41e−1kY15.3e3461e510kY24.4e3101e510kY35.9e3451e510kY43.5e3101e510Volfrac0.0130.0010.010.001k76.2e505e50 Open table in a new tab Mda thus has the core prediction that the time of the peak phosphorylation of IR occurs before 0.1 min. Experimentally, a lower boundary for the time of the peak value of IR phosphorylation was around 1 min (Fig. 1A). Hence, the core prediction of Mda is not fulfilled, and the model should probably be rejected. We also tested two other similar model structures, Mdb and Mdc (supplemental Fig. S1). These are more complex variations of Mda but differ only in that they have more internalized states and more reactions between the states. Nevertheless, also these model structures are unable to produce a peak value for IR phosphorylation later than 0.1 min and should thus probably also be rejected. To validate the predicted rejections, we undertook a more conventional two-step hypothesis testing approach. First, the models were optimized to the complete data set, here including both the overshoot data (Fig. 1, B and C) and the experimentally measured peak time (1.3 ± 0.2 min). Note that this involves a classical optimization, seeking only the best parameters, and that the cost function should be a χ2 measure without ad hoc punishments. Second, the resulting agreement with the data is evaluated using a χ2 test. For the most complex model, Mdc, this gave a test function value of 116, which should be compared with a threshold of 38.9 for a 95% χ2 distribution with 26 degrees of freedom (the number of data points). In other words, the core prediction successfully identified a crucial experiment (i.e. an experiment that implies a rejection of the model if the core prediction is not fulfilled); this serves as a validation of the core prediction analysis. We identified one model structure that does not have the problem of a too early peak time: Mdd (supplemental Fig. S1). This model structure includes insulin degradation both through lysosomal degradation and through direct degradation in the extracellular medium (corresponding to insulin-degrading processes at the plasma membrane). Mdd does not have the same spike-like rise in IR phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) and is able to produce a rise that is equally smooth as that produced by Mda to -c for phosphorylation of IRS1 only (Fig. 1C). We therefore looked for core predictions also for Mdd and found one that could be experimentally tested, the extracellular concentration of insulin. Mdd predicts that >95% of the insulin is degraded within the first few min (supplemental Fig. S2D). This prediction is shared among all acceptable parameter values and is thus a core prediction (i.e. a uniquely identified model property). Experimentally, the extent of degradation of insulin over 30 min was negligible (Fig. 1D). The core prediction is thus not fulfilled, and also Mdd should probably be rejected. We validated this core prediction-based rejection in the same way as above, by fitting the model to the complete data set (overshoot and amount of degradation) and evaluating the agreement using a χ2 test. The test function gave a value of 80, which should be compared with a χ2 threshold value of 38, implying a validated rejection. All of this evidence taken together led us to reject the Md hypothesis (see Table 2, which summarizes this and all similar conclusions).TABLE 2Summary of the data, models, and conclusionsExperimental dataModelsMdMmMfMiMfiOvershootOKOKOKOKOKInsulin in mediumFailOKOKOKOKStandard dataOKOKOKOKBlocking of internalizationFailFailOKOKExtent of internalizationFailOK Open table in a new tab To differentiate between the three remaining acceptable explanations for the overshoot data (Mm, Mf, and Mi) (Fig. 2), we searched to find experimentally testable core predictions that are different in these different hypotheses. However, the uncertainty of the predictions was too high (supplemental Fig. S2, N and O). Furthermore, many of the predicted behaviors lay outside the known behaviors of the system. For instance, the remaining models could at this point predict that 100 nm insulin treatment corresponds to less than 10% of maximal response (supplemental Fig. S2N), whereas we know that 100 nm treatment corresponds to saturation and maximal response. To avoid these problems with realism and nonspecific predictions, we collected more informative data: dose responses and multiple stimulations with insulin (Fig. 1, E and F). We refer to the resulting data (Fig. 1, B, C, E, and F) as the standard data. The three hypotheses Mm, Mf, and Mi are all able to describe these standard data (supplemental Figs. S2 (I–M) and S3 (D–G)), although some specific model structures could be rejected: Mma, Mia, and Mfa (supplemental Figs. S1, S2H, and S3C). Further, previously identified uncertain or unrealistic predictions are now much improved (compare supplemental Fig. S2O with supplemental Fig. S2P). We now return to identification of core predictions that can distinguish between the remaining hypotheses. Blocking of internalization is an experiment where the three hypotheses yield different predictions; Mf and Mm predict that the overshoot remains, but Mi predicts that it disappears (supplemental Fig. S3I). We blocked endocytosis of IR by lowering the temperature, which eliminates membrane vesicularization and fission (14Kuismanen E. Saraste J. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At 11 °C, the transient phosphorylation overshoot was gone (Fig. 4A). Lowering the temperature also reduced the response time because a lower temperature implies smaller rate constants. Interestingly, both the maximal and steady-state phosphorylation levels in response to insulin were increased (Fig. 4B). This shows that interfering with the mechanisms causing the overshoot may significantly increase the signaling strength. Because cooling is a rather nonspecific intervention, we also blocked internalization by reducing the amount of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, which eliminates caveolae invaginations in fat cells (15Thorn H. Stenkula K.G. Karlsson M. Ortegren U. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J. Strålfors P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3967-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and therefore IR internalization (6Fagerholm S. Ortegren U. Karlsson M. Ruishalme I. Strålfors P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Also, this inhibition of IR internalization removed the overshoot (Fig. 4C) with a significance of <0.05 (see “Materials and Methods”), which also implies a significant rejection of hypotheses Mm and Mf (Table 2). In a final iteration of the analysis experiment cycle (Fig. 3), we now show that the remaining hypothesis Mi has to be rejected as well. We have showed that the internalization model Mi has to include the state IRi, which is internalized and dephosphorylated but not yet recycled to the plasma membrane and available to be phosphorylated (12Cedersund G. Roll J. Ulfhielm E. Danielsson A. Tidefelt H. Strålfors P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A core prediction analysis showed that within a few min this state must account for 55–80% of the total amount of receptors (Fig. 4D). Hence, more than 55% of IR should be found in the internalized, cytosolic compartment after insulin stimulation. We experimentally determined the fraction of IR that was internalized after stimulation with insulin and found that only 2.3 ± 0.8% (mean ± S.E., n = 3 independent experiments, subjects) of the total amount of receptors was recovered in the intracellular compartment. This argues that model Mi should be rejected. We again validated this core prediction-based rejection using a classical hypothesis testing approach; we fitted the model to the complete data set (standard data plus the amount of internalization) and found a test function value of 221, which is way beyond the threshold 61, corresponding to the 95% χ2 value for 44 degrees of freedom. This rejection depends on our ability to search the space of acceptable parameters, and to further examine also this assumption leading to the rejection, we did some additional analytical analysis. We showed that decreasing a parameter at some point in a circular and mildly nonlinear model structure (such as Mma) eventually leads to overshoots in the preceding states (supplemental material, Corollary 1). This is also accompanied by an increase in the steady-state concentration of the following state (such as IRi in Mia-c). We give analytical expressions for these dependences (e.g. supplemental Equation 11). Hence, both an overshoot and an increased steady state are caused by the same changes. These results underscore our numerically derived insights and, together with our experimental data, lead to rejection of hypothesis Mi. All initially proposed hypotheses have now been rejected (Table 2). The rejection of Mi showed that it is not the internalization per se that generates the overshoot. We therefore examined a combination of Mf and Mi, Mif, where the feedback in Mf is dependent on internalization (Fig. 5A). This model can explain all available data for early insulin signaling (Fig. 5, B–G), it passes a χ2 test, and it is thus our final model for the system. Note that the model includes feedbacks from mass (internalization and recycling) and information transfer (through signaling via intermediary X) and that both of those feedbacks are required. The model requires that only a small fraction of IR is internalized at steady state but also that internalization is essential for the signaling. A core prediction analysis of the model reveals that internalized receptors are not significantly stronger signal generators than those at the plasma membrane (i.e. the catalyzing parameters for the two pools of autophosphorylated receptors are of the same order of magnitude). Instead, the requirement for the small, internalized pool is due to rapid internalization of the autophosphorylated IR, such that there is more phosphorylated IR in the internalized pool, compared with at the plasma membrane. This prediction is consistent with experimental results (6Fagerholm S. Ortegren U. Karlsson M. Ruishalme I. Strålfors P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Signal overshoot behavior is found in responses to other hormones and in other cell types (e.g. in response to isoprenaline in adipocytes (8Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor in epithelial cells (16Chen W.W. Schoeberl B. Jasper P.J. Niepel M. Nielsen U.B. Lauffenburger D.A. Sorger P.K. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 239Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and Hedgehog in Drosophila (17Nahmad M. Stathopoulos A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). Our findings may therefore indicate a general mechanism not restricted to insulin signaling. We want to stress some not yet mentioned general insights regarding the modeling framework we have developed. First, it results in an analysis including unique predictions and rejections rather than just a final mathematical model. Second, our approach to analysis, and hence our final model, is only concerned with mechanisms that are essential to the observed dynamics and is not attempting to generate a complete description of all processes that are involved. Our analysis goes beyond such descriptive usages of modeling. Third, our parameter-free conclusions are strong and final in that they will not be revised in the future; a rejected model may never describe a larger data set, and a uniquely identified property may not become non-unique from more data. This strength and finality do not exist with ordinary usage of models, including in some of the previous modeling works on insulin signaling (18Sedaghat A.R. Sherman A. Quon M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E1084-E1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Hori S.S. Kurland I.J. DiStefano 3rd, J.J. Ann. Biomed.

Biol. 2009; 5: 243Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fourth, note that all conclusions drawn in the paper are independent of the theoretical underpinnings of our core prediction analysis and modified optimization algorithm. Nevertheless, because all core prediction-based rejections were successfully validated, our work may in itself indicate the existence of such a theoretical underpinning. Fifth, we generally do not make claims regarding untested models, parameters, or combinations of mechanisms. For instance, we almost exclusively deal with mass action kinetics, and there might exist models with more complicated rate expressions that would give a different core prediction for the same interaction graph. There might also exist combinations of mechanisms other than our Mif hypothesis that also give acceptable behaviors with respect to the final data set. Nevertheless, any combination of mechanisms that does not include internalization of IR cannot explain the data because experimental blocking of the internalization showed that the overshoot then disappears. This thus allows us to refer to internalization as “necessary.” Note that this specific conclusion depends on the assumption that the two types of experimental blockings (cooling and removal of cholesterol) are specific, which is the typical limitation of purely experimental studies. Note also that our modeling approach can complement this weakness by adding stronger statements, of the character “not sufficient.” In summary, we have thus concluded that receptor internalization is necessary but not sufficient for control of insulin signaling and that the internalization mediates at least two fundamentally different types of feedbacks: via mass-transport and via information transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2016715472,"Background Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression and low survival rates. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed for this disease. Capsaicin, the active ingredient of chilli peppers, displays anti-proliferative activity in prostate and epidermoid cancer in vitro. However, the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin has not been studied in human SCLCs. The present manuscript fills this void of knowledge and explores the anti-proliferative effect of capsaicin in SCLC in vitro and in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings BrdU assays and PCNA ELISAs showed that capsaicin displays robust anti-proliferative activity in four human SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, capsaicin potently suppressed the growth of H69 human SCLC tumors in vivo as ascertained by CAM assays and nude mice models. The second part of our study attempted to provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. We found that the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin is correlated with a decrease in the expression of E2F-responsive proliferative genes like cyclin E, thymidylate synthase, cdc25A and cdc6, both at mRNA and protein levels. The transcription factor E2F4 mediated the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. Ablation of E2F4 levels by siRNA methodology suppressed capsaicin-induced G1 arrest. ChIP assays demonstrated that capsaicin caused the recruitment of E2F4 and p130 on E2F-responsive proliferative promoters, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of capsaicin could be useful in the therapy of human SCLCs."
https://openalex.org/W2049569756,"Stat3 is initially dephosphorylated in murine keratinocytes in response to UVB irradiation. Treatment with Na(3)VO(4) desensitized keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis with the recovery of phosphorylated Stat3 protein levels, implying that a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) is involved in this mechanism. In the current work, we report that three PTPs including TC45 (the nuclear form of TC-PTP), SHP1, and SHP2 are involved in this rapid dephosphorylation of Stat3 in keratinocytes induced by UVB irradiation. Dephosphorylation of Stat3 was increased rapidly after UVB irradiation of cultured keratinocytes. Knockdown of TC-PTP, SHP1, or SHP2 using RNAi showed that these PTPs are likely responsible for most of the rapid Stat3 dephosphorylation observed following UVB irradiation. The level of phosphorylated Stat3 was significantly higher in keratinocytes transfected with TC-PTP, SHP1, or SHP2 siRNA in the presence or absence of UVB compared with keratinocytes transfected with control siRNA. TC45 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus upon UVB irradiation. Stat3 dephosphorylation was associated with nuclear translocation of TC45. Further studies revealed that knockdown of all three phosphatases, using RNAi, prevented the rapid dephosphorylation of Stat3 following UVB irradiation. In mouse epidermis, the level of phosphorylated Stat3 was initially decreased, followed by a significant increase at later time points after UVB exposure. The levels of Stat3 target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc, followed the changes in activated Stat3 in response to UVB irradiation. Collectively, these results suggest that three phosphatases, TC45, SHP1, and SHP2, are primarily responsible for UVB-mediated Stat3 dephosphorylation and may serve as part of an initial protective mechanism against UV skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000025641,"Background The number of dental implant treatments increases annually. Dental implants are manufactured by competing companies. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis have shown a clear association between pharmaceutical industry funding of clinical trials and pro-industry results. So far, the impact of industry sponsorship on the outcomes and conclusions of dental implant clinical trials has never been explored. The aim of the present study was to examine financial sponsorship of dental implant trials, and to evaluate whether research funding sources may affect the annual failure rate. Methods and Findings A systematic approach was used to identify systematic reviews published between January 1993 and December 2008 that specifically deal with the length of survival of dental implants. Primary articles were extracted from these reviews. The failure rate of the dental implants included in the trials was calculated. Data on publication year, Impact Factor, prosthetic design, periodontal status reporting, number of dental implants included in the trials, methodological quality of the studies, presence of a statistical advisor, and financial sponsorship were extracted by two independent reviewers (kappa = 0.90; CI95% [0.77–1.00]). Univariate quasi-Poisson regression models and multivariate analysis were used to identify variables that were significantly associated with failure rates. Five systematic reviews were identified from which 41 analyzable trials were extracted. The mean annual failure rate estimate was 1.09%.(CI95% [0.84–1.42]). The funding source was not reported in 63% of the trials (26/41). Sixty-six percent of the trials were considered as having a risk of bias (27/41). Given study age, both industry associated (OR = 0.21; CI95% [0.12–0.38]) and unknown funding source trials (OR = 0.33; (CI95% [0.21–0.51]) had a lower annual failure rates compared with non-industry associated trials. A conflict of interest statement was disclosed in 2 trials. Conclusions When controlling for other factors, the probability of annual failure for industry associated trials is significantly lower compared with non-industry associated trials. This bias may have significant implications on tooth extraction decision making, research on tooth preservation, and governmental health care policies."
https://openalex.org/W2030170885,"The intestinal peptides GLP-1 and GIP potentiate glucose-mediated insulin release. Agents that increase GLP-1 action are effective therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, GIP action is blunted in T2DM, and GIP-based therapies have not been developed. Thus, it is important to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of GIP action. We developed mice lacking GIP-producing K cells. Like humans with T2DM, ""GIP/DT"" animals exhibited a normal insulin secretory response to exogenous GLP-1 but a blunted response to GIP. Pharmacologic doses of xenin-25, another peptide produced by K cells, restored the GIP-mediated insulin secretory response and reduced hyperglycemia in GIP/DT mice. Xenin-25 alone had no effect. Studies with islets, insulin-producing cell lines, and perfused pancreata indicated xenin-25 does not enhance GIP-mediated insulin release by acting directly on the beta-cell. The in vivo effects of xenin-25 to potentiate insulin release were inhibited by atropine sulfate and atropine methyl bromide but not by hexamethonium. Consistent with this, carbachol potentiated GIP-mediated insulin release from in situ perfused pancreata of GIP/DT mice. In vivo, xenin-25 did not activate c-fos expression in the hind brain or paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus indicating that central nervous system activation is not required. These data suggest that xenin-25 potentiates GIP-mediated insulin release by activating non-ganglionic cholinergic neurons that innervate the islets, presumably part of an enteric-neuronal-pancreatic pathway. Xenin-25, or molecules that increase acetylcholine receptor signaling in beta-cells, may represent a novel approach to overcome GIP resistance and therefore treat humans with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2038497586,"Background Antiangiogenic and anti-vascular therapies present intriguing alternatives to cancer therapy. However, despite promising preclinical results and significant delays in tumor progression, none have demonstrated long-term curative features to date. Here, we show that a single treatment session of Tookad-based vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) promotes permanent arrest of tumor blood supply by rapid occlusion of the tumor feeding arteries (FA) and draining veins (DV), leading to tumor necrosis and eradication within 24–48 h. Methodology/Principal Findings A mouse earlobe MADB106 tumor model was subjected to Tookad-VTP and monitored by three complementary, non-invasive online imaging techniques: Fluorescent intravital microscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering Imaging and photosensitized MRI. Tookad-VTP led to prompt tumor FA vasodilatation (a mean volume increase of 70%) with a transient increase (60%) in blood-flow rate. Rapid vasoconstriction, simultaneous blood clotting, vessel permeabilization and a sharp decline in the flow rates then followed, culminating in FA occlusion at 63.2 sec±1.5SEM. This blockage was deemed irreversible after 10 minutes of VTP treatment. A decrease in DV blood flow was demonstrated, with a slight lag from FA response, accompanied by frequent changes in flow direction before reaching a complete standstill. In contrast, neighboring, healthy tissue vessels of similar sizes remained intact and functional after Tookad-VTP. Conclusion/Significance Tookad-VTP selectively targets the tumor feeding and draining vessels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mono-therapeutic modality that primarily aims at the larger tumor vessels and leads to high cure rates, both in the preclinical and clinical arenas."
https://openalex.org/W2015549226,"Auditory training programs are being developed to remediate various types of communication disorders. Biological changes have been shown to coincide with improved perception following auditory training so there is interest in determining if these changes represent biologic markers of auditory learning. Here we examine the role of stimulus exposure and listening tasks, in the absence of training, on the modulation of evoked brain activity. Twenty adults were divided into two groups and exposed to two similar sounding speech syllables during four electrophysiological recording sessions (24 hours, one week, and up to one year later). In between each session, members of one group were asked to identify each stimulus. Both groups showed enhanced neural activity from session-to-session, in the same P2 latency range previously identified as being responsive to auditory training. The enhancement effect was most pronounced over temporal-occipital scalp regions and largest for the group who participated in the identification task. The effects were rapid and long-lasting with enhanced synchronous activity persisting months after the last auditory experience. Physiological changes did not coincide with perceptual changes so results are interpreted to mean stimulus exposure, with and without being paired with an identification task, alters the way sound is processed in the brain. The cumulative effect likely involves auditory memory; however, in the absence of training, the observed physiological changes are insufficient to result in changes in learned behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1978671493,"The myelin sheath is a tightly packed multilayered membrane structure insulating selected axons in the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Myelin is a biochemically unique membrane, containing a specific set of proteins. In this study, we expressed and purified recombinant human myelin P2 protein and determined its crystal structure to a resolution of 1.85 A. A fatty acid molecule, modeled as palmitate based on the electron density, was bound inside the barrel-shaped protein. Solution studies using synchrotron radiation indicate that the crystal structure is similar to the structure of the protein in solution. Docking experiments using the high-resolution crystal structure identified cholesterol, one of the most abundant lipids in myelin, as a possible ligand for P2, a hypothesis that was proven by fluorescence spectroscopy. In addition, electrostatic potential surface calculations supported a structural role for P2 inside the myelin membrane. The potential membrane-binding properties of P2 and a peptide derived from its N terminus were studied. Our results provide an enhanced view into the structure and function of the P2 protein from human myelin, which is able to bind both monomeric lipids inside its cavity and membrane surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2126759884,"Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter proteins (SGLT) belong to the SLC5A family, characterized by the cotransport of Na+ with solute. SGLT1 is responsible for intestinal glucose absorption. Until recently the only role described for SGLT proteins was to transport sugar with Na+. However, human SGLT3 (hSGLT3) does not transport sugar but causes depolarization of the plasma membrane when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. For this reason SGLT3 was suggested to be a sugar sensor rather than a transporter. Despite 70% amino acid identity between hSGLT3 and hSGLT1, their sugar transport, apparent sugar affinities, and sugar specificity differ greatly. Residue 457 is important for the function of SGLT1 and mutation at this position in hSGLT1 causes glucose-galactose malabsorption. Moreover, the crystal structure of vibrio SGLT reveals that the residue corresponding to 457 interacts directly with the sugar molecule. We thus wondered if this residue could account for some of the functional differences between SGLT1 and SGLT3. Methodology/Principal Findings We mutated the glutamate at position 457 in hSGLT3 to glutamine, the amino acid present in all SGLT1 proteins, and characterized the mutant. Surprisingly, we found that E457Q-hSGLT3 transported sugar, had the same stoichiometry as SGLT1, and that the sugar specificity and apparent affinities for most sugars were similar to hSGLT1. We also show that SGLT3 functions as a sugar sensor in a living organism. We expressed hSGLT3 and E457Q-hSGLT3 in C. elegans sensory neurons and found that animals sensed glucose in an hSGLT3-dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance In summary, we demonstrate that hSGLT3 functions as a sugar sensor in vivo and that mutating a single amino acid converts this sugar sensor into a sugar transporter similar to SGLT1."
https://openalex.org/W1974420620,"Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer, arising in cutaneous melanocytes. The transcription factor PAX3 regulates melanocyte specification from neural crest cells during development but expression in differentiated melanocytes is uncertain. By contrast it is frequently found in melanomas and naevi and is a marker for melanoma staging and detection. In this study we analysed the expression of PAX3 across the spectrum of melanocytic cells, from normal melanocytes to cells of benign and malignant lesions to better assess its function in these various tissues. Pax3 and PAX3 (italicized) refer to the mouse and human gene, respectively; whereas Pax3 and PAX3 (non-italicized) refer to the corresponding mouse and human protein.PAX3 expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence was used for co-expression with differentiation, migration and survival markers. As expected PAX3 expression was observed in naevi and melanoma cells. It was also found in melanocytes of normal skin where it co-expressed with melanocyte markers, MITF and MLANA. Co-expression with its downstream target, antiapoptotic factor BCL2L1 confirms PAX3 as a cell survival regulator. PAX3 was also co-expressed with melanoma cell migration marker MCAM in dermal naevi and melanoma cell nests, but this downstream target of PAX3 was not present in normal epidermal melanocytes, suggesting differential roles for PAX3 in normal epidermal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Most interestingly, a proportion of PAX3-positive epidermal melanocytes in normal skin show HES1 and Ki67 co-expression, indicating their less differentiated proliferative phenotype.Our results suggest that a previously identified role for PAX3, that of regulator of an undifferentiated plastic state, may operate in melanocytes of normal skin. This role, possibly required for cellular response to environmental stimuli, may contribute to formation and development of melanocytic lesions in which PAX3 expression is prominent."

Although bacteria accomplish division with a single FtsZ, plant chloroplasts require two FtsZ types for division, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. These proteins colocalize to a mid-plastid Z ring, but their biochemical relationship is poorly understood. We investigated the in vitro behavior of recombinant FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 separately and together. Both proteins bind and hydrolyze GTP, although GTPase activities are low compared with the activity of Escherichia coli FtsZ. Each protein undergoes GTP-dependent assembly into thin protofilaments in the presence of calcium as a stabilizing agent, similar to bacterial FtsZ. In contrast, when mixed without calcium, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 exhibit slightly elevated GTPase activity and coassembly into extensively bundled protofilaments. Coassembly is enhanced by FtsZ1, suggesting that it promotes lateral interactions between protofilaments. Experiments with GTPase-deficient mutants reveal that FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 form heteropolymers. Maximum coassembly occurs in reactions containing equimolar FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, but significant coassembly occurs at other stoichiometries. The FtsZ1:FtsZ2 ratio in coassembled structures mirrors their input ratio, suggesting plasticity in protofilament and/or bundle composition. This behavior contrasts with that of α- and β-tubulin and the bacterial tubulin-like proteins BtubA and BtubB, which coassemble in a strict 1:1 stoichiometry. Our findings raise the possibility that plasticity in FtsZ filament composition and heteropolymerization-induced bundling could have been a driving force for the coevolution of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage, perhaps arising from an enhanced capacity for the regulation of Z ring composition and activity in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2052000196,"Casein kinase 1 delta (CK1delta) plays a more prominent role in the regulation of circadian cycle length than its homologue casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1epsilon) in peripheral tissues such as liver and embryonic fibroblasts. Mice lacking CK1delta die shortly after birth, so it has not been possible to assess the impact of loss of CK1delta on behavioral rhythms controlled by the master circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN).In the present study, mPER2::LUCIFERASE bioluminescence rhythms were monitored from SCN explants collected from neonatal mice. The data demonstrate that SCN explants from neonatal CK1delta-deficient mice oscillate, but with a longer circadian period than littermate controls. The cycle length of rhythms recorded from neonatal SCN explants of CK1epsilon-deficient mice did not differ from control explants.The results indicate that CK1delta plays a more prominent role than CK1epsilon in the maintenance of 24-hour rhythms in the master circadian oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W2054981877,"We characterized the aro arsenite oxidation system in the novel strain Ralstonia sp. 22, a beta-proteobacterium isolated from soil samples of the Salsigne mine in southern France. The inducible aro system consists of a heterodimeric membrane-associated enzyme reacting with a dedicated soluble cytochrome c(554). Our biochemical results suggest that the weak association of the enzyme to the membrane probably arises from a still unknown interaction partner. Analysis of the phylogeny of the aro gene cluster revealed that it results from a lateral gene transfer from a species closely related to Achromobacter sp. SY8. This constitutes the first clear cut case of such a transfer in the Aro phylogeny. The biochemical study of the enzyme demonstrates that it can accommodate in vitro various cytochromes, two of which, c(552) and c(554,) are from the parent species. Cytochrome c(552) belongs to the sox and not the aro system. Kinetic studies furthermore established that sulfite and sulfide, substrates of the sox system, are both inhibitors of Aro activity. These results reinforce the idea that sulfur and arsenic metabolism are linked."
https://openalex.org/W2011345116,"Background IZUMO1 is the only sperm protein which is proven to be essential for sperm-egg fusion. However, the IZUMO1 is a structurally simple protein with single Ig domain and seems not to include either a “fusogenic peptide” or a fusion machinery domain. This led us to assume the existence of an IZUMO1-interacting protein(s) which makes a functional fusion machine interacting with IZUMO1. Methodology/Principal Findings We produced a transgenic mouse line which expresses His-tagged IZUMO1 in the Izumo1−/− genetic background. After solubilization of sperm membranes, we purified His-tagged IZUMO1 using anti-His affinity chromatography and found a protein that interacts with IZUMO1. After being separated on SDS-PAGE gel, the IZUMO1-interacting protein was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis and from the partial fragments, we identified the protein as ACE3. We raised the antibody against ACE3 and found that ACE3 is localized on the acrosomal cap area as in the case of IZUMO1. However, ACE3 disappeared from sperm after acrosome reaction while IZUMO1 remained on sperm. In order to investigate the role of ACE3 in vivo, we generated Ace3-deficient mice by homologous recombination and examined the fertilizing ability of the males. Unexpectedly, the male mice showed no defect in fertilizing ability in in vivo or in an in vitro fertilization system. Conclusions/Significance We identified an IZUMO1-interacting protein in sperm, which we identified as testis specific ACE homologue ACE3. We produced an Ace3 disrupted mouse line, and found the localization of IZUMO1 spread in a little wider area on sperm, but the elimination of ACE3 did not result in a loss of sperm fertilizing ability, differing from the case of ACE disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2033902598,"Background Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons receive two excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs: their most distal dendritic regions in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) are innervated by the perforant path (PP), originating from layer III of the entorhinal cortex, while their more proximal regions of the apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum (SR) are innervated by the Schaffer-collaterals (SC), originating from hippocampal CA3 neurons. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are naturally occurring mediators capable of modulating both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity via the CB1 receptor. Previous work on eCB modulation of excitatory synapses in the CA1 region largely focuses on the SC pathway. However, little information is available on whether and how eCBs modulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity at PP synapses. Methodology/Principal Findings By employing somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings, Ca2+ uncaging, and immunostaining, we demonstrate that there are significant differences in low-frequency stimulation (LFS)- or DHPG-, an agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), induced long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission between SC and PP synapses in the same pyramidal neurons. These differences are eliminated by pharmacological inhibition with selective CB1 receptor antagonists or genetic deletion of the CB1 receptor, indicating that these differences likely result from differential modulation via a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. We also revealed that depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a form of short-term synaptic plasticity, and photolysis of caged Ca2+-induced suppression of Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were less at the PP than that at the SC. In addition, application of WIN55212 (WIN) induced a more pronounced inhibition of EPSCs at the SC when compared to that at the PP. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that CB1 dependent LTD and DSE are differentially expressed at the PP versus SC synapses in the same neurons, which may have an impact on synaptic scaling, integration and plasticity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons."

Our studies show that MLK3 is activated in leukocyte-infiltrated islets of non-obese diabetic mice and that MLK3 activation compromises mitochondrial integrity and induces apoptosis of beta cells. Using an ex vivo model of islet-splenocyte co-culture, we show that MLK3 mediates its effects via the pseudokinase TRB3, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Tribbles. TRB3 expression strongly coincided with conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of BAX. Mechanistically, MLK3 directly interacted with and stabilized TRB3, resulting in inhibition of Akt, a strong suppressor of BAX translocation and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Accordingly, attenuation of MLK3 or TRB3 expression each prevented cytokine-induced BAX conformational change and attenuated the progression to apoptosis.

The striking parallels between the beta cell and neuronal phenotypes, coupled with the ability of cytokines to activate MLK3, prompted us to examine whether MLKs participate in cytokine-induced beta cell death. mitogen-activated protein kinase splenocyte-islet co-culture mixed lineage kinase non-obese diabetic glutathione S-transferase green fluorescence protein red fluorescence protein myristolylated analysis of variance c-Jun N-terminal kinase hemagglutinin terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling interleukin fetal bovine serum short hairpin RNA analysis of variance phospho-MLK3. Here we show that MLK3 is markedly elevated in leukocyte-infiltrated islets of the non-obese type 1 diabetic (NOD) mouse. To investigate the potential role of MLK3 in beta cell death, we devised an ex vivo system for co-culture of primary islets with immune-activated splenocytes. Compared with static culture with purified cytokines, this system is likely to be more representative of the milieu encountered by islets in autoimmune diabetes. We observed rapid activation of MLK3, and MLK3 was required for cytokine-mediated apoptosis via BAX, a proapoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family. MLK3 mediated its effects via the pseudokinase TRB3 (TRIBBLES homolog 3), originally identified as an inducible factor in neuronal cell death (12.Mayumi-Matsuda K. Kojima S. Suzuki H. Sakata T.

We found that MLK3-mediated stabilization of TRB3 led to a conformational change of BAX and the ensuing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (14.Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N.

Red blood cells were lysed in 0.15 m NH4Cl, and 1.5 × 106 splenocytes/well were plated in 24-well dishes in RPMI supplemented with 60 units/ml mouse IL-2 and 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Splenocytes were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and exogenous anti-CD28 antibodies (10 and 1 μg/ml, respectively; BD Biosciences) for 3 days as described previously (26.Bresson D. Togher L.

Islets were isolated 2 days later, rested overnight, and cultured with transwell filters in the presence of unstimulated or stimulated splenocytes, with or without 500 nm CEP11004 pretreatment and collected over a time course of 24 h. At each time point, islets were fixed, spun into pellets, and embedded in agarose plugs. Individual plugs from an entire time course were laid out on a grid and processed for paraffin embedding in a single block as described (27.Krajewska M. Zapata J.M. Meinhold-Heerlein I. Hedayat H.

For staining, slides were pretreated with targeted retrieval solution, high pH (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), as per the manufacturer's instructions or in 110 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and primary antibodies were revealed using a diaminobenzidine-based detection method employing either an avidin-biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or the Envision plus horseradish peroxidase system (DAKO). For immunofluorescence, Min6 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehye for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and primary antibodies were visualized with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent probes. Human adult islets were provided by the Islet Cell Resource Center Basic Science Human Islet Distribution Program and the Islet Transplant Program (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Islets were hand-picked and cultured overnight in CRML supplemented with 10% FBS. Prior to stimulation with cytokines, islets were cultured for at least 8 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Islets were isolated using a Ficoll gradient as described (29.Humphrey R.K. Yu S.M. Flores L.E. Jhala U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3406-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Dewaxed sections of the SICC array were pretreated with 10 μg/ml Proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C, whereas Min6 cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde prior to TUNEL labeling as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). For confocal microscopy, cells were incubated with JC-1 (2.5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C following the indicated treatments and examined immediately. For quantification, cells were processed using the Guava MitoPotential kit. Cell populations were gated based on JC-1 fluorescence and quantified using the Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). Using a modified method (30.Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), cells were harvested and allowed to swell for 30 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin). After 30 passes through a 25-gauge needle, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, along with sodium orthovanadate (0.5 mm) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to separate mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, and 15 μg of protein was used for SDS-PAGE. Min6 cells (passages 15–18 only) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated FBS and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. HEPG2 cells were grown in a 1:1 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F12K and 5% heat-inactivated FBS. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% heat inactivated FBS. Transfections for GST pull-down assays, immunoprecipitation, and BAX-RFP translocation in Min6, HEPG2, and COS-7 cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions and were treated as described 48 h post-transfection. Min6 cells were infected with Ad Akt-myristoylated (Myr) or Ad Akt-kinase-dead (KD) (multiplicity of infection = 25) for 6 h in growth medium and 40 h postinfection were treated as described. For endogenous MLK3 knockdown, due to the low transfection efficiency of beta cell lines, beta TC-3 cells were nucleofected with U6 shRNA constructs and pcDNA3-RFP reporter construct, used as a co-transfection marker. Cell sorting (FACS-DiVa; BD Biosciences) gated for RFP expression was followed by Western blotting analysis of MLK3 protein. For shRNA rescue experiments, 1 × 106 Min6 cells were electroporated using Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany) with 2 μg of plasmid DNA encoding shRNA or MLK3-KD, and 0.4 μg of pcDNA3-RFP. The indicated treatments were performed 40–48 h postnucleofection. COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-RFP, pcDNA3-BAX-RFP, pcDNA3, and pcDNA3-HA-TRB3, as indicated, were incubated with Mitotracker dye (200 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, fixed, and analyzed immediately. These experiments were performed as described (29.Humphrey R.K. Yu S.M. Flores L.E. Jhala U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3406-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors encoding GST or HA- or Myc-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in Min6 or HepG2 cells followed by GST pull-downs with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or immunoprecipitations as described (29.Humphrey R.K. Yu S.M. Flores L.E. Jhala U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3406-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bacterial MLK3 proteins were expressed using BL21-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TRB3 protein was generated by the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using T7 polymerase and pcDNA3-HA-TRB3 as template with a full complement of amino acids. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-MLK3 wild type (WT) or KD proteins were incubated with equal amounts of in vitro synthesized TRB3 protein in NETN buffer and a full complement of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The GST pull-downs were washed using NETN and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the top and bottom halves of the transferred blots were probed using pMLK3 (125 kDa) and TRB3 (48 kDa) antibodies, respectively. MLK3 input was detected using Gel-Code Blue stain reagent (Thermo-Pierce). Fluorescent and bright field images were acquired on either an inverted Olympus IX81 microscope attached to the Radiance 2100MP laser-scanning system (Bio-Rad) or a ScanScope CS digital slide scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA), respectively. All images were assembled in Photoshop 10 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Quantification was performed on 10 randomly selected fields of view using the ×40 or ×60 objective from three separate experiments. Total cell counts were obtained using propidium iodide (0.05 μg/ml), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml), RFP, GFP, or insulin for cell specificity in SICC arrays. Quantification of caspase-6 was performed on images deconvolved using ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA), and the caspase-6-positive pixels were expressed as a percentage of total pixels. Differences between means were examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni post hoc comparison. In all cases, p values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant. Analysis was performed using StatView 5.0 statistical software. NOD mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes around 15–18 weeks of age. Pancreas sections from 6- or 18-week-old NOD female mice with respective ambient glucose levels of 110 and 280 mg/dl were stained for MLK3 and its active form (pMLK3). Both total and phosphorylated MLK3 were strongly induced in leukocyte-infiltrated islets (Fig. 1A) but not detected in uninfiltrated islets from the same mouse or in islets of prediabetic NOD mice. These data suggested a correlation between local secretion of cytokines and induction and activation of MLK3. A widely used mixture of cytokines for study of beta cell death includes the three components IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ (31.Donath M.Y. Størling J. Maedler K. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 455-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Using each cytokine to stimulate Min6 cells, we found that in the beta cell, IL-1β rapidly induced total MLK3 protein levels within 20–30 min (Fig. 1B). Similarly, in human islets, IL-1β acutely induced the MLK3 isoform of the mixed lineage kinases by more than 4-fold. A smaller effect on MLK1 and -2 (supplemental Fig. 1) was observed in human islets. Of note, the rapid up-regulation of MLK3 protein was not due to increased transcription because no increase in MLK3 mRNA was observed (supplemental Fig. 2). Our data mirrored a key finding in a previous report where apoptogenic stimuli were shown to rapidly up-regulate MLK3 protein (32.Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by increasing protein stability. Because MLK3 is a MAP3K, which preferentially activates JNK (33.Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), we examined whether IL-1β induced JNK activity in an MLK3-dependent manner. Min6 insulinoma cells were treated with IL-1β, in the presence and absence of 500 nm CEP11004, a potent inhibitor of the mixed lineage kinase family (34.Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M. McKenna B.A. Thomas B.A. Mathiasen J.R. Saporito M.S. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Hudkins R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whose specificity was first ascertained as shown (supplemental Fig. 3). IL-1β rapidly induced JNK activation in the beta cell, and this effect was strongly attenuated by pretreatment with CEP11004 (Fig. 1C). To demonstrate cytokine-mediated induction of MLK3 in a physiologically relevant system, we devised an ex vivo SICC system, which would mimic the islet response to leukocyte invasion in insulitis. Unlike the events in vivo, this system (depicted by a schematic in Fig. 1D) permits the study of the earliest molecular events in cytokine signaling in a relatively controlled environment while maintaining the complex cytokine environment of insulitis. Splenocytes from diabetic NOD mice were isolated and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to trigger production of the full repertoire of cytokines (supplemental Table 1). During co-culture, islets were suspended in transwells such that they were immersed in stimulated medium but had no direct contact with splenocytes. To study the effect of MLK3, islets were co-cultured with or without pretreatment with CEP11004. Again MLK3 was rapidly (30 min) activated by cytokines, and Western blotting of islet extracts from SICC (Fig. 1E) showed that increasing numbers of splenocytes induced MLK3 and activated JNK in a dose-dependent manner. MLK3 and JNK were both inhibited using CEP11004, strongly suggesting that, similar to IL-β, conditions that mimic insulitis also activate MLK3 and its downstream kinase JNK. To examine whether MLKs were required for inducing autoimmune destruction of beta cells, we employed the SICC system described above. A time course of SICC islets from all experimental groups was arrayed on a single slide to enable a clear comparison across various samples. Similar to data from Western blotting, (Fig. 1E), MLK3 induction was also detected by immunostaining, and pretreatment with CEP11004 markedly inhibited this induction (Fig. 2A, column 1, rows ii and iii). Within 24 h of co-culture, 15% of the insulin-expressing cells in the islet were positive for TUNEL (column 2, row ii), which detects DNA strand breaks in end stage cell death. Pretreatment with CEP11004 effectively reduced TUNEL staining to unstimulated levels (column 2, row iii). CEP11004 treatment similarly inhibited the cleavage and activation of caspase-6 (supplemental Fig. 4). Quantification of TUNEL is shown in a graph (Fig. 2B). The arrayed time course of SICC islets was screened for shifts in expression of several apoptosis markers (see “Experimental Procedures”). Distinct MLK-dependent induction was observed for only two markers. The first was the pseudokinase TRB3 (Fig. 2A, column 3), which has been implicated in stress-induced apoptosis (12.Mayumi-Matsuda K. Kojima S. Suzuki H. Sakata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35.Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 36.Qian B. Wang H. Men X. Zhang W. Cai H. Xu S. Xu Y. Ye L. Wollheim C.B. Lou J. J. Endocrinol. 2008; 199: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The second marker was BAX (Fig. 2A, column 4), a proapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family of proteins, known to be critically required for pancreatic beta cell apoptosis (37.Dansen T.B. Whitfield J. Rostker F. Brown-Swigart L. Evan G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10890-10895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Apoptotic events have been shown to trigger a conformational change in BAX, which marks a critical transition toward its insertion in the mitochondrial membrane to initiate apoptosis. This structural change exposes a stretch of seven amino acids, normally buried in a hydrophobic pocket under quiescent conditions (38.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Using a monoclonal antibody (6A7) that specifically detects this exposed region, immunostaining of SICC islets (Fig. 2B, column 4) revealed intense punctate staining of BAX (row ii), and both TRB3 and BAX-6A7 induction were attenuated by pretreatment with the MLK inhibitor CEP11004 (row iii). Similar induction of TRB3 (Fig. 2C, panels i and ii) and BAX conformational change (panels iii and iv) were also detected in leukocyte-infiltrated islets of NOD mice. To understand the mechanistic connection between MLKs, TRB3, and BAX, we used activated splenocyte-derived conditioned or “stimulated” medium to treat Min6 mouse insulinoma cells, followed by immunofluorescent staining at 8 h (Fig. 3A). For clarity, an outline of the stained cells is presented below each image (bottom). As seen in Fig. 3A (top), TRB3 was induced in 20% of Min6 cells treated with stimulated medium (Fig. 3A, top, column 2). Remarkably, co-staining with 6A7 antibody detected conformationally altered BAX in most TRB3-positive cells (column 3), with little signal in TRB3-negative cells (see bottom panel), suggesting a close relationship between TRB3 induction and BAX conformational change. Indeed, overexpression of TRB3 was sufficient to induce mitochondrial translocation of coexpressed BAX-RFP fusion protein in cultured COS-7 cells. As seen in Fig. 3B, unlike the diffused localization of BAX-RFP in the presence of CMV control vector, the presence of TRB3 resulted in a strong overlap of BAX-RFP signal with the green Mitotracker dye. We next examined whether TRB3 protein induction was MLK-dependent. Using Western blotting, we found that stimulated medium (Fig. 3C) and IL-1β (Fig. 3D) both strongly induced TRB3 protein, and pretreatment with MLK inhibitor CEP11004 completely abrogated this effect. TRB3 protein induction was not accompanied by a change in TRB3 mRNA (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism for TRB3 regulation. To test whether the observed conformational change in BAX led to membrane insertion and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, we examined levels of BAX in subcellular fractions from Min6 cells treated with stimulated medium for 8 h. Western blots showed an increase in mitochondrial BAX and a corresponding reciprocal drop in cytoplasmic BAX (Fig. 3D) as early as 4 h and up to 12 h (not shown). In parallel, an inverse pattern of cytochrome c localization was observed, which indicated a breach in mitochondrial membrane integrity (39.Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu."
https://openalex.org/W1993359155,"Aging is a multi-factorial process, however, it is generally accepted that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are significant contributors. Mitochondria are important players in the aging process because they produce most of the cellular ROS. Despite the strength of the free-radical hypothesis, the use of free radical scavengers to delay aging has generated mixed results in vertebrate models, and clinical evidence of efficacy is lacking. This is in part due to the production of pro-oxidant metabolites by many antioxidants while scavenging ROS, which counteract their potentially beneficial effects. As such, a more effective approach is to enhance mitochondrial metabolism by reducing electron leakage with attendant reduction of ROS generation. Here, we report on the actions of a novel endogenous indole derivative, indolepropionamide (IPAM), which is similar in structure to melatonin. Our results suggest that IPAM binds to the rate-limiting component of oxidative phosphorylation in complex I of the respiratory chain and acts as a stabilizer of energy metabolism, thereby reducing ROS production. IPAM reversed the age-dependent decline of mitochondrial energetic capacity and increased rotifer lifespan, and it may, in fact, constitute a novel endogenous anti-aging substance of physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2053278010,"Disregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling directly promotes bypass of proliferation and survival restraints in a high frequency of epithelia-derived cancer. As such, much effort is currently focused on decoding the molecular architecture supporting EGFR activation and function. Here, we have leveraged high throughput reverse phase protein lysate arrays, with a sensitive fluorescent nanocrystal-based phosphoprotein detection assay, together with large scale siRNA-mediated loss of function to execute a quantitative interrogation of all elements of the human kinome supporting EGF-dependent signaling. This screening platform has captured multiple novel contributions of diverse protein kinases to modulation of EGFR signal generation, signal amplitude, and signal duration. As examples, the prometastatic SNF1/AMPK-related kinase hormonally upregulated Neu kinase was found to support EGFR activation in response to ligand binding, whereas the enigmatic kinase MGC16169 selectively supports coupling of active EGFR to ERK1/2 regulation. Of note, the receptor tyrosine kinase MERTK and the pyrimidine kinase UCK1 were both found to be required for surface accumulation of EGFR and subsequent pathway activation in multiple cancer cell backgrounds and may represent new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2090481512,"Background Calpain 3 (Capn3), also named p94, is a skeletal muscle tissue-specific protein known to be responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A). Recent experimental studies have hypothesized a pro-apoptotic role of Capn3 in some melanoma cell lines. So far the link between calpain3 and tumors comes from in vitro studies. The objective of this study was to describe Capn3 activation in naturally occurring urothelial tumors of the urinary bladder in cattle. Methods and Findings Here we describe, for the first time in veterinary and comparative oncology, the activation of Capn3 in twelve urothelial tumor cells of the urinary bladder of cattle. Capn3 protein was initially identified with nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS) in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment on E2F3, known to be a transcription factor playing a crucial role in bladder carcinogenesis in humans. Capn3 expression was then confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, the Ca2+-dependent proteolytic activity of Capn3 was assayed following ion exchange chromatography. Morphologically, Capn3 expression was documented by immunohistochemical methods. In fact numerous tumor cells showed an intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity, which was more rarely evident also at nuclear level. In urothelial tumors, bovine papillomavirus type 2 (BPV-2) DNA was amplified by PCR and the expression of E5 protein, the major oncogenic protein of BVP-2, was detected by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. E2F3 overexpression and pRb protein downregulation were shown by western blotting. Conclusion The role of capn3 protein in urothelial cancer of the urinary bladder remains to be elucidated: further studies would be required to determine the precise function of this protease in tumor development and progression. However, we suggest that activated Capn3 may be involved in molecular pathways leading to the overexpression of E2F3, which in turn could be responsible for urothelial tumor cell proliferation also in cattle, though other mechanisms are likely to exist. If further studies corroborate the important role of Capn3 in urothelial tumors of the urinary bladder, cattle with urinary tumors may prove useful as animal model for bladder carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1574085794,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are best known as transcription corepressors through deacetylating histone tails. Here we show that HDAC2 is also involved in cap-dependent mRNA translation by promoting sumoylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is independent of its deacetylase activity. By stimulating eIF4E sumoylation, HDAC2 induces the formation of the active eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex and induces the protein synthesis of a subset of eIF4E-responsive genes that are essential for cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis. These data demonstrate that HDAC2 has an unexpected sumoylation-promoting activity and regulates cap-dependent mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2029490774,"Human methionine adenosyltransferase 2beta (MAT2beta) encodes for two major splicing variants, V1 and V2, which are differentially expressed in normal tissues. Both variants are induced in human liver cancer and positively regulate growth. The aim of this work was to identify interacting proteins of V1 and V2. His-tagged V1 and V2 were overexpressed in Rosetta pLysS cells, purified, and used in a pulldown assay to identify interacting proteins from human colon cancer cell line RKO cell lysates. The eluted lysates were subjected to Western blot and in solution proteomic analyses. HuR, an mRNA-binding protein known to stabilize the mRNA of several cyclins, was identified to interact with V1 and V2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting confirmed their interaction in both liver and colon cancer cells. These variant proteins are located in both nucleus and cytoplasm in liver and colon cancer cells and, when overexpressed, increased the cytoplasmic HuR content. This led to increased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A, known targets of HuR. When endogenous expression of V1 or V2 is reduced by small interference RNA, cytoplasmic HuR content fell and the expression of these HuR target genes also decreased. Knockdown of cyclin D1 or cyclin A blunted, whereas knockdown of HuR largely prevented, the ability of V1 or V2 overexpression to induce growth. In conclusion, MAT2beta variants reside mostly in the nucleus and regulate HuR subcellular content to affect cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2043632033,"Here, we describe the characterization of the [2Fe-2S] clusters of arsenite oxidases from Rhizobium sp. NT-26 and Ralstonia sp. 22. Both reduced Rieske proteins feature EPR signals similar to their homologs from Rieske-cyt b complexes, with g values at 2.027, 1.88, and 1.77. Redox titrations in a range of pH values showed that both [2Fe-2S] centers have constant Em values up to pH 8 at ∼+210 mV. Above this pH value, the Em values of both centers are pH-dependent, similar to what is observed for the Rieske-cyt b complexes. The redox properties of these two proteins, together with the low Em value (+160 mV) of the Alcaligenes faecalis arsenite oxidase Rieske (confirmed herein), are in line with the structural determinants observed in the primary sequences, which have previously been deduced from the study of Rieske-cyt b complexes. Since the published Em value of the Chloroflexus aurantiacus Rieske (+100 mV) is in conflict with this sequence analysis, we re-analyzed membrane samples of this organism and obtain a new value (+200 mV). Arsenite oxidase activity was affected by quinols and quinol analogs, which is similar to what is found with the Rieske-cyt b complexes. Together, these results show that the Rieske protein of arsenite oxidase shares numerous properties with its counterpart in the Rieske-cyt b complex. However, two cysteine residues, strictly conserved in the Rieske-cyt b-Rieske and considered to be crucial for its function, are not conserved in the arsenite oxidase counterpart. We discuss the role of these residues. Here, we describe the characterization of the [2Fe-2S] clusters of arsenite oxidases from Rhizobium sp. NT-26 and Ralstonia sp. 22.

However, two cysteine residues, strictly conserved in the Rieske-cyt b-Rieske and considered to be crucial for its function, are not conserved in the arsenite oxidase counterpart. We discuss the role of these residues.

Apart from the two cases of Ectothiorhodospiraceae, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii str. MLHE-1 (2Hoeft S.E. Blum J.S. Stolz J.F. Tabita F.R. Witte B. King G.M. Santini J.M. Oremland R.S. Int. J. Syst.

Microbiol. 2005; 71: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), encoded by the aroA and aroB genes. The three-dimensional structure of Aro has been solved (6Ellis P.J. Conrads T. Hille R. Kuhn P. Structure. 2001; 9: 125-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The structure of the large AroA (or AoxB or AsoA) subunit (90–100 kDa), bearing a molybdopterin cofactor together with a [3Fe-4S] cluster, establishes the enzyme as a member of the large dimethyl sulfoxide reductase superfamily of molybdenum-containing enzymes (6Ellis P.J. Conrads T. Hille R. Kuhn P. Structure. 2001; 9: 125-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Corrresponding structural similarities demonstrate that the small AroB (or AoxA or AsoB) subunit (14 kDa), harboring a [2Fe-2S] cluster, belongs to the superfamily of Rieske proteins. Aro thus illustrates the “Janus Head” principle that many bioenergetic enzymes are built from a very limited number of basic units, which we have termed a “redox enzyme construction kit” (7Baymann F. Lebrun E. Brugna M. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Nitschke W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The first member of the family of Rieske proteins was identified and characterized in 1964 in Helmut Beinert's laboratory (8Rieske J.S. Hansen R.E. Zaugg W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3017-3022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a component of mitochondrial complex III. It stood out from other known iron sulfur proteins by its extraordinarily high reduction potential (HP). Over the ensuing 40 years, Rieske proteins have been shown to form a very large superfamily encompassing subunits of the Rieske-cyt b complexes (i.e. complexes homologous to complex III) (see Refs. 9Schütz M. Brugna M. Lebrun E. Baymann F. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Hauska G. Toci R. Lemesle-Meunier D. Tron P. Schmidt C. Nitschke W. J. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 47: 83-157Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 12Schmidt C.L. Shaw L. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2001; 33: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as well as sulredoxin from Sulfolobus tokodaii (13Iwasaki T. Isogai T. Lizuka T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to the above cited AroB proteins. The Rieske centers are thus present in highly diverse prokaryotic systems. The Rieske-cyt b complex performs electron transfer from membrane-diffusing quinols to small soluble or membrane-attached redox proteins and thereby participates in the generation of a proton motive potential. By transferring electrons from AsIII to a soluble cytochrome in the periplasm, Aro has been demonstrated to sustain chemolithoautotrophy in an aerobic respiration process. Although its precise integration into bioenergetic chains still needs to be established, Aro has therefore been proposed to bypass the Rieske-cyt b complex in prokaryotic aerobic heterotrophic bioenergetic chains (14vanden Hoven R.N. Santini J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1656: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The dioxygenases are soluble cytoplasmic enzyme systems involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds. They consist of two or three components that transfer electrons from reduced nucleotides (NADH) via flavin and [2Fe-2S] redox centers to a terminal oxygenase. In these systems, [2Fe-2S] centers can be found in one or two components (15Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).Phylogenetic analysis of Aro and the Rieske-cyt b complexes strongly suggests that both systems existed in the common ancestor of bacteria and archaea (16Lebrun E. Brugna M. Baymann F. Muller D. Lièvremont D. Lett M.C. Nitschke W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and that the emergence of these two very divergent enzymes from fundamental ancestral “building units” represents a very early event in the evolution of life (7Baymann F. Lebrun E. Brugna M. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Nitschke W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The substantially different enzymatic reactions of the two systems subsequently must have involved adaptation of the building blocks to specific functional requirements. Among these adaptations are the properties of the Rieske cluster.As established crystallographically, all Rieske proteins contain a [2Fe-2S] cluster in which one of the iron atoms is coordinated by two histidines (6Ellis P.J. Conrads T. Hille R. Kuhn P. Structure. 2001; 9: 125-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Kauppi B. Lee K. Carredano E. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Eklund H.

As documented for the Rieske-cyt b complexes and dioxygenases, these His ligands are responsible for i) an unusual EPR spectrum characterized by a low gav value of ∼1.91 as compared with ∼1.94 for most “classical” ferredoxins (21Bertrand P. Gayda J.P. Fee J.A. Kuila D. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and ii) a reduction potential at least 400 mV more positive than that of the classical ferredoxins (for review, see Refs. 11Link T.A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 83-157Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 22Schoepp B. Brugna M. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 335-360Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) a property that set the Rieske cluster apart at its discovery in 1964. Detailed structural determinants for these properties have been deduced from a comparison of the Rieske-cyt b complex and the dioxygenase groups, and several residues close to the cluster have been proposed to distinguish the two groups. The fact that the Rieske components of dioxygenases lack the disulfide bond near the cluster, whereas this bridge is universally present in the subunit of Rieske-cyt b complexes has led to the proposal that the dioxygenase cases be referred to as “Rieske-type” rather than “Rieske” centers. Such clusters have reduction potentials between −150 and −50 mV, whereas genuine Rieske proteins (i.e. those in Rieske-cyt b complexes) have reduction potentials in the range +100 to +380 mV (11Link T.A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 83-157Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As we will show below, the case of the AroB protein demonstrates that the distinction between “true” Rieske and Rieske-type proteins is not so clear.In comparison to the proteins from dioxygenases and Rieske-cyt b complexes, very little is known about the Rieske subunit in Aro. The spectrum recorded on the enzyme from Alcaligenes faecalis suggested that the EPR properties of the Aro-Rieske subunit were very similar to the protein in Rieske-cyt b complexes (23Anderson G.L. Williams J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23674-23682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectra of both Rieske clusters actually are so similar that the g = 1.90 signal recorded on membranes of Chloroflexus aurantiacus was first interpreted as arising from a Rieske-cyt b complex (24Zannoni D. Ingledew W.J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 93-98Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The genome sequence, however, revealed that C. aurantiacus doesn't possess a Rieske-cyt b complex and that this signal therefore must be due to Aro (16Lebrun E. Brugna M. Baymann F. Muller D. Lièvremont D. Lett M.C. Nitschke W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The high sequence similarity between Aro- and Rieske-cyt b Rieskes (16Lebrun E. Brugna M. Baymann F. Muller D. Lièvremont D. Lett M.C. Nitschke W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) thus correlates with the similar EPR properties of their [2Fe-2S] centers. The potentiometric results obtained on the Aro of A. faecalis (25Hoke K.R. Cobb N. Armstrong F.A. Hille R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and C. aurantiacus (24Zannoni D. Ingledew W.J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 93-98Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) moreover suggest that the redox properties of the Aro-Rieske cluster resemble those of the center in Rieske-cyt b complexes. In fact, redox titrations on the [2Fe-2S] center of A. faecalis and C. aurantiacus enzymes yield values of Em = +130 mV (at pH 6) and Em = +100 mV (at pH 7), respectively.To ascertain whether the structural determinants for properties of the center from Rieske-cyt b complexes also apply to the Aro-Rieske cluster, we have studied in the present work two additional enzymes from Rhizobium sp. NT-26 (NT-26; 26Santini J.M. vanden Hoven R.N. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1614-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and Ralstonia sp. 22 (S22; 62Lieutaud A. van Lis R. Duval S. Capowiez L. Muller D. Lebrun R. Lignon S. Fardeau M.L. Lett M.C. Nitschke W. Schoepp-Cothenet B. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20433-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, see accompanying paper), which are members of the α- and β-proteobacteria, respectively. We have determined the EPR power saturation and redox properties of their [2Fe-2S] clusters and analyzed the results in light of primary sequences and molecular structures. We have also re-examined the properties of the C. aurantiacus Rieske center by repeating selected experiments at higher protein concentrations. Since Aro- and Rieske-cyt b Rieskes are closely related, we have tested the ability of Aro-Rieskes to react with quinones or analogs. Altogether, our results establish common redox properties of the Aro [2Fe-2S] group. Re-examination of the ever-increasing number of Rieske-cyt b-Rieskes sequences and redox properties provide new insights into the structural determinants of the properties of the Rieske-clusters.RESULTSAs outlined in the introduction, all Rieske clusters are characterized by reduction potentials well above those of classical [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. However, among these clusters, three subgroups can be distinguished with respect to their Em values. The group including the dioxygenase, have reduction potentials <0 mV. The second group, made up of Rieske proteins found in Rieske-cyt b complexes from ubiquinone-, plastoquinone-, or caldariellaquinone-oxidizing organisms, were titrated at 330 ± 60 mV. The third group corresponds to Rieske proteins found in Rieske-cyt b complexes from menaquinone-oxidizing organisms, and the respective clusters were titrated at 160 ± 50 mV. The values published for the A. faecalis and C. aurantiacus Aro-Rieske centers suggest that they belong to the last of these groups. In this work, we have characterized two additional Aro-Rieske proteins, purified from NT-26 and S22, and can now draw reliable conclusions on how to classify this new ensemble of Rieske proteins.Reduction Potentials of the Aro-Rieske from NT-26 and S22 at pH 8Experiments were first carried out at a pH of 8 because of the higher stability and activity of the enzymes at this pH (see accompanying paper, Ref. 62Lieutaud A. van Lis R. Duval S. Capowiez L. Muller D. Lebrun R. Lignon S. Fardeau M.L. Lett M.C. Nitschke W. Schoepp-Cothenet B. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20433-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra recorded at 15 K on ascorbate-reduced purified Aro from NT-26 and S22 featured a derivative-shaped gy signal at g = 1.88, a gx trough at g = 1.77 and a gz peak (partially obscured by a wide radical signal) at g = 2.027 (Fig. 1A, spectra a and b). The differing amplitude ratios of the gx and gy features of spectra a and b suggested that the NT-26 and S22 [2Fe-2S] clusters may have differing relaxation properties. Power saturation curves measured on the gx and gy lines quantitatively confirmed this. In the case of the S22 cluster, the gx feature saturated more readily than the gy feature, a situation that is typical also for the cluster in Rieske-cyt b complexes (31Riedel A. Rutherford A.W. Hauska G. Müller A. Nitschke W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the NT-26 cluster, however, the situation was reversed (Fig. 1B).EPR spectra were next recorded under nonsaturating conditions. The very particular EPR spectral parameters, specific to Rieske clusters, allows their characterization even in nonpurified samples. Because the final yield of enzyme purification was only in the range of 30% (26Santini J.M. vanden Hoven R.N. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1614-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and 62Lieutaud A. van Lis R. Duval S. Capowiez L. Muller D. Lebrun R. Lignon S. Fardeau M.L. Lett M.C. Nitschke W. Schoepp-Cothenet B. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20433-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, accompanying paper), we performed EPR titrations on partially purified but substantially more concentrated enzyme samples (see “Experimental Procedures”) to obtain stronger signals. In both cases (NT-26 and S22), the observed signals (data not shown) were identical to those seen with purified enzymes. Because the AroB spectrum was readily observed in samples reduced by ascorbate, the only further center susceptible to contribute to the spectrum is the Rieske center of the Rieske-cyt b complexes in NT-26 and S22. However, the Rieske protein of the Rieske-cyt b complex is membrane-attached, anchored by its uncleaved twin arginine translocation signal sequence, and cannot be extracted from the membrane without detergent treatment (see Ref. 32Kallas T. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 259-317Google Scholar). It therefore appeared unlikely that this protein might contribute to the spectrum in samples obtained without detergent extraction (see “Experimental Procedures”).Redox titrations of the Aro-Rieske cluster from NT-26 and S22 at pH 8, evaluated from the size of the gy feature, are presented on supplemental Fig. S1. The determined Em values are similar with +225 ± 5 mV and +190 ± 5 mV for NT-26 and S22, respectively. These values are substantially higher than those reported for the Aro Rieske clusters from A. faecalis and C. aurantiacus.These latter Em values were obtained at lower pH values. All Rieske-type clusters, however, have been demonstrated to show pH-dependent redox properties. The Rieske-cyt b subunit from neutrophilic organisms features Em values, which are pH-independent up to pH 8 and pH-dependent above this value with a slope of −60 mV/pH. Furthermore, in several cases, it has been shown that the pH dependence can attain a slope of −120 mV/pH at pH values >9. The Rieske-cyt b-Rieskes from acidophilic organisms and the dioxygenase ferredoxins show the same overall pH dependence only shifted by 2 pH units to lower and to higher pH values, respectively (22Schoepp B. Brugna M. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 335-360Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Zu Y. Manon M.J. Kolling D.R. Crofts A.R. Eltis L.D. Fee J.A. Hirst J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16766-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the Em values reported at low pH values for A. faecalis and C. aurantiacus are lower than those determined for S22 and NT-26, the mentioned type of pH dependence cannot account for the difference between our values and those published. However, very peculiar pH dependences in Aro-Rieskes a priori cannot be excluded. We therefore next determined the redox potentials of the NT-26 and S22 Aro-Rieske clusters in the range between pH 6 and 9.5.pH Dependence of Reduction Potentials of NT-26 and S22 Aro-Rieske ClustersThe dependence of Aro Rieske Em values versus pH is depicted in Fig. 2. The Em values obtained at pH 6, 7, and 8 suggest that the reduction potential is independent of pH up to pH 7.8 at a value of +225 ± 5 mV and +215 ± 5 mV for NT-26 and S22, respectively. The pH-dependence of the Aro-Rieske from S22 in the alkaline region can be interpreted as a decrease with a homogeneous slope of −60 mV/pH from 7.8 to 9.5. In the case of the NT-26 Aro-Rieske, the Em of the cluster versus pH dependence requires consideration of slopes of −60 mV/pH from 7.8 to 8.8 and of −120 mV/pH at very high pHs. These results agree with previous observation on neutrophilic Rieske-cyt b-Rieskes (reviewed in Ref. 11Link T.A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 83-157Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) featuring two pKa,ox values ∼ 7.6 and 9.2.FIGURE 2The reduction potential of the Rieske center from NT-26 and S22 as a function of pH. The open and closed symbols represent data obtained with S22 and NT-26 enzyme, respectively. The data obtained on S22 Rieske are fitted by assuming two ionization equilibria with pKa values of 7.8 and 9.8 and an Em (low pH) of +215 mV, whereas the data obtained on NT-26 Rieske are fitted by assuming two ionization equilibria with pKa values of 7.8 and 8.8 and an Em (low pH) of +225 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The pH dependence of Em thus does not provide an explanation for the difference between our results and the previously published values. While the Em values published for A. faecalis and C. aurantiacus are comparable with those for menaquinone-oxidizing Rieske-cyt b-Rieske centers, the values obtained for the NT-26 and S22 Aro-Rieskes are intermediate between those of menaquinone-oxidizing and of ubiquinone-, plastoquinone-, or caldariellaquinone-oxidizing Rieske-cyt b-Rieske proteins (22Schoepp B. Brugna M. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 335-360Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Extensive studies of Rieske-cyt b complexes have established that selected residues involved in a complex hydrogen-bonding network near the cluster environment modulate its redox properties. Taking into account the close structural relationship between Aro- and Rieske-cyt b-Rieske centers, we therefore inspected the Aro-Rieske sequences to determine whether these hydrogen-bonding residues may account for the difference in Em between A. faecalis and C. aurantiacus on the one hand and NT-26 and S22 on the other hand.Sequence Analysis of Aro-Rieske ProteinsAro-Rieske sequences from NT-26, A. faecalis (AAR05655 (NT-26), AAQ19839), and C. aurantiacus (YP_001634828) are available in GenBank. Only a fragment of the S22 AroA subunit sequence was available (ABY19329) at the onset of this work. We made an effort to obtain the entire sequence of the S22 Aro-Rieske (GQ904715) and as discussed in the accompanying paper (62Lieutaud A. van Lis R. Duval S. Capowiez L. Muller D. Lebrun R.

A comparison was made of all four Aro-Rieske sequences to those of other Rieske proteins.Rieske proteins (i.e. Aro-Rieske, Rieske-cyt b-Rieske) are composed of two distinct structural domains (10Lebrun E.

The first, essentially represented by the N-terminal half of the primary sequence has only limited sequence similarity among Rieske proteins. On the other hand, the second domain, corresponding to the [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding domain, features strong similarities in proteins from all three domains of life allowing us to produce reliable multiple sequence alignments. An alignment corresponding to the cluster-binding domain is shown in Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W2153889246,"Metabolic labeling with [(35)S]cysteine was used to characterize early events in CaSR biosynthesis. [(35)S]CaSR is relatively stable (half-life approximately 8 h), but maturation to the final glycosylated form is slow and incomplete. Incorporation of [(35)S]cysteine is linear over 60 min, and the rate of [(35)S]CaSR biosynthesis is significantly increased by the membrane-permeant allosteric agonist NPS R-568, which acts as a cotranslational pharmacochaperone. The [(35)S]CaSR biosynthetic rate also varies as a function of conformational bias induced by loss- or gain-of-function mutations. In contrast, [(35)S]CaSR maturation to the plasma membrane was not significantly altered by exposure to the pharmacochaperone NPS R-568, the allosteric agonist neomycin, or the orthosteric agonist Ca(2+) (0.5 or 5 mm), suggesting that CaSR does not control its own release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A CaSR chimera containing the mGluR1alpha carboxyl terminus matures completely (half-time of approximately 8 h) and without a lag period, as does the truncation mutant CaSRDelta868 (half-time of approximately 16 h). CaSRDelta898 exhibits maturation comparable with full-length CaSR, suggesting that the CaSR carboxyl terminus between residues Thr(868) and Arg(898) limits maturation. Overall, these results suggest that CaSR is subject to cotranslational quality control, which includes a pharmacochaperone-sensitive conformational checkpoint. The CaSR carboxyl terminus is the chief determinant of intracellular retention of a significant fraction of total CaSR. Intracellular CaSR may reflect a rapidly mobilizable ""storage form"" of CaSR and/or may subserve distinct intracellular signaling roles that are sensitive to signaling-dependent changes in endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) and/or glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W2080266453,"We developed C57BL/6 mice with targeted deletion of group X secretory phospholipase A2 (GX KO). These mice have ∼80% higher plasma corticosterone concentrations compared with wild-type (WT) mice under both basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced stress conditions. This increased corticosterone level was not associated with increased circulating ACTH or a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis as evidenced by a normal response to dexamethasone challenge. Primary cultures of adrenal cells from GX KO mice exhibited significantly increased corticosteroid secretion compared with WT cells. Conversely, overexpression of GX secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), but not a catalytically inactive mutant form of GX sPLA2, significantly reduced steroid production 30–40% in Y1 mouse adrenal cell line. This effect was reversed by the sPLA2 inhibitor, indoxam. Silencing of endogenous M-type receptor expression did not restore steroid production in GX sPLA2-overexpressing Y1 cells, ruling out a role for this sPLA2 receptor in this regulatory process. Expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), the rate-limiting protein in corticosteroid production, was ∼2-fold higher in adrenal glands of GX KO mice compared with WT mice, whereas StAR expression was suppressed in Y1 cells overexpressing GX sPLA2. Results from StAR-promoter luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that GX sPLA2 antagonizes StAR promoter activity and liver X receptor-mediated StAR promoter activation. In summary, GX sPLA2 is expressed in mouse adrenal glands and functions to negatively regulate corticosteroid synthesis, most likely by negatively regulating StAR expression.

Among these enzymes, group X sPLA2 (GX sPLA2) has the highest binding affinity to zwitterionic phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, and thus potently hydrolyzes the outer leaflet of intact mammalian membranes, which are rich in phosphatidylcholine. GX sPLA2 is reportedly expressed in spleen, thymus, blood leukocytes, lung, colon, brain, heart, placenta, prostate, small intestine, testis, uterus, and pancreas (2Cupillard L. Koumanov K.

Almost all of the insights into GX sPLA2 function have been gleaned from in vitro studies, whereby cultured cells were either transfected with GX sPLA2 cDNA or antisense or were incubated with recombinant enzyme or pharmacological inhibitors. When added to intact cells, the mature enzyme effectively hydrolyzes plasma membranes to generate free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, most notably arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Based on its ability to generate bioactive lipid mediators, GX sPLA2 has been implicated in diverse biological functions, including prostaglandin-mediated inflammatory responses in airway epithelial cells, mast cells, and macrophages, and LPC-induced neurite outgrowth and melanocyte pigmentation (5Henderson Jr., W.R.

Although many of GX sPLA2s biological effects have been attributed to its potent catalytic activity, this molecule may also induce intracellular signaling events through processes that are independent of phospholipid hydrolysis (13Granata F.

GX sPLA2 is a high affinity ligand for the M-type sPLA2 receptor, a member of the C-type lectin family that is structurally similar to the macrophage mannose receptor (1Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Annu.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Whether the noncatalytic activities described for GX sPLA2 are mediated through M-type receptor-dependent signaling remains to be determined. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the M-type receptor mediates GX sPLA2 internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation (16Yokota Y. Notoya M. Higashino K. Ishimoto Y. Nakano K.

The recent development of genetically manipulated mice has provided new insights into GX sPLA2 functions in vivo. According to one report, lungs from mice deficient in GX sPLA2 (GX KO mice) have significantly reduced ovalbumin-induced inflammatory responses, suggesting a role for GX sPLA2 in asthma (5Henderson Jr., W.R.

We report for the first time that GX sPLA2 is expressed in mouse adrenal glands and cultured murine adrenal cells. Based on immunohistochemical staining, the protein is primarily localized in the zona fasiculata cells of the adrenal cortex. Our data indicate that GX sPLA2 negatively regulates corticosterone production by altering the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), likely by suppressing LXR-mediated StAR promoter activation. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for cell culture treatments was purchased from Sigma. Plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels were determined using specific radioimmunoassay kits (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Progesterone quantification was carried out using an EIA kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Phospholipase activity in conditioned media was measured using a colorimetric assay as described by Wooton-Kee et al. (20Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J. Webb N.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Matreya LLC, Pleasant Gap, PA) as substrate. Essentially, mixed micelles were prepared by warming 7 mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol with a 0.2-ml mixture of 4.0% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and 2.0% sodium deoxycholate to 37 °C, and then adding 1.8 ml of warm assay buffer (0.12 mol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8, 12 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA). For enzyme assays, 10 μl of conditioned media was added to 40 μl of substrate solution. After incubating at 37 °C for 20 min, the amount of free fatty acids released was quantified using a NEFA-C kit (Wako Chemicals). Targeted deletion of the GX sPLA2 gene was performed by InGenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc. (Stony Brook, NY), using embryonic stem cells derived from C57BL/6 mice. The targeting vector contained a Neo cassette that was trapped inside exon 1, upstream of the translation start signal, replacing 564 bp of the GX sPLA2 gene. Heterozygous GX sPLA2+/− mice were bred to produce GX sPLA2+/+ (WT) and GX sPLA2−/− mice (GX KO) mice that were used for the experiments. Male and female mice (3–5 months old) were maintained on a 10-h light/14-h dark cycle and received standard mouse chow and water ad libitum. For experiments with ACTH, mice received subcutaneous injections of 0.1 ml of saline or saline containing 4 units of ACTH (ACTHAR-GEL, Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Union City, CA) at time 0, 12, and 24 h (21Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Three hours after the last injection, the mice were anesthetized, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture in EDTA-containing tubes. Plasma was stored at −80 °C until analysis. For dexamethasone treatments, animals were injected intraperitoneally three times, 12 h apart with either 0.1 ml of saline (control) or dexamethasone (Sigma, 40 μg) in 0.1 ml of saline (21Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Animals were euthanized 3 h after the last injection, and plasma samples were collected as described above. All procedures were approved by the Lexington Veterans Affairs Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Murine Y1 BS1 adrenal cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 12.5% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). C-terminal FLAG-tagged cDNA was constructed by PCR using forward (F) and reverse (R) primers containing HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, 5′-CTGAAGCTTATGCTGCTGCTACTG-3′ (F) and 5′-GCTGAATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTCGCACTTGGGTGA-3′ (R), and mouse GX sPLA2 cDNA as a template. The PCR product was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) to yield a coding sequence that expressed GX sPLA2 with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. cDNA for catalytically inactive mutant of GX sPLA2 (H46Q) was generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using C-terminal FLAG-tagged cDNA for mouse GX sPLA2 as template and the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers: 5′-CTGGTGCTGCTACCACCAAGACTGCTGCTACTCC-3′ (F) and 5′- GGAGTAGCAGCAGTCTTGGTGGTAGCAGCACCAG-3′ (R). DNA sequencing was performed to confirm all expression constructions. Y1 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). For inhibitor studies, Y1 cells were incubated for 12 h with the indicated concentration of indoxam (14Rouault M. Le Calvez C. Boilard E. Surrel F. Singer A. Ghomashchi F. Bezzine S. Scarzello S. Bollinger J. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1647-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Where indicated, Y1 cells were incubated with 10 μm LPC (Sigma), 10 μm AA (Sigma), or vehicle in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Primary adrenal cell cultures were established as described by Cummins et al. (22Cummins C.L. Volle D.H. Zhang Y. McDonald J.G. Sion B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Caira F. Veyssière G. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Briefly, adrenal glands were cleaned of surrounding fat tissues, minced, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with rotation in complete medium 199 (10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) that was supplemented with 3.7 mg/ml collagenase type I and 5 μg/ml DNase I. The cell suspension was then passed through a 70-μm nylon mesh and rinsed with complete media 199. Cells were washed once with basal culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1), 15 mm HEPES, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 13.7 μg/ml fibronectin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin), resuspended in the same medium, and distributed into poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates. The cells were cultured for 3 days prior to treatments. Total RNA was isolated from mouse adrenal glands and cultured cells using the TriReagentTM (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RNA was further processed with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). RNA (1–2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). After a 4-fold dilution, 5 μl was used as a template for real time RT-PCR. Amplification was done for 40 cycles using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and DNA Engine Optical 2 System (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA). Quantification was performed in duplicate using the standard curve method and normalizing to 18 S. The primers used for amplification reactions are described in supplemental Table 1. A set of pre-designed synthetic oligonucleotides directed to the mouse M-type receptor with the sequence (5′-GGUAAAUCUGUACUGACCCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGUCAGUACAGAUUUACCTG-3′ (antisense) was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The oligonucleotides were transfected into Y1 cells stably expressing GX sPLA2 (Y1-GX cells) by nucleofector using the basic nucleofector kit for primary mammalian epithelial cells (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) and the program T-013. Scrambled siRNA (Ambion) was used as control. Cells and media were collected 24 h after transfection for RNA preparation and progesterone quantification, respectively. Y1 cells were grown in complete medium in 12-well plates to 90% confluence and then transfected with pTK-3×LXRE-Luc reporter construct (1.0 μg) along with plasmids encoding mLXRα (0.5 μg) and Renilla luciferase (0.01 μg; Promega) and either mGX sPLA2 expression vector or the corresponding pcDNA3 empty control vector (0.25 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The LXRE reporter construct and mLXRα expression plasmid were both gifts from Dr. Peter Tontonoz, UCLA. After 24 h, fresh medium (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% delipidated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) with or without 0.1 or 1.0 μm T0901317 was added to the cells and then incubated for a further 24 h. The volume of vehicle (DMSO) added was the same in all treatments. Luciferase activities were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency was normalized using Renilla luciferase activity. To assess StAR promoter activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with mGX sPLA2 expression vector or the corresponding pcDNA3 empty control vector along with either StAR promoter-luciferase reporter construct (p-254StAR/luc) containing putative LXR-response element-like sequence (LXRE-like) of the StAR promoter or mutated StAR promoter-luciferase construct with mutations in the putative LXRE half-sites (gifts from Dr. David J Mangelsdorf, Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) (22Cummins C.L.

Cell treatments and luciferase activity assays were carried out as described above. Adrenal glands were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm-thick sections at the level of the adrenal cortex were mounted on glass slides. After antigen retrieval with sodium citrate-based reagent (Dako) for 15 min at 95 °C, tissues were immunostained using rabbit anti-human GX sPLA2 antibody, which cross-reacts with mouse GX sPLA2 (23Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E. Singer A. Smart B.P. Borregaard N. Reithmeier R. Lindsay T.F. Lichtenberger C. Reinisch W. Lambeau G. Arm J. Tischfield J. Gelb M.H. Rubin B.B. J. Biol.

The color reaction was developed using Vectastain ABC kit (Vectastain Laboratories) and AEC chromogen (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Statistical comparisons between WT and GX KO mice within the same treatment group and between different treatment groups within the same genotype were carried out for each experiment, and all significant differences (p < 0.05) are given in the figures and/or figure legends. Statistical significance in experiments comparing only two groups was determined by two-tailed Student's t test. The significance of the difference in mean values among more than two groups was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. All statistical analyses were done with GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad software). Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. To elucidate the physiological function of GX sPLA2 in vivo, we recently developed C57BL/6 mice with targeted deletion of the GX sPLA2 gene (GX KO mice). RT-PCR analysis showed detectable expression of GX sPLA2 in adrenal glands of C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1A). Positive immunostaining was detected in mouse adrenal glands, primarily in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex (Fig. 1B). As expected, GX sPLA2 mRNA and protein was not detected in adrenal glands of GX KO mice (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings prompted us to investigate whether GX KO mice have altered adrenal function. Interestingly, plasma corticosterone levels in GX KO mice were significantly higher than WT mice under basal conditions (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C) and following ACTH treatment (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). There was no difference in circulating aldosterone levels between WT and GX KO mice demonstrating a specific effect on glucocorticoids (data not shown). Plasma ACTH levels were not significantly different between untreated GX KO and WT mice (WT, 286.9 ± 33 pg/ml; GX KO, 271.6 ± 58.2 pg/ml; n = 6), indicating that the increased corticosterone levels in GX KO mice were not due to trophic effects of ACTH. Plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels were suppressed to 6 and 11%, respectively, of base-line levels in GX KO mice following dexamethasone treatment, indicating that central negative feedback through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was intact in these mice (Fig. 2, A and B). For assessment of corticosterone production ex vivo, primary adrenal cells isolated from GX KO and WT mice were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nm ACTH for 20 h. The amount of corticosterone secreted by the two cell types under basal conditions was not significantly different, although there was a trend for increased production by cells from GX KO mice (p = 0.07). Notably, ACTH induced significantly higher levels of corticosterone secretion in cells derived from GX KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2C). Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that GX sPLA2 regulates adrenal corticosterone synthesis through a mechanism that is at least partially independent of a systemic effect. To further investigate the regulation of corticosterone production by GX sPLA2, we established a mouse adrenocortical cell line (Y1 cells) overexpressing mouse GX sPLA2. Stable transfection of GX sPLA2 in Y1 cells (Y1-GX cells) resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in phospholipase activity in the culture medium (Fig. 3A) compared with cells transfected with control vector (Y1-C cells). Y1 cells do not express 21-hydroxylase enzyme required for the conversion of progesterone to corticosterone (24Parker K.L. Chaplin D.D. Wong M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Schimmer B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 7860-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and hence, progesterone secretion was analyzed in these cells as an index of steroid production. The increase in GX sPLA2 expression resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in steroid production under basal as well as ACTH-treated conditions (Fig. 3B). Thus, consistent with our finding that deficiency of GX sPLA2 in vivo results in an increase in corticosterone production, overexpression of GX sPLA2 in vitro results in decreased steroid production. We have confirmed these results using at least two stably transfected cell lines and several transiently transfected lines that had variable GX sPLA2 expression. Published studies indicate that mouse GX sPLA2 is a high affinity ligand for the mouse M-type receptor, and it has been proposed that binding and activation of this receptor may mediate some of the biological effects of GX sPLA2 (14Rouault M. Le Calvez C. Boilard E. Surrel F. Singer A. Ghomashchi F. Bezzine S. Scarzello S. Bollinger J. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1647-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether the decreased glucocorticoid production in Y1-GX cells involves GX sPLA2 binding to this receptor. Accordingly, we used an siRNA-directed gene silencing approach to investigate whether suppressing M-type receptor expression increases progesterone production in Y1-GX cells. Analysis by RT-PCR readily detected M-type receptor mRNA in both mouse adrenal glands and Y1-C cells (data not shown) as well as Y1-GX cells treated with a control siRNA (Fig. 4A). Transfection with a gene-specific siRNA significantly reduced M-type receptor mRNA expression in Y1-GX cells by 70–80% (Fig. 4A). However, this decrease in receptor expression was not accompanied by an increase in steroid production; on the contrary, progesterone production was significantly reduced (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the negative regulation of adrenal steroid production by GX sPLA2 is not directly mediated by M-type receptor signaling. We investigated whether indoxam, an inhibitor of sPLA2 enzymatic activity (25Boilard E. Rouault M. Surrel F. Le Calvez C. Bezzine S. Singer A. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13203-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) alters adrenal steroid production. In the case of untransfected Y1 cells, treatment with 20 μm indoxam resulted in a 37% reduction in secreted phospholipase activity, which was accompanied by a significant increase in progesterone production (Fig. 5, A and B). This result suggests a role for endogenous sPLA2 in regulating steroid production in Y1 cells. Treatment of Y1-GX cells with increasing concentrations of indoxam resulted in a significant reduction in phospholipase activity and a dose-dependent increase in progesterone secreted into the media (Fig. 5, C and D). A structural analogue of indoxam devoid of inhibitory properties failed to alter the amount of phospholipase activity or progesterone secreted by either Y1 or Y1-GX cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results provide evidence that GX sPLA2 enzymatic activity plays a role in the regulation of adrenal steroidogenesis. As another approach to investigate whether GX sPLA2 negatively regulates steroidogenesis through a mechanism that requires phospholipid hydrolysis, we developed Y1 cells stably expressing an active site mutant of GX sPLA2 whereby a histidine residue in the active site was replaced by glutamine (Y1-H46Q cells) (26Nakashima S.

https://openalex.org/W2131489416,"Background The transcription factor Snail1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process responsible for the acquisition of invasiveness during tumorigenesis. Several transcriptomic studies have reported Snail1-regulated genes in different cell types, many of them involved in cell adhesion. However, only a few studies have used proteomics as a tool for the characterization of proteins mediating EMT. Methodology/Principal Findings We identified by proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF and ESI-linear ion trap mass spectrometry a number of proteins with variable functions whose expression is modulated by Snail1 in SW480-ADH human colon cancer cells. Validation was performed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Snail1 repressed several members of the 14-3-3 family of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine binding proteins and also the expression of the Proliferation-associated protein 2G4 (PA2G4) that was mainly localized at the nuclear Cajal bodies. In contrast, the expression of two proteins involved in RNA processing, the Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) and the Splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ), was higher in Snail1-expressing cells than in controls. The regulation of 14-3-3ε, 14-3-3τ, 14-3-3ζ and PA2G4 by Snail1 was reproduced in HT29 colon cancer cells. In addition, we found an inverse correlation between 14-3-3σ and Snail1 expression in human colorectal tumors. Conclusions/Significance We have identified a set of novel Snail1 target proteins in colon cancer that expand the cellular processes affected by Snail1 and thus its relevance for cell function and phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1967146902,"Background We have previously isolated a thermolabile nuclease specific for double-stranded DNA from industrial processing water of Northern shrimps (Pandalus borealis) and developed an application of the enzyme in removal of contaminating DNA in PCR-related technologies. Methodology/Principal Findings A 43 kDa nuclease with a high specific activity of hydrolysing linear as well as circular forms of DNA was purified from hepatopancreas of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The enzyme displayed a substrate preference that was shifted from exclusively double-stranded DNA in the presence of magnesium to also encompass significant activity against single-stranded DNA when calcium was added. No activity against RNA was detected. Although originating from a cold-environment animal, the shrimp DNase has only minor low-temperature activity. Still, the enzyme was irreversibly inactivated by moderate heating with a half-life of 1 min at 65°C. The purified protein was partly sequenced and derived oligonucleotides were used to prime amplification of the encoding cDNA. This cDNA sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a 404 amino acid protein containing a signal peptide. By sequence similarity the enzyme is predicted to belong to a family of DNA/RNA non-specific nucleases even though this shrimp DNase lacks RNase activity and is highly double-strand specific in some respects. These features are in agreement with those previously established for endonucleases classified as similar to the Kamchatka crab duplex-specific nuclease (Par_DSN). Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the Northern shrimp nuclease resembles the Par_DSN-like nucleases and displays a more distant relationship to the Serratia family of nucleases. Conclusions/Significance The shrimp nuclease contains enzyme activity that may be controlled by temperature or buffer compositions. The double-stranded DNA specificity, as well as the thermolabile feature, strengthens its potential for in vitro applications."

Recently, it has been suggested that NAA may function as a molecular water pump, responsible for the removal of large amounts of water from the human brain. Ovarian tumors typically present as large cystic masses with considerable fluid accumulation.Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, we demonstrated that NAA was present in a high micromolar concentration in oCF of epithelial ovarian tumors (EOTs) of serous histology, sometimes in the same range as found in the extracellular space of the human brain. In contrast, oCF of EOTs with a mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell histological subtype contained a low micromolar concentration of NAA. Serous EOTs have a cellular differentiation pattern which resembles the lining of the fallopian tube and differs from the other histological subtypes. The NAA concentration in two samples of fluid accumulation in the fallopian tube (hydrosalpinx) was in the same ranges as NAA found in oCF of serous EOTs. The NAA concentration in oCF of patients with serous EOTs was mostly 10 to 50 fold higher than their normal serum NAA concentration, whereas in patients with other EOT subtypes, serum and cyst fluid NAA concentration was comparable.The high concentration of NAA in cyst fluid of serous EOTs and low serum concentrations of NAA in these patients, suggest a local production of NAA in serous EOTs. Our findings provide the first identification of NAA concentrations high enough to suggest local production outside the human brain. Our findings contribute to the ongoing research understanding the physiological function of NAA in the human body."

https://openalex.org/W2041090498,"Background Fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane (FLRT) proteins have dual properties as regulators of cell adhesion and potentiators of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mediated signalling. The mechanism by which the latter is achieved is still unknown and is the subject of this investigation. Principal Findings Here we show that FLRT1 is a target for tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by FGFR1 and implicate a non-receptor Src family kinase (SFK). We identify the target tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of FLRT1 and show that these are not direct substrates for Src kinase suggesting that the SFK may exert effects via potentiation of FGFR1 kinase activity. We show that whilst FLRT1 expression results in a ligand-dependent elevation of MAP kinase activity, a mutant version of FLRT1, defective as an FGFR1 kinase substrate (Y3F-FLRT1), has the property of eliciting ligand-independent chronic activation of the MAP kinase pathway which is suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of either FGFR1 or Src kinase. Functional investigation of FGFR1 and FLRT1 signalling in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells reveals that FLRT1 alone acts to induce a multi-polar phenotype whereas the combination of FLRT1 and FGFR activation, or expression of Y3F-FLRT1, acts to induce neurite outgrowth via MAPK activation. Similar results were obtained in a dendrite outgrowth assay in primary hippocampal neurons. We also show that FGFR1, FLRT1 and activated Src are co-localized and this complex is trafficked toward the soma of the cell. The presence of Y3F-FLRT1 rather than FLRT1 resulted in prolonged localization of this complex within the neuritic arbour. Conclusions This study shows that the phosphorylation state of FLRT1, which is itself FGFR1 dependent, may play a critical role in the potentiation of FGFR1 signalling and may also depend on a SFK-dependent phosphorylation mechanism acting via the FGFR. This is consistent with an ‘in vivo’ role for FLRT1 regulation of FGF signalling via SFKs. Furthermore, the phosphorylation-dependent futile cycle mechanism controlling FGFR1 signalling is concurrently crucial for regulation of FLRT1-mediated neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2016056968,"Background Little is known about the reasoning mechanisms used by physicians in decision-making and how this compares to diagnostic clinical practice guidelines. We explored the clinical reasoning process in a real life environment. Method This is a qualitative study evaluating transcriptions of sixteen physicians' reasoning during appointments with patients, clinical discussions between specialists, and personal interviews with physicians affiliated to a hospital in Brazil. Results Four main themes were identified: simple and robust heuristics, extensive use of social environment rationality, attempts to prove diagnostic and therapeutic hypothesis while refuting potential contradictions using positive test strategy, and reaching the saturation point. Physicians constantly attempted to prove their initial hypothesis while trying to refute any contradictions. While social environment rationality was the main factor in the determination of all steps of the clinical reasoning process, factors such as referral letters and number of contradictions associated with the initial hypothesis had influence on physicians' confidence and determination of the threshold to reach a final decision. Discussion Physicians rely on simple heuristics associated with environmental factors. This model allows for robustness, simplicity, and cognitive energy saving. Since this model does not fit into current diagnostic clinical practice guidelines, we make some propositions to help its integration."
https://openalex.org/W2012443859,"Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus (XMRV) is a new human retrovirus associated with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. The causal relationship of XMRV infection to human disease and the mechanism of pathogenicity have not been established. During retrovirus replication, integration of the cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome into the host cell chromosome is an essential step and involves coordinated joining of the two ends of the linear viral DNA into staggered sites on target DNA. Correct integration produces proviruses that are flanked by a short direct repeat, which varies from 4 to 6 bp among the retroviruses but is invariant for each particular retrovirus. Uncoordinated joining of the two viral DNA ends into target DNA can cause insertions, deletions, or other genomic alterations at the integration site. To determine the fidelity of XMRV integration, cells infected with XMRV were clonally expanded and DNA sequences at the viral-host DNA junctions were determined and analyzed. We found that a majority of the provirus ends were correctly processed and flanked by a 4-bp direct repeat of host DNA. A weak consensus sequence was also detected at the XMRV integration sites. We conclude that integration of XMRV DNA involves a coordinated joining of two viral DNA ends that are spaced 4 bp apart on the target DNA and proceeds with high fidelity."

Ca2+ pumping is achieved by means of a reaction cycle (Scheme 1) involving the formation and decomposition of an aspartyl-phosphorylated intermediate coupled to protein conformational changes that facilitate the binding of two Ca2+ ions at cytoplasmically facing high affinity binding sites and subsequent dissociation from luminally facing low affinity sites. Because of extensive efforts that in recent years have involved x-ray crystallography (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), an increasingly detailed picture of the structural changes relating to Ca2+ transport by the Ca2+ pump is steadily emerging. The Ca2+-ATPase consists of 10 membrane-spanning helices (M1 through M10) connecting three major cytoplasmic domains named A (actuator), P (phosphorylation), and N (nucleotide binding) and some smaller luminal loops. Transmembrane helices M4-M6 and M8 contain the residues that coordinate the two Ca2+ ions bound side-by-side in a binding pocket in the Ca2E1 and Ca2E1P states. A key element in the transport cycle is the action of the A domain, which is directly linked to M1-M3 via flexible linkers (see Fig. 1). Thus, occlusion of the Ca2+ ions at the high affinity sites of Ca2E1 is achieved through an ATP-induced ∼30° tilting of the A domain and accompanying partial unfolding and bending of the N-terminal part of M1 (3Toyoshima C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). After transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to Asp351, a further ∼90° rotation of the A domain during the Ca2E1P → Ca2E2P transition propagates to the transmembrane domain, disrupting the high affinity Ca2+ sites and exposing the Ca2+ ions to the lumen. The subsequent release of the Ca2+ ions to the lumen is succeeded by dephosphorylation of the aspartyl phosphate in E2P, catalyzed by the 181TGES phosphatase motif of the A domain (8Clausen J.D.

The M4-residue Glu309, an essential residue for Ca2+ coordination in the occluded binding pocket of the Ca2E1 and Ca2E1P states (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), is exposed to the lumen and associated with a Mg2+ ion in the E2·BeF3− structure (Fig. 1). The E2·BeF3− crystals were formed in the presence of a high concentration of Mg2+ (50 mm) and absence of Ca2+, and it may be speculated that the Mg2+ ion is bound in place of Ca2+ at a luminally facing low affinity Ca2+ site. Ser72 and Glu90 at the luminal ends of transmembrane helices M1 and M2, respectively, are positioned very close to Glu309 in E2·BeF3−, and the Glu90 side-chain carboxylate seems to contribute to coordination of the luminal Mg2+ ion. In the Ca2E1 and Ca2E1P states, on the other hand, Ser72 and Glu90 are 10–20 Å apart from Glu309 and the Ca2+ sites due to translational movements of M1/M2 and M3/M4 relative to each other, and Ser72 and Glu90 instead interact with Lys297 at the luminal end of M4 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1. In the present study we investigated the significance of the above-described luminal interaction networks seen in the various crystal structures of the Ca2+-ATPase. Thus, mutants with alterations to Ser72, Glu90, and Lys297 were compared with wild type Ca2+-ATPase by analyzing the partial reactions in transient and steady-state kinetic measurements. We found that the mutations to Glu90 affect the Ca2+ binding properties profoundly both on the luminal side of the membrane, where Glu90 is situated, as well as on the cytoplasmic side. Furthermore, single-substitution of either Ser72 or Glu90 with arginine gives rise to Ca2+ pumps with a remarkably stable E2P state, compatible with the hypothesis that the positive charge of the arginine side chain interacts directly with the luminal Ca2+ outlet, possibly mimicking Ca2+ and thereby blocking further processing of the phosphoenzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform) inserted into the pMT2 vector (10Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell.

Microsomal vesicles containing either expressed wild type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase were isolated by differential centrifugation (12Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Transport of 45Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles and 45Ca2+ binding at 25 °C were measured by filtration, and the ATPase activity was determined by following the liberation of Pi (15Baginski E.S.

The determination of the phosphorylation level by acid quenching followed by acid SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantification of the radioactivity associated with the Ca2+-ATPase band was carried out using the previously established procedures (14Sorensen T.

Generally, the complete data set (i.e. including all experimental points before averaging) was analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.) with the equations described in the figure legends, giving the lines in the figures and the S.E. shown in the tables. To analyze the phosphorylation time courses in Fig. 2, the kinetic simulation software SimZyme was applied, allowing computation of the phosphorylation overshoot as detailed below and in previous publications (17Sorensen T.L.

The best fit was in this case determined manually by trial and error, comparing the computed time courses with the experimental data points for various choices of rate constants.

https://openalex.org/W2001962375,"Dynein light chain 1 (LC1), a member of the leucine-rich repeat protein family, has been shown to be engaged in controlling flagellar motility in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Trypanosoma brucei via its interaction with the dynein gamma heavy chain. In Plasmodium falciparum, we have identified the LC1 ortholog, designated Pfdlc1. Negative attempts to disrupt the dlc1 gene by reverse genetic approaches in both P. falciparum and P. berghei suggest either its essentiality for parasite survival or the inaccessibility of its locus. Expression studies revealed high levels of DLC1 protein in late trophozoites and schizonts, pointing to an unexpected role of this protein in blood-stage parasites as they do not have flagella. Interactions studies and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PfDLC1 was able to bind to P. falciparum myosin A and actin 1. The PfDLC1 interacting domains present in P. falciparum myosin A and actin 1 were mapped to sequences containing SDIE and/or EEMKT motifs present in the upper 50-kDa segment of the myosin A head domain and in the subdomain IV of actin 1, respectively. Detection of PfDLC1 by fluorescence tagging and immunofluorescence staining using specific antibodies showed a cytoplasmic location similar to actin and immunofluorescence studies showed a co-localization of PfDLC1 and myosin A. Taken together, these findings suggest that PfDLC1 might play an important role in P. falciparum erythrocytic stages by its interaction with myosin A and actin 1, known to be essential for parasite development."

https://openalex.org/W2097198685,"VILIP-1, a member of the neuronal Ca2+ sensor protein family, is able to act as a tumor suppressor in carcinoma cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. In order to study the role of VILIP-1 in skin carcinogenesis we generated transgenic mice overexpressing VILIP-1 in epidermis under the control of the bovine keratin K5 promoter (K5-VILIP-1). We studied the susceptibility of FVB wild type and VILIP-1 transgenic mice to chemically mediated carcinogenesis. After 30 weeks of treatment with a two-stage carcinogenesis protocol, all animals showed numerous skin tumors. Nevertheless, K5-VILIP-1 mice showed decreased squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) multiplicity of ∼49% (p<0.02) with respect to the corresponding SCC multiplicity observed in wild type (WT) mice. In addition, the relative percentage of low-grade cutaneous SCCs grade I (defined by the differentiation pattern according to the Broders grading scale) increased approximately 50% in the K5-VILIP1 mice when compared with SCCs in WT mice. Similar tendency was observed using a complete carcinogenesis protocol for skin carcinogenesis using benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P). Further studies of tumors and primary epidermal keratinocyte cultures showed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) levels and cell proliferation decreased in K5-VILIP-1 mice when compared with their wild counterparts. In addition tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) expression was higher in K5-VILIP-1 keratinocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2017130282,"Mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a large extracellular glycoprotein expressed in musculoskeletal tissues, cause two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. These mutations lead to massive intracellular retention of COMP, chondrocyte death and loss of growth plate chondrocytes that are necessary for linear growth. In contrast, COMP null mice have only minor growth plate abnormalities, normal growth and longevity. This suggests that reducing mutant and wild-type COMP expression in chondrocytes may prevent the toxic cellular phenotype causing the skeletal dysplasias. We tested this hypothesis using RNA interference to reduce steady state levels of COMP mRNA. A panel of shRNAs directed against COMP was tested. One shRNA (3B) reduced endogenous and recombinant COMP mRNA dramatically, regardless of expression levels. The activity of the shRNA against COMP mRNA was maintained for up to 10 weeks. We also demonstrate that this treatment reduced ER stress. Moreover, we show that reducing steady state levels of COMP mRNA alleviates intracellular retention of other extracellular matrix proteins associated with the pseudoachondroplasia cellular pathology. These findings are a proof of principle and the foundation for the development of a therapeutic intervention based on reduction of COMP expression."
