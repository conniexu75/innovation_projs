https://openalex.org/W3011660632,"Cancer drivers converge on NOTCH Cancer genome–sequencing projects have emphasized the handful of genes mutated at high frequency in patients. Less attention has been directed to the hundreds of genes mutated in only a few patients—the so-called “long tail” mutations. Although rare, these mutations may nonetheless inform patient care. Loganathan et al. developed a reverse genetic CRISPR screen that allowed them to functionally assess in mice nearly 500 long tail gene mutations that occur in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). They identified 15 tumor-suppressor genes with activities that converged on the NOTCH signaling pathway. Given that NOTCH itself is mutated at high frequency in HNSCC, these results suggest that the growth of these tumors is largely driven by NOTCH inactivation. Science , this issue p. 1264"

Genov et al. now report a potentially general strategy to invert the charges in this paradigm. Because intrinsically negative metal catalysts are comparatively rare, the authors appended a sulfonate group to the common bipyridyl ligand. Iridium complexes of this ligand paired with chiral positive ions could borylate just one of two aryl rings appended to carbon or phosphorus centers with high enantioselectivity.

We found that most disseminated CRC cells in circulation were Lgr5− and formed distant metastases in which Lgr5+ CSCs appeared. This plasticity occurred independently of stemness-inducing microenvironmental factors and was indispensable for outgrowth, but not establishment, of metastases.

Epithelial tissues are hierarchically organized: a small pool of replicative immortal and self-renewing stem cells (SCs) give rise to a large population of more specialized cells that are replicative mortal (Beck and Blanpain, 2013Beck B. Blanpain C. Unravelling cancer stem cell potential.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). During development, SCs drive long-term growth, while during adult life they sustain tissues by driving turnover of short-lived specialized cells (Donati and Watt, 2015Donati G. Watt F.M.

Indeed, cell-sorting and transplantation experiments showed that only a small pool of cancer cells, often referred to as cancer SCs (CSCs), have the ability to grow tumors in mice (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M.

More recently, lineage-tracing experiments provided proof of the existence of CSCs in unperturbed tumors, including glioblastoma (Chen et al., 2012Chen J. Li Y. Yu T.S. McKay R.M. Burns D.K.

In addition to the role in tumor growth and homeostasis, CSCs are thought to be important for metastasis. The essential role of CSCs in the metastatic process is reinforced by studies showing that metastasizing cells acquire SC properties, for example, through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Guo et al., 2012Guo W.

Indeed, selective depletion of CSCs in primary tumors protects from the appearance of distant metastases (de Sousa e Melo et al., 2017de Sousa e Melo F. Kurtova A.V. Harnoss J.M. Kljavin N. Hoeck J.D. Hung J. Anderson J.E. Storm E.E. Modrusan Z.

The role of CSCs in metastasis would be particularly crucial if the tumor cell hierarchy is a rigid one-way route, from SCs to more specialized cells (Meacham and Morrison, 2013Meacham C.E. Morrison S.J. Tumour heterogeneity and cancer cell plasticity.Nature. 2013; 501: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). However, epithelial hierarchical organization can be dynamic (Medema, 2013Medema J.P. Cancer stem cells: the challenges ahead.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For example, in healthy tissues, upon damage or selective ablation of the SC population, more specialized cells can acquire SC traits (Ritsma et al., 2014Ritsma L. Ellenbroek S.I.J. Zomer A. Snippert H.J. de Sauvage F.J. Simons B.D. Clevers H. van Rheenen J.

Whether cellular plasticity also plays an important role in metastasis is unknown. In this study, we dissect the different steps of the metastatic cascade (cell migration, intravasation, metastatic seeding, and outgrowth) and uncover the roles of CSCs, non-CSCs, and cellular plasticity in metastasis. CRC models provide a unique opportunity to clarify the role of CSCs and non-CSCs in the metastatic process, because hierarchical organization is maintained during disease progression and functional CSCs are marked by Lgr5 expression (Cortina et al., 2017Cortina C.

Upon injection of tamoxifen, the entire intestinal tract of these mice becomes tumorigenic, and these animals reach the humane endpoint before metastases are formed. Just before the humane endpoint, we isolated the tumorigenic colons of these mice and established primary CRC organoids that consist of cancer cells expressing RFP-Confetti and of CSCs that additionally express Lgr5-driven eGFP and diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) (referred as CRC Lgr5eGFP organoids; Figures S1A and S1B). As previously described, orthotopic transplantation of these murine CRC organoids led to the formation of a single colorectal primary tumor that spontaneously metastasizes to liver and lungs (Figures S1C–S1E) (Fumagalli et al., 2017Fumagalli A.

In line with previous findings (Cortina et al., 2017Cortina C. Turon G. Stork D. Hernando-Momblona X. Sevillano M. Aguilera M. Tosi S. Merlos-Suárez A. Stephan-Otto Attolini C. Sancho E. Batlle E.

Visualization and targeting of LGR5+ human colon cancer stem cells.Nature. 2017; 545: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), we found that Lgr5 is a good marker of the functional SCs both in organoids and tumors, because selective ablation of the Lgr5+ CSCs by diphtheria toxin (DT) (Figures S1F–S1I) caused organoids to collapse and prevented tumor growth and metastasis (Figures 1B–1D). Next, we developed a flow cytometry strategy to isolate Lgr5+ CSCs and Lgr5− cancer cells from both organoids and primary tumors (Figures S1J–S1M). Analysis of DT-treated CRC Lgr5eGFP organoids, in which Lgr5+ CSCs are selectively depleted, and post-sort confocal microscopy on untreated CRC Lgr5eGFP organoids confirmed that our gating strategy allowed to reliably isolate Lgr5+ and Lgr5− cancer cells (Figures S1N and S1O). Clonogenic assays confirmed isolation of functional Lgr5+ CSCs, as these cells were twice as clonogenic as Lgr5− cancer cells (Figure 1E). Moreover, isolated Lgr5+ CSCs showed higher expression of known intestinal SC markers and lower expression of differentiated markers than the Lgr5− cancer cells (Figure 1F) (de Sousa e Melo et al., 2017de Sousa e Melo F. Kurtova A.V. Harnoss J.M. Kljavin N. Hoeck J.D. Hung J. Anderson J.E. Storm E.E. Modrusan Z.

Visualization and targeting of LGR5+ human colon cancer stem cells.Nature. 2017; 545: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Of note, we found a very significant overlap in significantly differentially expressed genes between Lgr5+ and Lgr5− cells from organoids and orthotopic primary tumors (hypergeometric test p value < 10−100), indicating that Lgr5+ and Lgr5− cancer cells maintain their specific cellular identity when analyzed either in vitro or in vivo. Using the developed orthotopic transplantation mouse model, we addressed whether Lgr5+ CSCs and Lgr5− cancer cells have differential metastatic behavior. In order to metastasize, cancer cells first need to acquire traits that enable them to leave the primary tumor (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43102) Google Scholar). To test which cancer cells escape from the primary site, we filmed the behavior of Lgr5+ CSCs and Lgr5− cancer cells in vivo using multiphoton microscopy (Figure 2; Videos S1, S2, S3, and S4). Consistent with other tumor models (Beerling et al., 2016Beerling E. Seinstra D. de Wit E. Kester L. van der Velden D. Maynard C. Schäfer R. van Diest P.

Analysis of the migratory cells (i.e., cells that displaced more than half a cell diameter in 4 h; Figures 2D and 2E) revealed that Lgr5+ CSCs and Lgr5− cancer cells mainly escaped as single cells and less frequently as cell clusters (Figure 2F). Moreover, Lgr5− cancer cells might have a slightly higher displacement and velocity than Lgr5+ CSCs (Figures 2G and 2H; Figures S2B and S2C). Surprisingly, of the 1,064 migratory cells that escaped from the primary tumors, the majority were Lgr5− (Figures 2E and 2I; 90.3% ± 2.8%, p < 0.0001), suggesting that most of the escaping cells are in a more differentiated state. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/09d9f40e-d88d-4625-9d76-5e94b082e877/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

To determine whether both Lgr5+ CSCs and Lgr5− cancer cells were able to enter the blood circulation, we drew blood from the portal vein of mice bearing metastatic CRC to analyze CTCs directly draining from the primary tumor using flow cytometry (Figure 3A; Figure S3A). In all animals (n = 4) we detected only Lgr5− circulating cancer cells (Figure 3B; Figure S3B). We extended the analysis by collecting systemic oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle of the heart of a second batch of metastatic CRC mice to analyze CTCs coming from metastases and observed that also in this case the vast majority of circulating cancer cells were Lgr5− (98.4% ± 0.6%, n = 5; Figures S3C–S3E). Importantly, single-cell mRNA sequencing validated that the CTCs displayed an expression profile closely related to Lgr5− cancer cells and did not show enriched expression of other CSC marker genes, such as Prom1 (i.e., CD133), CD44, Aldh1a, and Bmi1 (Figure 3C; Figures S3F and S3G). Combined these data suggest that the disseminating population of cancer cells is dominated by Lgr5− cancer cells. Indeed, when we analyzed the livers of these mice, all single-cell metastases were Lgr5− (n = 6 mice; Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S3H). To understand whether escaping Lgr5− cancer cells could initiate metastatic lesions, we analyzed larger metastases in the livers. Although all single-cell and the majority of smaller metastases were devoid of Lgr5+ CSCs, all larger metastases (lesions larger than 80 μm in diameter) contained a population of Lgr5+ CSCs (Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S3H). To test whether Lgr5− cancer cells could give rise to full-blown metastatic lesions, we monitored the real-time outgrowth of Lgr5− cancer cells seeding in the liver, by tracking the same metastatic lesions with repeated multi-day intravital imaging through an abdominal imaging window (Figure 3F). In all small lesions initially containing only Lgr5− cancer cells, we observed that some of the Lgr5− tumor cells underwent plasticity and acquired Lgr5eGFP expression over time (Figure 3F). Next, we neutralized this plasticity by ablating newly formed Lgr5+ CSCs in early metastatic lesions and observed by intravital imaging that metastasis composed by only Lgr5− cancer cells stopped growing over time and ultimately regressed (Figures 3G and 3H; Figure S3I). Indeed, after 4 weeks of DT treatment, no metastases could be observed (Figures 3I and 3J). Combined this shows that the appearance of Lgr5+ CSCs is indispensable for the outgrowth of metastases founded by Lgr5− cancer cells. To compare the efficiency of Lgr5− cancer cells and Lgr5+ CSCs to initiate metastases, we injected equal amounts of sorted Lgr5+ CSCs and Lgr5− cancer cells into the mesenteric vein, which are transported through the portal vein to the liver. Four weeks later we found that, in addition to Lgr5+ CSCs, Lgr5− cancer cells were able to form metastases that displayed similar morphology, though with slightly lower efficiency (Figures 3K–3O; Figures S3J and S3K; n = 4 mice). Given that most disseminating cells were Lgr5− and had the ability to initiate metastatic growth, our data reveal that the majority of metastases are seeded by Lgr5− cancer cells. Because growth of metastases seeded by Lgr5− cancer cells requires cells to become Lgr5+, we next addressed what is driving this plasticity. It has been suggested that cancer cells can acquire SC properties when they are surrounded by a SC niche, such as fibroblasts and immune cells, that provides stemness-inducing signals (Sato and Clevers, 2013Sato T. Clevers H. Growing self-organizing mini-guts from a single intestinal stem cell: mechanism and applications.Science. 2013; 340: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To test whether SC-inducing microenvironmental factors are deterministic for cancer cell plasticity, we set up an organoid-forming assay. In these pure epithelial culture systems, the three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment was mimicked by Basement Membrane Extract (BME) and medium providing all the essential SC-inducing factors present in the intestinal SC niche, such as Wnt, R-spondin, and EGF (Sato and Clevers, 2013Sato T. Clevers H. Growing self-organizing mini-guts from a single intestinal stem cell: mechanism and applications.Science. 2013; 340: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). By simply removing one or more of these niche factors, it is possible to test whether intestinal epithelial cells and their dynamics are dependent on essential microenvironmental signals (Drost et al., 2015Drost J. van Jaarsveld R.H. Ponsioen B. Zimberlin C. van Boxtel R. Buijs A. Sachs N. Overmeer R.M. Offerhaus G.J.

We isolated single Lgr5− circulating cancer cells from the blood and tested whether they could be cultured in medium without any SC-inducing factors. Interestingly, in this minimal medium we were able to grow organoids from Lgr5− circulating cancer cells, and also here we observed the appearance of Lgr5+ CSCs over time (Figures 4A and 4B ). Moreover, these Lgr5+ cancer cells were functional SCs, as selective ablation of these cells by acute or chronic DT treatment in both organoid-derived and primary tumor-derived cells abolished organoid outgrowth (Figures 4C; Figures S4A–S4F). To exclude that residual growth factors in the BME matrix could trigger cancer cell plasticity in our culture system, we confirmed these data in an engineered 3D matrix consisting of growth factor-free synthetic hydrogel (Figures 4D and 4E). Finally, to test whether plasticity can be enhanced by microenvironmental factors that are released by cancer associated fibroblasts, we cultured Lgr5− cells in minimal medium supplemented with HGF, FGF, IL4, and IL13 (Chen et al., 2018Chen J.

https://openalex.org/W3010714645,"Deadenylate or activate? When cells are quiescent, they undergo reversible cell cycle arrest and evince low basal metabolism. Naïve T cells are normally quiescent until they recognize cognate antigens through T cell receptor–costimulatory molecule signaling. T cell quiescence appears to be an active process, but the mechanistic details are poorly understood. Hwang et al. report that the transcription factors BTG1 and BTG2 are selectively expressed in quiescent T cells. In mice, T cells conditionally knocked out for both factors showed enhanced proliferation and a lowered threshold of activation both in vitro and in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Deficiency of BTG1 and BTG2 resulted in increases in global messenger RNA half-life, suggesting that messenger RNA deadenylation and degradation are important processes for maintaining T cell quiescence.

https://openalex.org/W3011830677,"Summary The balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E and I) synapses is thought to be critical for information processing in neural circuits. However, little is known about the spatial principles of E and I synaptic organization across the entire dendritic tree of mammalian neurons. We developed a new open-source reconstruction platform for mapping the size and spatial distribution of E and I synapses received by individual genetically-labeled layer 2/3 (L2/3) cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) in vivo. We mapped over 90,000 E and I synapses across twelve L2/3 PNs and uncovered structured organization of E and I synapses across dendritic domains as well as within individual dendritic segments. Despite significant domain-specific variation in the absolute density of E and I synapses, their ratio is strikingly balanced locally across dendritic segments. Computational modeling indicates that this spatially precise E/I balance dampens dendritic voltage fluctuations and strongly impacts neuronal firing output."
https://openalex.org/W3011420006,"Background Codeine, a 3-methylmorphine, and other related opioids have been implicated in androgen suppression, although the associated mechanisms remain unclear. Aim Therefore, the objective of the current study was to elucidate the in vivo molecular mechanisms underlying codeine-induced androgen suppression. Methods This study made use of twenty-one healthy male rabbits, distributed into three groups randomly, control and codeine-treated groups. The control had 1ml of normal saline daily p.o. The codeine-treated groups received either 4mg/kg b.w of codeine or 10mg/kg b.w of codeine p.o. for six weeks. Reproductive hormonal profile, testicular weight, testicular enzymes, oxidative and inflammatory parameters, testicular DNA fragmentation, histological examination and apoptosis marker were evaluated to examine the effects of codeine use. Key findings Oral administration of codeine resulted in testicular atrophy and alterations in testicular histomorphology, elevated testicular enzymes, and suppression of circulatory and intra-testicular testosterone. These changes were associated with a marked rise in oxidative markers and decline in the activities of testicular enzymatic antioxidants, as well as oxidative DNA damage, inflammatory response, testicular DNA fragmentation, and caspase-dependent apoptosis (p<0.05). Significance In conclusion, chronic codeine use resulted in testicular degeneration and testosterone suppression, which is attributable to TNF-α/nitric oxide-/oxidative stress-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic testicular cell death and loss of testicular function."
https://openalex.org/W3012266030,"The social brain hypothesis approximates the total number of social relationships we are able to maintain at 150. Similar cognitive constraints emerge in several aspects of our daily life, from our mobility to the way we communicate, and might even affect the way we consume information online. Indeed, despite the unprecedented amount of information we can access online, our attention span still remains limited. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that online users are more likely to ignore dissenting information, choosing instead to interact with information adhering to their own point of view. In this paper, we quantitatively analyse users’ attention economy in news consumption on social media by analysing 14 million users interacting with 583 news outlets (pages) on Facebook over a time span of six years. In particular, we explore how users distribute their activity across news pages and topics. On the one hand, we find that, independently of their activity, users show a tendency to follow a very limited number of pages. On the other hand, users tend to interact with almost all the topics presented by their favoured pages. Finally, we introduce a taxonomy accounting for users’ behaviour to distinguish between patterns of selective exposure and interest. Our findings suggest that segregation of users in echo chambers might be an emerging effect of users’ activity on social media and that selective exposure—i.e. the tendency of users to consume information adhering to their preferred narratives—could be a major driver in their consumption patterns."

In this current study, cellular samples of a cohort of NAFLD patients (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC): n = 27, liver samples: n = 15) and healthy individuals (PBMC: n = 26, liver samples: n = 3) were analyzed using 16-color flow cytometry, and the frequency and phenotype of 23 immune cell subtypes was assessed. PBMC of NAFLD patients showed decreased frequencies of total CD3+, CD8+ T cells, CD56dim NK cells and MAIT cells, but elevated frequencies of CD4+ T cells and Th2 cells compared to healthy controls. Intrahepatic lymphocytes (IHL) of NAFLD patients showed decreased frequencies of total T cells, total CD8+ T cells, Vd2+γδ T cells, and CD56bright NK cells, but elevated frequencies of Vδ2-γδ T cells and CD56dim NK cells compared to healthy controls. The activating receptor NKG2D was significantly less frequently expressed among iNKT cells, total NK cells and CD56dim NK cells of PBMC of NAFLD patients compared to healthy controls. More strikingly, hepatic fibrosis as measured by fibroscan elastography negatively correlated with the intrahepatic frequency of total NK cells (r2 = 0,3737, p = 0,02). Hepatic steatosis as measured by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value negatively correlated with the frequency of circulating NKG2D+ iNKT cells (r2 = 0,3365, p = 0,0047). Our data provide an overview of the circulating and intrahepatic immune cell composition of NAFLD patients, and point towards a potential role of NK cells and iNKT cells for the regulation of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3012448492,"Animals have ubiquitous associations with microorganisms, but microbial community composition and population dynamics can vary depending upon many environmental factors, including diet. The bacterial communities present in caterpillar (Lepidoptera) guts are highly variable, even among individuals of a species. Across lepidopteran species, it is unclear if the variation in their gut bacterial communities is due to ingested bacteria with diets or responses of gut bacteria to their diet. In this study, we aimed to understand whether bacteria establish and persist in the lepidopteran gut or just pass through the gut with food. We also examined whether bacterial establishment in lepidopteran guts depended on diet. We conducted a series of experiments using axenic and gnotobiotic insect rearing methods to address these objectives. We found that bacteria were established and maintained without replacement through the larval instars of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea). Gut bacterial titers increased when larvae were fed gamma-irradiated corn leaves but decreased when fed a wheat germ artificial diet. However, bacterial titers of larvae fed on a pinto bean artificial diet were similar to those consuming intact plants. We also observed that microbial titers of fall armyworm and other folivorous larvae were positively related to the host body size throughout larval development. Collectively, these results suggest that the populations of bacteria present in caterpillar guts are not simply a transient community passing through the system, but rather are a dynamic component of the caterpillar gut. Sensitivity of bacterial populations to the type of diet fed to lepidopterans suggests that not all diets are equally useful for reducing variance in community structure and interpreting insect-microbe interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3011943652,"Blunted muscle hypertrophy and impaired regeneration with aging have been partly attributed to satellite cell (SC) dysfunction. However, true muscle regeneration has not yet been studied in elderly individuals. To investigate this, muscle injury was induced by 200 electrically stimulated (ES) eccentric contractions of the vastus lateralis (VL) of one leg in seven young (20-31 years) and 19 elderly men (60-73 years). This was followed by 13 weeks of resistance training (RT) for both legs to investigate the capacity for hypertrophy. Muscle biopsies were collected Pre- and Post-RT, and 9 days after ES, for immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Hypertrophy was assessed by MRI, DEXA, and immunohistochemistry. Overall, surprisingly comparable responses were observed between the young and elderly. Nine days after ES, Pax7+ SC number had doubled (P < .05), alongside necrosis and substantial changes in expression of genes related to matrix, myogenesis, and innervation (P < .05). Post-RT, VL cross-sectional area had increased in both legs (~15%, P < .05) and SCs/type II fiber had increased ~2-4 times more with ES+RT vs RT alone (P < .001). Together these novel findings demonstrate youthful regeneration and hypertrophy responses in human elderly muscle. Furthermore, boosting SC availability in healthy elderly men does not enhance the subsequent muscle hypertrophy response to RT."
https://openalex.org/W3012325810,"Retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) is elevated in serum and adipose tissue (AT) in obesity-induced insulin resistance and correlates inversely with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. But its role in insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis, free fatty acids (FFA), and endogenous glucose production (EGP) in humans is unknown. RBP4 mRNA or protein levels were higher in liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in morbidly obese subjects undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery compared to lean controls undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RBP4 mRNA expression in SAT correlated with the expression of several macrophage and other inflammation markers. Serum RBP4 levels correlated inversely with glucose disposal and insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis, FFA, and EGP. Mechanistically, RBP4 treatment of human adipocytes in vitro directly stimulated basal lipolysis. Treatment of adipocytes with conditioned media from RBP4-activated macrophages markedly increased basal lipolysis and impaired insulin-mediated lipolysis suppression. RBP4 treatment of macrophages increased TNFα production. These data suggest that elevated serum or adipose tissue RBP4 levels in morbidly obese subjects may cause hepatic and systemic insulin resistance by stimulating basal lipolysis and by activating macrophages in adipose tissue, resulting in release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that impair lipolysis suppression. While we have demonstrated this mechanism in human adipocytes in vitro, and correlations from our flux studies in humans strongly support this, further studies are needed to determine whether this mechanism explains RBP4-induced insulin resistance in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3011070962,"Antimicrobial Resistance is a global crisis that veterinarians contribute to through their use of antimicrobials in animals. Antimicrobial stewardship has been shown to be an effective means to reduce antimicrobial resistance in hospital environments. Effective monitoring of antimicrobial usage patterns is an essential part of antimicrobial stewardship and is critical in reducing the development of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study is to describe how frequently antimicrobials were used in veterinary consultations and identify the most frequently used antimicrobials. Using VetCompass Australia, Natural Language Processing techniques, and the Australian Strategic Technical Advisory Group’s (ASTAG) Rating system to classify the importance of antimicrobials, descriptive analysis was performed on the antimicrobials prescribed in consultations from 137 companion animal veterinary clinics in Australia between 2013 and 2017 (inclusive). Of the 4,400,519 consultations downloaded there were 595,089 consultations where antimicrobials were prescribed to dogs or cats. Antimicrobials were dispensed in 145 of every 1000 canine consultations; and 38 per 1000 consultations involved high importance rated antimicrobials. Similarly with cats, 108 per 1000 consultations had antimicrobials dispensed, and in 47 per 1000 consultations an antimicrobial of high importance rating was administered. The most common antimicrobials given to cats and dogs were cefovecin and amoxycillin clavulanate, respectively. The most common topical antimicrobial and high-rated topical antimicrobial given to dogs and cats was polymyxin B. This study provides a descriptive analysis of the antimicrobial usage patterns in Australia using methods that can be automated to inform antimicrobial use surveillance programs and promote antimicrobial stewardship."

To measure the level of social support, one needs an appropriate tool to produce valid and reliable results; therefore, we aimed to measure the invariance across gender groups, and analyze the construct validity and reliability of the Indonesian version of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), a social support measurement tool which was theoretically constructed and has been well validated in many countries with various cultures and backgrounds.A school-based assessment was conducted in junior and senior high schools in a post-disaster setting in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. We analyzed 299 adolescent survivors of a volcanic eruption, aged 12~18 years who completed a 12-item Indonesian version of the MSPSS.The factorial validity confirmed the three-factor structure of the scale (Family, Friends, and Significant Others) which met all of the criteria of parameter indices and provided evidence of high internal consistency reliability. The three-level measurement of invariance, which consisted of configural, metric, and scalar invariance, also performed very well across gender groups with our data and corresponded to the recommended parameters. Our composite reliability values were all fine (>0.7) and indicated that the items in the same construct were strongly correlated and reliable.The Indonesian version of the MSPSS was shown to be a valid, reliable, theoretically constructed, and applicable instrument for adolescent disaster survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3010654465,"The expansion of forest plantations is cause for concern because of their environmental effects, and the loss of native forests and agricultural land. Our goal was to quantify the increase in pine plantation, and concomitant loss of native forests, in central Chile since ca. 1960, and to identify in which settings native forests were lost most rapidly. We analyzed aerial photographs from 1955 and 1961, Landsat images from 1975 and 1998, and Google Earth high-resolution satellite images from 2014. To ensure high classification accuracy, we visually interpreted images for a systematic 3-km grid and assigned each point as either 'pine plantation', 'native forest', 'agricultural-livestock lands', or 'other'. We also calculated latitude, longitude, slope, Euclidean distance to the nearest road and to the nearest pulp mill, and the frequency of land use surrounding each point as potential variables to explain observed land use changes. Pine plantations expansion started even before 1960, when 12% of all points were already pine plantations, was particularly rapid from 1975 (18% of sample points) to 1998 (38%), and stabilized thereafter (37% by 2014). From 1975 to 1998 alone, 40% of native forests were replaced by pine plantations, and agricultural-livestock lands declined by 0.7%, 0.9%, 1% per year before 1975, from 1975 to 1998, and after 1998 respectively. Native forests that were surrounded by pine plantations, were most likely to be converted to plantations, and from 1960 to 1975, also native forests near pulp mills. The probability of change from agricultural-livestock lands to pine plantations was mainly influenced by slope, with most agricultural-livestock lands remaining in areas with low slopes."
https://openalex.org/W3011763970,"Cancer metastasis and secondary tumor initiation largely depend on circulating tumor cell (CTC) and vascular endothelial cell (EC) interactions by incompletely understood mechanisms. Endothelial glycocalyx (GCX) dysfunction may play a significant role in this process. GCX structure depends on vascular flow patterns, which are irregular in tumor environments. This work presents evidence that disturbed flow (DF) induces GCX degradation, leading to CTC homing to the endothelium, a first step in secondary tumor formation. A 2-fold greater attachment of CTCs to human ECs was found to occur under DF conditions, compared to uniform flow (UF) conditions. These results corresponded to an approximately 50% decrease in wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-labeled components of the GCX under DF conditions, vs UF conditions, with undifferentiated levels of CTC-recruiting E-selectin under DF vs UF conditions. Confirming the role of the GCX, neuraminidase induced the degradation of WGA-labeled GCX under UF cell culture conditions or in Balb/C mice and led to an over 2-fold increase in CTC attachment to ECs or Balb/C mouse lungs, respectively, compared to untreated conditions. These experiments confirm that flow-induced GCX degradation can enable metastatic CTC arrest. This work, therefore, provides new insight into pathways of secondary tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W3012061239,"Biochanin A, an isoflavone present in the pasture legume red clover (Trifloium pratense L.), alters fermentation in the rumen of cattle and other ruminants. Biochanin A inhibits hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria and promotes cellulolytic bacteria and fiber catalysis in vitro and ex vivo. Consequently, biochanin A supplementation improves weight gain in grazing steers. Red clover contains biologically active isoflavones that may act synergistically. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the effect of two levels of red clover hay on growth performance and the microbial community in growing steers grazing mixed grass pastures. A grazing experiment was conducted over 2 early growing seasons (2016 and 2017) with 36 cross-bred steers and twelve rumen-fistulated, growing Holstein steers for evaluation of average daily gain and rumen microbiota, respectively. Steers were blocked by body weight and assigned to pastures with one of four treatments: 1) pasture only, 2) pasture + dry distillers’ grains (DDG), 3) pasture + DDG + low level of red clover hay (~15% red clover diet), or 4) pasture + DDG + high level of red clover hay (~30% red clover diet). DDG were added to treatments to meet protein requirements and to balance total protein supplementation between treatments. All supplementation strategies (DDG ± red clover hay) increased average daily gains in comparison to pasture-only controls (P < 0.05), with a low level of red clover supplementation being the most effective (+0.17 kg d-1 > DDG only controls; P < 0.05). Similarly, hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria inhibition (10–100-fold; P < 0.05), fiber catalysis (+10–25%; P < 0.05) and short chain fatty acid concentrations were greatest with the low red clover supplement (+~25%; P < 0.05). These results provide evidence that lower levels or red clover supplementation may be optimal for maximizing overall microbial community function and animal performance in grazing steers."
https://openalex.org/W3011663030,"Background Cancer is a growing concern in Ethiopia. Though communication is essential for the treatment process, few studies have looked at communication in Ethiopian cancer care. Due to the large number of patients and scarcity of resources, it is vital to understand how to manage consultations in order to effectively help as many patients as possible in this challenging work environment. Thus, research is needed to analyze and understand the communicative challenges experienced by physicians, patients, and family caregivers, in order to successfully handle patient care in practice. Objective We explore communication in Ethiopian cancer care and present the main challenges faced by physicians, patients, and family caregivers. Methods This explorative qualitative study was conducted at the Oncology Department of the Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Specialized Teaching Hospital (TASH) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A triangulation of data collection methods was used: 91 audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews and 21 video-recordings of authentic interactions during hospital rounds. The aim was to obtain as complete a picture as possible of communication from the perspectives of physicians, patients, and family caregivers. The interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis and the identified themes were supported by excerpts from the transcribed recordings. Results Eight themes emerged from the data. Workload and time pressure, in combination with restricted space for privacy, limited the possibilities for physicians to deliver detailed information and provide emotional support. Furthermore, patient literacy levels, in combination with no or little cancer awareness, financial problems, reliance on traditional and religious treatments, the stigma of cancer, and a fatalistic attitude, resulted in delays in patients seeking care and participating in positive health behaviors, and, subsequently, often resulted in an unwillingness to openly discuss problems with physicians and adhere to treatment. The study also illustrates the paramount role of family in physician-patient communication in Ethiopia. Though family caregivers provide a valuable interpreting support when patients have limited language skills, they can also prevent patients from sharing information with physicians. Another important finding is that family caregivers were often responsible for making decisions about treatment and avoided telling patients about a poor prognosis, believing that conveying bad news may upset them. All of these themes have important implications for the role of ethically acceptable communication in patient-centered care. Conclusions This study has identified a number of serious challenges for successful and ethically acceptable health communication in Ethiopian cancer care. The study contributes to our understanding of the complexity around the role of family, combined with patients’ dependency on family members for communication, support, and access to care, which creates particular ethical dilemmas for the medical staff. The questions raised by this study concern how to organize consultations to achieve patient-centered health communication, while maintaining a constructive alliance with the family and not jeopardizing the patient’s continued access to care. The integration of communication training for medical students in Ethiopia, with a focus on ethical guidelines for family-centered patient consultation suitable for these circumstances, would be an essential step."
https://openalex.org/W3011339880,"Circadian typology has been related to several mental health aspects such as resilience, perceived well-being, emotional intelligence and psychological symptoms and disorders. However, the relationship between circadian typology and emotion regulation, metacognitions and assertiveness, which constitute core constructs related to psychological well-being and psychopathology, remain unexplored. This study aims to analyze whether circadian typology is related with those three constructs, considering the possible influence of sex. 2283 participants (833 women), aged 18-60 years (30.37 ± 9.26 years), completed the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire 30, and the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Main effects were observed between circadian typology and cognitive reappraisal, metacognitions, negative beliefs of uncontrollability and danger, cognitive confidence, cognitive self-consciousness, and assertiveness (F(2,2276) > 4.80, p < 0.009, ηp2 > 0.004, in all cases). Morning-type participants scored lower than evening-type in general metacognitive beliefs, negative beliefs of uncontrollability and danger, cognitive confidence, and cognitive self-consciousness, and higher than evening-type in cognitive reappraisal and assertiveness, while neither-type exhibited intermediate scores (p < 0.033 in all cases). According to the results, evening-type individuals might display a higher tendency to support maladaptive beliefs about thinking itself as well as a lesser tendency to reappraise a potentially emotion eliciting situations in order to modify its meaning and its emotional impact and to exert their rights respectfully. This new evidence improves the understanding of the relationships between circadian typology and psychological factors related to psychological well-being and psychopathology. Results implications for the onset and maintenance of psychological problems are discussed. Although future longitudinal studies are needed, results emphasize evening-type as a risk factor for the development of psychological disturbances and morning-type as a protective factor against those."
https://openalex.org/W3011690802,"Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is an ecologically and economically important species. Here, we assessed the diversity of 78 accessions cultivated in northern China using 8 agronomic characteristics, oil traits (including oil content and fatty acid composition) in seeds and fruit pulp, and SSR markers at 23 loci. The 78 accessions included 52 from ssp. mongolica, 6 from ssp. sinensis, and 20 hybrids. To assess the phenotypic diversity of these accessions, 8 agronomic fruit traits were recorded and analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The first two PCs accounted for approximately 78% of the variation among accessions. The oil contents were higher in pulp (3.46–38.56%) than in seeds (3.88–8.82%), especially in ssp. mongolica accessions. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio was slightly lower in the seed oil of hybrids (76.06%) than that of in ssp. mongolica (77.66%) and higher than that of in ssp. sinensis (72.22%). The monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) ratio in the pulp oil of ssp. sinensis (57.00%) was highest, and that in ssp. mongolica (51.00%) was equal to the ratio in the hybrids (51.20%). Using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), we examined the correlation between agronomic traits and oil characteristics in pulp and seeds. Oil traits in pulp from different origins were correlated with morphological groupings (r = 0.8725, p = 0.0000). To assess the genotypic diversity, 23 SSR markers (including 17 loci previously reported) were used among the 78 accessions with 59 polymorphic amplified fragments obtained and an average PIC value of 0.2845. All accessions were classified into two groups based on the UPGMA method. The accessions of ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica were genetically distant. The hybrid accessions were close to ssp. mongolica accessions. The 8 agronomic traits, oil characteristics in seed and pulp oils, and 23 SSR markers successfully distinguished the 78 accessions. These results will be valuable for cultivar identification and genetic diversity analysis in cultivated sea buckthorn."

Half the participants (50.2%) had poor knowledge level in relation to symptoms and complications of diabetes. Multivariable linear regression showed older age was associated with poor knowledge (®: -1.893, 95% CI-3.754; -0.031) and higher income was associated with self-management practice (®: 3.434, 95% CI 0.797; 6.070).

PAC in dogs is infrequent, difficult to differentiate from TCC and usually characterized by poor prognosis, enhancing the value of the few available cell lines. However, as cell lines adapt to culturing conditions, a thorough characterization, ideally compared to original tissue, is indispensable. Herein, six canine PAC cell lines and three TCC cell lines were profiled by immunophenotype in comparison to respective original tumor tissues. Three of the six PAC cell lines were derived from primary tumor and metastases of the same patient. Further, two of the three TCC cell lines were derived from TCCs invading into or originating from the prostate. Cell biologic parameters as doubling times and chemoresistances to commonly used drugs in cancer treatment (doxorubicin, carboplatin and meloxicam) were assessed. All cell lines were immunohistochemically close to the respective original tissue. Compared to primary tumor cell lines, metastasis-derived cell lines were more chemoresistant to doxorubicin, but equally susceptive to carboplatin treatment. Two cell lines were multiresistant. COX-2 enzyme activity was demonstrated in all cell lines. However, meloxicam inhibited prostaglandin E2 production in only seven of nine cell lines and did neither influence metabolic activity, nor proliferation. The characterized nine cell lines represent excellent tools to investigate PAC as well as TCC in prostate and urinary bladder of the dog. Furthermore, the profiled paired cell lines from PAC primary tumor and metastasis provide the unique opportunity to investigate metastasis-associated changes PAC cells undergo in tumor progression. The combination of nine differently chemoresistant PAC and TCC cell lines resembles the heterogeneity of canine lower urinary tract cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3012460963,"Aim The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility and diagnostic contribution of protein profiling using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry applied to saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and dental plaque from periodontitis and healthy subjects. We hypothesized that rapid routine and blinded MALDI-TOF analysis could accurately classify these three types of samples according to periodontal state. Materials and methods Unstimulated saliva, GCF and dental plaque, collected from periodontitis subjects and healthy controls, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Based on the differentially expressed peaks between the two groups, diagnostic decision trees were built for each sample. Results Among 141 patients (67 periodontitis and 74 healthy controls), the decision trees diagnosed periodontitis with a sensitivity = 70.3% (± 0.211) and a specificity = 77.8% (± 0.165) for saliva, a sensitivity = 79.6% (± 0.188) and a specificity = 75.7% (± 0.195) for GCF, and a sensitivity = 72.1% (± 0.202) and a specificity = 72.2% (± 0.195) for dental plaque. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests were improved to 100% (CI 95% = [0.91;1]) and 100% (CI 95% = [0.92;1]), respectively, when two samples were tested. Conclusion We developed, for the first time, diagnostic tests based on protein profiles of saliva, GCF and dental plaque between periodontitis patients and healthy subjects. When at least 2 of these samples were tested, the best results were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W3011102208,"Gradients in the elemental composition of a potato leaf tissue (i.e. its ionome) can be linked to crop potential. Because the ionome is a function of genetics and environmental conditions, practitioners aim at fine-tuning fertilization to obtain an optimal ionome based on the needs of potato cultivars. Our objective was to assess the validity of cultivar grouping and predict potato tuber yields using foliar ionomes. The dataset comprised 3382 observations in Québec (Canada) from 1970 to 2017. The first mature leaves from top were sampled at the beginning of flowering for total N, P, K, Ca, and Mg analysis. We preprocessed nutrient concentrations (ionomes) by centering each nutrient to the geometric mean of all nutrients and to a filling value, a transformation known as row-centered log ratios (clr). A density-based clustering algorithm (dbscan) on these preprocessed ionomes failed to delineate groups of high-yield cultivars. We also used the preprocessed ionomes to assess their effects on tuber yield classes (high- and low-yields) on a cultivar basis using k-nearest neighbors, random forest and support vector machines classification algorithms. Our machine learning models returned an average accuracy of 70%, a fair diagnostic potential to detect in-season nutrient imbalance of potato cultivars using clr variables considering potential confounding factors. Optimal ionomic regions of new cultivars could be assigned to the one of the closest documented cultivar."
https://openalex.org/W3012287041,"In this event-related potential (ERP) study we reevaluate syntax-first approaches to sentence processing by implementing a novel paradigm in French that includes correct sentences, pure syntactic category violations, lexical-semantic anomalies, and combined anomalies. Our balanced design systematically controlled for target word (noun vs. verb) and the context immediately preceding it. Group results from 36 native speakers of Quebec French revealed that, up to 300 ms, ERPs elicited by syntactic category violations were comparable with ERP responses to correct sentences, showing that there is no early activation reflecting syntactic category identification. Instead, in response to all anomalous conditions, we observed an N400 followed by a P600. Combined anomalies yielded additive effects of syntactic category and lexical-semantic anomalies on the N400, and a large P600 effect similar to the one observed in the pure syntactic condition. These results provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that (i) syntactic categories are processed first, and (ii) that syntactic category errors “block” lexical-semantic processing. Further, the N400 effect in response to pure syntactic category violations reflects a mismatch detection between a predicted word-stem and the actual target. This mechanism takes place simultaneously (and potentially in parallel) with lexical-semantic processing. In contrast, an interaction of syntax and semantics for the P600 reveals that the same neurocognitive resources are recruited for syntactic and semantic integration, both promoted by the implementation of an acceptability judgement task in our design. Additional analyses of individual data complemented these observations: during sentence processing, participants did not rely on one single cognitive mechanism reflected by either the N400 or the P600 effect but on both, suggesting that the biphasic N400-P600 ERP wave can indeed be considered to be an index of phrase-structure violations in most individuals, at least if they are realized on content words."
https://openalex.org/W3012082730,"Panicum maximum Jacq. ‘Mombaça’ (Guinea grass) is a C4 forage grass widely used in tropical pastures for cattle feeding. In this study, we evaluated the isolated and combined effects of warming and elevated CO2 concentration [CO2] during summer on nutrient content, nutrient accumulation, nutrient use efficiency and growth of P. maximum under field conditions. Field temperature and [CO2] were controlled by temperature free-air controlled enhancement and free-air CO2 enrichment systems, respectively. We tested two levels of canopy temperature: ambient temperature (aT) and 2°C above ambient temperature (eT), as well as two levels of atmospheric [CO2]: ambient [CO2] (aCO2) and 200 ppm above ambient CO2 (eCO2). The experiment was established in a completely randomized design with four replications, in a 2×2 factorial scheme. After pasture establishment, plants were exposed to the treatments during 30 days, with evaluations at 9, 16, 23 and 30 days after the treatments started. Results were dependent on the time of the evaluation, but in the last evaluation (beginning of the grazing), contents of N, K, Mg and S did not change as a function of treatments. However, P decreased as a function of warming under both levels of [CO2], and Ca increased under [eCO2] combined with warming. There was an increase in root dry mass under warming treatment. Combined treatment increased N, Ca and S accumulation without a corresponding increase in the use efficiency of these same nutrients, indicating that the fertiliser dose should increase in the next decades due to climate change. Our short-term results in young and well fertilized pasture suggest that under the combination of [eCO2] and eT conditions, P. maximum productivity will increase and the nutritional requirement for N, Ca and S will also increase."
https://openalex.org/W3011277038,"Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by sudden and recurrent seizures, which are caused by various factors, including genetic abnormalities. Several animal models of epilepsy mimic the different symptoms of this disorder. In particular, the genetic audiogenic seizure hamster from Salamanca (GASH/Sal) animals exhibit sound-induced seizures similar to the generalized tonic seizures observed in epileptic patients. However, the genetic alterations underlying the audiogenic seizure susceptibility of the GASH/Sal model remain unknown. In addition, gene variations in the GASH/Sal might have a close resemblance with those described in humans with epilepsy, which is a prerequisite for any new preclinical studies that target genetic abnormalities. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in GASH/Sal animals and their corresponding controls to identify and characterize the mutational landscape of the GASH/Sal strain. After filtering the results, moderate- and high-impact variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, assessing the possible impact of the mutations by ""in silico"" reconstruction of the encoded proteins and analyzing their corresponding biological pathways. Lastly, we quantified gene expression levels by RT-qPCR. In the GASH/Sal model, WES showed the presence of 342 variations, in which 21 were classified as high-impact mutations. After a full bioinformatics analysis to highlight the high quality and reliable variants, the presence of 3 high-impact and 15 moderate-impact variants were identified. Gene expression analysis of the high-impact variants of Asb14 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS Box Containing 14), Msh3 (MutS Homolog 3) and Arhgef38 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 38) genes showed a higher expression in the GASH/Sal than in control hamsters. In silico analysis of the functional consequences indicated that those mutations in the three encoded proteins would have severe functional alterations. By functional analysis of the variants, we detected 44 significantly enriched pathways, including the glutamatergic synapse pathway. The data show three high-impact mutations with a major impact on the function of the proteins encoded by these genes, although no mutation in these three genes has been associated with some type of epilepsy until now. Furthermore, GASH/Sal animals also showed gene variants associated with different types of epilepsy that has been extensively documented, as well as mutations in other genes that encode proteins with functions related to neuronal excitability, which could be implied in the phenotype of the GASH/Sal. Our findings provide valuable genetic and biological pathway data associated to the genetic burden of the audiogenic seizure susceptibility and reinforce the need to validate the role of each key mutation in the phenotype of the GASH/Sal model."
https://openalex.org/W3011453901,"Background Discordance between patient’s global assessment (PtGA) and physician’s global assessment (PhGA) has been described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Understanding the reasons for this discrepancy is important in the context of treat-to-target treatment strategy. Objective To assess the determinants of PtGA and PhGA and factors associated with discordance between them. Methods The REAL study included RA patients from Brazilian public health centers. Clinical, laboratory and outcomes measures were collected. PtGA and the PhGA were rated on a visual analog scale and analyzed. Three groups were defined: no discordance (difference between PtGA and PhGA within 3 cm), positive discordance (PtGA exceeding PhGA by >3 cm), and negative discordance (PtGA less than PhGA by >3 cm). Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify determinants of PtGA and PhGA and their discordance. Results 1115 patients (89,4% female, mean age 56.7y and median disease duration of 12.7y) were enrolled. Two factors were associated with PtGA in the final multivariate model: one point increase in the pain scale leads to an increase of 0.62 in PtGA; one point increase in HAQ increases by 9,25 points the PtGA. The factors associated with PhGA were pain scale, number of tender and swollen joints (NTJ and NSJ), positive RF, ESR, HAQ-DI and use of corticosteroids. Discordance between patient and physician was found in 30.52%: positive discordance in 24.6% and negative discordance in 5.92%. An increase of one point in the NSJ was associated with a 12% increase in the chance of negative discordance. The chance of positive discordance increased by 90% and 2% for each unit increased in HAQ-DI and pain scale respectively. Finally, the chance of positive discordance decreased by 3% for each point increased in NTJ and by 15% for each point increased in NSJ. Conclusion In one-third of the assessments, there was disagreement between PtGA and PhGA (a positive discordance was found in 80% of them). Pain and function were determinants for patients to estimate disease activity, while swollen joints was the main factor related to a worse physician’s evaluation. These data show how different can be the perspectives of patients and assistants."

We aimed at analyzing the heterogeneity of mutational load of BRAF V600E in biopsies of melanoma patients of different stages, and investigating its potential as a prognosis factor. Mutational load of BRAF V600E was analyzed by digital PCR in 78 biopsies of melanoma patients of different stages and 10 nevi. The BRAF V600E load was compared among biopsies of different stages. Results showed a great variability in the load of V600E (0%-81%). Interestingly, we observed a significant difference in the load of V600E between the early and late melanoma stages, in the sense of an inverse correlation between BRAF V600E mutational load and melanoma progression. In addition, a machine learning approach showed that the mutational load of BRAF V600E could be a good predictor of metastasis in stage II patients. Our results suggest that BRAF V600E is a promising biomarker of prognosis in stage II patients."
https://openalex.org/W3011892511,"Primary cilia are sensory organelles that are essential for eukaryotic development and health. These antenna-like structures are synthesized by intraflagellar transport protein complexes, IFT-B and IFT-A, which mediate bidirectional protein trafficking along the ciliary axoneme. Here using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), we investigate the ciliary roles of two mammalian orthologues of Chlamydomonas IFT-A gene, IFT139, namely Thm1 (also known as Ttc21b) and Thm2 (Ttc21a). Thm1 loss causes perinatal lethality, and Thm2 loss allows survival into adulthood. At E14.5, the number of Thm1;Thm2 double mutant embryos is lower than that for a Mendelian ratio, indicating deletion of Thm1 and Thm2 causes mid-gestational lethality. We examined the ciliary phenotypes of mutant MEF. Thm1-mutant MEF show decreased cilia assembly, increased cilia disassembly, shortened primary cilia, a retrograde IFT defect for IFT and BBS proteins, and reduced ciliary entry of membrane-associated proteins. Thm1-mutant cilia also show a retrograde transport defect for the Hedgehog transducer, Smoothened, and an impaired response to Smoothened agonist, SAG. Thm2-null MEF show normal ciliary dynamics and Hedgehog signaling, but additional loss of a Thm1 allele impairs response to SAG. Further, Thm1;Thm2 double-mutant MEF show enhanced cilia disassembly, and increased impairment of INPP5E ciliary import. Thus, Thm1 and Thm2 have unique and redundant roles in MEF. Thm1 regulates cilia assembly, and alone and together with Thm2, regulates cilia disassembly, ciliary entry of membrane-associated protein, Hedgehog signaling, and embryogenesis. These findings shed light on mechanisms underlying Thm1-, Thm2- or IFT-A-mediated ciliopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3012361999,"The relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms varies depending on the environment. According to the stress-dominance hypothesis (SDH), assembly mechanisms range from strong abiotic filtering to competition as the environment becomes more favourable. Most evidence for the SDH comes from studies in gradients of conditions (i.e. abiotic environmental factors that influence the functioning of organisms but are not consumed by them). However, we hypothesized that in resource gradients, competition increases as abiotic filtering becomes stronger. To test our hypothesis, we set up eight plots at different sites along an abiotic severity gradient in the Brazilian semi-arid region (BSAR). In each plot, we identified and measured each woody plant species found, and we recorded 11 functional traits of the main species, dividing the traits into alpha (competition effects) and beta (abiotic filtering effects). We investigated the presence of phylogenetic signal in the traits, the community phylogenetic and phenotypic patterns, and associated the variation in these patterns with the availability of water and soil nutrients. We found phylogenetic signal for most (91%) of the traits analysed. The phylogenetic patterns varied from clustered in stressful sites to random or overdispersed in favourable sites, and we concluded that these phylogenetic patterns were the result of historical processes influencing community assembly in different environments in the BSAR. In general, the phenotypic patterns varied from clustered at the most stressful end to random at less stressful sites. Our results show that in resource gradients, any restriction of the resource (hydric or edaphic) intensifies abiotic filtering and, at the same time, increases the competitive hierarchy among species. On the other hand, stochastic processes seem to have a stronger influence under more favourable abiotic conditions, where abiotic filtering and competition are weaker. Thus, we conclude that the SDH is not supported in resource gradients."

However, in areas occupied by more than one species, echolocation clicks need to be classified into species. The present study investigated whether the echolocation clicks produced by small, at-risk, resident sympatric populations of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in Menai Bay, Zanzibar, East Africa, could be classified to allow species specific monitoring. Underwater sounds of S. plumbea and T. aduncus groups were recorded using a SoundTrap 202HF in January and June-August 2015. Eight acoustic parameters, i.e. -10 dB duration, peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies, and -3 dB, -10 dB and root-mean-squared bandwidth, were used to describe and compare the two species’ echolocation clicks. Statistical analyses showed that S. plumbea clicks had significantly higher peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies compared to T. aduncus, whereas duration and bandwidth parameters were similar for the two species. Random Forest (RF) classifiers were applied to determine parameters that could be used to classify the two species from echolocation clicks and achieved 28.6% and 90.2% correct species classification rates for S. plumbea and T. aduncus, respectively. Both species were classified at a higher rate than expected at random, however the identified classifiers would only be useful for T. aduncus monitoring. The frequency and bandwidth parameters provided most power for species classification. Further study is necessary to identify useful classifiers for S. plumbea. This study represents a first step in acoustic description and classification of S. plumbea and T. aduncus in the western Indian Ocean region, with potential application for future acoustic monitoring of species-specific temporal and spatial occurrence in these sympatric species."

Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to improve outcomes for those living with Chagas, and also for the prevention of ongoing transmission. The decision to be tested for Chagas is affected by a range of factors. Studies have highlighted the need to consider the wider social determinants of healthcare seeking behaviour related to Chagas. In Madrid, 44% of Bolivians undergo Chagas screening, which is a higher rate than other European regions, but studies concerning the factors which determine testing have not been performed. This study aimed to assess, for a first time, the factors associated with screening for Chagas among Bolivians living in Madrid trying to help in developing strategies and health recommendations.This was a cross-sectional survey about knowledge of Chagas and practices of Bolivians living in Madrid, Spain. A structured questionnaire was administered to 376 participants regarding Chagas health-seeking behaviour. Determinants were assessed by multiple logistic regressions adjusted by sex.After adjusting for others variables and sex, the factors shown to be associated with Chagas screening were to have between 35 and 54 years of age; coming from a department with high prevalence of Chagas (OR 2.17 95% CI 0.99-4.76); received information about Chagas in Spain (OR 2.44 95% CI 1.32-4.51); and received any advice to do the test, especially if the advice came from a professional.Health authorities should coordinate and promote strategies addressed to diagnose and treat Chagas taking into account all factors associated with screening. Our study suggests that professional advice appears to be the cornerstone to encourage Bolivians to undergo Chagas screening in Madrid. It is time to change the burden of the decision of being screened from the patient to the doctor. Being diagnosed for Chagas needs to become an institutional strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3012522468,"Poractant alfa and Calsurf are two natural surfactants widely used in China for the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, which are extracted from porcine and calf lungs, respectively. The purpose of this experimental study was to compare their in vitro characteristics and in vivo effects in the improvement of pulmonary function and protection of lung injury. The biophysical properties, ultrastructure, and lipid composition of both surfactant preparations were respectively analysed in vitro by means of Langmuir-Blodgett trough (LBT), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS). Then, as core pharmacological activity, both head-to-head (100 and 200 mg/kg for both surfactants) and licensed dose comparisons (70 mg/kg Calsurf vs. 200 mg/kg Poractant alfa) between the two surfactants were conducted as prophylaxis in preterm rabbits with primary surfactant deficiency, assessing survival time and rate and dynamic compliance of the respiratory system (Cdyn). Intrapulmonary surfactant pools, morphometric volume density as alveolar expansion (Vv), and lung injury scores were determined post mortem. AFM and LC-MS analysis revealed qualitative differences in the ultrastructure as well as in the lipid composition of both preparations. Calsurf showed a longer plateau region of the LBT isotherm and lower film compressibility. In vivo, both surfactant preparations improved Cdyn at any dose, although maximum benefits in terms of Vv and intrapulmonary surfactant pools were seen with the 200 mg/kg dose in both surfactants. The group of animals treated with 200 mg/kg of Poractant alfa showed a prolonged survival time and rate compared to untreated but ventilated controls, and significantly ameliorated lung injury compared to Calsurf at any dose, including 200 mg/kg. The overall outcomes suggest the pulmonary effects to be dose dependent for both preparations. The group of animals treated with 200 mg/kg of Poractant alfa showed a significant reduction of mortality. Compared to Calsurf, Poractant alfa exerted better effects if licensed doses were compared, which requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3011845650,"Introduction Knowledge of HIV status in South Africa (SA) is reported to be 90% among people living with HIV. National level estimates could mask population-specific levels, which are critical to monitor program coverage and potential impact. Using data from the 2017 national antenatal sentinel survey, we assessed knowledge of HIV-positive status, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and socio-demographic characteristics associated with knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy among women attending antenatal care. Methods Between 1 October and 15 November 2017, a nationally representative sample of 32,716 pregnant women were enrolled from 1,595 public health facilities selected from all districts of SA. Data on age, gravidity, knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART initiation prior to pregnancy were extracted from medical records. A blood sample was collected from each woman regardless of prior knowledge of HIV status or ART history, and tested for HIV in the laboratory. All HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled in the survey were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Multivariable survey logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy. Results Of 10,065 eligible HIV-positive women, 60.8% (95% confidence interval (CI):59.9%–61.7%) knew their HIV status prior to the current pregnancy, of whom 91.1% (95% CI: 90.4%–91.7%) initiated ART prior to the current pregnancy. Knowledge of HIV-positive status was lower among adolescent girls and young women (15–24 years) (38.9%) and primigravid women (40.5%) compared with older women (35–49 years) (75.5%) and multigravid women (64.7%). In a multivariable analysis, significant effect modification was found between gravidity and age (P value = 0.047). Being in the age group 15–24 years compared to the age group 35–49 years decreased the odds of knowing HIV-positive status by 80% (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.2, 95% CI:0.1–0.4) among primigravid women and by 60%(AOR: 0.4, 95% CI:0.3–0.4) among multigravid women. Conclusion Knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy fell short of the target of 90% among pregnant women living with HIV. This was especially low among adolescent girls and young women, highlighting the gap in youth friendly reproductive health and HIV testing services."
https://openalex.org/W3012325652,"Noninvasive genetic sampling (NGS) is commonly used to study elusive or rare species where direct observation or capture is difficult. Little attention has been paid to the potential effects of observer bias while collecting noninvasive genetic samples in the field, however. Over a period of 7 years, we examined whether different observers (n = 58) and observer experience influenced detection, amplification rates, and correct species identification of 4,836 gray wolf (Canis lupus) fecal samples collected in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, USA and southwestern Alberta, Canada (2008–2014). We compared new observers (n = 33) to experienced observers (n = 25) and hypothesized experience level would increase the overall success of using NGS techniques in the wild. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that new individuals were better than experienced observers at detecting and collecting wolf scats and correctly identifying wolf scats from other sympatric carnivores present in the study areas. While adequate training of new observers is crucial for the successful use of NGS techniques, attention should also be directed to experienced observers. Observer experience could be a curse because of their potential effects on NGS data quality arising from fatigue, boredom or other factors. The ultimate benefit of an observer to a project is a combination of factors (i.e., field savvy, local knowledge), but project investigators should be aware of the potential negative effects of experience on NGS sampling."
https://openalex.org/W3010960970,"Eye contact perception—the ability to accurately and efficiently discriminate others’ gaze directions—is critical to understanding others and functioning in a complex social world. Previous research shows that it is affected in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders accompanied by social dysfunction, and understanding the cognitive processes giving rise to eye contact perception would help advance mechanistic investigations of psychopathology. This study aims to validate an online, psychophysical eye contact detection task through which two constituent cognitive components of eye contact perception (perceptual precision and self-referential tendency) can be derived. Data collected from a large online sample showed excellent test-retest reliability for self-referential tendency and moderate reliability for perceptual precision. Convergence validity was supported by correlations with social cognitive measures tapping into different aspects of understanding others. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceptual precision and self-referential tendency explained unique variance in social cognition, suggesting that they measure unique aspects of related constructs. Overall, this study provided support for the reliability and validity of the eye contact perception metrics derived using the online Eye Contact Detection Task. The value of the task for future psychopathology research was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3012157984,"Recent trends suggest that marine disease outbreaks caused by opportunistic pathogens are increasing in frequency and severity. One such malady is seagrass wasting disease, caused by pathogens in the genus Labyrinthula. It is suspected that pathogenicity is intimately linked to the ability of the host to initiate defense responses; however, supportive evidence is lacking. To address this, we developed two techniques, including 1) a new qPCR-based pathogen detection method, and 2) an immune profiling panel via four host-biomarker assays (measuring peroxidase, exochitinase, polyphenol oxidase, and lysozyme activities). These techniques were then used to experimentally investigate the impact of environmental stressors (namely, elevated temperature and salinity) on host immunity and how immune status might affect susceptibility to Labyrinthula infection. In the first experiment, we subjected individual turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum) shoots to short-term (7 d) abiotic stressors alone. In a second experiment, the same abiotic stressor conditions were followed by pathogen exposure (7 additional d), simulating a scenario where we attempt to isolate the impact of environmental stressors on the host seagrass species by removing the stressor as the pathogen is introduced. The qPCR assay successfully quantified the abundance of Labyrinthula spp. cells from both pure cultures and seagrass tissues across a broad range of predominately pathogenic strains, with high sensitivity. Immune enzyme assays revealed that all four biomarkers were constitutively active in turtlegrass individuals, but specific activities were largely unaffected by the chosen abiotic stressor conditions. We also identified positive correlations between pathogen load and two biomarkers (peroxidase, exochitinase), regardless of abiotic stress treatment, further demonstrating the potential utility of these biomarkers in future applications."
https://openalex.org/W3012269722,"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can measure both spatial (morphological) and spectral (biochemical) information from biological tissues. While HSI appears promising for biomedical applications, interpretation of hyperspectral images can be challenging when data is acquired in complex biological environments. Variations in surface topology or optical power distribution at the sample, encountered for example during endoscopy, can lead to errors in post-processing of the HSI data, compromising disease diagnostic capabilities. Here, we propose a background correction method to compensate for such variations, which estimates the optical properties of illumination at the target based on the normalised spectral profile of the light source and the measured HSI intensity values at a fixed wavelength where the absorption characteristics of the sample are relatively low (in this case, 800 nm). We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by imaging blood samples, tissue-mimicking phantoms, and ex vivo chicken tissue. Moreover, using synthetic HSI data composed from experimentally measured spectra, we show the proposed method would improve statistical analysis of HSI data. The proposed method could help the implementation of HSI techniques in practical clinical applications, where controlling the illumination pattern and power is difficult."
https://openalex.org/W3010646085,"An important feature of Bayesian statistics is the opportunity to do sequential inference: the posterior distribution obtained after seeing a dataset can be used as prior for a second inference. However, when Monte Carlo sampling methods are used for inference, we only have a set of samples from the posterior distribution. To do sequential inference, we then either have to evaluate the second posterior at only these locations and reweight the samples accordingly, or we can estimate a functional description of the posterior probability distribution from the samples and use that as prior for the second inference. Here, we investigated to what extent we can obtain an accurate joint posterior from two datasets if the inference is done sequentially rather than jointly, under the condition that each inference step is done using Monte Carlo sampling. To test this, we evaluated the accuracy of kernel density estimates, Gaussian mixtures, mixtures of factor analyzers, vine copulas and Gaussian processes in approximating posterior distributions, and then tested whether these approximations can be used in sequential inference. In low dimensionality, Gaussian processes are more accurate, whereas in higher dimensionality Gaussian mixtures, mixtures of factor analyzers or vine copulas perform better. In our test cases of sequential inference, using posterior approximations gives more accurate results than direct sample reweighting, but joint inference is still preferable over sequential inference whenever possible. Since the performance is case-specific, we provide an R package mvdens with a unified interface for the density approximation methods."

CNV patients had significantly more eye care provider visits (mean 8.8 vs. 3.2, p<0.0001), more ophthalmic imaging tests, higher rates of treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (45% vs. 4%, p<0.0001), and incurred higher mean total yearly costs ($1,251.83 vs. $251.36, p<0.0001) than POHS patients without CNV.Although the relationship between Histoplasma and POHS remains controversial, geographic patterns of POHS patient residence were consistent with the traditionally reported range of the fungus. CNV in the context of POHS was associated with additional healthcare use and costs. Further research to understand POHS etiology, risk factors, prevalence, and complications is needed, along with early diagnosis and treatment strategies."

The study of genetic information from reindeer is the basis for revealing the unique mechanism of antler growth. In the present study, we obtained 18.86 GB of clean reads, which were assembled to obtain 94,575 unigenes (average length: 704.69). Among these reads, 30,980 sequences were identified by searching a database of known proteins and then annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) classifications and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. All 7,480 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. A total of 84,435 and 82,226 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in male and female reindeer, respectively. We identified 31 genes that were highly expressed in reindeer antlers. These genes regulate cell activities that are closely associated with the process of rapid tissue growth. Our results provide a basis for studying reindeer antlers and for further studying the molecular genetics, population genetics, and functional genomics of reindeer."
https://openalex.org/W3011908095,"Current literature on women’s sexual signaling focuses on modes of attracting potential, new sexual partners, but says little about women’s subtle sexual signals in committed, romantic relationships. Subtle sexual signals are inherently private and are only visible to the intended audience; a woman might use these signals to elicit or accept a sexual response from her partner or to increase her overall attractiveness, or attractivity. In this study, we sought to identify women’s use of intimate apparel as a proceptive or receptive behavior as well as the effects of relative mate value, relationship commitment, relationship satisfaction, and sexual functioning. A total of N = 353 women in the United States aged 25–45 who were in committed, heterosexual relationships completed the survey; 88.7% of the sample indicated wearing or having worn sexy underwear. Results indicate that women report wearing sexier underwear the day taking the survey if they anticipate sexual activity that same day. However, during the most recent sexual activity, women did not report wearing sexier underwear if they initiated (proceptive) that activity. While relative mate value was not directly related to sexiness of intimate apparel, women who report higher mate value tend to wear sexier underwear. Women’s use of intimate apparel might be viewed as a method of increasing attractivity and underlying receptivity to aid relationship maintenance, though caveats regarding measures and alternative interpretations are also discussed. Findings suggest that these women use intimate apparel to feel sexy, desired, aroused, and to prepare for sex with their partners. This study is the first to examine intimate apparel in relationships and as a subtle sexual signal of proceptivity and receptivity."
https://openalex.org/W3012218856,"Several pathological conditions introduce spatial variations in the electrical properties of cardiac tissue. These variations occur as localized or distributed gradients in ion-channel functionality over extended tissue media. Electrical waves, propagating through such affected tissue, demonstrate distortions, depending on the nature of the ionic gradient in the diseased substrate. If the degree of distortion is large, reentrant activity may develop, in the form of rotating spiral (2d) and scroll (3d) waves of electrical activity. These reentrant waves are associated with the occurrence of lethal cardiac rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), which are believed to be common precursors of sudden cardiac arrest. By using state-of-the-art mathematical models for generic, and ionically-realistic (human) cardiac tissue, we study the detrimental effects of these ionic gradients on electrical wave propagation. We propose a possible mechanism for the development of instabilities in reentrant wave patterns, in the presence of ionic gradients in cardiac tissue, which may explain how one type of arrhythmia (VT) can degenerate into another (VF). Our proposed mechanism entails anisotropic reduction in the wavelength of the excitation waves because of anisotropic variation in its electrical properties, in particular the action potential duration (APD). We find that the variation in the APD, which we induce by varying ion-channel conductances, imposes a spatial variation in the spiral- or scroll-wave frequency ω. Such gradients in ω induce anisotropic shortening of wavelength of the spiral or scroll arms and eventually leads to instabilitites."
https://openalex.org/W3012488989,"Similarity-based search of sequence collections is a core task in bioinformatics, one dominated for most of the genomic era by exact and heuristic alignment-based algorithms. However, even efficient heuristics such as BLAST may not scale to the data sets now emerging, motivating a range of alignment-free alternatives exploiting the underlying lexical structure of each sequence. In this paper, we introduce two supervised approaches—SuperVec and SuperVecX—to learn sequence embeddings. These methods extend earlier Representation Learning (RepL) based methods to include class-related information for each sequence during training. Including class information ensures that related sequence fragments have proximal representations in the target space, better reflecting the structure of the domain. We show the quality of the embeddings learned through these methods on (i) sequence retrieval and (ii) classification tasks. We also propose an hierarchical tree-based approach specifically designed for the sequence retrieval problem. The resulting methods, which we term H-SuperVec or H-SuperVecX, according to their respective use of SuperVec or SuperVecX, learn embeddings across a range of feature spaces based on exclusive and exhaustive subsets of the class labels. Experiments show that the proposed methods perform better for retrieval and classification tasks over existing (unsupervised) RepL-based approaches. Further, the new methods are an order of magnitude faster than BLAST for the database retrieval task, supporting hybrid approaches that rapidly filter the collection so that only potentially relevant records remain. Such filtering of the original database allows slower but more accurate methods to be executed quickly over a far smaller dataset. Thus, we may achieve faster query processing and higher precision than before."
https://openalex.org/W3011179386,"To construct a simple polygon from a set of plane points, we propose an iterative inserting ordered points (IIOP) algorithm. Using a given a set of ordered non-collinear points, a simple polygon can be formed and its shape is dependent on the sorting method used. To form such simple polygons with a given set of plane points, the points must first be ordered in one direction (typically, the x-axis is used). The first three points in the set are used to form an initial polygon. Based on the formed polygon, new polygons can be iteratively formed by inserting the first point of from among the remaining set of points, depending on line visibility from that point. This process is carried out until all the points are inserted into the polygon. In this study, we generated 20, 50, and 80 plane points and used the proposed method to construct polygons. Experimental results show that these three polygons are all simple polygons. Through theoretical and experimental verification, we can concluded that when given a set of non-collinear points, a simple polygon can be formed."
https://openalex.org/W3011584704,"I settled into my seat on a plane bound for Cuba feeling frustrated. When I planned the trip, I had assumed that my Cuban collaborators and I would hit the ground running, heading out into the field straight away to collect water and sediment samples from rivers. That's how I'd done fieldwork in Namibia, Bolivia, and Greenland. But not in Cuba, it seemed. Five days earlier, a Cuban scientist emailed to inform me that we'd only be meeting to talk about our planned project. Sampling would happen during a later trip, she wrote. That left me feeling impatient and unhappy. Why did I need to travel there to have a meeting? But I had something to learn in Cuba.



> “The lack of hierarchy … was unlike anything I'd experienced before in academia.” 

At the airport, one of my collaborators greeted me with a broad smile. “Welcome to Cuba!” he exclaimed in perfect English, giving me a strong handshake and a hug. The next day, we drove to the research center where he worked. As scorpions scurried across the floor of the conference room, each of us gave a presentation about our science and what we hoped to learn from the study of Cuban rivers.

Then, we toured every lab in the building. I met scientists, technicians, secretaries, students, and the cook. Some spoke English; others communicated to me in Spanish while my collaborator translated. I was impressed that I was introduced to each person in their center. The lack of hierarchy—the team atmosphere—was unlike anything I'd experienced before in academia.

The next day, we met again to brainstorm. Together, we pored over maps to plan how we were going to collect samples. Had it not been for the Cubans, I would have been unaware that the maps I had were outdated and wrong. They left out reservoirs, which was a problem because had we sampled downstream of them, our results would have been biased. Local involvement and knowledge were key—making me wonder what I'd missed working without such a team in Africa, South America, and the Arctic.

Six months later, I flew back to Cuba and—this time—we headed into the field. I was impressed, yet again, by the lengths to which my collaborators went to ensure that all team members were treated equally. We drove around Cuba in bright yellow vans, and we made sure that each van had a mix of Cubans and Americans at all seniority levels. In the field, students, faculty, and technicians all sweated together.

On the last night of the trip, we searched for a restaurant that could seat all 14 of us at one table—because that's what teams do, they sit together. When a restaurant couldn't accommodate the team without splitting us up, my collaborators insisted that we move on and find a place with a large enough table.

In 26 years as a professor, I've always tried my best to treat my students as valued collaborators. I have never been a fan of academia's hierarchy. I want everyone working with me to feel as though they are part of a team. But my Cuban collaborators take teamwork to another level entirely. They make it clear—through actions both big and small—that all team members are valued, that everyone is equal, and that true teamwork makes for better science.

I returned to the United States a changed scientist. Now, I spend more time listening and making sure that everyone's voice is heard. Four months ago, I took the Cuban approach to heart when I led a workshop for scientists from five countries. We met to discuss how we were going to analyze a few precious grams of rock collected from beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet. I made sure that every scientist had a voice in the discussions and that all 35 of us ate dinners together. The approach worked: We began as individuals, but after the workshop, we were a team.

Many people outside Cuba focus on its communist system or the bad blood between our two countries. In Cuba, my collaborators taught me about coming together. I learned that the best teams recognize that individual members bring different perspectives to the table. All voices have merit, and each and every person deserves respect. I hope this essay inspires others to recognize the power of real teamwork—even during routine moments such as dinner."
https://openalex.org/W3012076011,"Each year, a series of Science Research Conferences (SRCs) are sponsored by The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), a non-profit federation of 29 research societies representing 130,000 scientists, that allows experimental biologists to meet in a relaxing, collegial atmosphere and explore new approaches to current research areas. Matricellular proteins were defined by Dr. Paul Bornstein in 1995 as a family of structurally diverse, modular secreted proteins that bind to both extracellular matrix molecules and cellular receptors to regulate a wide array of key cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, survival, proliferation, extracellular matrix organization, growth factor and protease regulation, and differentiation. Of importance are emerging data showing key roles for matricellular proteins in diseases through their roles in regulating tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, fibrosis, inflammation, immunity, metabolism, and development. Matricellular proteins are therapeutic targets for multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and metastasis, autoimmunity, neurogenesis and neuropathic pain, ocular diseases including inflammation, glaucoma, and macular degeneration, diabetes and diabetic complications, skeletal dysplasia and regeneration, and arthritis. The field has evolved from elucidating structure function activities of these complex proteins to identifying roles in diseases and the development of matricellular-targeted therapeutic interventions. The Matricellular Proteins in Inflammation and Tissue Remodeling conference was held in Lisbon, Portugal, 14-19 July 2019, at the Lisbon Marriott hotel. The goal of the conference was to bring together investigators in the field of matricellular proteins focusing on specific diseases and physiological systems and providing a forum for interdisciplinary exchange and discussions that led to dissemination of new ideas and information across several medical and basic science fields, create new opportunities for collaboration and cross-fertilization, and help to ensure the highest quality future research. This goal is important for all researchers in the field of matricellular proteins, but it is particularly important for young scientists, who may otherwise not have access to the depth of preceding knowledge or may become over-specialized in the absence of such interchanges. This interchange is a key component of the meeting, because it breaks the barriers of many traditional small meetings which are disease, organ, or molecular family focused. The biological functions and mechanisms of action of matricellular proteins are attracting increasing interest within the scientific community as several matricellular members have been identified as key regulators of tissue homeostasis, normal and pathological tissue remodeling, and inflammation. Matricellular proteins are making their way into clinical and translation studies as well. Dysregulation of their function is being increasingly recognized as central to the pathogenesis of several major diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. These proteins function to regulate tissue remodeling: remodeling of vasculature and myocardium, angiogenesis, tumor progression, fibrogenesis, wound repair, hemostasis, diabetes, obesity, inflammation, innate and acquired immunity, synaptogenesis, and development and stem cell differentiation. At the conference, evidence for potential use of therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting or replicating the activity of CCN2 (Enrique Brandan, Chile; Andrew Leask, Canada), tenascin-C (Kim Midwood, UK), fibulin-7 (Susana de Vega, Japan), and thrombospondin 1 (Stephane Dedieu, France; Giulia Taraboletti, Italy; Laura Velazquez, France) were presented. The agonistic effects of CCN2 and antagonistic effects of CCN3 on multi-organ fibrosis and solid tumors and the use of CCN3-based therapeutic peptides for treatment were shown by Bruce Riser, USA. In addition, Jacqueline Hecht spoke about clinical trials to treat children with COMP mutations that cause a form of dwarfism. Together, these exciting findings establish the relevance of matricellular proteins in disease pathogenesis and treatment. The conference was organized into nine sessions, each focused on the physiology and/or disease of a specific physiological system (e.g., Matricellular Proteins in Cardiovascular Physiology and Disease, Matricellular Proteins in Remodeling of Connective Tissue and Fibrotic Disease) or on physiological process or specific application of matricellular proteins (e.g., Matricellular Proteins in Development, Matricellular Proteins and Biomaterials). In each session, there were 4-8 talks, for a total of 39 talks by invited speakers, who are recognized leaders in the field, and 14 presentations selected from the submitted abstracts. The keynote speaker Dr. Didier Stainier, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim (Germany) presented a new paradigm in regulation of gene expression. Dr. Stainier described an mRNA-decay-dependent mechanism of upregulation of genes that exhibit sequence similarity with the mutated gene’s mRNA. This novel pathway of gene regulation is sequence-dependent and a part of the phenomenon of transcriptional adaptation. In addition to a better understanding of disease-causing mutations, these findings will greatly help in designing mutant alleles with minimal compensation. The attendees found this talk very stimulating and inspiring and relevant to everyone’s research activities. The talk generated a significant discussion about how these mechanisms may impact the matricellular protein field and was evaluated by the attendees as a great choice for a keynote presentation. This was reflected in the evaluation from the attendees (e.g., “…really liked that the Keynote talk was on a distinct topic—would be good to continue this in the future. Also liked having a keynote on basic cell/molecular biology research…”). The conference started with two sessions on Matricellular Proteins in Immunity, Inflammation, and Injury. The roles of matricellular proteins in regulation of immune cell functions, wound healing, and pain were discussed. Dr. Amy Bradshaw (MUSC) presented recent results highlighting the role of a matricellular protein SPARC in development of cardiac fibrosis. SPARC is produced by bone marrow-derived immune cells in response to injury in myocardium. Matricellular proteins are well-known regulators of fibrosis. Fibrosis of various organs accounts for nearly half of all death in developed countries and promotes metastasis and cancer growth. The conference continued with two sessions on their role in fibrosis and connective tissue diseases. Bruce Riser (BLR Bio LLC) discussed new developments in designing drugs based on CCN family of proteins that show the potential to threat and even reverse not only fibrosis, but also loss of organ function. The potential use of matricellular proteins to prevent scarring was discussed by Dr. Douglas W. Hamilton (The University of Western Ontario—London, CAN), who discovered a distinct pattern of expression of a matricellular protein periostin in gingival and palatal tissue. Gingiva does not scar, but palatal tissue is associated with severe scarring, and evidence showed a different role for the protein in these two tissues. Dr. Davy Vanhoutte (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center), who is one of the seven recipients of Travel Awards, discussed the mechanism of action and the role of Thrombospondin-3 (TSP-3) in myocardium. Out of five members of the Thrombospondin family, this protein is the least studied. The presented results not only shed light on its functions and properties but also redefine thrombospondin biology by uncovering that these proteins function as intracellular mediators of plasma membrane attachment complexes to regulate the dynamics of cellular remodeling and membrane stability. In the session on Matricellular Proteins and Biomaterials that took place on Tuesday, July 16, Dr. Yadong Wang (Cornell University) discussed the development of regenerative matrices for cardiac repair and vascular regeneration using the extracellular matrix proteins from regenerative species and organs. This innovative approach results in restoration of heart and vascular function superior to current approaches. The session on Matricellular Proteins in Aging and Metabolic Diseases encompassed discussions of matricellular proteins in metabolic dysfunction and cancers associated with metabolic changes, in aging heart, in stress-induced senescence, in neurodegenerative diseases, and in atherosclerosis. A novel signaling pathway by which TSP-1 regulates mitochondrial fission and the reactive oxygen species generation during hypoxia and ischemia reperfusion was presented by Dr. Amanda LeBlanc (University of Louisville), and a strategy to improve the heart function and to reverse coronary microvascular dysfunction in aging population by inhibiting TSP-1 was discussed. The Keynote session, Matricellular Proteins in Cardiovascular Physiology and Disease, held in the evening of Wednesday, July 17, informed the attendees of new insights into roles of TSP-1 and tenascin in aortic remodeling and myocardial tissue repair, respectively, as well as into regulation of TSP-1 by miRNA. Thursday, July 18 sessions were dedicated to the roles of matricellular proteins in cancer. Regulation of metastasis, fibrosis, cancer microenvironment, and cancer vasculature were discussed. Dr. Gertraud Orend (INSERM—Strasbourg, FRA) reported that tenascin C promotes metastasis through several complementary signaling mechanisms in both the stromal and the tumor cells. The conference was concluded with a session on Matricellular Proteins in Physiology and Diseases of Nervous System and Eye, during which the roles of matricellular proteins in ocular diseases such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and ocular inflammation were discussed. Two career development events were held during the lunch hours. One of them organized experts and trainees for an informal discussion by interests (Meet the Expert lunch) and was appreciated by the trainees (e.g., “I really enjoyed the lunch at which we had tables for specific matricellular proteins. I would like to see that continued.”). The second event brought together established investigators and the young investigators/trainees to discuss the career development issues. The event was also useful to young investigators, and this was reflected in their comments. The participants indicated that they benefited from discussing “grant seeking,” “publishing strategies,” and noted that “It was great to have the designated time for Career Development.” To support trainees’ and young investigators’ travel to the conference, six awards were given based on the evaluation of the posters and talks by conference faculty. Sukhbir Kaur (NCI), Jasmine Gajeton (Cleveland Clinic), and Thomas Loustau (Inserm U1109—Strasbourg, FRA) received the Conference Poster Awards. Davy Vanhoutte (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) and Georgia Nikoloudaki (Western University—London, CAN) received the Conference Travel Award. Thomas Daubon (INSERM-GBM Team-Univ Bordeaux-PESSAC, FRA) received a Young Investigator Award, and Sophia Pantasis (ETH—Zürich, CHE) was awarded the Travel Award from the American Journal of Physiology Cell Physiology.

https://openalex.org/W3012302268,"Plants located adjacent to agricultural fields are important for maintaining biodiversity in semi-natural landscapes. To avoid undesired impacts on these plants due to herbicide application on the arable fields, regulatory risk assessments are conducted prior to registration to ensure proposed uses of plant protection products do not present an unacceptable risk. The current risk assessment approach for these non-target terrestrial plants (NTTPs) examines impacts at the individual-level as a surrogate approach for protecting the plant community due to the inherent difficulties of directly assessing population or community level impacts. However, modelling approaches are suitable higher tier tools to upscale individual-level effects to community level. IBC-grass is a sophisticated plant community model, which has already been applied in several studies. However, as it is a console application software, it was not deemed sufficiently user-friendly for risk managers and assessors to be conveniently operated without prior expertise in ecological models. Here, we present a user-friendly and open source graphical user interface (GUI) for the application of IBC-grass in regulatory herbicide risk assessment. It facilitates the use of the plant community model for predicting long-term impacts of herbicide applications on NTTP communities. The GUI offers two options to integrate herbicide impacts: (1) dose responses based on current standard experiments (acc. to testing guidelines) and (2) based on specific effect intensities. Both options represent suitable higher tier options for future risk assessments of NTTPs as well as for research on the ecological relevance of effects."
https://openalex.org/W3012415654,"Site-directed mutagenesis allows the generation of novel DNA sequences that can be used for a variety of important applications such as the functional analysis of genetic variants. To overcome the limitations of existing site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we explored in vivo DNA gap repair. We found that site-specific mutations in plasmid DNA can be generated in Escherichia coli using mutant single-stranded oligonucleotides to target PCR-derived linear double-stranded plasmid DNA. We called this method DeGeRing, and we characterized its advantages, including non-biased multiplex mutagenesis, over existing site-directed mutagenesis methods such as recombineering (recombination-mediated genetic engineering), single DNA break repair (SDBR, introduced by W. Mandecki), and QuikChange (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). We determined the efficiency of DeGeRing to induce site-directed mutations with and without a phenotype in three K-12 E coli strains using multiple single-stranded oligonucleotides containing homological and heterological parts of various sizes. Virtual lack of background made the isolation of mutants with frequencies up to 10-6 unnecessary. Our data show that endogenous DNA gap repair in E coli supports efficient multiplex site-directed mutagenesis. DeGeRing might facilitate the generation of mutant DNA sequences for protein engineering and the functional analysis of genetic variants in reverse genetics."
